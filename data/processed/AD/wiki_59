He is recognized as a saint in the Western and Eastern churches.\nHe was born around the beginning of the 3rd century in North Africa, perhaps at Carthage, where he received a classical education. Soon after converting to Christianity, he became a bishop in 249. A controversial figure during his lifetime, his strong pastoral skills, firm conduct during the Novatianist controversy and outbreak of the Plague of Cyprian (named for his description of it), and eventual martyrdom at Carthage established his reputation and proved his sanctity in the eyes of the Church.\nHis skilful Latin rhetoric led to his being considered the pre-eminent Latin writer of Western Christianity until Jerome and Augustine.\nEarly life.\nCyprian was born into a rich pagan Roman African Carthaginian family sometime during the early third century. His original name was Thascius; he took the additional name Caecilius in memory of the priest to whom he owed his conversion. Before his conversion, he was a leading member of a legal fraternity in Carthage, an orator, a \"pleader in the courts\", and a teacher of rhetoric. After a \"dissipated youth\", Cyprian was baptized when he was thirty-five years old, c.\u2009245 AD. After his baptism, he gave away a portion of his wealth to the poor of Carthage, as befitted a man of his status.\nIn the early days of his conversion, he wrote an \"Epistola ad Donatum de gratia Dei\" and the \"Testimoniorum Libri III\" that adhere closely to the models of Tertullian, who influenced his style and thinking. Cyprian described his own conversion and baptism in the following words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I was still lying in darkness and gloomy night, I used to regard it as extremely difficult and demanding to do what God's mercy was suggesting to me... I myself was held in bonds by the innumerable errors of my previous life, from which I did not believe I could possibly be delivered, so I was disposed to acquiesce in my clinging vices and to indulge my sins... But after that, with the help of the water of new birth, the stain of my former life was washed away, and a light from above, serene and pure, was infused into my reconciled heart... a second birth restored me to a new man. Then, in a wondrous manner, every doubt began to fade... I clearly understood that what had first lived within me, enslaved by the vices of the flesh, was earthly and that what, instead, the Holy Spirit had wrought within me was divine and heavenly.\nContested election as bishop of Carthage.\nNot long after his baptism, he was ordained a deacon and soon afterwards a priest. Sometime between July 248 and April 249, he was elected bishop of Carthage, a popular choice among the poor who remembered his patronage as demonstrating good equestrian style. However, his rapid rise did not meet with the approval of senior members of the clergy in Carthage, an opposition that did not disappear during his episcopate.\nNot long afterwards, the entire community was put to an unwanted test. Christians in North Africa had not suffered persecution for many years; the Church was assured and lax. In early 250, the Decian persecution began. Emperor Decius issued an edict, the text of which is lost, ordering sacrifices to the gods to be made throughout the Empire. Jews were specifically exempted from that requirement. Cyprian chose to go into hiding, rather than face potential execution. While some clergy saw that decision as a sign of cowardice, Cyprian defended himself by saying that he had fled in order not to leave the faithful without a shepherd during the persecution and that his decision to continue to lead them, although from a distance, was in accordance with divine will. Moreover, he pointed to the actions of the Apostles and Jesus himself: \"And therefore the Lord commanded us in the persecution to depart and to flee; and both taught that this should be done, and Himself did it. For as the crown is given by the condescension of God, and cannot be received unless the hour comes for accepting it, whoever abiding in Christ departs for a while does not deny his faith, but waits for the time...\"\nControversy over the lapsed.\nThe persecution was especially severe at Carthage, according to Church sources. Many Christians fell away and were thereafter referred to as \"Lapsi\" (\"fallen\"). The majority had obtained signed statements (\"libelli\") certifying that they had sacrificed to the Roman gods to avoid persecution or confiscation of property. In some cases, Christians had actually sacrificed, whether under torture or otherwise. Cyprian found those \"libellatici\" especially cowardly and demanded that they and the rest of the \"lapsi\" undergo public penance before being readmitted to the Church.\nHowever, in Cyprian's absence, some priests disregarded his wishes by readmitting the lapsed to communion with little or no public penance. Some of the \"lapsi\" presented a second \"libellus\" purported to bear the signature of some martyr or confessor who, it was held, had the spiritual prestige to reaffirm individual Christians. That system was not limited to Carthage, but on a wider front by its charismatic nature, it clearly constituted a challenge to institutional authority in the Church, in particular to that of the bishop. Hundreds or even thousands of \"lapsi\" were readmitted that way against the express wishes of Cyprian and the majority of the Carthaginian clergy, who insisted upon earnest repentance.\nA schism then broke out in Carthage, as the laxist party, led largely by the priests who had opposed Cyprian's election, attempted to block measures taken by him during his period of absence. After fourteen months, Cyprian returned to the diocese and in letters addressed to the other North African bishops defended having left his post. After issuing a tract, \"De lapsis\" (\"On the Fallen\"), he convoked a council of North African bishops at Carthage to consider the treatment of the lapsed and the apparent schism of Felicissimus (251). Cyprian took a middle course between the followers of Novatus of Carthage, who were in favour of welcoming back all with little or no penance, and Novatian of Rome, who would not allow any of those who had lapsed to be reconciled. The council in the main sided with Cyprian and condemned Felicissimus though no acts of that council survive.\nThe schism continued as the laxists elected a certain Fortunatus as bishop in opposition to Cyprian. At the same time, the rigorist party in Rome, who refused reconciliation to any of the lapsed, elected Novatian as bishop of Rome in opposition to Pope Cornelius. The Novatianists also secured the election of a certain Maximus as a rival bishop of their own at Carthage. Cyprian now found himself wedged between laxists and rigorists, but the polarisation highlighted the firm but moderate position adopted by Cyprian and strengthened his influence by wearing down the numbers of his opponents. Moreover, his dedication during the time of a great plague and famine gained him still further popular support.\nCyprian wrote \"De mortalitate\", and in \"De eleemosynis\" exhorted them to active charity towards the poor and set a personal example. He defended Christianity and the Christians in the \"apologia\" \"Ad Demetrianum\", directed against a certain Demetrius, and countered pagan claims that Christians were the cause of the public calamities.\nPersecution under Valerian.\nIn late 256, a new persecution of the Christians broke out under Emperor Valerian, and Pope Sixtus II was executed in Rome.\nIn Africa, Cyprian prepared his people for the expected edict of persecution by his \"De exhortatione martyrii\" and set an example when he was brought before the Roman proconsul Aspasius Paternus (30 August 257). He refused to sacrifice to the pagan deities and firmly professed Christ.\nThe proconsul banished him to Curubis, now Korba. In a vision, he believed he saw his approaching fate. When a year had passed, he was recalled and kept practically a prisoner in his own villa in expectation of severe measures after a new and more stringent imperial edict arrived, which Christian writers subsequently claimed demanded the execution of all Christian clerics.\nOn 13 September 258, Cyprian was imprisoned on the orders of the new proconsul, Galerius Maximus. The public examination of Cyprian by Galerius Maximus, on 14 September 258, has been preserved:\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Galerius Maximus\": \"Are you Thascius Cyprianus?\"\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Cyprian\": \"I am.\"\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Galerius\": \"The most sacred Emperors have commanded you to conform to the Roman rites.\" \n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Cyprian\": \"I refuse.\" \n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Galerius\": \"Take heed for yourself.\"\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Cyprian\": \"Do as you are bid; in so clear a case I may not take heed.\" \n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Galerius\", after briefly conferring with his judicial council, with much reluctance pronounced the following sentence: \"You have long lived an irreligious life, and have drawn together a number of men bound by an unlawful association, and professed yourself an open enemy to the gods and the religion of Rome; and the pious, most sacred and august Emperors\u00a0... have endeavoured in vain to bring you back to conformity with their religious observances; whereas therefore you have been apprehended as principal and ringleader in these infamous crimes, you shall be made an example to those whom you have wickedly associated with you; the authority of law shall be ratified in your blood.\" He then read the sentence of the court from a written tablet: \"It is the sentence of this court that Thascius Cyprianus be executed with the sword.\"\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Cyprian\": \"Thanks be to God.\"\nThe execution was carried out at once in an open place near the city. A vast multitude followed Cyprian on his last journey. He removed his garments without assistance, knelt down, and prayed. After he blindfolded himself, he was beheaded by the sword. The body was interred by Christians near the place of execution.\nCyprian's martyrdom was followed by the martyrdom of eight of his disciples in Carthage.\nWritings.\nCyprian's works were edited in volumes 3 and 4 of the \"Patrologia Latina.\" He was not a speculative theologian, his writings being always related to his pastoral ministry. The first major work was a monologue spoken to a friend called \"Ad Donatum,\" detailing his own conversion, the corruption of Roman government and the gladiatorial spectacles, and pointing to prayer as \"the only refuge of the Christian\". Another early written work was the \"Testimonia ad Quirinum\". During his exile from Carthage Cyprian wrote his most famous treatise, \"De Ecclesiae Catholicae Unitate\" (\"On the Unity of the Catholic Church\") and on returning to his see, he issued \"De Lapsis\" (\"On the Fallen\"). Another important work is his \"Treatise on the Lord's Prayer\". Doubtless only part of his written output has survived, and this must apply especially to his correspondence, of which some sixty letters are extant, in addition to some of the letters he received.\nCyprian of Carthage is often confused with Cyprian of Antioch, reputedly a magician before his conversion. A number of grimoires, such as \"Libellus Magicus\", are thus mistakenly attributed to Cyprian of Carthage.\nBiography.\nPontius the Deacon wrote a biography of Cyprian titled \"The Life and Passion of St. Cyprian\", which details the saint's early life, his conversion, notable acts, and martyrdom under Valerian.\nTheology.\nSacraments.\nCyprian believed in infant baptism and infant communion. Cyprian, however, spoke against the efficacy of baptism performed by heretics and insisted on their rebaptism, and he believed that the Eucharist cannot be properly consecrated outside the Church.\nCyprian was one of the earliest of the Church Fathers to enunciate clearly and unambiguously the doctrine of baptismal regeneration (\"the idea that salvation happens at and by water baptism duly administered\"): \"While he attributed all the saving energy to the grace of God, he considered the 'laver of saving water' the instrument of God that makes a person 'born again,' receiving a new life and putting off what he had previously been. The 'water of new birth' animated him to new life by the Spirit of holiness working through it.\"\nChurch.\nCyprian believed that the lapsed could be re-admitted to the Church after penance and he opposed the Novatians.\nCyprian believed the see of Peter (Rome) is the direct heir of Peter. While Cyprian believed that all the apostles were equal and that all the bishops followed the Apostles in succession, Cyprian emphasized the unity of the Church under a single \"cathedra\" (chair): \"he [Jesus Christ] assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [\"cathedra\"], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were that also which Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord.\"\nOther.\nCyprian was amillennial. Augustine argued that Cyprian taught the gift of perseverance. Cyprian argued that each day of the Genesis creation account consisted of 1,000 years.\nVeneration.\nChurches were erected over his tomb and over the place of his death. In later centuries, however, these churches were destroyed by the Vandals. The graves of such saints as Cyprian and Martin of Tours came to be regarded as \"contact points between Heaven and Earth\", and they became the centres of new, redefined, Christian urban communities. A surviving homily from Augustine on Cyprian's feast day indicates that his following was fairly widespread throughout Africa by the fourth century.\nCharlemagne is said to have had the bones transferred to France; and Lyon, Arles, Venice, Compi\u00e8gne, and Roenay in Flanders all have claimed to possess part of the martyr's relics.\nThe Catholic Church celebrates his feast day together with that of his good friend Pope Cornelius on 16 September, and in the Catholic Middle Ages the Sarum use observed it on the day of his death, 14 September. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him on 31 August. Lutherans now commemorate him on 16 September, while Anglicans celebrate his feast usually either on 13 September (e.g. the Anglican Church of Australia) or 15 September (the present-day Church of England Calendar of saints) remembers him with a Lesser Festival.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the type species of the genus \"Valeriana\".\nDescription.\nIt grows up to tall, rarely to . The stems are erect, usually unbranched, with pinnately divided leaves up to 20\u00a0cm long, the leaflets with irregularly toothed to toothless margins. The flowers are produced from June to August, and are 2.5\u20135\u00a0mm diameter with a five-lobed corolla, sweetly scented, pale pink, occasionally white, grouped in both compound and secondary clusters.\nSubspecies.\nThree subspecies are accepted by the Plants of the World Online (POWO) database:\nTwo other subspecies, not distinguished by POWO, are accepted by some other authors:\nDistribution and habitat.\nIt is native from Iceland south to Portugal, north to central Scandinavia, east to European Russia, and southeast to Iran. The plant is typically found in wet and dry meadows, wet woodlands, and marshes; plants adapted to drier chalk grassland soils are sometimes distinguished as \"V. o.\" subsp. \"collina\".\nEcology.\nThe flowers attract many fly species, especially hoverflies of the genus \"Eristalis\". The plant is consumed as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the grey pug.\nAs an invasive species.\nValerian is considered an invasive species in many locations outside its natural range, including the US state of Connecticut where it is officially banned, and in New Brunswick, Canada, where it is listed as a plant of concern.\nNames.\nThe name of the herb is derived from the personal name \"Valeria\" and the Latin verb (to be strong, healthy). Other names used for this plant include garden valerian (to distinguish it from other \"Valeriana\" species), garden heliotrope (although not related to \"Heliotropium\"), setwall (though this originally meant zedoary, from which it is etymologically derived) and all-heal (which is also used for plants in the genus \"Stachys\"). \"Valeriana phu\" is also known as garden valerian. \"Valeriana rubra\", red valerian, often grown in gardens, is also sometimes referred to as \"valerian\", but is a different species. Valerian is also called cat's love due to its catnip-like effects.\nUses.\nCrude extracts of valerian root may have sedative and anxiolytic effects; however, evidence for this is mixed and debated. It is commonly sold as a dietary supplement to promote sleep. A dry ethanol extract of valerian root has been recognised as a medicine for adults with mild symptoms by the European Medicines Agency. It produces a catnip-like response in cats.\nPhytochemicals.\nKnown compounds detected in valerian include:\nPreparation.\nThe chief constituent of valerian is a yellowish-green to brownish-yellow oil present in the dried root, varying in content from 0.5 to 2.0%. This variation in quantity may be determined by location; a dry, stony soil yields a root richer in oil than moist, fertile soil.\nTraditional medicine.\nValerian is a common traditional medicine used for treating insomnia. Some sources describe its effectiveness for this purpose as weak, ineffective, inconclusive, or low. Two meta-analyses concluded that valerian may improve sleep quality. A 2006 meta-analysis concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine valerian's effectiveness or safety for anxiety disorders. Another\u00a0meta-analysis found that valerian may be safe and effective for improving sleep and reducing anxiety and that inconsistent results in past research could possibly stem from variability in extract quality. \nIn contrast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the health claim that valerian can be used as a traditional herb to relieve mild nervous tension and to aid sleep; the EMA's Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products recognises valerian dry ethanol extract as a well-established herbal medicine for relieving mild nervous tension and improving sleep, based on multiple randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials, expert reports, sleep-EEG studies, and traditional use demonstrating gradual improvements in sleep and mild nervous tension symptoms.\nGermany's Commission E, the scientific advisory board responsible for evaluating the safety and efficacy of herbal substances, has approved valerian as an effective mild sedative.\nValerian has not been shown to be helpful in treating restless leg syndrome.\nOral forms.\nOral forms are available in both standard and nonstandard forms. Standardised products may be preferable considering the wide variation of the chemicals in the dried root, as noted above. When standardised, it is done so as a percentage of valerenic acid or valeric acid. For commonly used doses, valerian is generally recognised as safe in the U.S.\nAdverse effects.\nBecause the compounds in valerian produce central nervous system depression, they should not be used with other depressants, such as ethanol (drinking alcohol), benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, kava, or antihistamine drugs.\nAs an unregulated product, the concentration, contents, and potential contaminants in valerian preparations cannot be easily determined. Because of this uncertainty and the potential for toxicity in the fetus and hepatotoxicity in the mother, valerian use is discouraged during pregnancy. Headache and diarrhea have occurred among subjects using valerian in clinical studies.\nOther uses.\nThe young leaves can be cooked and the roots can be infused in hot beverages like hot chocolate.\nEffect on cats.\nValerian root is a cat attractant, containing attractant semiochemicals in a way similar to catnip, which can affect cat behaviour. Its roots and leaves are one of three alternatives for the one-third of domesticated or medium-sized cats who do not feel the effects of catnip. Valerian root has also been reported to be attractive to rats and used to attract members of the family Canidae to traps.\nIn culture.\nValerian has been used in traditional herbal medicine since at least the times of ancient Greece and Rome. Hippocrates described its properties, and Galen later prescribed it as a remedy for insomnia. In medieval Sweden, it was sometimes placed in the wedding clothes of a bridegroom to ward off the \"envy\" of the elves. In the 16th century, Pilgram Marpeck prescribed valerian tea for a sick woman.\nJohn Gerard's \"Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes\", first published in 1597, states that his contemporaries found valerian \"excellent for those burdened and for such as be troubled with croup and other like convulsions, and also for those that are bruised with falls\". He says that the dried root was valued as a medicine by the poor in the north of England and the south of Scotland, such that \"no brothes, pottages or phisicalle meates are woorth [worth] anything if Setwall [valerian] were not at one end\".\nThe 17th-century astrological botanist Nicholas Culpeper thought the plant was \"under the influence of Mercury, and therefore hath a warming faculty\". He recommended both herb and root, and said that \"the root boiled with liquorice, raisons and aniseed is good for those troubled with cough. Also, it is of special value against the plague, the decoction thereof being drunk and the root smelled. The green herb being bruised and applied to the head taketh away pain and pricking thereof.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "37902", "revid": "49129766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37902", "title": "La traviata", "text": "1853 opera by Giuseppe Verdi\nLa traviata (; \"The Fallen Woman\") is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi set to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. It is based on \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" (1852), a play by Alexandre Dumas \"fils\", which he adapted from his own 1848 novel. The opera was originally titled Violetta, after the main character. It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at La Fenice opera house in Venice.\nPiave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, \"c.\u00a01700\". It was not until the 1880s that the composer's and librettist's original wishes were carried out and \"realistic\" productions were staged. \"La traviata\" has become immensely popular and is among the most frequently performed of all operas.\nComposition history.\nFor Verdi, the years 1851 to 1853 were filled with operatic activity. First, he had agreed with the librettist Salvadore Cammarano on a subject for what would become \"Il trovatore\", but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing \"Rigoletto\", which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after \"Rigoletto\"'s success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice.\nVerdi sees \"The Lady of the Camellias\" play.\nVerdi and Giuseppina Strepponi visited Paris from late 1851 and into March 1852. In February the couple attended a performance of Alexander Dumas \"fils\"'s \"The Lady of the Camellias\". As a result of this, Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz reports, the composer immediately began to compose music for what would later become \"La traviata\". However, Julian Budden notes that Verdi had probably read the Dumas novel some time before, and, after seeing the play and returning to Italy, \"he was already setting up an ideal operatic cast for it in his mind\", shown by his dealings with La Fenice.\nComposing for Venice.\nFrancesco Maria Piave was engaged to write the new libretto and the two men tried to come up with a suitable subject, but the composer complained that his librettist \"had not yet offered him an 'original' or 'provocative' idea\". Writing to Piave, he added that \"I don't want any of those everyday subjects that one can find by the hundreds.\" But at the same time, the composer expressed concern about censorship in Venice, something with which he was very familiar after his dealings with the censors concerning \"Rigoletto\". As the months dragged on into October, it was agreed that Piave would come to Sant'Agata (Verdi's home near Busseto) and work with the composer. One subject was chosen, Piave set to work, and then Verdi threw in another idea, which may have been \"La traviata\". Within a short time, a synopsis was dispatched to Venice under the title of \"Amore e morte\" (\"Love and Death\"). However, Verdi wrote to his friend De Sanctis telling him that \"for Venice I'm doing \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" which will probably be called \"La traviata\". A subject for our own age.\" Although still bogged down at Sant'Agata, Piave was sanguine: \"Everything will turn out fine, and we'll have a new masterpiece from this true wizard of modern harmonies\".\nWhen back at Sant'Agata in late January 1853 Verdi was reminded that his contract called for him to be in Venice within a week or two and for the premiere to be held on the \"first Saturday in March 1853\". However, it soon became clear that a modern-dress staging of the new opera was impossible\u2014the requirement was that it should be set in the 17th century \"in the era of Richelieu\"\u2014and reports from the opening of the season confirmed the limitations of the chosen soprano, the 38-year-old Fanny Salvini-Donatelli for taking the role of Violetta. Verdi was distraught, for he held on to the notion that the opera could be staged in modern dress\u2014as \"Stiffelio\" had been done\u2014Piave was sent back to Sant'Agata to no avail: he could not persuade the composer to back down on his insistence that another soprano be secured, yet the 15 January deadline for securing one had come and gone. Verdi was filled with premonitions of disaster upon his arrival in Venice on 21 February for rehearsals and he made his unhappiness clear to the singers.\nPerformance history.\nThe audience jeered at times during the premiere, directing some of their scorn at the casting of soprano Fanny Salvini-Donatelli in the lead role of Violetta. Though she was an acclaimed singer, they considered her to be too old (at 38) and overweight to credibly play a young woman dying of consumption. (Verdi had previously attempted to persuade the manager of La Fenice to re-cast the role with a younger woman, but with no success.) Nevertheless, the first act was met with applause and cheering at the end; but in the second act, the audience began to turn against the performance, especially after the singing of the baritone Felice Varesi and the tenor Lodovico Graziani. The next day, Verdi wrote to his friend Emanuele Muzio in what has now become perhaps his most famous letter: \"\"La traviata\" last night a failure. Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell.\"\nCoincidentally, as Philips-Matz points out, an Italian translation of the play \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" was being presented just a short distance from La Fenice.\nWhile there were demands for productions from impresarios in various Italian cities, Verdi was loath to allow them unless he could be sure of the strength of the singers, and in spite of their pleas, the composer refused. As Budden notes, it came to be Venice \"that made an honest woman of Violetta\" when Verdi allowed a performance at the Teatro San Benedetto. Some revisions took place between 1853 and May 1854, mostly affecting acts 2 and 3, but the opera was performed again on 6 May 1854 and was a great success, largely due to Maria Spezia-Aldighieri's portrayal of Violetta. \"Then [referring to the La Fenice performances] it was a fiasco; now it has created a furore. Draw your own conclusions!\" reported Piave (who had overseen the production in Verdi's absence).\nThe opera (in the revised version) was first performed in Madrid on 1 February 1855 with Spezia-Aldighieri at Teatro Real, in Vienna on 4 May 1855 in Italian and in Barcelona on 25 October at Gran Teatre del Liceu. It was first performed in England on 24 May 1856 in Italian at His Majesty's Theatre in London, where it was considered morally questionable, and \"the heads of the Church did their best to put an injunction upon performance; the Queen refrained from visiting the theatre during the performances, though the music, words and all, were not unheard at the palace\". It was first performed in the United States by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company on 3 December 1856 in Italian at the Academy of Music in New York. George Templeton Strong noted in his diary: \"People say the plot's immoral, but I don't see that it's so much worse than many others, not to speak of \"Don Giovanni\", which as put on the stage is little but rampant lechery\", while the \"Evening Post\" critic wrote: \"Those who have quietly sat through the glaring improprieties of \"Don Giovanni\" will hardly blush or frown at anything in \"La traviata\".\"\nThe opera was first performed in France on 6 December 1856 in Italian by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour in Paris, and on 27 October 1864 in French as \"Violetta\" (an adaptation by \u00c9douard Duprez, older brother of the tenor Gilbert Duprez) at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique on the Place du Ch\u00e2telet with Christina Nilsson in the title role. The French adaptation of the libretto was published in 1865.\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"La traviata\" became one of the most frequently performed operas during Verdi's lifetime. It is often ranked highly on annual lists of most performed operas.\nPlace: Paris and its vicinity\nTime: Beginning of the 19th century\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"The salon in Violetta's house\"\nVioletta Val\u00e9ry, a famed courtesan, throws a lavish party at her Paris salon to celebrate her recovery from an illness. Gastone, a viscount, has brought with him a friend, Alfredo Germont, a young bourgeois from a provincial family who has long adored Violetta from afar. While walking to the salon, Gastone tells Violetta that Alfredo loves her, and that while she was ill, he came to her house every day. Alfredo joins them, admitting the truth of Gastone's remarks.\nBaron Douphol, Violetta's current lover, waits nearby to escort her to the salon. Once there, the Baron is asked to give a toast, but refuses, and the crowd turns to Alfredo, who agrees to sing a brindisi \u2013 a drinking song (Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: \u2013 \"Let's drink from the joyful cups\").\nFrom the next room, the sound of the orchestra is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: \u2013 \"One day, happy and ethereal\"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.\nAfter the guests leave, Violetta wonders if Alfredo could actually be the one in her life (Violetta: \u2013 \"Ah, perhaps he is the one\"). But she concludes that she needs freedom to live her life (Violetta, Alfredo: \u2013 \"Always free\"). From off stage, Alfredo's voice is heard singing about love as he walks down the street.\nAct 2.\n\"Scene 1: Violetta's country house outside Paris\"\nThree months later, Alfredo and Violetta are living together in a peaceful country house outside Paris. Violetta has fallen in love with Alfredo and she has completely abandoned her former life. Alfredo sings of their happy life together (Alfredo: \u2013 \"The youthful ardor of my ebullient spirits\"). Annina, the maid, arrives from Paris, and, when questioned by Alfredo, tells him that she went there to sell the horses, carriages and everything owned by Violetta to support their country lifestyle.\nAlfredo is shocked to learn this and leaves for Paris immediately to settle matters himself. Violetta returns home and receives an invitation from her friend, Flora, to a party in Paris that evening. Alfredo's father, Giorgio Germont, is announced and demands that she break off her relationship with his son for the sake of his family, since he reveals that Violetta's relationship with Alfredo has threatened his daughter's engagement (Giorgio: \u2013 \"Pure as an angel, God gave me a daughter\") because of Violetta's reputation. Meanwhile, he reluctantly becomes impressed by Violetta's nobility, something which he did not expect from a courtesan. She responds that she cannot end the relationship because she loves Alfredo so much, but Giorgio pleads with her for the sake of his family. With growing remorse, she finally agrees (Violetta, Giorgio: \u2013 \"Tell the young girl, so beautiful and pure,\") and says goodbye to Giorgio. In a gesture of gratitude for her kindness and sacrifice, Giorgio kisses her forehead before leaving her weeping alone.\nVioletta gives a note to Annina to send to Flora accepting the party invitation and, as she is writing a farewell letter to Alfredo, he enters. She can barely control her sadness and tears; she tells him repeatedly of her unconditional love (Violetta: \u2013 \"Love me, Alfredo, love me as I love you\"). Before rushing out and setting off for Paris, she hands the farewell letter to her servant to give to Alfredo.\nSoon, the servant brings the letter to Alfredo and, as soon as he has read it, Giorgio returns and attempts to comfort his son, reminding him of his family in Provence (Giorgio: \u2013 \"Who erased the sea, the land of Provence from your heart?\"). Alfredo suspects that the Baron is behind his separation from Violetta, and the party invitation, which he finds on the desk, strengthens his suspicions. He decides to confront Violetta at the party. Giorgio tries to stop Alfredo, but he rushes out.\n\"Scene 2: Party at Flora's house\"\nAt the party, the Marquis tells Flora that Violetta and Alfredo have separated, much to the amazement of everyone who had previously seen the happy couple. She calls for the entertainers to perform for the guests (Chorus: \u2013 \"We are gypsy girls who have come from afar\"; \u2013 \"We are matadors from Madrid\"). Gastone and his friends join the matadors and sing (Gastone, chorus, dancers: \u2013 \"Piquillo is a bold and handsome matador from Biscay\").\nVioletta arrives with Baron Douphol. They see Alfredo at the gambling table. When he sees them, Alfredo loudly proclaims that he will take Violetta home with him. Feeling annoyed, the Baron goes to the gambling table and joins him in a game. As they bet, Alfredo wins some large sums until Flora announces that supper is ready. Alfredo leaves with handfuls of money.\nAs everyone is leaving the room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron's anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness what he has to say ( \u2013 \"You know this woman?\"). He humiliates and denounces Violetta in front of the guests and then throws his winnings at her feet in payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo ( - \"Ignoble insulter of women, go away from here, you fill us with horror!\").\nIn search of his son, Giorgio enters the hall and, knowing the real significance of the scene, denounces his son's behavior (Giorgio, Alfredo, Violetta, chorus: \u2013 \"A man, who even in anger, offends a woman renders himself deserving of contempt.\").\nFlora and the ladies attempt to persuade Violetta to leave the dining room, but Violetta turns to Alfredo (Violetta: \u2013 \"Alfredo, Alfredo, you can't understand all the love in this heart...\").\nAct 3.\n\"Violetta's bedroom\"\nDr. Grenvil tells Annina that Violetta will not live long since her tuberculosis has worsened. Alone in her room, Violetta reads a letter from Alfredo's father telling her that the Baron was only wounded in his duel with Alfredo. He has informed Alfredo of the sacrifice she has made for him and his sister; and he is sending his son to see her as quickly as possible to ask for her forgiveness. But Violetta senses it is too late (Violetta: \u2013 \"Farewell, lovely, happy dreams of the past\").\nAnnina rushes into the room to tell Violetta of Alfredo's arrival. The lovers are reunited and Alfredo suggests that they leave Paris (Alfredo, Violetta: \u2013 \"We will leave Paris, O beloved\").\nBut it is too late: she knows her death approaches (Alfredo, Violetta: \u2013 \"Great God!...to die so young\"). Alfredo's father enters with the doctor, regretting what he has done. After singing a duet with Alfredo, Violetta suddenly revives, exclaiming that the pain and discomfort have left her. A moment later, she dies in Alfredo's arms.\nInstrumentation.\nThe opera uses an orchestra with the following instrumentation: 2 flutes (fl. 2 doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, harp, cimbasso, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, triangle, strings.\nBanda: Verdi did not fully orchestrate the parts of the on-stage band, but rather composed it in the style of a piano reduction, leaving the actual realization to the person in charge of the band. Over the years many versions were created, varying from theater to theater depending on the instruments available, but none of them is authoritative. A widespread version is: 1 piccolo, 4 clarinets, 2 horns, flugelhorn, 3 trumpets, at least 2 trombones, low brasses (number unspecified), bass drum.\nMusic.\nThe prelude to the opera begins with very soft, very high strings depicting the frail heroine, followed by the main love theme of the opera, which is then played on lower strings while the higher instruments decorate the melody.\nThis delicate atmosphere is altered on curtain rise by lively dance tunes in the orchestra. After the famous \"Brindisi\", an offstage band plays a series of waltzes (waltz rhythms pervade the first act of the opera, creating a Parisian atmosphere). The concluding part of Violetta's solo scene that ends the first act is full of vocal decoration and feverish ornamentation as she swears to stay free (\"Sempre libera\"). These coloratura effects are not required for the character after the first act.\nThe lengthy and crucial duet between the elder Germont and Violetta in act 2 is multi-sectioned with the music following the changing dramatic situation.\n\"La traviata\" is the only one of Verdi's many operas to be set entirely indoors. Unlike \"Il trovatore\", which was composed simultaneously, \"La traviata\" is an intimate piece, full of tender lyricism. The character of Violetta dominates the work and her music changes as she develops through the drama, from the hectic, almost hysterical coloratura of the first act, to the more dramatic passages of the second, and the spiritual quality of her music as she dies in act 3.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37903", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37903", "title": "Il trovatore", "text": "1853 opera by Giuseppe Verdi\nIl trovatore ('The Troubadour') is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto largely written by Salvadore Cammarano, based on the Spanish play \"El trovador\" (1836) by Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez. It was Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez's most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as \"a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.\"\nThe premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853, where it \"began a victorious march throughout the operatic world\", a success due to Verdi's work over the previous three years. It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of \"Il trovatore\". There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora.\nFor Verdi, the three years were filled with musical activity; work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered \"Rigoletto\" in Venice in March 1851. His personal affairs also limited his professional work. In May 1851, an additional commission was offered by the Venice company after \"Rigoletto\"'s success there. Another commission came from Paris while he was visiting that city from late 1851 to March 1852. Before the libretto for \"Il trovatore\" was completed, before it was scored, and before it premiered, Verdi had four operatic projects in various stages of development.\nToday, \"Il trovatore\" is performed frequently and is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire.\nComposition history.\nHow and when Verdi acquired a copy of the Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez play is uncertain, but Budden notes that it appears that Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom Verdi had been living in Busseto since September 1849, had translated the play, as evidenced in a letter from her two weeks before the premiere urging him to \"hurry up and give OUR \"Trovatore\"\".\nWhen considering setting Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez's play, Verdi turned to work with Cammarano, \"the born operatic poet\" (according to Budden). Their correspondence began as early as January 1850, well before Verdi had done anything to develop a libretto with Piave for what later became \"Rigoletto\" in Venice. At this time, it was also the first since \"Oberto\" that the composer was beginning to prepare an opera with a librettist but without a commission of any kind from an opera house. In his first letter to Cammarano, Verdi proposed \"El Trovador\" as the subject with \"two feminine roles. The first, the gypsy, a woman of unusual character after whom I want to name the opera.\"\nWith regard to the chosen librettist's strength as a poet in preparing verse for opera, Budden also comments that his approach was very traditional, something which began to become clear during the preparation of the libretto and which appears in the correspondence between the two men.\nRelationship with Cammarano.\nVerdi's time and energy were spent mostly on finishing \"Rigoletto,\" which premiered at La Fenice in Venice in March 1851. Within a matter of weeks, Verdi was expressing his frustration to a mutual friend, Cesare De Sanctis, at having no communication from Cammarano. His letter emphasized that \"the bolder he is, the happier it will make me,\" although it appears that Cammarano's reply contained several objections, which Verdi answered on 4 April and, in his response, he emphasized certain aspects of the plot which were important to him. These included Leonora taking the veil and also the importance of the Azucena/Manrico relationship. He continued by asking whether the librettist liked the drama and emphasized that \"the more unusual and bizarre the better\".\nVerdi also writes that if there were no standard forms \u2013 \"cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. [...] and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus...\" he would be quite happy. Correspondence continued between the two men for the following two months or so, including another letter from the composer of 9 April which included three pages of suggestions. But he also made concessions and expresses his happiness in what he is receiving in the way of verse.\nDuring the period to follow, in spite of his preoccupations but especially after he had begun to overcome them, Verdi had kept in touch with the librettist. In a letter around the time of his intended departure for France, he wrote encouragingly to Cammarano: \"I beg you with all my soul to finish this \"Trovatore\" as quickly as you possibly can.\"\nPreoccupations and delays in 1851\u20131852.\nThere then arose the question of where the opera would eventually be presented. Verdi had turned down an offer from Naples, but became concerned about the availability of his preferred Azucena, Rita Gabussi-De Bassini. She turned out not to be on the Naples roster, but expressed an interest in the possibility of Rome.\nThings were put on hold for several months as Verdi became preoccupied with family matters, which included the illnesses of both his mother (who died in July) and father, the estrangement from his parents with communications conducted only between lawyers, and the administration of his newly acquired property at Sant'Agata (now the Villa Verdi near his hometown of Busseto), where he had established his parents. But his relationship with his parents, albeit legally severed, as well as Strepponi's situation living with the composer in an unmarried state, continued to preoccupy him, as did the deterioration of his relationship with his father-in-law, Antonio Barezzi. Finally, in April 1851, agreement was reached with the elder Verdis on the payment of debts mutually owed and the couple were given time to resettle, leaving Sant'Agata for Verdi and Strepponi to occupy for the next fifty years.\nMay 1851 brought an offer for a new opera from the Venice authorities, and it was followed by an agreement with the Rome Opera company to present \"Trovatore\" during the 1852/1853 Carnival season, specifically in January 1853.\nBy November Verdi and Strepponi left Italy to spend the winter of 1851/52 in Paris, where he concluded an agreement with the Paris Op\u00e9ra to write what became \"Les v\u00eapres siciliennes\", his first grand opera, although he had adapted his earlier \"I Lombardi\" into \"J\u00e9rusalem\" for the stage. Including work on \"Trovatore\", other projects consumed him, but a significant event occurred in February, when the couple attended a performance of \"The Lady of the Camellias\" by Alexandre Dumas \"fils\". What followed is reported by Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz who states that the composer revealed that, after seeing the play, he immediately began to compose music for what would later become \"La traviata\".\nThe couple returned to Sant'Agata by mid-March 1852 and Verdi immediately began work on \"Trovatore\" after a year's delay.\nDeath of Cammarano and work with Bardare.\nThen, in July 1852, by way of an announcement in a theatrical journal, Verdi received news of Cammarano's death earlier that month. This was both a professional and a personal blow. The composer learned that Cammarano had completed Manrico's third-act aria, \"Di quella pira\" just eight days before his death, but now he turned to De Sanctis to find him another librettist. Leone Emanuele Bardare was a young poet from Naples who was beginning his career; eventually he wrote more than 15 librettos before 1880. Composer and librettist met in Rome around 20 December 1852 and Verdi began work on both \"Trovatore\" and \"La traviata\".\nHis main aim, having changed his mind about the distribution of characters in the opera, was to enhance the role of Leonora, thus making it \"a two-women opera\" and he communicated many of these ideas ahead of time via letters to De Sanctis over several months. Leonora now was to have a cantabile for the Miserere as well as retaining \"Tacea la Notte\" in act 1 with its cabaletta. Changes were also made to Azucena's \"Stride la vampa\" and to the Count's lines. Taking into account the last-minute requirements of the censor and the consequent changes, overall, the revisions and changes enhanced the opera, and the result was that it was a critical and a popular success.\nPerformance history.\nIn Italian as \"Il trovatore\" \nThe opera's immense popularity \u2013 albeit a popular success rather than a critical one \u2013 came from some 229 productions worldwide in the three years following its premiere on 19 January 1853, and is illustrated by the fact that \"in Naples, for example, where the opera in its first three years had eleven stagings in six theaters, the performances totalled 190\".\nFirst given in Paris in Italian on 23 December 1854 by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour, the cast included Lodovico Graziani as Manrico and Adelaide Borghi-Mamo as Azucena.\nA few days after the Paris premiere, on 4 January 1855, \"Il Trovatore\" was first performed in Buenos Aires at the Teatro Argentino by the Pestalardo opera company. The cast included Ida Edelvira as Leonora, Luigi Guglielmini as Manrico, Matilde Eboli as Azucena, and Juan Carlos Casanova as the Count di Luna. \n\"Il trovatore\" was first performed in the US by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company on 2 May 1855 at the then-recently opened Academy of Music in New York. The cast included Balbina Steffenone as Leonora, Pasquale Brignoli as Manrico, Felicita Vestvali as Azucena, and Alessandro Amodio as the Count di Luna. The work's UK premiere took place on 10 May 1855 at Covent Garden in London, with Jenny B\u00fcrde-Ney as Leonora, Enrico Tamberlik as Manrico, Pauline Viardot as Azucena and Francesco Graziani as the Conte di Luna.\nAs the 19th century proceeded there was a decline in interest, but \"Il trovatore\" saw a revival of interest after Toscanini's 1902 revivals. From its performance at the Met on 26 October 1883 the opera has been a staple of its repertoire.\nToday, almost all performances use the Italian version and it is one of the world's most frequently performed operas.\nIn French as \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" \nAfter the successful presentation of the opera in Italian in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Crosnier, director of l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris, proposed that Verdi revise his opera for the Paris audience as a grand opera, which would include a ballet, to be presented on the stage of the major Paris house. While Verdi was in Paris with Giuseppina Strepponi from late July 1855, working on the completion of \"Aroldo\" and beginning to prepare a libretto with Piave for what would become \"Simon Boccanegra\", he encountered some legal difficulties in dealing with Toribio Calzado, the impresario of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Italiens, and, with his contacts with the Op\u0117ra, agreed to prepare a French version of \"Trovatore\" on 22 September 1855.\nA translation of Cammarano's libretto was made by librettist \u00c9milien Pacini under the title of \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" and it was first performed at La Monnaie in Brussels on 20 May 1856. There followed the production at the Paris Opera's Salle Le Peletier on 12 January 1857 after which Verdi returned to Italy. Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eug\u00e9nie attended the latter performance.\nFor the French premiere, Verdi made some changes to the score of \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" including the addition of music for the ballet in act 3 which followed the soldiers' chorus, where gypsies danced to entertain them. The quality of Verdi's ballet music has been noted by scholar Charles Osborne: \"He could have been the Tchaikovsky of Italian ballet\" he states, continuing to praise it as \"perfect ballet music\". In addition, he describes the unusual practice of Verdi having woven in themes from the gypsy chorus of act 2, ballet music for opera rarely connecting with the themes of the work. Several other revisions focused on Azucena's music, including an extended version of the finale of act 4, to accommodate the role's singer Adelaide Borghi-Mamo. Some of these changes have even been used in modern performances in Italian.\nIn 1990 Tulsa Opera presented the first staging of \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" in the United States using a new critical edition by musicologist, conductor, and Verdi scholar David Lawton. Recorded live for broadcast on NPR, Lawton conducted the premiere with Margaret Jane Wray as Leonore, Craig Sirianni as Manrique, Greer Grimsley as Le Comte de Luna, Barbara Conrad as Azucena, and the Tulsa Philharmonic. This version was published by Ricordi and the University of Chicago Press in 2001. An updated version of this critical edition by Lawton was published by Ricordi in 2018, and given its premiere at the Festival Verdi in Parma that same year.\nRarely given in French, it was presented as part of the 1998 Festival della Valle d'Itria and in 2002 \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" appeared as part of the Sarasota Opera's \"Verdi Cycle\" of all the composer's work.\n\"Place: Biscay and Aragon (Spain)\"\n\"Time: Fifteenth century.\"\nSynopsis.\nAct 1: The Duel.\n\"Scene 1: The guard room in the castle of Luna (The Palace of Aljafer\u00eda, Zaragoza, Spain)\"\nFerrando, the captain of the guards, orders his men to keep watch while the Count di Luna wanders restlessly beneath the windows of Leonora, lady-in-waiting to the Princess. Di Luna loves Leonora and is jealous of his successful rival, a troubadour whose identity he does not know. In order to keep the guards awake, Ferrando narrates the history of the count (Racconto: / \"The good Count di Luna lived happily, the father of two sons\"): many years ago, a gypsy woman was wrongfully accused of having bewitched the youngest of the di Luna children; the child had fallen sick, and for this the gypsy had been burnt alive as a witch, her protests of innocence ignored. Dying, she had commanded her daughter Azucena to avenge her, which she did by abducting the baby. Although the burnt bones of a child were found in the ashes of the pyre, the father refused to believe his son's death. Dying, the father commanded his firstborn, the new Count di Luna, to seek Azucena.\n\"Scene 2: Garden in the palace of the princess\"\nLeonora confesses her love for the Troubadour to her confidante, Ines (Cavatina (\"Tacea la notte placida\" / \"The peaceful night lay silent\"... \"Di tale amor\" / \"A love that words can scarcely describe\"), in which she tells how she fell in love with a mystery knight, victor at a tournament; lost track of him when a civil war broke out; then encountered him again, in disguise as a wandering troubadour who sang beneath her window. When they have gone, the Count di Luna enters, intending to pay court to Leonora himself, but hears the voice of his rival in the distance: (\"Deserto sulla terra\" / \"Alone upon this earth\"). Leonora in the darkness briefly mistakes the count for her lover, until the Troubadour himself enters the garden, and she rushes to his arms. The Count challenges his rival to reveal his true identity, which he does: Manrico, a knight now outlawed and under death sentence for his allegiance to a rival prince. Manrico in turn challenges him to call the guards, but the Count regards this encounter as a personal rather than political matter, and challenges Manrico instead to a duel over their common love. Leonora tries to intervene, but cannot stop them from fighting (Trio: \"Di geloso amor sprezzato\" / \"The fire of jealous love\" ).\nAct 2: The Gypsy Woman.\n\"Scene 1: The gypsies' camp\"\nThe gypsies sing the \"Anvil Chorus\": \"Vedi le fosche notturne\" / \"See! The endless sky casts off her sombre nightly garb...\". Azucena, the daughter of the Gypsy woman burnt by the count, is still haunted by her duty to avenge her mother (Canzone: \"Stride la vampa\" / \"The flames are roaring!\"). The Gypsies break camp while Azucena confesses to Manrico that after stealing the di Luna baby she had intended to burn the count's little son along with her mother, but overwhelmed by the screams and the gruesome scene of her mother's execution, she became confused and threw her own child into the flames instead (Racconto: \"Condotta ell'era in ceppi\" / \"They dragged her in bonds\").\nManrico realises that he is not the son of Azucena, but loves her as if she were indeed his mother, as she has always been faithful and loving to him \u2013 and, indeed, saved his life only recently, discovering him left for dead on a battlefield after being caught in ambush. Manrico tells Azucena that he defeated di Luna in their earlier duel, but was held back from killing him by a mysterious power (Duet: \"Mal reggendo\" / \"He was helpless under my savage attack\"): and Azucena reproaches him for having stayed his hand then, especially since it was the Count's forces that defeated him in the subsequent battle of Pelilla. A messenger arrives and reports that Manrico's allies have taken Castle Castellor, which Manrico is ordered to hold in the name of his prince: and also that Leonora, who believes Manrico dead, is about to enter a convent and take the veil that night. Although Azucena tries to prevent him from leaving in his weak state (\"Ferma! Son io che parlo a te!\" / \"I must talk to you\"), Manrico rushes away to prevent her from carrying out this intent.\n\"Scene 2: In front of the convent\"\nDi Luna and his attendants intend to abduct Leonora and the Count sings of his love for her (Aria: \"Il balen del suo sorriso\" / \"The light of her smile\" ... \"Per me ora fatale\" / \"Fatal hour of my life\"). Leonora and the nuns appear in procession, but Manrico prevents di Luna from carrying out his plans and takes Leonora away with him, although once again leaving the Count behind unharmed, as the soldiers on both sides back down from bloodshed, the Count being held back by his own men.\nAct 3: The Son of the Gypsy Woman.\n\"Scene 1: Di Luna's camp\"\nDi Luna and his army are attacking the fortress Castellor where Manrico has taken refuge with Leonora (Chorus: \"Or co' dadi ma fra poco\" / \"Now we play at dice\"). Ferrando drags in Azucena, who has been captured wandering near the camp. When she hears di Luna's name, Azucena's reactions arouse suspicion and Ferrando recognizes her as the supposed murderer of the count's brother. Azucena cries out to her son Manrico to rescue her and the count realizes that he has the means to flush his enemy out of the fortress. He orders his men to build a pyre and burn Azucena before the walls.\n\"Scene 2: A chamber in the castle\"\nInside the castle, Manrico and Leonora are preparing to be married. She is frightened; the battle with di Luna is imminent and Manrico's forces are outnumbered. He assures her of his love (Aria: \"Ah s\u00ec, ben mio, coll'essere\" / \"Ah, yes, my love, in being yours\"), even in the face of death. When news of Azucena's capture reaches him, he summons his men and desperately prepares to attack (Cabaletta: \"Di quella pira l'orrendo foco\" / \"The horrid flames of that pyre\"). Leonora faints.\nAct 4: The Punishment.\n\"Scene 1: Before the dungeon keep\"\nManrico has failed to free Azucena and has been imprisoned himself. Leonora attempts to free him (Aria: \"D'amor sull'ali rosee\" / \"On the rosy wings of love\"; Chorus &amp; Duet: \"Miserere\" / \"Lord, thy mercy on this soul\") by begging di Luna for mercy and offers herself in place of her lover. She promises to give herself to the Count, but secretly swallows poison from her ring in order to die before di Luna can possess her (Duet: \"Mira, d'acerbe lagrime\" / \"See the bitter tears I shed\").\n\"Scene 2: In the dungeon\"\nManrico and Azucena are awaiting their execution. Manrico attempts to soothe Azucena, whose mind wanders to happier days in the mountains (Duet: \"Ai nostri monti ritorneremo\" / \"Again to our mountains we shall return\"). At last the gypsy slumbers. Leonora comes to Manrico and tells him that he is saved, begging him to escape. When he discovers she cannot accompany him, he refuses to leave his prison. He believes Leonora has betrayed him until he realizes that she has taken poison to remain true to him. As she dies in agony in Manrico's arms, she confesses that she prefers to die with him than to marry another (Trio: \"Prima che d'altri vivere\" / \"Rather than live as another's\"). The Count hears Leonora's last words and orders Manrico's execution. Azucena awakens and tries to stop di Luna. Once she finds out Manrico is dead, she cries: \"Egli era tuo fratello! Sei vendicata, o madre.\" / \"He was your brother ... You are avenged, oh mother!\"\nMusic.\nToday, most opera scholars recognize the expressive musical qualities of Verdi's writing. However, musicologist Roger Parker notes that \"the extreme formalism of the musical language has been seen as serving to concentrate and define the various stages of the drama, above all channeling them into those key confrontations that mark its inexorable progress\".\nHere he, like many other writers, notes the elements of musical form (then often described as \"closed forms\") which characterize the opera and make it appear to be something of a return to the language of earlier times, \"the veritable apotheosis of \"bel canto\" with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range,\" notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: \"the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do,\" he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on \"'Il trovatore\" is that \"it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a step backward after \"Rigoletto\"\".\nBudden describes one of the musical qualities as the relationship between the \"consistent dramatic impetus\" of the action being caused by the \"propulsive quality\" of the music which produces a \"sense of continuous forward motion\". Parker describes it as \"sheer musical energy apparent in all the numbers\". And Budden gives many examples which show Verdi as \"the equal of Bellini\" as a melodist.\nVerdi also clearly recognizes the importance of the role of Azucena. Remembering that the composer's initial suggestion to Cammarano was that he wanted to name the opera after her, Budden notes that this character \"is the first of a glorious line\" and he names Ulrica (from \"Ballo\"), Eboli (from \"Don Carlos\"), and Amneris (from \"Aida\") as followers in the same vocal range and with the same expressive and distinct qualities which separate them from the other female role in the opera in which they feature. He quotes from a letter which Verdi wrote to Marianna Barbieri-Nini, the soprano who was due to sing the Leonora in Venice after the premiere, and who expressed reservations about her music. Here, Verdi emphasizes the importance of the role of Azucena:\n..it's a principal, \"the\" principal role; finer and more dramatic and more original than the other. If I were a prima donna (a fine thing that would be!), I would always rather sing the part of the Gypsy in \"Il trovatore\".\nFrom this position, Budden comments on the distinct differences in an era where vocal registers were less defined and which extend into Leonora's and Azucena's music \"where greater verbal projection of the lower voice [can be] turned to advantage\" and where \"the polarity between the two female roles [extends] into every field of comparison.\" He then sums up the musical relationship which exists between the two female characters, the men having simply been defined as being representative of their own voice types, something evident and very striking in Verdi's significant use of voice types in \"Ernani\" of 1844. Regarding Leonora, Budden describes her music as \"mov[ing] in long phrases most characterized by a soaring 'aspiring' quality\" whereas \"Azucena's melodies evolve in short, often commonplace phrases based on the repetition of short rhythmic patterns\".\nCultural references.\nEnrico Caruso once said that all it takes for a successful performance of \"Il trovatore\" is the four greatest singers in the world. On many occasions, this opera and its music have been featured in various forms of popular culture and entertainment. Scenes of comic chaos play out over a performance of \"Il trovatore\" in the Marx Brothers film \"A Night at the Opera\" (including a quotation, in the middle of the act 1 overture, of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"). Luchino Visconti used a performance of \"Il trovatore\" at La Fenice opera house for the opening sequence of his 1954 film \"Senso\". As Manrico sings his battle cry in \"Di quella pira\", the performance is interrupted by the answering cries of Italian nationalists on the upper balcony who shower the stalls area below with patriotic leaflets. In \"Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism\", Millicent Marcus proposes that Visconti used this operatic paradigm throughout \"Senso\", with parallels between the opera's protagonists, Manrico and Leonora, and the film's protagonists, Ussoni and Livia. A staging of act 1, scene 2, of \"Il trovatore\" is featured in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1979 film \"La Luna\". Music from the opera was featured on Kijiji in Canada for commercials.\nHistorical references.\nWhile the story and most of the characters are fictitious, it is set towards the end of a real civil war in Aragon. Following the death of King Martin of Aragon in 1410, no fewer than six candidates staked a claim for the throne. A political meeting, the Compromise of Caspe, found in favour of Martin's sororal nephew Ferdinand. Count James II of Urgell, King Martin's brother-in-law and the closest relative through purely patrilineal line of descent, refused to accept the decision of the Compromise, believing (with some justification) that Martin had intended to adopt him as the heir by appointing him Governor-General after the death of his own son Martin the Younger, and rebelled. A third candidate was Frederic, Count of Luna, bastard son of Martin the Younger, whose legitimization had been sought from the Pope unsuccessfully. As part of the compromise for withdrawing his own claim in favour of Ferdinand, Frederic was granted the County of Luna, one of the lesser titles that his father had held.\nWhile neither of the two princes who actually took part in the war appears in the opera\u00a0\u2013 neither is even referred to by name, and only Urgell is referred to by his title\u00a0\u2013 the fortunes of their followers mirror those of their princes. Thus, with his military success, Ferdinand's side has the upper hand in the war and is effectively the Royalist party, with the backing of much of the nobility and the Dowager Queen, and he also has Di Luna as his chief henchman (Luna's own connection to the royal family is not mentioned, being not necessary to the drama): while Urgel, losing the war and on the back foot, is forced to recruit among outlaws and the dispossessed, effectively taking the part of a rebel despite having some legal right to his case. Thus the fact that the forces of Urgel, in the opera as in real life, lose every pitched battle: and on the single occasion that they capture a castle (named in the opera as \"Castellor\", a fairly generic name for a castle, there being many Castellars in the region), it proves a handicap to them because their only hope in battle lies in speed, mobility, surprise and ambush, all of which are lost when defending a fortress.\nThus it is that the fictitious troubadour Manrico can gain his rags-to-riches background, having risen from the obscurity of a Biscayan gypsy camp to become Urgel's chief general, a knight and a master swordsman in his own right, good enough to defeat Di Luna himself in a personal duel, or win a knightly tournament: only to lose it again on the military battlefield, where the odds are perpetually against him, and he is damned as an outlaw even before the opera begins, for no deed of his own but because his master is the rebel. And yet he gets to be a heroic, popular outlaw, who might just escape with his life in return for a vow of future loyalty, if put on trial in front of the Prince himself: a chance that Luna does not want to risk, given that his rivalry with Manrico is personal as well as political. Hence the challenge to the duel over the personal rivalry, instead of calling the guards and making the arrest political, in act 1: and hence also the decision to execute without trial in act 4 even though Luna knows he is abusing his position. Leonora and Azucena are, of course, as fictitious as Manrico, as is the story's conceit that the former Count of Luna had not one but two sons.\nRecordings.\nOver the last century there has been an increase in interest and appreciation for Verdi's music. Remarkably, there has been a lot of interest in the excerpt \"Miserere\" and \"Di Quella Pira\", and since the dawn of recorded music there have been tens of recordings of these fragments, ranging from vocal interpretations to instrumental duets. For the early American market, Giannini's and Pryor's arrangements may be notable, and for the Russian market Labinskii's recording is considered to be the most mature. Though, for the first half of the 20th century, Caruso's version would be the most acclaimed.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Anvil Chorus is one of the most-recognized pieces of classical music. It \"has transcended the opera itself\" and is often played in non-opera concerts. It appears in many cultural references as well.\nA modified sample of an 1899 recording of Ferruccio Giannini's performance of \"Miserere\" appears on The Caretaker recording \"Everywhere at the End of Time (Stage 3).\"\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources\nOther sources"}

As musicologist Roger Parker notes, the composer \"intervened on several important points, insisting for example that the role of Ernani be sung by a tenor (rather than by a contralto as had originally been planned)\".\n\"Ernani\" was first performed on 9 March 1844, and it was \"immensely popular, and was revived countless times during its early years\".\nIt became Verdi's most popular opera until it was superseded by \"Il trovatore\" after 1853. In 1903, it became the first opera to be recorded completely.\nComposition history.\nFollowing the success of both \"Nabucco\" and \"I Lombardi\", Verdi was approached by many opera companies wanting to commission him to write an opera for their houses. Rather than prepare another for La Scala, he was interested in a commission for two operas for the 1843\u201344 season (one of which would be \"I Lombardi\") which came from the President of the Teatro la Fenice in Venice, Marquis Nanni Mocenigo.\nHowever, the composer was only willing to accept the terms which he proposed: 12,000 Austrian lire to be paid after the first performance, not the third as proposed by Venice (Verdi recalled what had happened to \"Un giorno di regno\" with its one and only performance). Amongst other stipulations, he demanded the right to choose his own subject and his own librettist, and also to pay him directly, as well as refusing to accept the requirement that a full orchestral score be available in advance. In addition, he had the right to choose the singers from the assembled company for that season. David Kimbell notes one additional demand:\nHe explains [to Mocenigo at La Fenice]\u2014and this was rare at the time\u2014that he began to compose only when the libretto was completed to his satisfaction because \"when I have a general conception of the whole poem, the music comes of its own accord\"\nOnce this agreement was settled upon, the next step was to choose a subject, something which took some time. Several subjects came to Verdi's attention: for example, Byron's \"The Corsair\" was considered, but the right baritone was not available. In thinking about an opera about the Venetian Foscari family, he found that it was forbidden by the censor in order to avoid upsetting any of the descendants of that family who were then living in Venice. (Both of these subjects were to become later Verdi operas, \"Il corsaro\" and \"I due Foscari\", the latter opening in Rome later in 1844.)\nAn unsolicited manuscript from the unknown Francesco Piave (who was La Fenice's resident poet and stage manager in addition to being a friend of Brenna, the company's Secretary) proposed an opera, \"Cromwell,\" based on Victor Hugo's play, and on which he had started work. Mocenigo assured the composer of Piave's sense of the theatre and of musical forms, and so they agreed to proceed, although by the time of its approval by the Fenice authorities, it had become \"Allan Cameron\", a story set in the time just prior to the accession of Britain's Charles II. Immediately, Verdi took control and made it clear to Piave what he wanted in the way of a theatrical experience: \"...Let's have as few words as possible ... Remember that brevity is never a fault ... But I do insist on brevity because that's what the public wants...\"\nThe idea for \"Hernani\".\nThe \"Cromwell\" libretto arrived from Piave in pieces, and Verdi put it away until he had the complete version to work from. However, when the composer and La Fenice's president met in Venice in late August, Verdi expressed some dissatisfaction at how the libretto had turned out. Then Mocenigo's casual reference to Hugo's successful 1830 drama \"Hernani\" as an idea for a libretto caught Verdi's imagination, as seen in a letter which the latter wrote to Mocenigo in early September which expressed concerns about \"Allan Cameron\" and the way it had turned out, though noting that this was \"the fault of the subject and not the poet\". He continues:\nBut oh, if only we could do \"Hernani\" instead that would be tremendous. I know that it would mean a great deal of trouble for the poet but my first task would be to try and compensate him... all he would have to do would be to condense and tighten up; the action is already there ready made, and it's all immensely good theatre. Tomorrow I'll write at length to Piave setting out all the scenes from \"Hernani\" which seem to me suitable.\nAt this point he continues with suggestions for the poet. For Verdi, the appeal of Hugo's work \u2013 which the latter described as \"Romanticism or the Liberalism in literature\" \u2013 was \"the struggle between love and honour\", and Budden sums up this appeal as \"Within Hugo's scheme each illogical action follows logically from the one that precedes it, giving Verdi the pace, the eventfulness and above all the dramatic unity that he has been looking for.\"\nSetting the play as the opera, \"Ernani\".\nHowever, Piave was not at all pleased by this turn of events and felt that an opera based on \"Hernani\" could not be staged because of censorship. For instance, the King's first appearance in the play is from a cupboard where he has been hiding since some time after his arrival and before he meets Elvira. Thus he overhears much of the interaction between Elvira and Ernani before finally revealing himself. Verdi must have realized that no king \"would ever be allowed to hide in a cupboard\", according to Budden.\nBut the La Fenice directorate did approve the concept and the librettist was offered compensation, although he saved his \"Allan Cameron\" in reserve in case of mishap. As it evolved, the opera \u2013 originally titled \"Don Ruy Gomez de Silva\" in synopsis form \u2013 came more and more \"to reflect the unique character of the parent drama\" as Verdi wished to stick as closely as possible to the original play. For Budden, this \"marks a new outlook in Italian opera\", because this would never have occurred to either Rossini or Donizetti, for whom plots were interchangeable.\nAlthough Verdi had agreed to try to accommodate the contralto Carolina Vietti when the opera was \"Allan Cameron\", he was against making the leading character of Ernani a musico contralto. However, he compromised somewhat and, by the end of October, it appeared that the four voice types were to be soprano (Elvira), contralto (Ernani), tenor (Don Carlo), and baritone (de Silva), but after the acceptance of the libretto by the Venetian police, Verdi was able to hold firm and ultimately get what he wanted: a soprano, a tenor, a baritone, and \u2013 although Rosi was not an experienced enough singer \u2013 a bass in the role of de Silva. Thus it became a comprimario role, one to be sung by a second-rung singer in the company. But, as Budden notes, Verdi's \"difficulties with singers were not yet over\".\nThe season opened with \"I Lombardi\" in December 1843. It was a disaster, with terrible singing from the tenor Domenico Conti. Two other operas early in the 1843/44 season were equally poorly received. Having heard one other potential tenor, Vitali, as a possible replacement, the composer presented an ultimatum: either be released from his contract or the company would engage Carlo Guasco in the role of Ernani. With a premiere set for March, two final glitches were overcome: the bass Rosi had disappeared from consideration as de Silva but was replaced by Meini, who then withdrew because he found the part too low. Verdi then engaged a member of the chorus, the bass Antonio Selva who went on to a distinguished career. And, in spite of complaints from the soprano, Sophie L\u00f6we, that she was not to be front and centre for the finale, she became part of the final trio.\nVerdi and theatre.\nBudden notes the following in regard to the specific relationship between this opera and the work of Victor Hugo:\n...from the first the spirit of Hugo is there. Verdi [ten years younger than the playwright] was part of that youthful audience to which the play \"Hernani\" is addressed. The bounding energy of Hugo's alexandrines is reflected in the spirit of Verdi's music, which is far more forceful than anything he had written so far. Victor Hugo, one might say, was good for Verdi; and it significant that both the operas that he based on Hugo's plays (the other was of course \"Rigoletto\") were landmarks in his career.\nBut it is the composer himself who, in a letter to Brenna, the La Fenice secretary and a friend of Piave's, sums up his own sense of theatre, of what works and what does not. This was written at a time when Piave was unhappy about the shift from his original libretto to the one for what became \"Ernani\". With this shift came many changes of direction as issues such as casting came into consideration, and Verdi asks Brenna to communicate his feelings to the librettist:\nHowever little experience I may have had, I do go to the theatre [Verdi is referring to the opera house] all the year round and I pay the most careful attention to what I see and hear. I've been able to put my finger on so many works which wouldn't have failed if the pieces had been better laid out, the effects better calculated, the musical forms clearer, etc... in a word, if either the composer or the poet had been more experienced.\nIn effect, Verdi is taking control over all aspects of the piece, which includes the condensation of the sprawling play into his four acts. (The first two acts of Hugo's play become act 1 of the opera). Rather than allow the librettist a free hand in composing his verses, \"this would have perpetuated in a diminished form the word-music division that Verdi precisely wanted to get away from. The composer's desire to take charge of every aspect of an opera implied that he had the power to decide what weight to give the text and the music, respectively, depending upon the \"moment\" of the action.\nPerformance history.\n19th century.\nBudden sums up the opening night success of \"Ernani\": nothing \"prevented [the opera] from being a tremendous success. With it, Verdi's fame took a new leap which carried it at once across the boundaries of Italy. For better or worse, he was now a world composer ... [and] wherever there was an Italian opera house, \"Ernani\" arrived sooner or later.\" However, it was not all smooth sailing: due to Hugo's opposition, the first performances in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Italiens two years later required a change of title \u2013 to \"Il proscritto\" \u2013 and a change of characters' names: \"The practice was followed in other cities where the names Victor Hugo and \"Hernani\" smacked of revolution.\" In Palermo in 1845 it became \"Elvira d'Aragona\" and in Messina in 1847 the title became \"Il proscritto ossia Il corsaro di Venezia\". Overall, \"Ernani\" was staged in one form or another up to the mid-1850s, with \"32 theatres [giving] the work in 1844, 60 in 1845, and at least 65 in 1846, not including revivals in houses that had already presented it.\"\nThe United Kingdom premiere, the first of Verdi's operas to be translated into English, took place at Her Majesty's Theatre in London on 8 March 1845 followed on 13 April 1847 by its US premiere in New York City.\n20th century and beyond.\n\"Ernani\" appeared on the roster of the Metropolitan Opera as early as 1903 and has been given many times since then. The opera was revived in a series of new productions at the San Francisco Opera (1982), the Met (1983), the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1984), and at La Scala (1984). It was given as part of the 1997 season of the Sarasota Opera's \"Verdi Cycle\". The Teatro Regio di Parma, another company with the aim of presenting every Verdi opera, gave it in October 2005.\nToday \"Ernani\" receives numerous performances at opera houses around the world.\nTime: 1519.\nPlace: Aragon, Aachen, and Zaragoza.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"Mountains of Aragon\"\nThe bandits demand the reason for Ernani's gloom (Chorus: \"Evviva! Beviam! Beviam!\" / \"To you we drink\"; \"Ernani pensoso!\" / \"Ernani, so gloomy? Why, oh strong one, does care sit on your brow?\"). Ernani replies that he loves Elvira (Recitative: \"Thanks, dear friends\"; Cavatina: \"Come rugiada al cespite\" / \"As the flower turns to the sun\"), who is about to be married against her will to old Gomez de Silva (\"O tu che l'alma adora\"). He asks the bandits to abduct her.\n\"In Elvira's chamber\"\nElvira worries about her upcoming marriage (Scena: \"Now sinks the sun and Silva does not return\"; Cavatina: \"Ernani, Ernani involami\" / \"Ernani, Ernani, save me\") as servants deliver Silva's wedding presents to her. She reaffirms her love for Ernani (\"Tutto sprezzo che d'Ernani\" / \"I scorn everything which does not speak to my heart of Ernani\"). King Carlo enters, declaring his love for Elvira, who rejects it, admitting she is in love with another man. As Carlo attempts to use force, she grasps a dagger, while Ernani suddenly arrives to defend her. Carlo recognizes Ernani as the leader of the bandits. (Trio: \"Tu se' Ernani! Me 'l dice lo sdegno\" / \"You are Ernani! The scorn that invades this soul tells that to me\"). Ernani replies that Carlo killed his father, robbed him of his lands and forced him into a life of banditry. As he invites Carlo to fight, Silva appears and sees them both, guessing correctly that they are trying to seduce Elvira (\"Infelice!... e tu credevi\"... \"che mai vegg'io!\" / \"Dreadful sight\"; Silva's cavatina: \"Unhappy man! You thought this lovely...was yours\").\n[\"La Scala, Autumn 1844, Silva's cabaletta added\": \"Infin che un brando vindice\" \"using music originally written for Verdi's first opera, Oberto\"]\nSilva wants to fight both the seductors to restore his honour, when Riccardo approaches and recognises the king. Silva is horrified and apologizes to the king, who in turn decides to save Ernani, saying that is one of his servants. Ernani whispers to Elvira to prepare to flee, while Carlo starts talking with Silva about his rights for the Holy Roman Empire.\nAct 2.\n\"A hall in Silva's palace\"\nErnani enters disguised as a pilgrim. He asks for shelter, which Silva grants him, and then learns from Silva that he is about to marry Elvira, who believes Ernani to be dead. Ernani reveals his true identity to everyone, begging to be handed to the king. Silva however decides to keep his word and protect Ernani. The bandit then confronts Elvira, who tells him that she was planning to kill herself at the altar (Duet: \"Ah, morir potessi adesso\" / \"Ah, if I could die now\"). Silva walks in, discovering the pair, and furiously decides to kill Ernani. However, he is stopped by one of his men, Jago, who tells of the impending arrival of the king. Silva decides to hide Ernani and exact his vengeance on him later. (Trio: \"No, vendetta pi\u00f9 tremenda\" / \"No, I want to keep a greater revenge\"). Carlo arrives and wishes to know why the castle is barred. Silva refuses to surrender Ernani (Carlo's aria: \"Lo vedremo, veglio audace\" / \"We shall see, you bold old man\") and Don Carlo's men cannot find Ernani's hiding place. Silva keeps his word, even when the king secures Elvira as a hostage. Finally alone, Silva releases Ernani, challenging him to a duel. Ernani refuses to fight, pleading to see on last time Elvira and die. After Silva reveals that the king has taken her as hostage, Ernani reveals that Carlo loves Elvira, too. After that, Silva is convinced to posticipate again his revenge on Ernani. They join forces to retrieve Elvira and kill Carlo. Therefore, Ernani swears to die whenever Silva will sound a horn he gives to him. (\"Se uno squillo intender\u00e0, tosto Ernani morir\u00e0\" / \"If Ernani will hear a sound, Ernani will die at moment\")\n[\"Added for Parma, 26 December 1844: \"at Rossini's request, Verdi wrote a grand aria for the tenor Nicola Ivanoff\". Ernani gathers his men to him. His aria of vengeance: \"Sprezzo la vita n\u00e9 pi\u00f9 m'alletta\" / \"Life means nothing to me, only hope of vengeance\" concludes the act]\".\nAct 3.\n\"In the burial vault of Charles the Great at Aachen\"\nCarlo visits the grave of the emperor Charlemagne (Carlo Magno), whose successor, the new Holy Roman Emperor, is being elected by delegates from the relevant countries. Carlo resolves to change his life if he is crowned (Cavatina: \"Oh, de' verd'anni miei\"/ \"Oh, the dreams and deceits of my youth\"). Hiding behind the vault, he overhears a gathering of conspirators including Silva and Ernani. Ernani swears to murder Carlo. (Choir: \"Si ridesti il leon di Castiglia\" / \"Let the lion of Castille awaken\") The conspiracy is foiled when Carlo's attendants enter and surprise the conspirators. The king commands that all the traitorous noblemen be executed. Ernani steps forward, declaring that thus he must die too; he is not the bandit Ernani, but Don Juan of Aragon, whose lands were taken from him. Elvira, who had been brought to Carlo as his intended empress, begs mercy for her lover, and Carlo, whose mood has changed, forgives all the conspirators and places Elvira's hand in that of Ernani. Silva is furious.\nAct 4.\n\"Ernani's Castle\"\nElvira and Ernani have just been married, when, in consternation, Ernani hears a bugle call. Silva arrives, wearing a mask, and hands him a cup of poison and a dagger. Ernani asks for time to \"sip from the cup of love\" (\"Ascolta, ascolta un detto ancor\"/ \"Listen, just one word...\") but, cursed by Silva as a coward, Ernani keeps his oath and stabs himself in the heart (Trio with Silva: \"\u00c8 vano, o donna, il piangere, \u00e8 vano\" / \"Your weeping is in vain, woman\"). He dies in Elvira's arms, telling her to live.\nOrchestration.\n\"Ernani\" is scored for one piccolo, one flute, two oboes, two clarinets, one bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, one cimbasso, one harp, timpani, bass drum and cymbals, snare drum, on-stage band with on-stage bass drum, one offstage horn, six offstage trumpets, and strings.\nMusic.\nNoting that the dramatic structure of this opera \"brought about a fresh consideration of the fixed forms of Italian opera, in particular an expansion and enrichment of the solo aria and duet together with a more flexible approach to the musical sequences that bind together lyrical pieces\", Roger Parker continues by stating that of greatest importance was \"Verdi's gathering sense of musical drama's larger rhetoric, his increasing control over the dynamics of entire acts rather than merely of entire numbers. In this respect, the third act of \"Ernani\" sets up an imposing standard of coherence, one that is rarely equalled until the operas of the early 1850s.\"\nHowever, it is writer Gabriele Baldini (whose specialization was in English literature) who in 1980 points to one of the most significant aspects of \"Ernani\"'s dramatic and musical structure, the concept of male vocal archetypes, something which is echoed in Budden's 1984 chapter on this opera. Baldini writes of the musical conflicts inherent in the drama as a result of the use of certain voice types:\nA youthful, passionate female voice is besieged by three male voices, each of whom establishes a specific relationship with her. The siege is fruitless. The male voices, or rather registers, meet with various fates, and each is granted a relationship with the woman, although on different levels. This relationship varies in intensity of passion according to the distance between the soprano register and the particular male voice.\nTherefore, it is the lowest voice [the bass, de Silva], which is \"farthest away, and thus his relationship is the coldest and most retrained\". The baritone [the King, Don Carlo] \"manages to draw somewhat closer, although indirectly and ambiguously\", but Baldini continues by noting that it the highest male voice [the tenor, Ernani] who \"gets near a relationship which if not complete ... is at least reciprocated for long periods\".\nFinally, while Baldini agrees with Parker that it is act 3 of \"Ernani\" which is the strongest \u2013 \"in my opinion it marks the first occasion on which Verdi enclosed within a fairly extended musical space (about twenty five minutes) a perfect structural unit\" \u2013 he also echoes Budden and De Van in noting the importance of the opening horn motif and references to the horn which recur throughout the opera and which ends with the final horn call, the fatal summons to Ernani by de Silva.\nRecordings.\nThe first complete recording of an opera was the 1904 recording of \"Ernani\", on 40 single-sided discs, by the Gramophone Company in England. Later recordings include:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The opera is most often performed in Italian translation, usually under the title Don Carlo.\nThe opera's story is based on conflicts in the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545\u20131568). Though he was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois, part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551\u201359 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois demanded that she be married instead to his father Philip II of Spain. It was commissioned and produced by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial de l'Op\u00e9ra (Paris Opera) and given its premiere at the Salle Le Peletier on 11 March 1867.\nThe first performance in Italian was given at Covent Garden in London in June 1867. The first performance in Italy was in Bologna in October 1867, also in Italian translation. After some revisions by Verdi, it was performed in Italian in Naples in November/December 1872. Verdi was also responsible for a short four-act \"Milan version\" in which the first act was removed and the ballet omitted (composed to a French text, but first performed in Milan in January 1884 in Italian translation) but also apparently approved a five-act \"Modena version\" in which the first act was restored but the ballet still omitted (performed in Modena in December 1886, also in Italian translation). Around 1970, substantial passages of music cut before the premiere were discovered in Paris archives, giving rise to at least one additional version that can be ascribed to Verdi: the version he prepared for the Paris Opera in 1866, before any cuts were made. No other Verdi opera exists in so many authentic versions. At its full length (including the ballet and the cuts made before the first performance), it contains close to four hours of music and is Verdi's longest opera.\nComposition history.\nPre-premi\u00e8re cuts and first published edition\nVerdi made a number of cuts in 1866, after finishing the opera but before composing the ballet, simply because the work was becoming too long. These were a duet for Elisabeth and Eboli in Act 4, Scene 1; a duet for Carlos and the King after the death of Posa in Act 4, Scene 2; and an exchange between Elisabeth and Eboli during the insurrection in the same scene.\nAfter the ballet had been composed, it emerged during the 1867 rehearsal period that, without further cuts, the opera would not finish before midnight (the time by which patrons would need to leave in order to catch the last trains to the Paris suburbs). Verdi then authorised some further cuts, which were, firstly, the introduction to Act 1 (with a chorus of woodcutters and their wives, and including the first appearance of Elisabeth); secondly, a short entry solo for Posa (\"J'\u00e9tais en Flandres\") in Act 2, Scene 1; and, thirdly, part of the dialogue between the King and Posa at the end of Act 2, Scene 2.\nThe opera was first published as given at the premi\u00e8re and consisted of Verdi's original conception, without the music of the above-named cuts, but with the ballet.\nIn 1969, at a Verdi congress in Verona, the American musicologist David Rosen presented the missing section from the Philip-Posa duet from the end of Act 2, which he had found folded down in the conductor's copy of the score. Other pages with cuts had simply been removed from the autograph score and the conductor's copy. Shortly thereafter, the British music critic Andrew Porter found most of these other cut passages could be reconstructed from the individual parts, in which the pages with the \"lost\" music had been either \"pasted, pinned or stitched down.\" In all, 21 minutes of missing music was restored. Nearly all of the known music Verdi composed for the opera, including the pre-premi\u00e8re cuts and later revisions, can be found in an integral edition prepared by the German musicologist Ursula G\u00fcnther, first published in 1980 and in a second, revised version in 1986.\nPerformance history.\n19th century.\nAs \"Don Carlos\" in French.\nAfter the premi\u00e8re and before leaving Paris, Verdi authorised the Op\u00e9ra authorities to end Act 4, Scene 2 with the death of Posa (thereby omitting the insurrection scene) if they thought fit. This was done, beginning with the second performance on 13 March, after his departure. Further (unauthorised) cuts were apparently made during the remaining performances. Despite a grandiose production designed by scenic artists Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry (Acts I and III), \u00c9douard Desplechin and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (Acts II and V), and Auguste Alfred Rub\u00e9 and Philippe Chaperon (Act IV), it appears to have been a \"problem opera\" for the Op\u00e9ra\u2014it disappeared from its repertoire after 1869.\nAs \"Don Carlo\" in an Italian translation.\nIt was common practice at the time for most theatres (other than those in French-speaking communities) to perform operas in Italian, and an Italian translation of \"Don Carlos\" was prepared in the autumn of 1866 by Achille de Lauzi\u00e8res. On 18 November 1866 Verdi wrote to Giovanni Ricordi, offering the Milan publisher the Italian rights, but insisting that the opera:\nmust be performed in its entirety as it will be performed for the first time at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. \"Don Carlos\" is an opera in five acts with ballet: if nevertheless the management of Italian theatres would like to pair it with a different ballet, this must be placed either before or after the uncut opera, never in the middle, following the barbarous custom of our day.\nThe Italian translation was first performed not in Italy but in London at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 4 June 1867, where it was produced and conducted by Michael Costa. However, it was not as Verdi desired; the opera was given in a cut and altered form, with the first act removed, the ballet in Act 3 omitted, and Carlo's aria \"Io la vidi\" (originally in Act 1) moved to Act 3, just before the terzetto. Additionally, the duet between Philip and the Inquisitor was shortened by four lines, and Elisabeth's aria in Act 5 consisted only of part of the middle section and the reprise. The production was initially considered a success, and Verdi sent a congratulatory note to Costa. Later when he learned of the alterations, Verdi was greatly irritated, but Costa's version anticipated revisions Verdi himself would make a few years later in 1882\u201383.\nThe Italian premiere on 27 October 1867 at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, conducted by Verdi's close friend Angelo Mariani, was an \"instant success\", and this version, although produced in Verdi's absence, was more complete and included the ballet. For the Rome premiere on 9 February 1868 at the Teatro Apollo, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Papal censor changed the Inquisitor into a Gran Cancelliere (Grand Chancellor) and the Monk/Emperor into a Solitario (Recluse).\nThis version of the opera was first performed in Milan at La Scala on 25 March 1868, and prestige productions in most other Italian opera houses followed, but it did not become a popular success. The length was a particular problem, and subsequent performances were generally heavily cut. The first production in Naples in 1871 was indisputably a failure.\n1872 revisions for Naples.\nFollowing the unsuccessful performance in Naples in 1871, Verdi was persuaded to visit the city for further performances in November / December 1872, and he made two more modifications to the score: (a) a revision of the closing two-thirds of the Philippe-Rodrigue duet in Act 2, Scene 2 (to Italian verses, almost certainly by Antonio Ghislanzoni), which replaced some of the previously cut material, and (b) the removal of the \"allegro marziale\" section of the final Elisabeth-Carlos duet (replaced with an 8-bar patch). These are the only portions of the opera that were composed to an Italian rather than a French text. According to Julian Budden, Verdi \"was to regret both modifications\". Ricordi incorporated the revisions into later prints of the opera without changing the plate numbers. This subsequently confused some authors, e.g. Francis Toye and Ernest Newman, who dated them to 1883.\n1882/83 and 1886 revisions: \"Milan version\" and \"Modena version\".\nThe idea of reducing the scope and scale of \"Don Carlos\" had originally come to Verdi in 1875, partly as a result of his having heard reports of productions, such as Costa's, which had removed Act 1 and the ballet and introduced cuts to other parts of the opera. By April 1882, he was in Paris where he was ready to make changes. He was already familiar with the work of Charles-Louis-\u00c9tienne Nuitter, who had worked on French translations of \"Macbeth\", \"La forza del destino\" and \"Aida\" with du Locle, and the three proceeded to spend nine months on major revisions of the French text and the music to create a four-act version. This omitted Act 1 and the ballet, and was completed by March 1883. An Italian translation of this revised French text, re-using much of the original 1866 translation by de Lauzi\u00e8res, was made by Angelo Zanardini. The La Scala premi\u00e8re of the 1883 revised version took place on 10 January 1884 in Italian.\nAlthough Verdi had accepted the need to remove the first act, it seems that he changed his mind and allowed a performance which presented the \"Fontainebleau\" first act along with the revised four-act version. It was given on 29 December 1886 in Modena, and has become known as the \"Modena version\", which was published by Ricordi as \"a new edition in five acts without ballet\".\n20th century and beyond.\nIn Italian\nPerformances of \"Don Carlo\" in the first half of the twentieth century were rare, but in the post Second World War period it has been regularly performed, particularly in the four-act 1884 \"Milan version\" in Italian. In 1950, to open Rudolf Bing's first season as director of the Metropolitan Opera, the four-act version was performed without the ballet in a production by Margaret Webster with Jussi Bj\u00f6rling in the title role, Delia Rigal as Elizabeth, Robert Merrill as Rodrigo, Fedora Barbieri as Eboli, Cesare Siepi as Philip II and Jerome Hines as the Grand Inquisitor. This version was performed there until 1972. The four-act version in Italian continued to be championed by conductors such as Herbert von Karajan (1978 audio recording and 1986 video recording) and Riccardo Muti (1992 video recording).\nAlso influential was a 1958 staging of the 1886 five-act \"Modena version\" in Italian by The Royal Opera company, Covent Garden, directed by Luchino Visconti and conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini. The cast included Jon Vickers as Don Carlo, Tito Gobbi as Rodrigo, Boris Christoff as King Phillip and Gr\u00e9 Brouwenstijn as Elizabeth. This version has increasingly been performed elsewhere and has been recorded by, among others, Georg Solti and Giulini.\nAfter the discovery of music cut before the premiere, conductors began performing five-act versions that included some of it. In 1973 at La Fenice, Georges Pr\u00eatre conducted a 5-act version in Italian without the ballet that included the discarded woodcutters scene, the first Carlo-Rodrigo duet in a hybrid beginning with the Paris edition but ending with the Milan revision, the discarded Elisabeth-Eboli duet from Act 4, and the Paris finale. In 1975, Charles Mackerras conducted an expanded and modified five-act version (with Verdi's original prelude, the woodcutters' scene and the original Paris ending) in an English translation for English National Opera at the London Coliseum. In 1978, Claudio Abbado mounted an expanded five-act version in Italian at La Scala. The cast included Mirella Freni as Elizabeth, Elena Obraztsova and Viorica Cortez as Eboli, Jos\u00e9 Carreras in the title role, Piero Cappuccilli as Rodrigo, Nicolai Ghiaurov as King Phillip, and Evgeny Nesterenko as the Grand Inquisitor. On 5 February 1979, James Levine conducted an expanded five-act version in Italian at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The cast included Renata Scotto as Elizabeth, Marilyn Horne as Eboli, Giuseppe Giacomini as Don Carlo, Sherrill Milnes as Rodrigo, Nicolai Ghiaurov as King Philip, and James Morris as the Grand Inquisitor.\nToday, as translated into Italian and presented in four-act and five-act versions, the opera has become part of the standard repertory.\nIn French\nStagings and broadcasts of five-act French versions of the opera have become more frequent in the later 20th and into the 21st century. Up to 1973, these productions consisted of the revised and abridged four-act score of 1882\u201383 prefaced by the shortened, revised Act 1 set in Fontainebleau. A radio broadcast by ORTF in France was given in 1967 with a nearly all-French cast, with the exception of the Italian Matteo Manuguerra as Rodrigue. A five-act French version was performed at La Scala Milan in 1970.\nOn 22 May 1973, the Opera Company of Boston under the direction of Sarah Caldwell presented a nearly complete five-act French version which included the 21 minutes of music cut before the premiere, but not the ballet. The 1867 version was used, since the restored music does not easily fit with the 1886 revised version. The cast included John Alexander in the title role, the French-Canadian https:// as \u00c9lisabeth, the French singer Mich\u00e8le Vilma as Princess Eboli, William Dooley as Rodrigue and Donald Gramm as Philippe. According to Andrew Porter, the Boston production was \"the first performance, ever, of the immense opera that Verdi prepared in 1867; and in doing so it opened a new chapter in the stage history of the piece.\"\nThe BBC Concert Orchestra under John Matheson broadcast the opera in June 1973 with the roles of Don Carlos sung by Andr\u00e9 Turp, Philippe II by Joseph Rouleau, and Rodrigue by Robert Savoie. Julian Budden comments that \"this was the first complete performance of what could be called the 1866 conception in French with the addition of the ballet.\"\nSeveral notable productions of five-act French versions have been mounted more recently. A five-act French version was performed by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1983. A co-production between the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris and the Royal Opera in London in 1996 used Andrew Porter as a consultant and was a \"judicious mixture\" of music from the 1866 original and the 1883 revision. The production, staged by Luc Bondy, was also shared with the opera houses in Brussels, Nice and Lyon. The performance by the Paris cast (March 1996), was conducted by Antonio Pappano with Roberto Alagna as Don Carlos, Karita Mattila as Elisabeth, Thomas Hampson as Rodrigue, Jos\u00e9 Van Dam as Philippe II and Waltraud Meier as Eboli. It was recorded on videotape and is now available in a remastered HD video format.\nA Vienna State Opera production, staged by Peter Konwitschny and performed in Vienna in October 2004, included all of the music excised during the Paris rehearsal period plus the ballet. Patrick O'Connor, writing in the \"Gramophone\" magazine, reports the ballet was \"staged as 'Eboli's Dream'. She and Don Carlos are living in suburban bliss, and have Philip and Elisabeth round for a pizza, delivered by Rodrigo. Musically, the performance, apart from the Auto-da-f\u00e9 scene, has a lot going for it under the direction of Bertrand de Billy.\" A DVD video recording is available.\nOn 17 September 2005 a co-production directed by John Caird of the largely uncut Paris version in French between the Welsh National Opera and the Canadian Opera Company (Toronto) was premiered by the WNO at the Wales Millennium Center. The performance was conducted by Carlo Rizzi with Nuccia Focile as Elizabeth, Paul Charles Clarke as Don Carlos, Scott Hendricks as Rodrigue, Guang Yang as Eboli, Andrea Silvestrelli as Philippe II, and Daniel Sumegi as the Grand Inquisitor. The production was taken on tour to Edinburgh, Oxford, Birmingham, Bristol, Southampton and Liverpool. It was performed by the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto in October/November 2007 with a different cast. The production was performed several times by the Houston Grand Opera from 13 April 2012 until 28 April. The Houston production was conducted by Patrick Summers with Brandon Jovanovich as Don Carlos, Tamara Wilson as Elizabeth, Andrea Silvestrelli as Philippe II, Christine Goerke as Eboli, Scott Hendricks as Rodrigue and Samuel Ramey as the Grand Inquisitor.\nOn 10 October 2017, the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris performed the 1866 French version (before the ballet was composed) in a production staged by Krzysztof Warlikowski at the Bastille. Conducted by Philippe Jordan, the cast included Jonas Kaufmann as Don Carlos, Sonya Yoncheva as Elisabeth, Ludovic T\u00e9zier as Rodrigue, Ildar Abdrazakov as Philippe II and El\u012bna Garan\u010da as Eboli. The performance of 19 October was telecast live to cinemas in Europe and later that evening presented on the ARTE television channel.\nThe Metropolitan Opera presented the opera in French for the first time on 28 February 2022 in the Modena version in a production by David McVicar, with tenor Matthew Polenzani in the title role and French-Canadian Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducting. The performance of 26 March 2022 was presented as part of the Met Opera Live in HD series, with house-conductor Patrick Furrer filling in for an ailing N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin.\n[This synopsis is based on the original five-act version composed for Paris and completed in 1866. Important changes for subsequent versions are noted in indented brackets. First lines of arias, etc., are given in French and Italian].\n[This act was omitted in the 1883 revision]\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"The Forest of Fontainebleau, France in winter\"\nA prelude and chorus of woodcutters and their wives is heard. They complain of their hard life, made worse by war with Spain. Elisabeth, daughter of the King of France, arrives with her attendants. She reassures the people that her impending marriage to Don Carlos, Infante and son of Philip II, King of Spain, will bring the war to an end, and departs.\n[The preceding prelude and chorus of woodcutters was cut before the Paris premi\u00e8re and replaced by a short scene in which Elisabeth crosses the stage and hands out money to the woodcutters; she exits without singing. The prelude and chorus of woodcutters was also omitted when Act 1 was restored in the 1886 five-act Modena version.]\nCarlos, coming out from hiding, has seen Elisabeth and fallen in love with her (Aria: \"Je l'ai vue\" / \"Io la vidi\"). When she reappears, he initially pretends to be a member of the Count of Lerma's delegation. She asks him about Don Carlos, whom she has not yet met. Before long, Carlos reveals his true identity and his feelings, which she reciprocates (Duet: \"De quels transports poignants et doux\" / \"Di quale amor, di quanto ardor\"). A cannon-shot signifies that peace has been declared between Spain and France. Thibault appears and gives Elisabeth the surprising news that her hand is to be claimed not by Carlos but by his father, Philip. When Lerma and his followers confirm this, Elisabeth is devastated but feels bound to accept, in order to consolidate the peace. She departs for Spain, leaving Carlos equally devastated.\n[This is Act 1 in the 1883 revision]\nAct 2.\n\"Scene 1: The monastery of Saint-Just (San Jer\u00f3nimo de Yuste) in Spain\"\nThe scene takes place soon after King Philip II and Elisabeth have married. Monks pray before the tomb of the former Emperor Charles V (\"Carlo Quinto\"). The monks' leader proclaims that the Emperor was proud but has been humbled through error.\nDon Carlos enters, anguished that the woman he loves is now his stepmother.\n[In the 1883 revision, he sings a revised version of the aria \"Je l'ai vue\" / \"Io la vidi\", which was salvaged from the omitted first act but with some different music and different text to reflect his current situation. In the four-act version he already knows that he cannot marry Elisabeth. In the original, when singing the aria, he was still expecting to marry her]\nWhen Carlos pauses in his lament, the leader of the monks proclaims that the turbulence of the world persists even in sacred places; we cannot rest except in Heaven. The sound of his voice frightens Carlos, who thinks it sounds like that of the Emperor Charles V. Carlos further notices that the monk physically resembles the Emperor, and recalls hearing rumors that the Emperor's ghost haunts the monastery.\nCarlos' dear friend Rodrigue, Marquis of Posa, who has just arrived from the oppressed land of Flanders, enters. The two greet each other joyfully (Aria: \"J'\u00e9tais en Flandres\").\nRodrigue asks for the Infante's aid on behalf of the suffering people there. Carlos reveals that he loves his stepmother. Rodrigue is first shocked, but then sympathetic. He encourages Carlos to leave Spain and go to Flanders, and to forget his pain by focusing on political activity there. The two men swear eternal friendship (Duet: \"Dieu, tu semas dans nos \u00e2mes\" / \"Dio, che nell'alma infondere\").\nKing Philip and his new wife, with their attendants, enter also to do homage at Charles V's tomb, while Don Carlos laments his lost love.\n\"Scene 2: A garden near Saint-Just\"\nPrincess Eboli sings the Veil Song (\"Au palais des f\u00e9es\" / \"Nel giardin del bello\") about a Moorish King trying to seduce an alluring veiled beauty, who turns out to be his own neglected wife. Elisabeth enters. Rodrigue gives her a letter from France, which covers a secret note from Don Carlos. At his urging (Aria: \"L'Infant Carlos, notre esp\u00e9rance\" / \"Carlo ch'\u00e8 sol il nostro amore\"), Elisabeth agrees to see the Infante alone. Unaware of this relationship, Eboli infers that she, Eboli, is the one Don Carlos loves.\nWhen they are alone, Don Carlos tells Elisabeth that he is miserable, and asks her to request the King to send him to Flanders. She promptly agrees, provoking Carlos to renew his declarations of love, which she piously rejects. Don Carlos exits in a frenzy, shouting that he must be under a curse. The King enters and becomes angry because the Queen is alone and unattended. His suspicions are insulting to her. He orders the lady-in-waiting who was meant to be attending her, the Countess of Aremberg, to return to France, prompting Elizabeth to sing a sorrowful farewell-aria. (Aria: \"Oh ma ch\u00e8re compagne\" / \"Non pianger, mia compagna\").\nThe King now approaches Rodrigue, with whose character and activism he is impressed, and offers to reward him for his loyalty and service. Rodrigue begs the King to stop oppressing the people of Flanders. The King calls Rodrigue's idealism unrealistic and warns that the Grand Inquisitor is watching him. The King confides in Rodrigue, telling him that he fears that Carlos is having an affair with Elisabeth. Rodrigue replies that Carlos is innocent, and offers to watch Elisabeth and to be responsible for her good behavior. The King gratefully accepts this offer, and again warns Rodrigue to beware of the Grand Inquisitor.\n[This dialogue was revised three times by Verdi.]\n[This is Act 2 in the 1883 revision]\nAct 3.\n\"Scene 1: Evening in the Queen's garden in Madrid\"\nElisabeth is tired, and wishes to concentrate on the following day's coronation of the King. To avoid the \"divertissement\" planned for the evening, she exchanges masks with Eboli, assuming that thereby her absence will not be noticed, and leaves.\n[This scene was omitted from the 1883 revision]\n[In the premi\u00e8re, the ballet (choreographed by Lucien Petipa and entitled \"La P\u00e9r\u00e9grina\") took place at this point]\nAt midnight, Don Carlos enters, clutching a note suggesting a tryst in the gardens. Although he thinks this is from Elisabeth, it is really from Eboli. Eboli, who still thinks Don Carlos loves her, enters. Don Carlos mistakes her for Elisabeth in the dark, and passionately declares his love. When he sees Eboli's face, he realizes his error and recoils from her. Eboli guesses his secret\u2014that he was expecting the Queen, whom he loves. She threatens to tell the King that Elisabeth and Carlos are lovers. Carlos, terrified, begs for mercy. Rodrigue enters, and warns her not to cross him; he is the King's confidant. Eboli replies by hinting darkly that she is a formidable and dangerous foe, with power which Rodrigue does not yet know about. (Her power is that she is having an affair with the King, but she does not reveal this yet.) Rodrigue draws his dagger, intending to stab her to death, but reconsiders, spares her, and declares his trust in the Lord. Eboli exits in a vengeful rage. Rodrigue advises Carlos to entrust to him any sensitive, potentially incriminating political documents that he may have and, when Carlos agrees, they reaffirm their friendship.\n\"Scene 2: In front of the Cathedral of Valladolid\"\nPreparations are being made for an \"auto-da-f\u00e9\", the public parade and burning of condemned heretics. While the people celebrate, monks drag the condemned to the woodpile. A royal procession follows, and the King addresses the populace, promising to protect them with fire and sword. Don Carlos enters with six Flemish envoys, who plead with the King for their country's freedom. Although the people and the court are sympathetic, the King, supported by the monks, orders his guards to arrest the envoys. Carlos demands that the King grant him authority to govern Flanders; the King scornfully refuses. Enraged, Carlos draws his sword against the King. The King calls for help but the guards will not attack Don Carlos. Rodrigue realizes that actually attacking the King would be disastrous for Carlos. He steps forward and defuses the situation by taking Carlos' sword from him. Carlos, astonished, yields to his friend without resisting. Relieved and grateful, the King raises Rodrigue to the rank of Duke. The guards arrest Carlos, the monks fire the woodpile, and as the flames start to rise, a heavenly voice can be heard promising heavenly peace to the condemned souls.\n[This is Act 3 in the 1883 revision]\nAct 4.\n\"Scene 1: Dawn in King Philip's study in Madrid\"\nAlone and suffering from insomnia, the King, in a reverie, laments that Elisabeth has never loved him, that his position means that he has to be eternally vigilant and that he will only sleep properly when he is in his tomb in the Escorial (Aria: \"Elle ne m'aime pas\" / \"Ella giammai m'am\u00f2\"). The blind, ninety-year-old Grand Inquisitor is announced and shuffles into the King's apartment. When the King asks if the Church will object to him putting his own son to death, the Inquisitor replies that the King will be in good company: God sacrificed \"His\" own son. In return for his support, the Inquisitor demands that the King have Rodrigue killed. The King refuses at first to kill his friend, whom he admires and likes. However, the Grand Inquisitor reminds the King that the Inquisition can take down any king; he has created and destroyed other rulers before. Frightened and overwhelmed, the King begs the Grand Inquisitor to forget about the past discussion. The latter replies \"Peut-\u00eatre\" / \"Forse!\" \u2013 perhaps! \u2013 and leaves. The King bitterly muses on his helplessness to oppose the Church.\nElisabeth enters, alarmed at the apparent theft of her jewel casket. However, the King produces it and points to the portrait of Don Carlos which it contains, accusing her of adultery. She protests her innocence but, when the King threatens her, she faints. In response to his calls for help, into the chamber come Eboli and Rodrigue. Their laments of suspicion cause the King to realize that he has been wrong to suspect his wife (Quartet: \"Maudit soit le soup\u00e7on inf\u00e2me\" / \"Ah, sia maledetto, il rio sospetto\"). Aside, Rodrigue resolves to save Carlos, though it may mean his own death. Eboli feels remorse for betraying Elisabeth; the latter, recovering, expresses her despair.\n[The quartet was revised by Verdi in 1883 and begins: \"Maudit soit, maudit le soup\u00e7on inf\u00e2me\" / \"Ah! sii maledetto, sospetto fatale\".]\nElisabeth and Eboli are left together. Eboli confesses that it was she who told the King that Elisabeth and Carlos were having an affair, for revenge against Carlos for having rejected her. This is followed by the duet \"J'ai tout compris\". Eboli also confesses that she herself is guilty of that which she accused the Queen, and has become the King's mistress. Elisabeth leaves, and the Count di Lerma orders Eboli to choose between exile or the convent, then leaves.\n[At the premiere, the duet \"J'ai tout compris\" and Eboli's second confession, of her affair with the king, were omitted. Elisabeth orders Eboli to choose between exile or the convent immediately after Eboli's first confession. In 1883, the duet was omitted, but Eboli's second confession was reinstated in a revised version, and Elisabeth remains on stage to sing the Count di Lerma's lines.]\nEboli, left alone, curses her own beauty and pride, and resolves to make amends by trying to save Carlos from the Inquisition (Aria: \"O don fatal\" / \"O don fatale\").\n\"Scene 2: A prison\"\nDon Carlos has been imprisoned. Rodrigue arrives and tells Carlos that he (Rodrigue) has saved Carlos from being executed, by allowing himself (Rodrigue) to be incriminated by the politically sensitive documents which he had obtained from Carlos earlier (Aria, part 1: \"C'est mon jour supr\u00eame\" / \"Per me giunto \u00e8 il d\u00ec supremo\"). A shadowy figure appears\u2014one of the Grand Inquisitor's assassins\u2014and shoots Rodrigue in the chest. As he dies, Rodrigue tells Carlos that Elisabeth will meet him at Saint-Just the following day. He adds that he is content to die if his friend can save Flanders and rule over a happier Spain (Aria, part 2: \"Ah, je meurs, l'\u00e2me joyeuse\" / \"Io morr\u00f2, ma lieto in core\"). At that moment, the King enters, offering his son freedom, as Rodrigue had arranged. Carlos repulses him for having murdered Rodrigue. The King sees that Rodrigue is dead and cries out in sorrow.\n[Duet: Carlos and the King- \"Qui me rendra ce mort ?\" /\"Chi rende a me quest'uom\" It was cut before the premi\u00e8re and, following it, Verdi authorized its optional removal. The music was later re-used by Verdi for the Lacrimosa of his \"Messa da Requiem\" of 1874]\nBells ring as Elisabeth and Eboli enter. The crowd pushes its way into the prison and threatens the King, demanding the release of Carlos. In the confusion, Eboli escapes with Carlos. The people are brave enough at first in the presence of the King, but they are terrified by the arrival of the Grand Inquisitor, and instantly obey his angry command to quiet down and pay homage to the King.\n[After the premi\u00e8re, some productions ended this act with the death of Rodrigue. However, in 1883 Verdi provided a much shortened version of the insurrection, as he felt that otherwise it would not be clear how Eboli had fulfilled her promise to rescue Carlos]\n[This is Act 4 in the 1883 revision]\nAct 5.\n\"The moonlit monastery of Yuste\"\nElisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V. She is committed to help Don Carlos on his way to fulfill his destiny in Flanders, but she herself longs only for death (Aria: \"Toi qui sus le n\u00e9ant\" / \"Tu che le vanit\u00e0\"). Carlos appears and tells her that he has overcome his desire for her; he now loves her honorably, as a son loves his mother. They say a final farewell, promising to meet again in Heaven (Duet: \"Au revoir dans un monde o\u00f9 la vie est meilleure\" / \"Ma lass\u00f9 ci vedremo in un mondo migliore\").\n[This duet was twice revised by Verdi]\nThe King and the Grand Inquisitor enter, with several armed guards. The King infers that Carlos and Elisabeth have been lovers and demands that they both be immediately killed in a double sacrifice. The Inquisitor confirms that the Inquisition will do its duty. A short summary trial follows, confirming Carlos's putative culpability.\n[The trial was omitted in 1883 and does not occur on any commercially available audio recording, although it was performed at La Scala in 1978. It was performed in Vienna in 2004 and recorded on video.]\nCarlos, cries \"Ah, God will avenge me, this tribunal of blood, His hand will crush.\" Defending himself, Carlos retreats towards the tomb of Charles V. The gate opens, the Monk appears, draws Carlos into his arms, covers him with his coat and sings: \"My son, the pains of the earth still follow us in this place, the peace your heart hopes for is found only with God.\" The King and the Inquisitor recognize the Monk's voice: he is the King's father, Charles V, who was believed dead. As the curtain slowly falls, the Monk leads the distraught Carlos into the cloister to the chanting of monks in the chapel that \"Charles V, the august Emperor is naught but ash and dust.\" The opera concludes softly with pianissimo chords and tremolos played by the strings.\n[The ending was revised in 1883, with the Monk singing a tone higher. The score explicitly indicates he is Charles V with royal robe and crown, and the chanting of the monks is no longer sung, but \"thundered out as a brass chorale.\"]\nInstrumentation.\nExcept as noted, the instrumentation shown here is from the \"Edizione integrale\", second edition, edited by Ursula G\u00fcnther.\nCultural references.\nThe opera is the subject of the 1999 novel \"Score!\" by Jilly Cooper, which sets a murder mystery plot against the backdrop of a fictional film recording of the work.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources\nOther sources"}

Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket).\nOn a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full Earth orbit. For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies. Spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites. To date, only a handful of interstellar probes, such as \"Pioneer 10\" and \"11\", \"Voyager 1\" and \"2\", and \"New Horizons,\" are on trajectories that leave the Solar System.\nOrbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. Most are not. Recoverable spacecraft may be subdivided by a method of reentry to Earth into non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes. Recoverable spacecraft may be reusable (can be launched again or several times, like the SpaceX Dragon and the Space Shuttle orbiters) or expendable (like the Soyuz). In recent years, more space agencies are tending towards reusable spacecraft.\nHumanity has achieved space flight, but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches: Russia (Roscosmos), the United States (NASA), the member states of the European Space Agency, Japan (JAXA), China (CNSA), India (ISRO), Taiwan (TSA), Israel (ISA), Iran (ISA), and North Korea (NADA). In addition, several private companies have developed or are developing the technology for orbital launches independently from government agencies. Two prominent examples of such companies are SpaceX and Blue Origin.\nHistory.\nA German V-2, co-designed by Wernher von Braun, became the first spacecraft when it reached an altitude of 189\u00a0km in June 1944 in Peenem\u00fcnde, Germany. Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite. It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit (LEO) by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments; while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the Space Age. Apart from its value as a technological first, Sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layer's density, by measuring the satellite's orbital changes. It also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. Pressurized nitrogen in the satellite's false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection. Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at , taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002\u00a0MHz\nWhile Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other human-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100\u00a0km, which is the height required by the international organization F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale to count as a spaceflight. This altitude is called the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. In particular, in the 1940s there were several test launches of the V-2 rocket, some of which reached altitudes well over 100\u00a0km.\nCrewed and uncrewed spacecraft.\nCrewed spacecraft.\nAs of 2016, only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft: USSR/Russia, USA, and China.\nThe first crewed spacecraft was Vostok 1, which carried Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, and completed a full Earth orbit. There were five other crewed missions which used a Vostok spacecraft. The second crewed spacecraft was named \"Freedom 7\", and it performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying American astronaut Alan Shepard to an altitude of just over . There were five other crewed missions using Mercury spacecraft.\nOther Soviet crewed spacecraft include the Voskhod, Soyuz, flown uncrewed as Zond/L1, L3, TKS, and the Salyut and \"Mir\" crewed space stations. Other American crewed spacecraft include the Gemini spacecraft, the Apollo spacecraft including the Apollo Lunar Module, the Skylab space station, the Space Shuttle with undetached European Spacelab and private US Spacehab space stations-modules, and the SpaceX Crew Dragon configuration of their Dragon 2. US company Boeing also developed and flown a spacecraft of their own, the CST-100, commonly referred to as Starliner, but a crewed flight is yet to occur. China developed, but did not fly Shuguang, and is currently using Shenzhou (its first crewed mission was in 2003).\nExcept for the Space Shuttle and the Buran spaceplane of the Soviet Union, the latter of which only ever had one uncrewed test flight, all of the recoverable crewed orbital spacecraft were space capsules.\nThe International Space Station, crewed since November 2000, is a joint venture between Russia, the United States, Canada and several other countries.\nUncrewed spacecraft.\nUncrewed spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board. Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input; they may be remote controlled, remote guided or even autonomous, meaning they have a pre-programmed list of operations, which they will execute unless otherwise instructed.\nMany space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit. Multiple space probes were sent to study Moon, the planets, the Sun, multiple small Solar System bodies (comets and asteroids).\nSpecial class of uncrewed spacecraft is space telescopes, a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. The first operational telescopes were the American Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, OAO-2 launched in 1968, and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion (scintillation) of electromagnetic radiation which they observe, and avoid light pollution which ground-based observatories encounter. The best-known examples are Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope.\nCargo spacecraft are designed to carry cargo, possibly to support space stations' operation by transporting food, propellant and other supplies. Automated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station and Tiangong space station.\nOther.\nSome spacecrafts can operate as both a crewed and uncrewed spacecraft. For example, the Buran spaceplane could operate autonomously but also had manual controls, though it never flew with crew onboard.\nOther dual crewed/uncrewed spacecrafts include: SpaceX Dragon 2, Dream Chaser, and Tianzhou.\nTypes of spacecraft.\nCommunications satellite.\nA communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. Others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.\nThe high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth. The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points. Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or \"bands\" certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.\nCargo spacecraft.\nCargo or resupply spacecraft are robotic spacecraft that are designed specifically to carry cargo, possibly to support space stations' operation by transporting food, propellant and other supplies.\nAutomated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station and Tiangong space station.\nAs of 2023, three different cargo spacecraft are used to supply the International Space Station: Russian \"Progress\", American SpaceX Dragon 2 and Cygnus. Chinese \"Tianzhou\" is used to supply Tiangong space station.\nSpace probes.\nSpace probes are robotic spacecraft that are sent to explore deep space, or astronomical bodies other than Earth. They are distinguished from landers by the fact that they work in open space, not on planetary surfaces or in planetary atmospheres. Being robotic eliminates the need for expensive, heavy life-support systems (the Apollo crewed Moon landings required the use of the Saturn V rocket that cost over a billion dollars per launch, adjusted for inflation) and so allows for lighter, less expensive rockets. Space probes have visited every planet in the Solar System and Pluto, and the Parker Solar Probe has an orbit that, at its closest point, is in the Sun's chromosphere. There are five space probes that are escaping the Solar System, these are \"Voyager 1\", \"Voyager 2\", \"Pioneer 10\", \"Pioneer 11\", and \"New Horizons\".\nVoyager program.\nThe identical Voyager probes, weighing , were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a rare alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that would allow a spacecraft to visit all four planets in one mission, and get to each destination faster by using gravity assist. In fact, the rocket that launched the probes (the Titan IIIE) could not even send the probes to the orbit of Saturn, yet \"Voyager 1\" is travelling at roughly and \"Voyager 2\" moves at about kilometres per second as of 2023. In 2012, \"Voyager 1\" exited the heliosphere, followed by \"Voyager 2\" in 2018. \"Voyager 1\" actually launched 16 days after \"Voyager 2\" but it reached Jupiter sooner because \"Voyager 2\" was taking a longer route that allowed it to visit Uranus and Neptune, whereas \"Voyager 1\" did not visit Uranus or Neptune, instead choosing to fly past Saturn\u2019s satellite Titan. As of August 2023, \"Voyager 1\" has passed 160 astronomical units, which means it is over 160 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. This makes it the farthest spacecraft from the Sun. \"Voyager 2\" is 134 AU away from the Sun as of August 2023. NASA provides real time data of their distances and data from the probe\u2019s cosmic ray detectors. Because of the probe\u2019s declining power output and degradation of the RTGs over time, NASA has had to shut down certain instruments to conserve power. The probes may still have some scientific instruments on until the mid-2020s or perhaps the 2030s. After 2036, they will both be out of range of the Deep Space Network.\nSpace telescopes.\nA space telescope or space observatory is a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation which they observe, and avoid light pollution which ground-based observatories encounter. They are divided into two types: satellites which map the entire sky (astronomical survey), and satellites which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond. Space telescopes are distinct from Earth imaging satellites, which point toward Earth for satellite imaging, applied for weather analysis, espionage, and other types of information gathering.\nLanders.\nA lander is a type of spacecraft that makes a soft landing on the surface of an astronomical body other than Earth. Some landers, such as \"Philae\" and the Apollo Lunar Module, land entirely by using their fuel supply, however many landers (and landings of spacecraft on Earth) use aerobraking, especially for more distant destinations. This involves the spacecraft using a fuel burn to change its trajectory so it will pass through a planet (or a moon's) atmosphere. Drag caused by the spacecraft hitting the atmosphere enables it to slow down without using fuel, however this generates very high temperatures and so adds a requirement for a heat shield of some sort.\nSpace capsules.\nSpace capsules are a type of spacecraft that can return from space at least once. They have a blunt shape, do not usually contain much more fuel than needed, and they do not possess wings unlike spaceplanes. They are the simplest form of recoverable spacecraft, and so the most commonly used. The first such capsule was the Vostok capsule built by the Soviet Union, that carried the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin. Other examples include the Soyuz and Orion capsules, built by the Soviet Union and NASA, respectively.\nSpaceplanes.\nSpaceplanes are spacecraft that are built in the shape of, and function as, airplanes. The first example of such was the North American X-15 spaceplane, which conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over in the 1960s. This first reusable spacecraft was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963.\nThe first reusable orbital spaceplane was the Space Shuttle orbiter. The first orbiter to fly in space, the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\", was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. \"Enterprise\" was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 SCA and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was \"Columbia\", followed by \"Challenger\", \"Discovery\", \"Atlantis\", and \"Endeavour\". \"Endeavour\" was built to replace \"Challenger\" when it was lost in January 1986. \"Columbia\" broke up during reentry in February 2003.\nThe first autonomous reusable spaceplane was the \"Buran\"-class shuttle, launched by the USSR on November 15, 1988, although it made only one flight and this was uncrewed. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the U.S. Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran. The Space Shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry in case of necessity.\nPer the Vision for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 mainly due to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle's human transport role is to be replaced by SpaceX's SpaceX Dragon 2 and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. Dragon 2's first crewed flight occurred on May 30, 2020. The Shuttle's heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the Space Launch System and ULA's Vulcan rocket, as well as the commercial launch vehicles.\nScaled Composites' SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company built a successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic was planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2014, but was delayed after the crash of VSS \"Enterprise\".\nSpace Shuttle.\nThe Space Shuttle is a retired reusable Low Earth Orbital launch system. It consisted of two reusable Solid Rocket Boosters that landed by parachute, were recovered at sea, and were the most powerful rocket motors ever made until they were superseded by those of NASA\u2019s SLS rocket, with a liftoff thrust of , which soon increased to per booster, and were fueled by a combination of PBAN and APCP, the Space Shuttle Orbiter, with 3 RS-25 engines that used a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen propellant combination, and the bright orange throwaway Space Shuttle external tank from which the RS-25 engines sourced their fuel. The orbiter was a spaceplane that was launched at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Centre and landed mainly at the Shuttle Landing Facility, which is part of Kennedy Space Centre. A second launch site, Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 6 in California, was revamped so it could be used to launch the shuttles, but it was never used. The launch system could lift about into an eastward Low Earth Orbit. Each orbiter weighed roughly , however the different orbiters had differing weights and thus payloads, with \"Columbia\" being the heaviest orbiter, \"Challenger\" being lighter than \"Columbia but\" still heavier than the other three. The orbiter structure was mostly composed of aluminium alloy. The orbiter had seven seats for crew members, though on STS-61-A the launch took place with 8 crew onboard. The orbiters had wide by long payload bays and also were equipped with a CanadaArm1, an upgraded version of which is used on the International Space Station. The heat shield (or Thermal Protection System) of the orbiter, used to protect it from extreme levels of heat during atmospheric reentry and the cold of space, was made up of different materials depending on weight and how much heating a particular area on the shuttle would receive during reentry, which ranged from over to under . The orbiter was manually operated, though an autonomous landing system was added while the shuttle was still on service. It had an in orbit maneouvreing system known as the Orbital Manoeuvring System, which used the hypergolic propellants monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide, which was used for orbital insertion, changes to orbits and the deorbit burn.\nThough the shuttle\u2019s goals were to drastically decrease launch costs, it did not do so, ending up being much more expensive than similar expendable launchers. This was due to expensive refurbishment costs and the external tank being expended. Once a landing had occurred, the SRBs and many parts of the orbiter had to be disassembled for inspection, which was long and arduous. Furthermore, the RS-25 engines had to be replaced every few flights. Each of the heat shielding tiles had to go in one specific area on the orbiter, increasing complexity more. Adding to this, the shuttle was a rather dangerous system, with fragile heat shielding tiles, some being so fragile that one could easily scrape it off by hand, often having been damaged in many flights. After 30 years in service from 1981 to 2011 and 135 flights, the shuttle was retired from service due to the cost of maintaining the shuttles, and the 3 remaining orbiters (the other two were destroyed in accidents) were prepared to be displayed in museums.\nOther.\nSome spacecraft do not fit particularly well into any of the general spacecraft categories. This is a list of these spacecraft.\nSpaceX Starship.\nStarship is a spacecraft and second stage under development by American aerospace company SpaceX. Stacked atop its booster, Super Heavy, it composes the identically named Starship super heavy-lift space vehicle. The spacecraft is designed to transport both crew and cargo to a variety of destinations, including Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and potentially beyond. It is intended to enable long duration interplanetary flights for a crew of up to 100 people. It will also be capable of point-to-point transport on Earth, enabling travel to anywhere in the world in less than an hour. Furthermore, the spacecraft will be used to refuel other Starship vehicles to allow them to reach higher orbits to and other space destinations. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, estimated in a tweet that 8 launches would be needed to completely refuel a Starship in low Earth orbit, extrapolating this from Starship's payload to orbit and how much fuel a fully fueled Starship contains. To land on bodies without an atmosphere, such as the Moon, Starship will fire its engines and thrusters to slow down.\nMission Extension Vehicle.\nThe Mission Extension Vehicle is a robotic spacecraft designed to prolong the life on another spacecraft. It works by docking to its target spacecraft, then correcting its orientation or orbit. This also allows it to rescue a satellite which is in the wrong orbit by using its own fuel to move its target to the correct orbit. The project is currently managed by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. As of 2023, 2 have been launched. The first launched on a Proton rocket on 9 October 2019, and did a rendezvous with Intelsat-901 on 25 February 2020. It will remain with the satellite until 2025 before the satellite is moved to a final graveyard orbit and the vehicle does a rendezvous with another satellite. The other one launched on an Ariane 5 rocket on 15 August 2020.\nSubsystems.\nA spacecraft astrionics system comprises different subsystems, depending on the mission profile. Spacecraft subsystems are mounted in the satellite bus and may include attitude determination and control (variously called ADAC, ADC, or ACS), guidance, navigation and control (GNC or GN&amp;C), communications (comms), command and data handling (CDH or C&amp;DH), power (EPS), thermal control (TCS), propulsion, and structures. Attached to the bus are typically payloads.\n Spacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a life-support system for the crew.\n A spacecraft needs an attitude control subsystem to detumble, be correctly oriented in space and respond to external torques and forces properly. This may use reaction wheels or it may use small rocket thrusters. The attitude control subsystem consists of sensors and actuators, together with controlling algorithms. The attitude control subsystem permits proper pointing for the science objective, sun pointing for power to the solar arrays and Earth pointing for communications.\n Guidance refers to the calculation of the commands (usually done by the CDH subsystem) needed to steer the spacecraft where it is desired to be. Navigation means determining a spacecraft's orbital elements or position. Control means adjusting the path of the spacecraft to meet mission requirements.\n The C&amp;DH subsystem receives commands from the communications subsystem, performs validation and decoding of the commands, and distributes the commands to the appropriate spacecraft subsystems and components. The CDH also receives housekeeping data and science data from the other spacecraft subsystems and components, and packages the data for storage on a data recorder or transmission to the ground via the communications subsystem. Other functions of the CDH include maintaining the spacecraft clock and state-of-health monitoring.\n Spacecraft, both robotic and crewed, have various communications systems for communication with terrestrial stations and for inter-satellite service. Technologies include space radio station and optical communication. In addition, some spacecraft payloads are explicitly for the purpose of ground\u2013ground communication using receiver/retransmitter electronic technologies.\n Spacecraft need an electrical power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems. For spacecraft near the Sun, solar panels are frequently used to generate electrical power. Spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations, for example Jupiter, might employ a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to generate electrical power. Electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a power distribution unit over an electrical bus to other spacecraft components. Batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator, and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available, for example when a low Earth orbit spacecraft is eclipsed by Earth.\n Spacecraft must be engineered to withstand transit through Earth's atmosphere and the space environment. They must operate in a vacuum with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds of degrees Celsius as well as (if subject to reentry) in the presence of plasmas. Material requirements are such that either high melting temperature, low density materials such as beryllium and reinforced carbon\u2013carbon or (possibly due to the lower thickness requirements despite its high density) tungsten or ablative carbon\u2013carbon composites are used. Depending on mission profile, spacecraft may also need to operate on the surface of another planetary body. The thermal control subsystem can be passive, dependent on the selection of materials with specific radiative properties. Active thermal control makes use of electrical heaters and certain actuators such as louvers to control temperature ranges of equipments within specific ranges.\n Spacecraft may or may not have a propulsion subsystem, depending on whether or not the mission profile calls for propulsion. The \"Swift\" spacecraft is an example of a spacecraft that does not have a propulsion subsystem. Typically though, LEO spacecraft include a propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments (drag make-up maneuvers) and inclination adjustment maneuvers. A propulsion system is also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers. Components of a conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel, tankage, valves, pipes, and thrusters. The thermal control system interfaces with the propulsion subsystem by monitoring the temperature of those components, and by preheating tanks and thrusters in preparation for a spacecraft maneuver.\n Spacecraft must be engineered to withstand launch loads imparted by the launch vehicle, and must have a point of attachment for all the other subsystems. Depending on mission profile, the structural subsystem might need to withstand loads imparted by entry into the atmosphere of another planetary body, and landing on the surface of another planetary body.\n The payload depends on the mission of the spacecraft, and is typically regarded as the part of the spacecraft \"that pays the bills\". Typical payloads could include scientific instruments (cameras, telescopes, or particle detectors, for example), cargo, or a human crew.\n The ground segment is vital to the operation of the spacecraft. Typical components of a ground segment in use during normal operations include a mission operations facility where the flight operations team conducts the operations of the spacecraft, a data processing and storage facility, ground stations to radiate signals to and receive signals from the spacecraft, and a voice and data communications network to connect all mission elements.\n The launch vehicle propels the spacecraft from Earth's surface, through the atmosphere, and into an orbit, the exact orbit being dependent on the mission configuration. The launch vehicle may be expendable or reusable. In a single stage to orbit rocket, the rocket can be considered a spacecraft itself.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37913", "revid": "50910152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37913", "title": "Escape velocity", "text": "Concept in celestial mechanics\nIn celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape from contact with or orbit of a primary body, assuming:\nAlthough the term \"escape velocity\" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than as a velocity because it is independent of direction. Because gravitational force between two objects depends on their combined mass, the escape speed also depends on mass. For artificial satellites and small natural objects, the mass of the object makes a negligible contribution to the combined mass, and so is often ignored.\nEscape speed varies with distance from the center of the primary body, as does the velocity of an object traveling under the gravitational influence of the primary. If an object is in a circular or elliptical orbit, its speed is always less than the escape speed at its current distance. In contrast if it is on a hyperbolic trajectory its speed will always be higher than the escape speed at its current distance. (It will slow down as it gets to greater distance, but do so asymptotically approaching a positive speed.) An object on a parabolic trajectory will always be traveling exactly the escape speed at its current distance. It has precisely balanced positive kinetic energy and negative gravitational potential energy; it will always be slowing down, asymptotically approaching zero speed, but never quite stop.\nEscape velocity calculations are typically used to determine whether an object will remain in the gravitational sphere of influence of a given body. For example, in solar system exploration it is useful to know whether a probe will continue to orbit the Earth or escape to a heliocentric orbit. It is also useful to know how much a probe will need to slow down in order to be gravitationally captured by its destination body. Rockets do not have to reach escape velocity in a single maneuver, and objects can also use a gravity assist to siphon kinetic energy away from large bodies. \nPrecise trajectory calculations require taking into account small forces like atmospheric drag, radiation pressure, and solar wind. A rocket under continuous or intermittent thrust (or an object climbing a space elevator) can attain escape at any non-zero speed, but the minimum amount of energy required to do so is always the same.\nCalculation.\nEscape speed at a distance \"d\" from the center of a spherically symmetric primary body (such as a star or a planet) with mass \"M\" is given by the formula\n formula_1\nwhere:\nThe value \"GM\" is called the standard gravitational parameter, or \"\u03bc\", and is often known more accurately than either \"G\" or \"M\" separately.\nWhen given an initial speed \"V\" greater than the escape speed \"v\"e, the object will asymptotically approach the \"hyperbolic excess speed\" \"v\"\u221e, satisfying the equation:\n formula_2\nFor example, with the definitional value for standard gravity of , the escape velocity from Earth is . \nEnergy required.\nFor an object of mass formula_3 the energy required to escape a celestial body's gravitational field is \"GMm\"\u00a0/\u00a0\"r\", a function of the object's mass (where \"r\" is the radius of the planet, which for Earth is 6,371 kilometres (3,959\u00a0mi), \"G\" is the gravitational constant, and \"M\" is the mass of the planet, which for Earth is \"M\" \n 5.9736 \u00d7 1024 kg). A related quantity is the specific orbital energy which is essentially the sum of the kinetic and potential energy divided by the mass. An object has reached escape velocity when the specific orbital energy is greater than or equal to zero.\nConservation of energy.\nThe existence of escape velocity can be thought of as a consequence of conservation of energy and an energy field of finite depth. For an object with a given total energy, which is moving subject to conservative forces (such as a static gravity field) it is only possible for the object to reach combinations of locations and speeds which have that total energy; places which have a higher potential energy than this cannot be reached at all. Adding speed (kinetic energy) to an object expands the region of locations it can reach, until, with enough energy, everywhere to infinity becomes accessible.\nThe formula for escape velocity can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. For the sake of simplicity, unless stated otherwise, we assume that an object will escape the gravitational field of a uniform spherical planet by moving away from it and that the only significant force acting on the moving object is the planet's gravity. Imagine that a spaceship of mass \"m\" is initially at a distance \"r\" from the center of mass of the planet, whose mass is \"M\", and its initial speed is equal to its escape velocity, \"v\"e. At its final state, it will be an infinite distance away from the planet, and its speed will be negligibly small. Kinetic energy \"K\" and gravitational potential energy \"U\"g are the only types of energy that we will deal with (we will ignore the drag of the atmosphere), so by the conservation of energy,\n formula_4\nWe can set \"K\"final = 0 because final velocity is arbitrarily small, and \"U\"g\u200afinal = 0 because final gravitational potential energy is defined to be zero a long distance away from a planet, so\n formula_5\nRelativistic.\nThe same result is obtained by a relativistic calculation, in which case the variable \"r\" represents the \"radial coordinate\" or \"reduced circumference\" of the Schwarzschild metric.\nScenarios.\nFrom the surface of a body.\nAn alternative expression for the escape velocity \"v\"e particularly useful at the surface on the body is:\n formula_6\nwhere \"r\" is the distance between the center of the body and the point at which escape velocity is being calculated and \"g\" is the gravitational acceleration at that distance (i.e., the surface gravity).\nFor a body with a spherically symmetric distribution of mass, the escape velocity \"v\"e from the surface is proportional to the radius assuming constant density, and proportional to the square root of the average density \"\u03c1\".\n formula_7\nwhere formula_8.\nThis escape velocity is relative to a non-rotating frame of reference, not relative to the moving surface of the planet or moon, as explained below.\nFrom a rotating body.\nThe escape velocity \"relative to the surface\" of a rotating body depends on direction in which the escaping body travels. For example, as the Earth's rotational velocity is 465\u00a0m/s at the equator, a rocket launched tangentially from the Earth's equator to the east requires an initial velocity of about 10.735\u00a0km/s \"relative to the moving surface at the point of launch\" to escape whereas a rocket launched tangentially from the Earth's equator to the west requires an initial velocity of about 11.665\u00a0km/s \"relative to that moving surface\". The surface velocity decreases with the cosine of the geographic latitude, so space launch facilities are often located as close to the equator as feasible, e.g. the American Cape Canaveral (latitude 28\u00b028\u2032\u00a0N) and the French Guiana Space Centre (latitude 5\u00b014\u2032\u00a0N).\nPractical considerations.\nIn most situations it is impractical to achieve escape velocity almost instantly, because of the acceleration implied, and also because if there is an atmosphere, the hypersonic speeds involved (on Earth a speed of 11.2\u00a0km/s, or 40,320\u00a0km/h) would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by atmospheric drag. For an actual escape orbit, a spacecraft will accelerate steadily out of the atmosphere until it reaches the escape velocity appropriate for its altitude (which will be less than on the surface). In many cases, the spacecraft may be first placed in a parking orbit (e.g. a low Earth orbit at 160\u20132,000\u00a0km) and then accelerated to the escape velocity at that altitude, which will be slightly lower (about 11.0\u00a0km/s at a low Earth orbit of 200\u00a0km). The required additional change in speed, however, is far less because the spacecraft already has a significant orbital speed (in low Earth orbit speed is approximately 7.8\u00a0km/s, or 28,080\u00a0km/h).\nFor an orbiting body.\nThe escape velocity at a given height is formula_9 times the speed in a circular orbit at the same height, (compare this with the velocity equation in circular orbit). This corresponds to the fact that the potential energy with respect to infinity of an object in such an orbit is minus two times its kinetic energy, while to escape the sum of potential and kinetic energy needs to be at least zero. The velocity corresponding to the circular orbit is sometimes called the first cosmic velocity, whereas in this context the escape velocity is referred to as the second cosmic velocity.\nFor a body in an elliptical orbit wishing to accelerate to an escape orbit the required speed will vary, and will be greatest at periapsis when the body is closest to the central body. However, the orbital speed of the body will also be at its highest at this point, and the change in velocity required will be at its lowest, as explained by the Oberth effect.\nBarycentric escape velocity.\nEscape velocity can either be measured as relative to the other, central body or relative to center of mass or barycenter of the system of bodies. Thus for systems of two bodies, the term \"escape velocity\" can be ambiguous, but it is usually intended to mean the barycentric escape velocity of the less massive body. Escape velocity usually refers to the escape velocity of zero mass test particles. For zero mass test particles we have that the 'relative to the other' and the 'barycentric' escape velocities are the same, namely formula_10.\nBut when we can't neglect the smaller mass (say \"m\") we arrive at slightly different formulas.\nBecause the system has to obey the law of conservation of momentum we see that both the larger and the smaller mass must be accelerated in the gravitational field. Relative to the center of mass the velocity of the larger mass (\"v\"p, for planet) can be expressed in terms of the velocity of the smaller mass (\"v\"r, for rocket). We get formula_11.\nThe 'barycentric' escape velocity now becomes formula_12, while the 'relative to the other' escape velocity becomes formula_13.\nHeight of lower-velocity trajectories.\nIgnoring all factors other than the gravitational force between the body and the object, an object projected vertically at speed \"v\" from the surface of a spherical body with escape velocity \"v\"e and radius \"R\" will attain a maximum height \"h\" satisfying the equation\n formula_14\nwhich, solving for \"h\" results in\n formula_15\nwhere \"x\" = \"v\"/\"v\"e is the ratio of the original speed \"v\" to the escape velocity \"v\"e.\nUnlike escape velocity, the direction (vertically up) is important to achieve maximum height.\nTrajectory.\nIf an object attains exactly escape velocity, but is not directed straight away from the planet, then it will follow a curved path or trajectory. Although this trajectory does not form a closed shape, it can be referred to as an orbit. Assuming that gravity is the only significant force in the system, this object's speed at any point in the trajectory will be equal to the escape velocity \"at that point\" due to the conservation of energy, its total energy must always be 0, which implies that it always has escape velocity; see the derivation above. The shape of the trajectory will be a parabola whose focus is located at the center of mass of the planet. An actual escape requires a course with a trajectory that does not intersect with the planet, or its atmosphere, since this would cause the object to crash. When moving away from the source, this path is called an escape orbit. Escape orbits are known as \"C\"3 = 0 orbits. \"C\"3 is the characteristic energy, \u2212\"GM\"/2\"a\", where \"a\" is the semi-major axis length, which is infinite for parabolic trajectories.\nIf the body has a velocity greater than escape velocity then its path will form a hyperbolic trajectory and it will have an excess hyperbolic velocity, equivalent to the extra energy the body has. A relatively small extra delta-\"v\" above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed can result in a relatively large speed at infinity. Some orbital manoeuvres make use of this fact. For example, at a place where escape speed is 11.2\u00a0km/s, the addition of 0.4\u00a0km/s yields a hyperbolic excess speed of 3.02\u00a0km/s:\n formula_16\nIf a body in circular orbit (or at the periapsis of an elliptical orbit) accelerates along its direction of travel to escape velocity, the point of acceleration will form the periapsis of the escape trajectory. The eventual direction of travel will be at 90 degrees to the direction at the point of acceleration. If the body accelerates to beyond escape velocity the eventual direction of travel will be at a smaller angle, and indicated by one of the asymptotes of the hyperbolic trajectory it is now taking. This means the timing of the acceleration is critical if the intention is to escape in a particular direction.\nIf the speed at periapsis is v, then the eccentricity of the trajectory is given by:\n formula_17\nThis is valid for elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic trajectories. If the trajectory is hyperbolic or parabolic, it will asymptotically approach an angle formula_18 from the direction at periapsis, with\n formula_19\nThe speed will asymptotically approach\n formula_20\nList of escape velocities.\nIn this table, the left-hand half gives the escape velocity from the visible surface (which may be gaseous as with Jupiter for example), relative to the centre of the planet or moon (that is, not relative to its moving surface). In the right-hand half, \"V\"e refers to the speed relative to the central body (for example the sun).\nThe last column will depend precisely where in orbit escape velocity is reached, as the orbits are not exactly circular (particularly Mercury and Pluto).\nDeriving escape velocity using calculus.\nLet \"G\" be the gravitational constant and let \"M\" be the mass of the earth (or other gravitating body) and \"m\" be the mass of the escaping body or projectile. At a distance \"r\" from the centre of gravitation the body feels an attractive force\n formula_21\nThe work needed to move the body over a small distance \"dr\" against this force is therefore given by\n formula_22\nThe total work needed to move the body from the surface \"r\"0 of the gravitating body to infinity is then\n formula_23\nIn order to do this work to reach infinity, the body's minimal kinetic energy at departure must match this work, so the escape velocity \"v\"0 satisfies\n formula_24\nwhich results in\n formula_25\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37914", "revid": "724850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37914", "title": "Carmen", "text": "1875 opera by Georges Bizet\nCarmen () is an opera in four acts by the French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, based on the novella of the same title by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. The opera was first performed by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalised its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years. \"Carmen\" has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon; the \"Habanera\" and \"Seguidilla\" from act 1 and the \"Toreador Song\" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.\nThe opera is written in the genre of \"op\u00e9ra comique\" with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos\u00e9, a na\u00efve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. Jos\u00e9 abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo, after which Jos\u00e9 kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the murder of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.\nAfter the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. \"Carmen\" initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that \"Carmen\" forms the bridge between the tradition of \"op\u00e9ra comique\" and the realism or \"verismo\" that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.\nThe music of \"Carmen\" has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which the emotions and suffering of the characters are represented. At his death Bizet was still in the midst of revising his score, and because of other later changes (notably the introduction of recitatives composed by Ernest Guiraud in place of the original dialogue), there is still no definitive edition of the opera. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.\nBackground.\nIn the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital's two main state-funded opera houses\u2014the Op\u00e9ra and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique\u2014followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet's professional relationship with L\u00e9on Carvalho, manager of the independent Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, \"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\" (1863) and \"La jolie fille de Perth\" (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.\nWhen artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera \"Djamileh\" opened at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances, it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy would provide the libretto. Hal\u00e9vy, who had written the text for Bizet's student opera \"Le docteur Miracle\" (1856), was a cousin of Bizet's wife, Genevi\u00e8ve; he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach's operettas.\nBizet was delighted with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in \"the absolute certainty of having found my path\". The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's novella \"Carmen\". M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's story is a blend of travelogue and adventure yarn, possibly inspired by the writer's lengthy travels in Spain in 1830, and had originally been published in 1845 in the journal \"Revue des deux Mondes\". It may have been influenced in part by Alexander Pushkin's 1824 poem \"The Gypsies\", a work M\u00e9rim\u00e9e had translated into French; it has also been suggested that the story was developed from an incident told to M\u00e9rim\u00e9e by his friend the Countess Montijo. Bizet may first have encountered the story during his Rome sojourn of 1858\u201360, since his journals record M\u00e9rim\u00e9e as one of the writers whose works he absorbed in those years.\nInstrumentation.\nThe orchestration consists of two flutes (doubling piccolo), two oboes (the second doubling cor anglais), two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, harp, and strings. The percussion section consists of timpani, side drum, triangle, tambourine, cymbals, castanets, and bass drum. The orchestral complement for the premiere run was 62 or 57 musicians in total (depending on whether the pit trumpet and trombone players doubled off-stage music).\nPlace: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills\nTime: Around 1820\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"A square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse.\"\nA group of soldiers relax in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (\"Sur la place, chacun passe\"). Mica\u00ebla appears, seeking Jos\u00e9. Moral\u00e8s tells her that \"Jos\u00e9 is not yet on duty\" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. Jos\u00e9 arrives with the new guard, which is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (\"Avec la garde montante\").\nAs the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (\"La cloche a sonn\u00e9\"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don Jos\u00e9, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.\nAs the women go back to the factory, Mica\u00ebla returns and gives Jos\u00e9 a letter and a kiss from his mother (\"Parle-moi de ma m\u00e8re!\"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Mica\u00ebla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as Jos\u00e9 declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (\"Tra la la... Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\"); Zuniga orders Jos\u00e9 to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with Jos\u00e9, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover\u2014whoever that may be\u2014in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, Jos\u00e9 agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. Jos\u00e9 is arrested for dereliction of duty.\nAct 2.\n\"Lillas Pastia's Inn\"\nTwo months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are entertaining Zuniga and other officers (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\") in Pastia's inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of Jos\u00e9's release from two months' detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo (\"Vivat, vivat le Tor\u00e9ro\"). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the \"Toreador Song\" (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\") and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.\nWhen only Carmen, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remain, smugglers Danca\u00efre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband (\"Nous avons en t\u00eate une affaire\"). Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for Jos\u00e9. After the smugglers leave, Jos\u00e9 arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur... La la la\"), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When Jos\u00e9 says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square (\"La fleur que tu m'avais jet\u00e9e\"). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. Jos\u00e9 refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and Jos\u00e9 fight. Carmen summons her gypsy comrades, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, Jos\u00e9 now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers (\"Suis-nous \u00e0 travers la campagne\").\nAct 3.\n\"A wild spot in the mountains\"\nCarmen and Jos\u00e9 enter with the smugglers and their booty (\"\u00c9coute, \u00e9coute, compagnon\"); Carmen has now become bored with Jos\u00e9 and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and Jos\u00e9's. The smugglers depart to transport their goods while the women distract the local customs officers. Jos\u00e9 is left behind on guard duty.\nMica\u00ebla enters with a guide, seeking Jos\u00e9 and determined to rescue him from Carmen (\"Je dis que rien ne m'\u00e9pouvante\"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is Jos\u00e9, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. Jos\u00e9's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight (\"Je suis Escamillo, tor\u00e9ro de Grenade\"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls (\"Hol\u00e0, hol\u00e0 Jos\u00e9\"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Mica\u00ebla is discovered; at first, Jos\u00e9 will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. He departs, vowing he will return. Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.\nAct 4.\n\"A square in Seville. At the back, the walls of an ancient amphitheatre\"\nZuniga, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are among the crowd awaiting the arrival of the bullfighters (\"Les voici! Voici la quadrille!\"). Escamillo enters with Carmen, and they express their mutual love (\"Si tu m'aimes, Carmen\"). As Escamillo goes into the arena, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s warn Carmen that Jos\u00e9 is nearby, but Carmen is unafraid and willing to speak to him. Alone, she is confronted by the desperate Jos\u00e9 (\"C'est toi!\", \"C'est moi!\"). While he pleads vainly for her to return to him, cheers are heard from the arena. As Jos\u00e9 makes his last entreaty, Carmen contemptuously throws down the ring he gave her and attempts to enter the arena. He then stabs her, and as Escamillo is acclaimed by the crowds, Carmen dies. Jos\u00e9 kneels and sings \"Ah! Carmen! ma Carmen ador\u00e9e!\"; as the crowd exits the arena, Jos\u00e9 confesses to killing Carmen.\nCreation.\nWriting history.\nMeilhac and Hal\u00e9vy were a long-standing duo with an established division of labour: Meilhac, who was completely unmusical, wrote the dialogue and Hal\u00e9vy the verses. There is no clear indication of when work began on \"Carmen\". Bizet and the two librettists were all in Paris during 1873 and easily able to meet; thus there is little written record or correspondence relating to the beginning of the collaboration. The libretto was prepared in accordance with the conventions of \"op\u00e9ra comique\", with dialogue separating musical numbers. It deviates from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's novella in a number of significant respects. In the original, events are spread over a much longer period of time, and much of the main story is narrated by Jos\u00e9 from his prison cell, as he awaits execution for Carmen's murder. Mica\u00ebla does not feature in M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's version, and the Escamillo character is peripheral\u2014a picador named Lucas who is only briefly Carmen's grand passion. Carmen has a husband called Garcia, whom Jos\u00e9 kills during a quarrel. In the novella, Carmen and Jos\u00e9 are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera; Bizet's biographer Mina Curtiss comments that M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's Carmen, on stage, would have seemed \"an unmitigated and unconvincing monster, had her character not been simplified and deepened\".\nWith rehearsals due to begin in October 1873, Bizet began composing in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more. At that point, according to Bizet's biographer Winton Dean, \"some hitch at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique intervened\", and the project was suspended for a while. One reason for the delay may have been the difficulties in finding a singer for the title role. Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre, Camille du Locle and Adolphe de Leuven, over the advisability of staging the work. De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqu\u00e9 a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure audiences would be frightened away. He was assured by Hal\u00e9vy that the story would be toned down, that Carmen's character would be softened, and offset by Mica\u00ebla, described by Hal\u00e9vy as \"a very innocent, very chaste young girl\". Furthermore, the gypsies would be presented as comic characters, and Carmen's death would be overshadowed at the end by \"triumphal processions, ballets and joyous fanfares\". De Leuven reluctantly agreed, but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874.\nAfter the various delays, Bizet appears to have resumed work on \"Carmen\" early in 1874. He completed the draft of the composition\u20141,200 pages of music\u2014in the summer, which he spent at the artists' colony at Bougival, just outside Paris. He was pleased with the result, informing a friend: \"I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody.\" During the period of rehearsals, which began in October, Bizet repeatedly altered the music\u2014sometimes at the request of the orchestra who found some of it impossible to perform, sometimes to meet the demands of individual singers, and otherwise in response to the demands of the theatre's management. The vocal score that Bizet published in March 1875 shows significant changes from the version of the score he sold the publishers, Choudens, in January 1875; the conducting score used at the premiere differs from each of these documents. There is no definitive edition, and there are differences among musicologists about which version represents the composer's true intentions. Bizet also changed the libretto, reordering sequences and imposing his own verses where he felt the librettists had strayed too far from the character of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's original. Among other changes, he provided new words for Carmen's \"Habanera\", and rewrote the text of Carmen's solo in the act 3 card scene. He also provided a new opening line for the \"Seguidilla\" in act 1.\nCharacterisation.\nMost of the characters in \"Carmen\"\u2014the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Mica\u00ebla and Escamillo\u2014are reasonably familiar types within the \"op\u00e9ra comique\" tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, Jos\u00e9 and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of \"op\u00e9ra comique\". They are more akin to the \"verismo\" style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.\nDean considers that Jos\u00e9 is the central figure of the opera: \"It is his fate rather than Carmen's that interests us.\" The music characterises his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Mica\u00ebla; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, the result of his experiences as a prisoner, but it is clear that by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even when the door is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: \"He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he knows what to do.\"\nCarmen herself, says Dean, is a new type of operatic heroine representing a new kind of love, not the innocent kind associated with the \"spotless soprano\" school, but something altogether more vital and dangerous. Her capriciousness, fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented: \"She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music\". Curtiss suggests that Carmen's character, spiritually and musically, may be a realisation of the composer's own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage. Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to \"a female Don Giovanni. She would rather die than be false to herself.\" The dramatic personality of the character, and the range of moods she is required to express, call for exceptional acting and singing talents. This has deterred some of opera's most distinguished exponents; Maria Callas, though she recorded the part, never performed it on stage. The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that \"French opera never produced another \"femme\" as \"fatale\" as Carmen\", though she may have influenced some of Massenet's heroines. Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire, Richard Strauss's Salome and Alban Berg's Lulu \"may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet's temptress\".\nBizet was reportedly contemptuous of the music he wrote for Escamillo: \"Well, they asked for ordure, and they've got it\", he is said to have remarked about the toreador's song\u2014but, as Dean comments, \"the triteness lies in the character, not in the music\". Mica\u00ebla's music has been criticised for its \"Gounodesque\" elements, although Dean maintains that her music has greater vitality than that of any of Gounod's own heroines.\nPerformance history.\nAssembling the cast.\nThe search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in mid-1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, the Op\u00e9ra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to C\u00e9lestine Galli-Mari\u00e9, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Mari\u00e9, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.\nThe leading tenor part of Don Jos\u00e9 was given to Paul Lh\u00e9rie, a rising star of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of \"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\". Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in Gounod's \"Faust\" and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Mica\u00ebla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.\nPremiere and initial run.\nBecause rehearsals did not start until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a generally optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Mica\u00ebla's act 3 aria from him: \"That melody is mine!\" Hal\u00e9vy recorded his impressions of the premiere in a letter to a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Hal\u00e9vy noted, \"coldness\". In act 3 only Mica\u00ebla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was \"glacial from first to last\", and Bizet was left \"only with the consolations of a few friends\". The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Op\u00e9ra-Comique audience was \"shocked by the drastic realism of the action\" and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, \"Don't you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?\" In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: \"How happy you must be at this time\u2014it's a great success!\"\nThe general tone of the next day's press reviews ranged from disappointment to outrage. The more conservative critics complained about \"Wagnerism\" and the subordination of the voice to the noise of the orchestra. There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue; Galli-Mari\u00e9's interpretation of the role was described by one critic as \"the very incarnation of vice\". Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Op\u00e9ra-Comique repertoire of Auber and Boieldieu. L\u00e9on Escudier in \"L'Art Musical\" called \"Carmen\"'s music \"dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes.\" It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations, both of those who (given Hal\u00e9vy's and Meilhac's past associations) had expected something in the Offenbach mould, and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a Wagnerian music drama. Among the few supportive critics was the poet Th\u00e9odore de Banville; writing in \"Le National\", he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Op\u00e9ra-Comique \"puppets\".\nIn its initial run at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, \"Carmen\" provoked little public enthusiasm; it shared the theatre for a while with Verdi's much more popular \"Requiem\". \"Carmen\" was often performed to half-empty houses, even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets. Early on 3 June, the day after the opera's 33rd performance, Bizet died suddenly of heart disease, at the age of 36. It was his wedding anniversary. That night's performance was cancelled; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended. Du Locle brought \"Carmen\" back in November 1875, with the original cast, and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year's total for the original production of 48. Among those who attended one of these later performances was Tchaikovsky, who wrote to his benefactor, Nadezhda von Meck: \"\"Carmen\" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch.\" After the final performance, \"Carmen\" was not seen in Paris again until 1883.\nEarly revivals.\nShortly before his death Bizet signed a contract for a production of \"Carmen\" by the Vienna Court Opera. For this version, first staged on 23 October 1875, Bizet's friend Ernest Guiraud replaced the original dialogue with recitatives, to create a \"grand opera\" format. Guiraud also reorchestrated music from Bizet's \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne suite\" to provide a spectacular ballet for \"Carmen\"'s second act. Shortly before the initial Vienna performance, the Court Opera's director Franz von Jauner decided to use parts of the original dialogue along with some of Guiraud's recitatives; this hybrid and the full recitative version became the norms for productions of the opera outside France for most of the next century.\nDespite its deviations from Bizet's original format, and some critical reservations, the 1875 Vienna production was a great success with the city's public. It also won praise from both Wagner and Brahms. The latter reportedly saw the opera twenty times, and said he would have \"gone to the ends of the earth to embrace Bizet\". The Viennese triumph began the opera's rapid ascent towards worldwide fame. In February 1876 it began a run in Brussels at La Monnaie; it returned there the following year, with Galli-Mari\u00e9 in the title role, and thereafter became a permanent fixture in the Brussels repertory. On 17 June 1878 \"Carmen\" was produced in London, at Her Majesty's Theatre, where Minnie Hauk began her long association with the part of Carmen. A parallel London production at Covent Garden, with Adelina Patti, was cancelled when Patti withdrew. The successful Her Majesty's production, sung in Italian, had an equally enthusiastic reception in Dublin. On 23 October 1878 the opera received its American premiere, at the New York Academy of Music, and in the same year was introduced to Saint Petersburg.\nIn the following five years performances were given in numerous American and European cities. The opera found particular favour in Germany, where the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, apparently saw it on 27 different occasions and where Friedrich Nietzsche opined that he \"became a better man when Bizet speaks to me\". \"Carmen\" was also acclaimed in numerous French provincial cities including Marseille, Lyon and, in 1881, Dieppe, where Galli-Mari\u00e9 returned to the role. In August 1881 the singer wrote to Bizet's widow to report that \"Carmen\"'s Spanish premiere, in Barcelona, had been \"another great success\". But Carvalho, who had assumed the management of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, thought the work immoral and refused to reinstate it. Meilhac and H\u00e1levy were more prepared to countenance a revival, provided that Galli-Mari\u00e9 had no part in it; they blamed her interpretation for the relative failure of the opening run.\nIn April 1883 Carvalho finally revived \"Carmen\" at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, with Ad\u00e8le Isaac featuring in an under-rehearsed production that removed some of the controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come to be regarded as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Mari\u00e9, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.\nWorldwide success.\nOn 9 January 1884, \"Carmen\" was given its first New York Metropolitan Opera performance, to a mixed critical reception. \"The New York Times\" welcomed Bizet's \"pretty and effective work\", but compared Zelia Trebelli's interpretation of the title role unfavourably with that of Minnie Hauk. Thereafter \"Carmen\" was quickly incorporated into the Met's regular repertory. In February 1906 Enrico Caruso sang Jos\u00e9 at the Met for the first time; he continued to perform in this role until 1919, two years before his death. On 17 April 1906, on tour with the Met, he sang the role at the Grand Opera House in San Francisco. Afterwards he sat up until 3 am reading the reviews in the early editions of the following day's papers. Two hours later he was awakened by the first violent shocks of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, after which he and his fellow performers made a hurried escape from the Palace Hotel.\nThe popularity of \"Carmen\" continued through succeeding generations of American opera-goers; by the beginning of 2011 the Met alone had performed it almost a thousand times. It enjoyed similar success in other American cities and in all parts of the world, in many different languages. Carmen's habanera from act 1, and the toreador's song \"Votre toast\" from act 2, are among the most popular and best-known of all operatic arias, the latter \"a splendid piece of swagger\" according to Newman, \"against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain\". Most of the productions outside France followed the example created in Vienna and incorporated lavish ballet interludes and other spectacles, a practice which Mahler abandoned in Vienna when he revived the work there in 1900. In 1919, Bizet's aged contemporary Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns was still complaining about the \"strange idea\" of adding a ballet, which he considered \"a hideous blemish in that masterpiece\", and he wondered why Bizet's wife had permitted it.\nAt the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, after its 1883 revival, \"Carmen\" was always presented in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, the year of the 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.\nDean has commented on the dramatic distortions that arise from the suppression of the dialogue; the effect, he says, is that the action moves forward \"in a series of jerks, rather instead of by smooth transition\", and that most of the minor characters are substantially diminished. Only late in the 20th century did dialogue versions become common in opera houses outside France, but there is still no universally recognised full score. Fritz Oeser's 1964 edition is an attempt to fill this gap, but in Dean's view is unsatisfactory. Oeser reintroduces material removed by Bizet during the first rehearsals, and ignores many of the late changes and improvements that the composer made immediately before the first performance; he thus, according to Susan McClary, \"inadvertently preserves as definitive an early draft of the opera\". In the early 21st century new editions were prepared by Robert Didion and Richard Langham-Smith, published by Schott and Peters respectively. Each departs significantly from Bizet's vocal score of March 1875, published during his lifetime after he had personally corrected the proofs; Dean believes this vocal score should be the basis of any standard edition. Lesley Wright, a contemporary Bizet scholar, remarks that, unlike his compatriots Rameau and Debussy, Bizet has not been accorded a critical edition of his principal works; should this transpire, she says, \"we might expect yet another scholar to attempt to refine the details of this vibrant score which has so fascinated the public and performers for more than a century.\" Meanwhile, \"Carmen\"'s popularity endures; according to Macdonald: \"The memorability of Bizet's tunes will keep the music of Carmen alive in perpetuity,\" and its status as a popular classic is unchallenged by any other French opera.\nMusic.\nHerv\u00e9 Lacombe, in his survey of 19th-century French opera, contends that \"Carmen\" is one of the few works from that large repertory to have stood the test of time. While he places the opera firmly within the long \"op\u00e9ra comique\" tradition, Macdonald considers that it transcends the genre and that its immortality is assured by \"the combination in abundance of striking melody, deft harmony and perfectly judged orchestration\". Dean sees Bizet's principal achievement in the demonstration of the main actions of the opera in the music, rather than in the dialogue, writing that \"Few artists have expressed so vividly the torments inflicted by sexual passions and jealousy.\" Dean places Bizet's realism in a different category from the \"verismo\" of Puccini and others; he likens the composer to Mozart and Verdi in his ability to engage his audiences with the emotions and sufferings of his characters.\nBizet, who had never visited Spain, sought out appropriate ethnic material to provide an authentic Spanish flavour to his music. Carmen's habanera is based on an idiomatic song, \"El arreglito\", by the Spanish composer Sebasti\u00e1n Yradier (1809\u201365). Bizet had taken this to be a genuine folk melody; when he learned its recent origin he added a note to the vocal score, crediting Yradier. He used a genuine folksong as the source of Carmen's defiant \"Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\" while other parts of the score, notably the \"Seguidilla\", utilise the rhythms and instrumentation associated with flamenco music. However, Dean insists that \"[t]his is a French, not a Spanish opera\"; the \"foreign bodies\", while they undoubtedly contribute to the unique atmosphere of the opera, form only a small ingredient of the complete music.\nThe prelude to act 1 combines three recurrent themes: the entry of the bullfighters from act 4, the refrain from the Toreador Song from act 2, and the motif that, in two slightly differing forms, represents both Carmen herself and the fate she personifies. This motif, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of the changing of the guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen's entrance. After her provocative habanera, with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key, the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to Jos\u00e9 before departing. This action elicits from Jos\u00e9 a passionate A major solo which Dean suggests is the turning-point in his musical characterisation. The softer vein returns briefly, as Mica\u00ebla reappears and joins with Jos\u00e9 in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment. The tranquillity is shattered by the women's noisy quarrel, Carmen's dramatic re-entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga. After her beguiling \"Seguidilla\" provokes Jos\u00e9 to an exasperated high A sharp shout, Carmen's escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera. Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect.\nAct 2 begins with a short prelude, based on a melody that Jos\u00e9 will sing offstage before his next entry. A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo's tumultuous entrance, in which brass and percussion provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along. The quintet that follows is described by Newman as \"of incomparable verve and musical wit\". Jos\u00e9's appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene; Carmen sings, dances and plays the castanets; a distant cornet-call summoning Jos\u00e9 to duty is blended with Carmen's melody so as to be barely discernible. A muted reference to the fate motif on an English horn leads to Jos\u00e9's \"Flower Song\", a flowing continuous melody that ends \"pianissimo\" on a sustained high B-flat. Jos\u00e9's insistence that, despite Carmen's blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and Jos\u00e9's unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.\nThe prelude to act 3 was originally intended for Bizet's \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\" score. Newman describes it as \"an exquisite miniature, with much dialoguing and intertwining between the woodwind instruments\". As the action unfolds, the tension between Carmen and Jos\u00e9 is evident in the music. In the card scene, the lively duet for Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s turns ominous when Carmen intervenes; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death. Mica\u00ebla's aria, after her entry in search of Jos\u00e9, is a conventional piece, though of deep feeling, preceded and concluded by horn calls. The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and Jos\u00e9, now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen's favour. The music reflects their contrasting attitudes: Escamillo remains, says Newman, \"invincibly polite and ironic\", while Jos\u00e9 is sullen and aggressive. When Mica\u00ebla pleads with Jos\u00e9 to go with her to his mother, the harshness of Carmen's music reveals her most unsympathetic side. As Jos\u00e9 departs, vowing to return, the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind. The confident, off-stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador's refrain provides a distinct contrast to Jos\u00e9's increasing desperation.\nThe final act is prefaced with a lively orchestral piece derived from Manuel Garc\u00eda's short operetta \"El criado fingido\". After the opening crowd scene, the bullfighters' march is led by the children's chorus; the crowd hails Escamillo before his short love scene with Carmen. The long finale, in which Jos\u00e9 makes his last pleas to Carmen and is decisively rejected, is punctuated at critical moments by enthusiastic off-stage shouts from the bullfighting arena. As Jos\u00e9 kills Carmen, the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off-stage; the fate motif, which has been suggestively present at various points during the act, is heard fortissimo, together with a brief reference to Carmen's card scene music. Jose's last words of love and despair are followed by a final long chord, on which the curtain falls without further musical or vocal comment.\nMusical numbers.\nNumbers are from the vocal score (English version) printed by G. Schirmer Inc., New York, 1958 from Guiraud's 1875 arrangement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRecordings.\n\"Carmen\" has been the subject of many recordings, beginning with early wax cylinder recordings of excerpts in the 1890s, a nearly complete performance in German from 1908 with Emmy Destinn in the title role, and a complete 1911 Op\u00e9ra-Comique recording in French. Since then, many of the leading opera houses and artistes have recorded the work, in both studio and live performances. Over the years many versions have been commended and reissued. From the mid-1990s numerous video recordings have become available. These include David McVicar's Glyndebourne production of 2002, and the Royal Opera productions of 2007 and 2010, each designed by Francesca Zambello.\nAdaptations.\nIn 1883, the Spanish violinist and composer Pablo de Sarasate wrote a \"Carmen Fantasy\" for violin, described as \"ingenious and technically difficult\". Ferruccio Busoni's 1920 piece, Piano Sonatina No. 6 (Fantasia da camera super Carmen), is based on themes from \"Carmen\". The Russian pianist Vladimir Horowitz played his \"Variations on a Theme from \"Carmen\"\" (1926) throughout his career. In 1967, the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin adapted parts of the \"Carmen\" music into a ballet, the \"Carmen Suite\", written for his wife Maya Plisetskaya, then the Bolshoi Ballet's principal ballerina.\nIn 1983 the stage director Peter Brook produced an adaptation of Bizet's opera known as \"La Tragedie de Carmen\" in collaboration with the writer Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and the composer Marius Constant. This 90-minute version focused on four main characters, eliminating choruses and the major arias were reworked for chamber orchestra. Brook first produced it in Paris, and it has since been performed in many cities.\nThe character \"Carmen\" has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema. The films were made in various languages and interpreted by several cultures, and have been created by prominent directors including Gerolamo Lo Savio (1909), Raoul Walsh (1915) with Theda Bara, Cecil B. DeMille (1915), and \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948) with Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, directed by Charles Vidor. Otto Preminger's 1954 \"Carmen Jones\", with an all-black cast, is based on the 1943 Oscar Hammerstein Broadway musical of the same name, an adaptation of the opera transposed to 1940s North Carolina extending to Chicago. \"The Wild, Wild Rose\" is a 1960 Hong Kong film which adapts the plot and main character to the setting of a Wanchai nightclub, including renditions of some of the most famous songs by Grace Chang. Other adaptions include Carlos Saura (1983) (who made a flamenco-based dance film with two levels of story telling), Peter Brook (1983) (filming his compressed \"La Trag\u00e9die de Carmen\") and Jean-Luc Godard (1984). Francesco Rosi's film of 1984, with Julia Migenes and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, is generally faithful to the original story and to Bizet's music. \"Carmen on Ice\" (1990), starring Katarina Witt, Brian Boitano and Brian Orser, was inspired by Witt's gold medal-winning performance during the 1988 Winter Olympics. Robert Townsend's 2001 film, \"\", starring Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, is a more recent attempt to create an African-American version. \"Carmen\" was interpreted in modern ballet by the South African dancer and choreographer Dada Masilo in 2010.\nThe opera has been adapted at least twice in African films, as \"Karmen Ge\u00ef\", directed by Joseph Ga\u00ef Ramaka in 2001, and \"U-Carmen eKhayelitsha\", directed by Mark Dornford-May in 2005, and achieving the Golden Bear award of the Berlinale that year.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the longest opera commonly performed, taking nearly four and a half hours, not counting two breaks between acts, and is traditionally not cut. With Hans von B\u00fclow conducting, it was first performed on 21 June 1868 at the National Theater in Munich, today home of Bavarian State Opera.\nThe story is set in Nuremberg in the mid-16th century. At the time, Nuremberg was a free imperial city and one of the centers of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. The story revolves around the city's guild of \"Meistersinger\" (Master Singers), an association of amateur poets and musicians who were primarily master craftsmen of various trades. The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making, with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs. The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild. One of the main characters, the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs, is based on a historical figure, Hans Sachs (1494\u20131576), the most famous of the master-singers.\n\"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas (he had come to reject his early \"Das Liebesverbot\") and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events feature. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet.\nThe autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.\nComposition history.\nWagner's autobiography (\"My Life\") described the genesis of . Taking the waters at Marienbad in 1845 he began reading Georg Gottfried Gervinus' \"Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung\" (History of German Poetry). This work included chapters on master song and on Hans Sachs.\nI had formed a particularly vivid picture of Hans Sachs and the mastersingers of Nuremberg. I was especially intrigued by the institution of the Marker and his function in rating master-songs ... I conceived during a walk a comic scene in which the popular artisan-poet, by hammering upon his cobbler's last, gives the Marker, who is obliged by circumstances to sing in his presence, his come-uppance for previous pedantic misdeeds during official singing contests, by inflicting upon him a lesson of his own.\nGervinus' book also mentions a poem by the real-life Hans Sachs on the subject of Protestant reformer Martin Luther, called \"Die Wittenbergisch Nachtigall\" (The Wittenberg Nightingale). The opening lines for this poem, addressing the Reformation, were later used by Wagner in Act III Scene 5 when the crowd acclaims Sachs: \"\" (Awake, the dawn is drawing near; I hear, singing in the green grove, a blissful nightingale)\nIn addition to this, Wagner added a scene drawn from his own life, in which a case of mistaken identity led to a near-riot: this was to be the basis for the finale of Act II.\nOut of this situation evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable growth in the number of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to me as if the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.\nThis first draft of the story was dated \"Marienbad 16 July 1845\". Wagner later said, in \"Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde\" (1851) (A Communication to my Friends) that was to be a comic opera to follow a tragic opera, i.e. \"Tannh\u00e4user\". Just as the Athenians had followed a tragedy with a comic satyr play, so Wagner would follow with : the link being that both operas included song-contests.\nInfluence of Schopenhauer.\nIn 1854, Wagner first read Schopenhauer, and was struck by the philosopher's theories on aesthetics. In this philosophy, art is a means for escaping from the sufferings of the world, and music is the highest of the arts since it is the only one not involved in representation of the world (i.e. it is abstract). It is for this reason that music can communicate emotion without the need for words. In his earlier essay \"Oper und Drama\" (Opera and Drama) (1850\u20131) Wagner had derided staples of operatic construction: arias, choruses, duets, trios, recitatives, etc. As a result of reading Schopenhauer's ideas about the role of music, Wagner re-evaluated his prescription for opera, and included many of these elements in .\nAlthough is a comedy, it also elucidates Wagner's ideas on the place of music in society, on renunciation of \"Wille\" (Will), and on the solace that music can bring in a world full of (delusion, folly, self-deception). It is which causes the riot in Act II \u2013 a sequence of events arising from a case of mistaken identity, which can be seen as a form of self-delusion. Commentators have observed that in his famous Act III monologue (Madness! Madness!, Everywhere madness!), Sachs paraphrases Schopenhauer's description of the way that drives a person to behave in ways that are self-destructive:\n&lt;poem lang=\"de\" style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\"&gt;in Flucht geschlagen, w\u00e4hnt er zu jagen; h\u00f6rt nicht sein eigen Schmerzgekreisch,\nwenn er sich w\u00fchlt ins eig'ne Fleisch, w\u00e4hnt Lust sich zu erzeigen!&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:1em; float:left;\"&gt;driven into flight he believes he is hunting, and does not hear his own cry of pain:\nwhen he tears into his own flesh, he imagines he is giving himself pleasure!&lt;/poem&gt;\nFollowing the completion of \"Tristan und Isolde\", Wagner resumed work on in 1861 with a quite different philosophical outlook from that which he held when he developed his first draft. The character of Hans Sachs became one of the most Schopenhauerian of Wagner's creations. Wagner scholar Lucy Beckett has noted the remarkable similarity between Wagner's Sachs and Schopenhauer's description of the noble man:\nWe always picture a very noble character to ourselves as having a certain trace of silent sadness... It is a consciousness that has resulted from knowledge of the vanity of all achievements and of the suffering of all life, not merely of one's own. (Schopenhauer: \"The World as Will and Representation\")\nThe other distinctive manifestation of Sachs's character \u2013 his calm renunciation of the prospect of becoming a suitor for Eva's love \u2013 is also deeply Schopenhauerian. Sachs here denies the Will in its supposedly most insistent form, that of sexual love. Wagner marks this moment with a direct musical and textual reference to \"Tristan und Isolde\": (\"My child, I know a sad tale of Tristan and Isolde. Hans Sachs was clever and did not want anything of King Marke's lot.\")\nCompletion and premiere.\nHaving completed the scenario, Wagner began writing the libretto while living in Paris in 1862, and followed this by composing the overture. The overture was publicly performed in Leipzig on 2 November 1862, conducted by the composer. Composition of Act I was begun in spring of 1863 in the Viennese suburb of Penzing, but the opera in its entirety was not finished until October 1867, when Wagner was living at Tribschen near Lucerne. These years were some of Wagner's most difficult: the 1861 Paris production of \"Tannh\u00e4user\" was a fiasco, Wagner gave up hope of completing \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", the 1864 Vienna production of \"Tristan und Isolde\" was abandoned after 77 rehearsals, and finally in 1866 Wagner's first wife, Minna, died. Cosima Wagner was later to write: \"When future generations seek refreshment in this unique work, may they spare a thought for the tears from which the smiles arose.\"\nThe premiere was given at the K\u00f6nigliches Hof- und National-Theater, Munich, on 21 June 1868. The production was sponsored by Ludwig II of Bavaria and the conductor was Hans von B\u00fclow. Franz Strauss, the father of the composer Richard Strauss, played the French horn at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner's frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner's most successful works. At the end of the first performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner bowed to the crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch could address an audience from the box.\nInstrumentation.\n is scored for the following instruments:\n\"on-stage\"\nSynopsis.\n\"Nuremberg, towards the middle of the sixteenth century.\"\nAct 1.\nPrelude\n\"Scene 1: Interior of Katharinenkirche (St. Catherine's Church) in Nuremberg, Saint John's Eve or Midsummer's Eve, June 23\"\nAfter the prelude, a church service is just ending with a singing of \"Da zu dir der Heiland kam\" (When the Saviour came to thee), an impressive pastiche of a Lutheran chorale, as Walther von Stolzing, a young knight from Franconia, addresses Eva Pogner, whom he had met earlier, and asks her if she is engaged to anyone. Eva and Walther have fallen in love at first sight, but she informs him that her father, the goldsmith and mastersinger Veit Pogner, has arranged to give her hand in marriage to the winner of the guild's song contest on Saint John's Day (Midsummer's Day), tomorrow. Eva's maid, Magdalena, gets David, Hans Sachs's apprentice, to tell Walther about the mastersingers' art. The hope is for Walther to qualify as a mastersinger during the guild meeting, traditionally held in the church after Mass, and thus earn a place in the song contest despite his utter ignorance of the master-guild's rules and conventions.\n\"Scene 2\"\nAs the other apprentices set up the church for the meeting, David warns Walther that it is not easy to become a mastersinger; it takes many years of learning and practice. David gives a confusing lecture on the mastersingers' rules for composing and singing. (Many of the tunes he describes were real master-tunes from the period.) Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for a place in the guild anyway.\n\"Scene 3\"\nThe first mastersingers file into the church, including Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner and the town clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for the winner of the song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is rejected by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the master guild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the \"Marker\" of the guild for worldly matters. At the signal to begin (\"Fanget an!\"), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (\"So rief der Lenz in den Wald\"), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that there is no point in finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his voice over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.\nAct 2.\n\"Evening. On the street corner by Pogner's and Sachs's houses. A linden tree (tilia or lime-tree or basswood) stands outside Pogner's house, a \"Flieder\"-tree (syringa or lilac-tree) before Sachs's. Apprentices are closing the shutters.\"\n\"Scene 1\"\nThe apprentices sing joyfully about St. John's Day, also called Midsummer Day, and its accompanying garlands of flowers and ribbons (\"Johannistag! Johannistag!\"). David informs Magdalena of Walther's failure. In her disappointment, Magdalena leaves without giving David the food she had brought for him. This arouses the derision of the other apprentices, and David is about to turn on them when Sachs arrives and hustles his apprentice into the workshop.\n\"Scene 2\"\nPogner arrives with Eva, engaging in a roundabout conversation: Eva is hesitant to ask about the outcome of Walther's application, and Pogner has private doubts about whether it was wise to offer his daughter's hand in marriage for the song contest. As they enter their house, Magdalena appears and tells Eva about the rumours of Walther's failure. Eva decides to ask Sachs about the matter.\n\"Scene 3\"\nAs twilight falls, Hans Sachs takes a seat in front of his house to work on new shoes for Beckmesser. He muses about Walther's song, which has made a deep impression on him (\"Was duftet doch der Flieder\", known as the Flieder Monologue).\n\"Scene 4\"\nEva approaches Sachs, and they discuss tomorrow's song contest. Eva is unenthusiastic about Beckmesser, who appears to be the only eligible contestant. She hints that she would not mind if Sachs, a widower, were to win the contest. Though touched, Sachs protests that he would be too old a husband for her. Upon further prompting, Sachs describes Walther's failure at the guild meeting. This causes Eva to storm off angrily, confirming Sachs's suspicion that she has fallen in love with Walther. Eva is intercepted by Magdalena, who informs her that Beckmesser is coming to serenade her. Eva, determined to search for Walther, tells Magdalena to pose as her (Eva) at the bedroom window.\n\"Scene 5\"\nJust as Eva is about to leave, Walther appears. He tells her that he has been rejected by the mastersingers, and the two prepare to elope. However, Sachs has overheard their plans. As they are passing by, he illuminates the street with his lantern, forcing them to hide in the shadow of Pogner's house. Walther makes up his mind to confront Sachs, but is interrupted by the arrival of Beckmesser.\n\"Scene 6\"\nAs Eva and Walther retreat further into the shadows, Beckmesser begins his serenade. Sachs interrupts him by launching into a full-bellied cobbling song, and hammering the soles of the half-made shoes. Annoyed, Beckmesser tells Sachs to stop, but the cobbler replies that he has to finish tempering the soles of the shoes, whose lateness Beckmesser had publicly complained about (in Act I). Sachs offers a compromise: he will be quiet and let Beckmesser sing, but he (Sachs) will be Beckmesser's \"marker\", and mark each of Beckmesser's musical/poetical errors by striking one of the soles with his hammer. Beckmesser, who has spotted someone at Eva's window (Magdalena in disguise), has no time to argue. He tries to sing his serenade, but he makes so many mistakes (his tune repeatedly places accents on the wrong syllables of the words) that from the repeated knocks Sachs finishes the shoes. David wakes up and sees Beckmesser apparently serenading Magdalena. He attacks Beckmesser in a fit of jealous rage. The entire neighborhood is awakened by the noise. The other apprentices rush into the fray, and the situation degenerates into a full-blown riot. In the confusion, Walther tries to escape with Eva, but Sachs pushes Eva into her home and drags Walther into his own workshop. Quiet is restored as abruptly as it was broken. A lone figure walks through the street \u2013 the nightwatchman, calling out the hour.\nAct 3.\nPrelude, a meditative orchestral introduction using music from two key episodes to be heard in act 3: Sachs's scene 1 monologue \"Wahn! Wahn!\" and the \"Wittenberg Nightingale\" quasi-chorale sung by the townspeople to greet Sachs in scene 5.\n\"Scene 1: Sachs's workshop\"\nAs morning dawns, Sachs is reading a large book. Lost in thought, he does not respond as David returns from delivering Beckmesser's shoes. David finally manages to attract his master's attention, and they discuss the upcoming festivities \u2013 it is Saint John's day, Hans Sachs's name day. David recites his verses for Sachs, and leaves to prepare for the festival. Alone, Sachs ponders last night's riot. \"Madness! Madness! Everywhere madness!\" (\"Wahn! Wahn! \u00dcberall Wahn!\") His attempt to prevent an elopement had ended in shocking violence. Nevertheless, he is resolved to make madness work for him today.\n\"Scene 2\"\nSachs gives Walther an interactive lesson on the history and philosophy of music and mastersinging, and teaches him to moderate his singing according to the spirit (if not the strict letter) of the masters' rules. Walther demonstrates his understanding by composing two sections of a new Prize Song in a more acceptable style than his previous effort from Act I. Sachs writes down the new verses as Walther sings them. A final section remains to be composed, but Walther postpones the task. The two men leave the room to dress for the festival.\n\"Scene 3\"\nBeckmesser, still sore from his drubbing the night before, enters the workshop. He spots the verses of the Prize Song, written in Sachs's handwriting, and infers (erroneously) that Sachs is secretly planning to enter the contest for Eva's hand. The cobbler re-enters the room and Beckmesser confronts him with the verses and asks if he wrote them. Sachs confirms that the handwriting is his, but does not clarify that he was not the author but merely served as scribe. However, he goes on to say that he has no intention of wooing Eva or entering the contest, and he presents the manuscript to Beckmesser as a gift. He promises never to claim the song for his own, and warns Beckmesser that it is a very difficult song to interpret and sing. Beckmesser, his confidence restored by the prospect of using verses written by the famous Hans Sachs, ignores the warning and rushes off to prepare for the song contest. Sachs smiles at Beckmesser's foolishness but expresses hope that Beckmesser will learn to be better in the future.\n\"Scene 4\"\nEva arrives at the workshop. She is looking for Walther, but pretends to have complaints about a shoe that Sachs made for her. Sachs realizes that the shoe is a perfect fit, but pretends to set about altering the stitching. As he works, he tells Eva that he has just heard a beautiful song, lacking only an ending. Eva cries out as Walther enters the room, splendidly attired for the festival, and sings the third and final section of the Prize Song. The couple are overwhelmed with gratitude for Sachs, and Eva asks Sachs to forgive her for having manipulated his feelings. The cobbler brushes them off with bantering complaints about his lot as a shoemaker, poet, and widower. At last, however, he admits to Eva that, despite his feelings for her, he is resolved to avoid the fate of King Marke (a reference to the subject of another Wagner opera, \"Tristan und Isolde\", in which an old man tries to marry a much younger woman), thus conferring his blessing upon the lovers. David and Magdalena appear. Sachs announces to the group that a new master-song has been born, which, following the rules of the mastersingers, is to be baptized. As an apprentice cannot serve as a witness for the baptism, he promotes David to the rank of journeyman with the traditional cuff on the ear (and by this also \"promoting\" him as a groom and Magdalena as a bride). He then christens the Prize Song the \"Morning Dream Song\" (\"Selige Morgentraumdeut-Weise\"). After celebrating their good fortune with an extended quintet \"(Selig, wie die Sonne meines Gl\u00fcckes lacht)\" \u2013 musically capping the first four scenes of act 3 \u2013 the group departs for the festival.\n\"Scene 5\"\nAlmost an act in itself, this scene occupies about 45 minutes of the two hours of act 3 and is separated from the preceding four scenes by \"Verwandlungsmusik\", a transforming interlude. Meadow by the Pegnitz River. It is the Feast of St. John.\nVarious guilds enter boasting of their contributions to N\u00fcrnberg's success; Wagner depicts three of them: the Cobblers, whose chorus \"Sankt Krispin, lobet ihn!\" uses the signature cry \"streck! streck! streck!\"; the Tailors, who sing the chorus \"Als N\u00fcrnberg belagert war\" with the goat cry \"meck! meck! meck!\"; and the Bakers, who cut the tailors off with \"Hungersnot! Hungersnot!\", or \"Famine, famine!\", and its \"beck! beck! beck!\", or \"bake, bake, bake!\"\nThis leads into the \"Tanz der Lehrbuben\" (Dance of the Apprentices). The mastersingers themselves then grandly arrive: the Procession of the Masters. The crowd sings the praises of Hans Sachs, the most beloved and famous of the mastersingers; here Wagner provides a rousing chorus, \"Wach' auf, es nahet gen den Tag\", using words written by the historical Sachs himself, in a chorale-like four-part setting, relating it to the chorales of the \"Wittenberg Nightingale\" (a metaphor for Martin Luther).\nThe prize contest begins. Beckmesser attempts to sing the verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words \"(Morgen ich leuchte)\" and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also that it is in fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as \"Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein\") that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.\nThey declare Walther the winner, and the mastersingers want to make him a member of their guild on the spot. At first Walther is tempted to reject their offer, but Sachs intervenes once more and explains that art, even ground-breaking, contrary art like Walther's, can only exist within a cultural tradition, which tradition the art sustains and improves. Walther is convinced; he agrees to join. Pogner places the symbolic master-hood medal around his neck, Eva takes his hand, and the people sing once more the praises of Hans Sachs, the beloved mastersinger of Nuremberg.\nReception.\n was enthusiastically received at its premiere in 1868, and was judged to be Wagner's most immediately appealing work. Eduard Hanslick wrote in after the premiere: \"Dazzling scenes of colour and splendour, ensembles full of life and character unfold before the spectator's eyes, hardly allowing him the leisure to weigh how much and how little of these effects is of musical origin.\"\nWithin a year of the premiere the opera was performed across Germany at Dresden, Dessau, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Weimar, Hanover, and in Vienna, with Berlin following in 1870. It was one of the most popular and prominent German operas during the Unification of Germany in 1871, and in spite of the opera's overall warning against cultural self-centeredness, became a potent symbol of patriotic German art. Hans Sachs's final warning at the end of Act III on the need to preserve German art from foreign threats was a rallying point for German nationalism, particularly during the Franco-Prussian War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBeware! Evil tricks threaten us; if the German people and kingdom should one day decay, under a false, foreign1 rule, soon no prince would understand his people; and foreign mists with foreign vanities they would plant in our German land; what is German and true none would know, if it did not live in the honour of German masters. Therefore I say to you: honour your German masters, then you will conjure up good spirits! And if you favour their endeavours, even if the Holy Roman Empire should dissolve in mist, for us there would yet remain holy German Art!\nHans Sachs's final speech from Act III of \n1 The word translated here as \"foreign\" (\"\") is a catch-all term denoting \"French and/or Italian.\" Wagner here referred to the court of Frederick the Great, where French rather than German was spoken.\n\"Die Meistersinger\" was soon performed outside Germany as well, spreading throughout Europe and around the world:\nAt the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1924 following its closure during World War I was performed. The audience rose to its feet during Hans Sachs's final oration, and sang \"Deutschland \u00fcber Alles\" after the opera had finished.\n was frequently used as part of Nazi propaganda. On 21 March 1933, the founding of the Third Reich was celebrated with a performance of the opera in the presence of Adolf Hitler. The prelude to Act III is played over shots of old Nuremberg at the beginning of \"Triumph of the Will\", the 1935 film by Leni Riefenstahl depicting the Nazi party congress of 1934. During World War II, was the only opera presented at the Bayreuth festivals of 1943\u20131944.\nThe association of with Nazism led to one of the most controversial stage productions of the work. The first Bayreuth production of following World War II occurred in 1956, when Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, attempted to distance the work from German nationalism by presenting it in almost abstract terms, by removing any reference to Nuremberg from the scenery. The production was dubbed (The Mastersingers without Nuremberg).\nCriticisms of Beckmesser as a possible antisemitic trope.\nBeckmesser has been widely criticized as an antisemitic stereotype, ever since the idea was put forward by Theodor Adorno. Wagner scholar Barry Millington advanced the idea that Beckmesser represents a Jewish stereotype, whose humiliation by the Aryan Walther is an onstage representation of Wagner's antisemitism. Millington argued in his 1991 \"Nuremberg Trial: Is There Anti-Semitism in ?\" that common antisemitic stereotypes prevalent in 19th-century Germany were a part of the \"ideological fabric\" of and that Beckmesser embodied these unmistakable antisemitic characteristics. Millington's article spurred significant debate among Wagner scholars including Charles Rosen, Hans Rudolph Vaget, Paul Lawrence Rose, and Karl A. Zaenker.\nIn a 2009 interview, Katharina Wagner, the composer's great-granddaughter and co-director of the Bayreuth Festival, was asked whether she believed Wagner relied on Jewish stereotypes in his operas. Her response was, \"With Beckmesser he probably did.\" Nike Wagner, another of the composer's great-granddaughters, contends that Beckmesser is principally the victim of sadism, \"which is inseparable from the syndrome that also produces violent fascism\".\nScholars Dieter Borchmeyer, Udo Bermbach and Hermann Danuser support the thesis that with the character of Beckmesser, Wagner did not intend to allude to Jewish stereotypes, but rather to criticize (academic) pedantism in general. They point out similarities to the figure of Malvolio in Shakespeare's comedy \"Twelfth Night\".\nAlthough the score calls for Beckmesser to rush off in a huff after his self-defeating attempt to sing Walther's song, in some productions he remains and listens to Walther's correct rendition of his song, and shakes hands with Sachs after the final monologue.\nA related view holds that Beckmesser was designed to parody the renowned critic Eduard Hanslick, who valorized the music of Brahms and held Wagner's music in low regard. We know that the original name of the Beckmesser character was \"Veit Hanslich,\" and we know that Wagner invited Hanslick to his initial reading of the libretto, though whether then the character still had the \"Hanslich\" name when Hanslick heard it is unclear. This second interpretation of Beckmesser may dovetail with the antisemitism interpretation above, as Wagner attacked Hanslick as \"of gracefully concealed Jewish origin\" in his revised edition of his essay Jewishness in Music.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "37916", "revid": "11612968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37916", "title": "The Magic Flute", "text": "1791 opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nThe Magic Flute (, ), K.\u00a0620, is an opera in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to a German libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder. It is a \"Singspiel\", a popular form that included both singing and spoken dialogue. The work premiered on 30 September 1791 at Schikaneder's theatre, the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, just two months before Mozart's death. It was Mozart's last opera. It was an outstanding success from its first performances, and remains a staple of the opera repertory.\nIn the opera, the Queen of the Night persuades Prince Tamino to rescue her daughter Pamina from captivity under the high priest Sarastro; instead, he learns the high ideals of Sarastro's community and seeks to join it. Separately, then together, Tamino and Pamina undergo severe trials of initiation, which end in triumph, with the Queen and her cohorts vanquished. The earthy Papageno, who accompanies Tamino on his quest, fails the trials completely but is rewarded anyway with the hand of his ideal female companion Papagena.\nComposition.\nThe opera was the culmination of Mozart's increasing involvement with Emanuel Schikaneder's theatrical troupe, which since 1789 had been the resident company at the Theater auf der Wieden. Mozart was a close friend of one of the singer-composers of the troupe, tenor Benedikt Schack (the first Tamino), and had contributed to the compositions of the troupe, which were often collaboratively written. Mozart's participation increased with his contributions to the 1790 collaborative opera \"Der Stein der Weisen\" (\"The Philosopher's Stone\"), including the duet (\"Nun liebes Weibchen\", K.\u00a0625/592a) among other passages. Like \"The Magic Flute\", \"Der Stein der Weisen\" was a fairy-tale opera and can be considered a kind of precursor; it employed much the same cast in similar roles.\nSchikaneder's libretto for \"The Magic Flute\" is thought by scholars to be based on many sources. Some works of literature that may have served as sources include the medieval romance \"Yvain\" by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, the novel \"Life of Sethos\" by Jean Terrasson, and the essay \"On the mysteries of the Egyptians\" by Ignaz von Born. The libretto is also a natural continuation of a series of fairy tale operas produced at the time by Schikaneder's troupe, including an adaptation of Sophie Seyler's Singspiel \"Oberon\" as well as \"Der Stein der Weisen\". Especially for the role of Papageno, the libretto draws on the Hanswurst tradition of the Viennese popular theatre. Many scholars also acknowledge an influence of Freemasonry.\n\"The Magic Flute\" appears to have two references to the music of Antonio Salieri. The first is that the Papageno\u2013Papagena duet is similar to the Cucuzze cavatina in Salieri's \"Prima la musica e poi le parole\". Both are centered around musical-textual playfulness with humorous bird-like utterances of pseudo-Italian words. \"The Magic Flute\" also echoes Salieri's music in that Papageno's whistle is based on a motif borrowed from Salieri's Concerto for Clavicembalo in B-flat major.\nRoles.\nThe names of the performers at the premiere are taken from (at right), which does not give full names; \"Hr.\"\u00a0=\u00a0Herr, Mr.; \"Mme.\"\u00a0=\u00a0Madame, Mrs.; \"Mlle.\"\u00a0=\u00a0Mademoiselle, Miss.\nWhile the female roles in the opera are assigned to different voice types, the playbill for the premiere performance referred to all of the female singers as \"sopranos\". The casting of the roles relies on the actual vocal range of the part.\nOrchestration.\nThe work is scored for two flutes (one doubling on piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets (doubling basset horns), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones (alto, tenor, and bass), timpani and strings. It also requires a four-part chorus for several numbers (notably the finales of each act). Mozart also called for a \"\" (instrument of steel) to perform Papageno's magic bells. This instrument has since been lost to history, though modern day scholars believe it to be a keyed glockenspiel, which is usually replaced with a celesta in modern-day performances.\nCharles Rosen has remarked on the character of Mozart's orchestration:\n\"Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\" has the greatest variety of orchestral color that the eighteenth century was to know; the very lavishness, however, is paradoxically also an economy as each effect is a concentrated one, each one\u2014Papageno's whistle, the Queen of the Night's coloratura, the bells, Sarastro's trombones, even the farewell in scene 1 for clarinets and pizzicato strings\u2014a single dramatic stroke.\"\nSynopsis.\nOverture.\nThe overture, composed after the other parts of the opera were complete, begins with a solemn three-chord sequence from the brass, associated with the Priests of the Temple of Wisdom. (The number three is highly significant in Freemasonry and recurs as the number of ladies, boys and temples.) It transitions in an adagio to a lively fugue in E-flat major. Halfway through, there is a false ending. After another three-chord brass sequence, the fugue resumes in E-flat minor, returning to E-flat major.\nAct 1.\nScene 1: A rough, rocky landscape.\nTamino, a handsome prince lost in a distant land, is pursued by a serpent and asks the gods to save him (aria: \" / Help! Help!, segued into trio \" / Die, monster, by our might!). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to persuade the other two to leave her alone with him. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.\nTamino wakes up and is surprised to find himself still alive and the serpent dead. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: \"\" / The birdcatcher am I indeed). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit \u2013 claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving Papageno wine, cake and figs, they give him water and a stone, and padlock his mouth closed as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: / This portrait is enchantingly beautiful).\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, whom they describe as a powerful, evil demon. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative: / Oh, tremble not, my dear son! \u2013 and aria: / You will go to free her). The Queen and the ladies leave and Papageno can only hum to bemoan the padlock on his mouth. (Quintet: \"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\"). The ladies return and remove the padlock with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy, and Papageno magic bells for protection, telling him to go with Tamino. The ladies tell of three boys who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth.\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace.\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders them to chain her and leave her alone with him. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \" / Just come in, you fine little dove!). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee, each thinking the other is the devil. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred value of marital love (duet: \" / In men, who feel love).\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple.\nThe three boys lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \"\" / This path leads you to your goal). Tamino approaches the right-hand entrance (the Temple of Reason) and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the left (the Temple of Nature). But from the entrance in the middle (the Temple of Wisdom), a senior priest appears. (The priest is referred to as \"The Speaker\" in the libretto, but his role is sung.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. With a hidden male chorus, he promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when he approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship, and that Pamina is alive. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \" / How strong is thy magic tone).\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \" / Swift steps, ready courage). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, causing Monostatos and his slaves to dance off the stage, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \" / That sounds so splendid). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \" / Long live Sarastro!) Pamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness, but he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro ironically \"rewards\" Monostatos with a beating and sends him away. He announces that Tamino and Pamina must both undergo trials to be purified. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\"\" / If virtue and justice).\nAct 2.\nScene 1: A grove of palms.\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \" / O Isis and Osiris\").\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal.\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \" / Keep yourselves from women's tricks). The three ladies appear and remind Tamino and Papageno of what the Queen has said about Sarastro, trying to tempt them into speaking. (Quintet: \" / How, how, how) Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion. The Speaker and a priest return and lead Tamino and Papageno away.\nScene 3: A garden.\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos creeps in and ogles her. (Aria: \" / All feel the joys of love) He is about to kiss her, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. Waking, Pamina tells her that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and that she is thinking of accompanying him. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband, the previous owner of the temple, on his deathbed gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of to her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \" / Hell's vengeance boils in my heart). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \" / Within these sacred halls).\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal.\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three boys bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \" / We welcome you a second time). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \" / Oh, I feel it, it is gone) She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids.\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \" / O Isis and Osiris). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \" / Shall I see you no more, dear one? \u2014 Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following the chorus \".) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \" / A girl or a woman). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden.\nThe three boys hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The boys restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \" / To herald the morning, soon will shine). The scene changes without a break, leading into scene 7.\nScene 7: At the Mountains of Ordeal.\n(One mountain has a waterfall, the other emits fire.) Two men in armor lead Tamino in. They promise enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"\" / He who walks this path weighed down with cares \u2013 sung to a Baroque chorale prelude, inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" / Oh God, look down from heaven). Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\" / Oh, what luck, my Tamino!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple. The scene changes without a break, leading into scene 8.\nScene 8: A garden with a tree.\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"\" / Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Dear woman, dear dove, my beauty) He hesitates, counting to three, but more and more slowly. The three boys appear and stop him. They remind him he can play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa-Pa-Pa-Papageno\"). The scenes change without a break, leading into scene 9.\nScene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night.\nMonostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"\" / Just quiet, quiet) and the Queen confirms her promise to give Pamina to Monostatos, but suddenly, with thunder and lightning, they are cast out into eternal night. The scene changes without a break, leading into scene 10.\nScene 10: The Temple of the Sun.\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night and the fraudulent power of hypocrites. The chorus hails the newly consecrated Tamino and Pamina, and gives thanks to Isis and Osiris.\nPremiere and reception.\nThe opera premiered in Vienna on 30 September 1791 at the suburban Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden. Mozart conducted the orchestra and Schikaneder himself played Papageno, while the role of the Queen of the Night was sung by Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer.\nOn the reception of the opera, Mozart scholar Maynard Solomon writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although there were no reviews of the first performances, it was immediately evident that Mozart and Schikaneder had achieved a great success, the opera drawing immense crowds and reaching hundreds of performances during the 1790s.\nAs Mozart's letters show, he was very pleased to have achieved such a success. Solomon continues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mozart's delight is reflected in his last three letters, written to Constanze, who with her sister Sophie was spending the second week of October in Baden. \"I have this moment returned from the opera, which was as full as ever\", he wrote on 7 October, listing the numbers that had to be encored. \"But what always gives me the most pleasure is the \"silent approval\"! You can see how this opera is becoming more and more esteemed.\" ... He went to hear his opera almost every night, taking along [friends and] relatives.\nThe opera celebrated its 100th performance in November 1792, though Mozart did not have the pleasure of witnessing this milestone, as he had died on 5 December 1791. The opera was first performed outside Vienna (21 September 1792) in Lemberg, then in Prague. It then made \"triumphal progress through Germany's opera houses great and small\", and with the early 19th century spread to essentially all the countries of Europe\u2014and eventually, everywhere in the world\u2014where opera is cultivated.\nAs Peter Branscombe documents, the earlier performances were often of highly altered, sometimes even mutilated, versions of the opera (see \"Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith\"). Productions of the past century have tended to be more faithful to Mozart's music, though faithful rendering of Mozart and Schikaneder's original (quite explicit) stage directions and dramatic vision continues to be rare; with isolated exceptions, modern productions strongly reflect the creative preferences of the stage director.\n\"The Magic Flute\" is among the most frequently performed of all operas.\nCritic of the 1970s, Pauline Kael once described the opera as making a \"special claim on one's affections, because its libretto is high camp. It's a peerlessly silly masterpiece: sublimely lucid music arising out of a parodistic fairy tale that celebrates in all seriousness the exalted brotherhood of the Freemasons.\" \nFirst publication.\nOn 28 December 1791, three and a half weeks after Mozart's death, his widow Constanze offered to send a manuscript score of \"The Magic Flute\" to the electoral court in Bonn. Nikolaus Simrock published this text in the first full-score edition (Bonn, 1814), claiming that it was \"in accordance with Mozart's own wishes\" (\"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\", 13 September 1815).\nThemes.\n\"The Magic Flute\" is noted for its prominent Masonic elements, although some scholars hold that the Masonic influence is exaggerated. Schikaneder and Mozart were Freemasons, as was Ignaz Alberti, engraver and printer of the first libretto. The opera is also influenced by Enlightenment philosophy and can be regarded as advocating enlightened absolutism. The Queen of the Night is seen by some to represent a dangerous form of obscurantism, by others to represent Roman Catholic Empress Maria Theresa, who banned Freemasonry from Austria. Still others see the Roman Catholic Church itself, which was and still is strongly anti-Masonic. Likewise, the literature repeatedly addresses the fact that the central theme of the work is not only \"love\", but also becoming a better person by overcoming trials (similar to Wagner's \"Parsifal\" later on).\nRecordings.\nThe first known recording of \"The Magic Flute\"'s overture was issued around 1903, by the Victor Talking Machine Company and played by the Victor Grand Concert Band.\nThe first complete recording of \"The Magic Flute\" was of a live performance at the 1937 Salzburg Festival, with Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera, though the recording was not officially issued until many years later. The first studio recording of the work, with Sir Thomas Beecham conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, was completed in 1938. Both of these historic recordings have been reissued on LP and compact disc. Since then there have been many recordings, in both audio and video formats.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

The libretto was based on Pierre Beaumarchais's French comedy \"The Barber of Seville\" (1775). The premiere of Rossini's opera (under the title \"Almaviva, o sia L'inutile precauzione\") took place on 20 February 1816 at the Teatro Argentina, Rome, with designs by Angelo Toselli.\nRossini's \"Barber of Seville\" is considered to be one of the greatest masterpieces of comedy within music, and has been described as the opera buffa of all \"opere buffe\". After two centuries, it remains a popular work.\nComposition history.\nRossini's opera recounts the events of the first of the three plays by French playwright Pierre Beaumarchais that revolve around the clever and enterprising character named Figaro, the barber of the title. Mozart's opera \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" composed 30 years earlier in 1786, is based on the second part of the Beaumarchais trilogy. (This play was originally conceived as an op\u00e9ra comique, but was rejected as such by the Com\u00e9die-Italienne.) The play as it is now known was premiered in 1775 by the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Tuileries in Paris.\nOther operas based on the first play were composed by Giovanni Paisiello (in 1782), by Nicolas Isouard in 1796, and then by Francesco Morlacchi in 1816. Though the work of Paisiello triumphed for a time, only Rossini's version has stood the test of time and continues to be a mainstay of operatic repertoire. On 11 November 1868, two days before Rossini's death, the composer Constantino Dall'Argine (1842\u20131877) premiered an opera based on the same libretto as Rossini's work, bearing a dedication to Rossini. The premiere was not a failure, but critics condemned the \"audacity\" of the young composer and the work is now forgotten.\nRossini was well known for being remarkably productive, completing an average of two operas per year for 19 years, and in some years writing as many as four. Musicologists believe that, true to form, the music for \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" was composed in just under three weeks, although the famous overture was actually recycled from two earlier Rossini operas, \"Aureliano in Palmira\" and \"Elizabeth, Queen of England\" and thus contains none of the thematic material in \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" itself.\nPerformance history.\nLuigi Zamboni, for whom Rossini wrote the role of Figaro, had urged Rossini and Francesco Sforza-Cesarini, the cash-strapped impresario of the Teatro Argentina, to engage his sister-in-law, Elisabetta Gafforini, as Rosina. However, her fee was too high and in the end they settled on Geltrude Righetti. The premiere of Rossini's opera at the Teatro Argentina in Rome on 20 February 1816 was a disaster: the audience hissed and jeered throughout, and several on-stage accidents occurred. Furthermore, many of the audience were supporters of one of Rossini's rivals, the veteran Giovanni Paisiello, who played on mob mentality to provoke the rest of the audience to dislike the opera. Paisiello had already composed \"The Barber of Seville\" and took Rossini's new version to be an affront to his version. In particular, Paisiello's admirers were displeased with the latter inasmuch as they \"were used in the way of buffo music to the style in which the pathetic often mingles with and sometimes effaces the comic\". The second performance, however, was successful. The original French play, \"Le Barbier de S\u00e9ville\", had a similar story: poorly received at first, only to become a favorite within a week.\nThe opera was first performed in England on 10 March 1818 at the King's Theatre in London in Italian, soon followed on 13 October at the Covent Garden Theatre by an English version translated by John Fawcett and Daniel Terry. It was first performed in America on 3 May 1819 in English (probably the Covent Garden version) at the Park Theatre in New York. It was given in French at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans in New Orleans on 4 March 1823, and became the first opera ever to be performed in Italian in New York, when Manuel Garcia (who played Almaviva) and his Italian troupe opened their first season there with \"Il barbiere\" on 29 November 1825 at the Park Theatre. The cast of eight had three other members of his family, including the 17-year-old Maria-Felicia, later known as Maria Malibran.\nThe role of Rosina was originally written for a contralto. According to music critic Richard Osborne, writing in \"The New Grove Dictionary of Opera\", \"it is important to record the degree to which singers have sometimes distorted Rossini's intentions. The most serious distortion has been the upward transposition of the role of Rosina, turning her from a lustrous alto into a pert soprano.\" However, it has also been noted that Rossini, who frequently altered his music for specific singers, wrote a new aria for the second act for Jos\u00e9phine Fodor-Mainvielle, a soprano who had sung Rosina in the 1818 London premiere, and sang the new aria c. 1820 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in Paris, where it was published. According to Alberto Zedda, the author of the first critical edition of the opera, 'the transposition of the part of Rosina from contralto to soprano entails the need to transfer to a lower voice the role of the seconda donna, Berta, written by Rossini for a soprano voice. A mezzo-soprano Berta will find the tessitura of her aria \"Il vecchiotto cerca moglie\" uncomfortable, and the climb to C6 required at the conclusion of the grand concertato of the first-act finale rather difficult to achieve'.\nThe singing lesson in act 2 has often been turned into \"a show-stopping cabaret\". Adelina Patti was known to include Luigi Arditi's \"Il bacio\", the Bolero from Verdi's \"I vespri siciliani\", the Shadow Song from Meyerbeer's \"Dinorah\", and Henry Bishop's \"Home! Sweet Home!\". Nellie Melba followed suit, accompanying herself on the piano in the final song. Pauline Viardot began the practice of inserting Alexander Alyabyev's \"Nightingale\". In a recording of a La Scala performance in 1956, Maria Callas sang a shortened version of \"Contro un cor\", transposed up a tone, in E.\nOnce after Patti had sung a particularly florid rendition of the opera's legitimate aria, \"Una voce poco fa\", Rossini is reported to have asked her: \"Very nice, my dear, and who wrote the piece you have just performed?\"\nThe piece is a staple of the operatic repertoire Because of a scarcity of true contraltos, the role of Rosina has most frequently been sung by a coloratura mezzo-soprano (with or without pitch alterations, depending on the singer), and has in the past, and occasionally in more recent times, been sung by coloratura sopranos such as Marcella Sembrich, Maria Callas, Roberta Peters, Gianna D'Angelo, Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, Beverly Sills, Lily Pons, Diana Damrau, Edita Gruberov\u00e1, Kathleen Battle and Luciana Serra. Famous recent mezzo-soprano Rosinas include Marilyn Horne, Teresa Berganza, Frederica von Stade, Lucia Valentini Terrani, Susanne Marsee, Cecilia Bartoli, Joyce DiDonato, Jennifer Larmore, El\u012bna Garan\u010da, Isabel Leonard and Vesselina Kasarova. Famous contralto Rosinas include Ewa Podle\u015b who made her stage debut in that role.\nPlace: Seville, Spain\nTime: 17th century\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"The square in front of Bartolo's house\"\nIn a public square outside Bartolo's house a band of musicians and a poor student named Lindoro are serenading, to no avail, the window of Rosina (\"Ecco, ridente in cielo\"; \"There, laughing in the sky\"). Lindoro, who is really the young Count Almaviva in disguise, hopes to make the beautiful Rosina love him for himself \u2013 not his money. Almaviva pays off the musicians who then depart, leaving him to brood alone. Rosina is the young ward of the grumpy, elderly Bartolo and she is allowed very little freedom because Bartolo plans to marry her once she is of age and thus appropriate her considerable dowry. \nFigaro approaches singing (Aria: \"Largo al factotum della citt\u00e0\"; \"Make way for the factotum of the city\"). Since Figaro used to be a servant of the Count, the Count asks him for assistance in helping him meet Rosina, offering him money should he be successful in arranging this (duet: \"All'idea di quel metallo\"; \"At the idea of that metal\"). Figaro advises the Count to disguise himself as a drunken soldier, ordered to be billeted with Bartolo, so as to gain entrance to the house. For this suggestion, Figaro is richly rewarded.\n\"A room in Bartolo's house with four doors\"\nThe scene begins with Rosina's cavatina, \"Una voce poco fa\" (\"A voice a little while ago\"). (This aria was originally written in the key of E major, but it is sometimes transposed a semitone up into F major for coloratura sopranos to perform, giving them the chance to sing extra, almost traditional, cadenzas, sometimes reaching high Ds or even Fs.)\nKnowing the Count only as Lindoro, Rosina writes to him because she is interested in getting to know him better. As she is leaving the room, Bartolo enters with the music teacher Basilio. Bartolo is suspicious of the Count, and Basilio advises that he be put out of the way by creating false rumours about him (this aria, \"La calunnia \u00e8 un venticello\" \u2013 \"Calumny is a little breeze\" \u2013 is almost always sung a tone lower than the original D major).\nWhen the two have gone, Rosina and Figaro enter. Figaro asks Rosina to write a few encouraging words to Lindoro, which she has actually already written. (Duet: \"Dunque io son...tu non m'inganni?\"; \"Then I'm the one...you're not fooling me?\"). Although surprised by Bartolo, Rosina manages to fool him, but he remains suspicious. (Aria: \"A un dottor della mia sorte\"; \"To a doctor of my class\").\nCount Almaviva, disguised as a soldier and pretending to be drunk, enters the house and demands to be quartered there. In fear of the drunken man, Berta the housekeeper rushes to Bartolo for protection. Bartolo tells the \"soldier\" that he (Bartolo) has an official exemption which excuses him from the requirement to quarter soldiers in his home. Almaviva pretends to be too drunk and belligerent to understand, and dares Bartolo to brawl. While Bartolo searches his cluttered desk for the official document which would prove his exemption, Almaviva whispers to Rosina that he is Lindoro in disguise, and passes a love-letter to her. Bartolo suspiciously demands to know what is in the piece of paper in Rosina's hands, but she fools him by handing over her laundry list. Bartolo and the Count argue loudly. Basilio enters; then Figaro, who warns that the noise of the argument is rousing the whole neighborhood. Finally, the noise attracts the attention of the Officer of the Watch and his troops, who crowd into the room. Bartolo demands that the Officer arrest the \"drunken soldier\". The Officer starts to do so, but Almaviva quietly reveals his true identity to the Officer, and he (the Officer) backs off. Bartolo and Basilio are astonished and mystified; Figaro laughs quietly at them. (Finale: \"Fredda ed immobile, come una statua\"; \"Cold and still, just like a statue\"). The confusion intensifies and causes everyone to suffer headaches and auditory hallucinations (\"Mi par d'esser con la testa in un'orrida fucina; dell'incudini sonore l'importuno strepitar\"; \"My head seems to be in a fiery forge: the sound of the anvils deafens the ear\").\nAct 2.\n\"A room in Bartolo's house with a piano\"\nCount Almaviva again appears at the doctor's house, this time disguised as Don Alonso, a priest and singing tutor who is substituting for the supposedly ailing Basilio. To gain Bartolo's trust, Don Alonso tells him he has intercepted a note from Lindoro to Rosina, and says that Lindoro is a servant of Count Almaviva who has dishonorable intentions towards Rosina. While Almaviva pretends to give Rosina her singing lesson (\"Contro un cor\"; \"Against a heart\"), Figaro arrives to shave Bartolo. Not wanting to leave Rosina alone with the singing teacher, Bartolo insists Figaro shave him right there in the music room. Basilio suddenly appears for his scheduled music lesson, but he is bribed by a full purse from Almaviva and persuaded to leave again, with much discussion of how ill he looks. (Quintet: \"Don Basilio! \u2013 Cosa veggo!\"; \"Don Basilio! \u2013 What do I see?\"). Bartolo overhears the lovers conspiring, and angrily drives everybody away. Berta vents about the crazy household (\"Il vecchiotto cerca moglie\").\n\"A room in Bartolo's house\" \"with a grille looking out onto the square\". \nBartolo orders Basilio to have the notary ready to marry him to Rosina that evening. Basilio leaves and Rosina arrives. Bartolo shows Rosina the letter she wrote to \"Lindoro\" and persuades her that this is proof that Lindoro is merely a flunky of Almaviva and is toying with her at Almaviva's behest. Rosina believes the story and agrees to marry Bartolo.\nDuring an instrumental interlude, the music creates a thunder storm to indicate the passage of time. Almaviva and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter Rosina's room through a window. Rosina accuses Almaviva, whom she believes to be Lindoro, of betraying her. Almaviva reveals his identity and the two reconcile. While Almaviva and Rosina are enraptured by one another, Figaro keeps urging them to leave. Two people are heard approaching the front door. They are Basilio and the notary. The Count, Rosina, and Figaro attempt to leave by way of the ladder, but discover it has been removed. Using bribes and threats, Almaviva coerces the notary into marrying him to Rosina, with Basilio and Figaro as the legally required witnesses. Bartolo barges in, accompanied by the Officer and the men of the watch, but too late; the marriage is already complete. The befuddled Bartolo is pacified by being allowed to retain Rosina's dowry. The opera concludes with an anthem to love (\"Amor e fede eterna, si vegga in noi regnar!\"; \"May love and faith eternally be seen to reign in us\").\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The story is set in Paris around 1830 and shows the Bohemian lifestyle (known in French as \"\") of a poor seamstress and her artist friends.\nThe world premiere of \"La boh\u00e8me\" was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio, conducted by the 28-year-old Arturo Toscanini. Since then, \"La boh\u00e8me\" has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide.\nIn 1946, 50 years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a commemorative performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. A recording of the performance was later released by RCA Victor on vinyl record, tape and compact disc. It is the only recording ever made of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.\nOrigin of the story.\nAs credited on its title page, the libretto of \"La boh\u00e8me\" is based on Henri Murger's 1851 novel, \"Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de boh\u00e8me\", a collection of vignettes portraying young bohemians living in Paris in the 1840s. Although often called a novel, the book has no unified plot. Like the 1849 play drawn from the book by Murger and Th\u00e9odore Barri\u00e8re, the opera's libretto focuses on the relationship between Rodolfo and Mim\u00ec, ending with her death. Also like the play, the libretto combines two characters from the novel, Mim\u00ec and Francine, into the single character of Mim\u00ec. Early in the composition stage Puccini was in dispute with the composer Ruggero Leoncavallo, who said that he had offered Puccini a completed libretto and felt that Puccini should defer to him. Puccini responded that he had had no idea of Leoncavallo's interest and that having been working on his own version for some time, he felt that he could not oblige him by abandoning the opera. Leoncavallo completed his own version in which Marcello was sung by a tenor and Rodolfo by a baritone. It was not as successful as Puccini's and is now rarely performed.\nMuch of the libretto is original. Major sections of acts two and three are the librettists' invention, with only a few passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the book, piecing together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four\u2014the scenes with Rodolfo and Mim\u00ec\u2014resemble both the play and the book. The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the book, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mim\u00ec at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mim\u00ec's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the book, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mim\u00ec's.\nThe published libretto includes a note from the librettists briefly discussing their adaptation. Without mentioning the play directly, they defend their conflation of Francine and Mim\u00ec into a single character: \"Chi pu\u00f2 non confondere nel delicato profilo di una sola donna quelli di Mim\u00ec e di Francine?\" (\"Who cannot confuse in the delicate profile of one woman the personality both of Mim\u00ec and of Francine?\"). At the time, the book was in the public domain, Murger having died without heirs, but rights to the play were still controlled by Barri\u00e8re's heirs.\nPerformance history and reception.\nInitial success.\nThe world premi\u00e8re performance of \"La boh\u00e8me\" took place in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio and was conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. The role of Rodolfo was played by Evan Gorga with Cesira Ferrani as Mimi, but Gorga was unable to accommodate the high tessitura and the music had to be transposed down for him. The initial response of the audience at the first performance was subdued and critical responses were polarized. Despite this varied introductory response, the opera quickly became popular throughout Italy and productions were soon mounted by the following companies: The Teatro di San Carlo (14\u00a0March 1896, with Elisa Petri as Musetta and Antonio Magini-Coletti as Marcello); The Teatro Comunale di Bologna (4\u00a0November 1896, with Amelia Sedelmayer as Musetta and Umberto Beduschi as Rodolfo); The Teatro Costanzi (17\u00a0November 1896, with Maria Stuarda Savelli as Mim\u00ec, Enrico Giannini-Grifoni as Rodolfo, and Maurizio Bensaude as Marcello); La Scala (15 March 1897, with Angelica Pandolfini as Mim\u00ec, Camilla Pasini as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Edoardo Camera as Marcello); La Fenice (26 December 1897, with Emilia Merolla as Mim\u00ec, Maria Martelli as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu and Franco Mannucci as Rodolfo, and Ferruccio Corradetti as Marcello); Teatro Regio di Parma (29 January 1898, with Solomiya Krushelnytska as Mim\u00ec, Lina Cassandro as Musetta, Pietro Ferrari as Rodolfo, and Pietro Giacomello as Marcello); Paris Opera (13 June 1898); and the Teatro Donizetti di Bergamo (21 August 1898, with Emilia Corsi as Mim\u00ec, Annita Barone as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu as Rodolfo, and Giovanni Roussel as Marcello).\nThe first performance of \"La boh\u00e8me\" outside Italy was at the Teatro de la \u00d3pera in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 16 June 1896. The protagonists were Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e and Emilio De Marchi, conducted by Edoardo Mascheroni.\nThe opera was performed in Alexandria, Lisbon, and Moscow in early 1897. The United Kingdom premiere took place at the Theatre Royal in Manchester, on 22 April 1897, in a presentation by the Carl Rosa Opera Company supervised by Puccini. This performance was given in English and starred Alice Esty as Mim\u00ec, Bessie McDonald as Musetta, Robert Cunningham as Rodolfo, and William Paull as Marcello. On 2 October 1897 the same company gave the opera's first staging at the Royal Opera House in London and on 14 October 1897 in Los Angeles for the opera's United States premiere. The opera reached New York City on 16 May 1898 when it was performed at Wallack's Theatre with Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo. The first production of the opera actually produced by the Royal Opera House itself premiered on 1 July 1899 with Nellie Melba as Mim\u00ec, Z\u00e9lie de Lussan as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Mario Ancona as Marcello.\n\"La boh\u00e8me\" premiered in Germany at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin on 22 June 1897. The French premiere of the opera was presented by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 13 June 1898 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nations. The production used a French translation by Paul Ferrier and starred Julia Guiraudon as Mim\u00ec, Jeanne Tiphaine as Musetta, Adolphe Mar\u00e9chal as Rodolfo, and Lucien Fug\u00e8re as Marcello. The Czech premiere of the opera was presented by the National Theatre on 27 February 1898.\n20th and 21st centuries.\n\"La boh\u00e8me\" continued to gain international popularity throughout the early 20th century and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique alone had already presented the opera one hundred times by 1903. The Belgian premiere took place at La Monnaie on 25 October 1900 using Ferrier's French translation with Marie Thi\u00e9rry as Mim\u00ec, L\u00e9on David as Rodolfo, Eug\u00e8ne-Charles Badiali as Marcello, sets by Pierre Devis, Armand Lynen, and Albert Dubosq, and Philippe Flon conducting. The Metropolitan Opera staged the work for the first time on 26 December 1900 with Nellie Melba as Mim\u00ec, Annita Occhiolini-Rizzini as Musetta, Albert Sal\u00e9za as Rodolfo, Giuseppe Campanari as Marcello, and Luigi Mancinelli conducting. \"La boh\u00e8me\" was the last opera performed at New York's Metropolitan Opera's original 1883 building on 16 April 1966, conducted by George Schick.\nThe opera was first performed in Brazil at the Theatro da Paz in Bel\u00e9m on 21 April 1900 with the Brazilian soprano Tilde Maragliano as Mim\u00ec, Maria Cavallini as Musetta, Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo and Alessandro Modesti as Marcello. The conductor was Giorgio Polacco.\nThe following year \"La boh\u00e8me\" was presented at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, on 2 July 1901 with Elvira Miotti as Mim\u00ec, Mabel Nelma as Musetta, Michele Sigaldi as Rodolfo, and Enrico De Franceschi as Marcello. Other premieres soon followed:\nPuccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, and the news of his death reached Rome during a performance of \"La boh\u00e8me\". The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played Chopin's \"Funeral March\" for the stunned audience.\nThe first production of \"La boh\u00e8me\" at the Salzburg Festival did not occur until as late as July 2012. However, that festival has not shown much interest in the operas of Puccini, only ever having one production each of \"Tosca\" and \"Turandot\" in its entire history.\nCritical reception.\nDespite the opera's popularity with audiences, Puccini has been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult. The composer Benjamin Britten wrote in 1951, \"[A]fter four or five performances I never wanted to hear \"Boh\u00e8me\" again. In spite of its neatness, I became sickened by the cheapness and emptiness of the music.\"\nPlace: Paris\nTime: Around 1830.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"In the four bohemians' garret (Christmas Eve)\"\nMarcello is painting while Rodolfo gazes out of the window. They complain of the cold. In order to keep warm, they burn the manuscript of Rodolfo's drama. Colline, the philosopher, enters shivering and disgruntled at not having been able to pawn some books. Schaunard, the musician of the group, arrives with food, wine and cigars. He explains the source of his riches: a job with an eccentric English gentleman, who hired him to play his violin to a parrot until it died. The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table to eat and drink. Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.\nThe friends are interrupted by Beno\u00eet, the landlord, who arrives to collect the rent. They flatter him and him with wine. In his drunkenness, he begins to boast of his amorous adventures, but when he also reveals that he is married, they thrust him from the room\u2014without the rent payment\u2014in comic moral indignation. The rent money is divided for their evening out at Cafe Momus. This was a cafe in Rue des Pr\u00eatres St Germain l\u2019Auxerrois.\nMarcello, Schaunard and Colline go out, but Rodolfo remains alone for a moment in order to finish an article he is writing, promising to join his friends soon. There is a knock at the door. It is a girl who lives in another room in the building. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.\nHer candle goes out in the draught and Rodolfo's candle goes out too; the pair stumble in the dark. Rodolfo, eager to spend time with the girl, to whom he is already attracted, finds the key and pockets it, feigning innocence. He takes her cold hand (\"Che gelida manina\"\u2014\"What a cold little hand\") and tells her of his life as a poet, then asks her to tell him more about her life. The girl says her name is Mim\u00ec (\"S\u00ec, mi chiamano Mim\u00ec\"\u2014\"Yes, they call me Mim\u00ec\"), and describes her simple life as an embroiderer. Impatiently, the waiting friends call Rodolfo. He answers and turns to see Mim\u00ec bathed in moonlight (duet, Rodolfo and Mim\u00ec: \"O soave fanciulla\"\u2014\"Oh lovely girl\"). They realize that they have fallen in love. Rodolfo suggests remaining at home with Mim\u00ec, but she decides to accompany him to the Cafe Momus. As they leave, they sing of their newfound love.\nAct 2.\n\"Cafe Momus (same evening)\"\nA great crowd, including children, has gathered with street sellers announcing their wares (chorus: \"Aranci, datteri! Caldi i marroni!\"\u2014\"Oranges, dates! Hot chestnuts!\"). The friends arrive; Rodolfo buys Mim\u00ec a bonnet from a vendor, while Colline buys a coat and Schaunard a horn. Parisians gossip with friends and bargain with the vendors; the children of the streets clamor to see the wares of Parpignol, the toy seller. The friends enter the Cafe Momus.\nAs the men and Mim\u00ec dine at the cafe, Musetta, Marcello's former sweetheart, arrives with her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she is tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqu\u00e9 song (Musetta's waltz: \"Quando me'n vo\"'\u2014\"When I go along\"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mim\u00ec recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.\nThe friends are presented with their bill. However, Schaunard's purse has gone missing and no one else has enough money to pay. The sly Musetta has the entire bill charged to Alcindoro. The sound of a military band is heard, and the friends leave. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe seeking Musetta. The waiter hands him the bill and, dumbfounded, Alcindoro sinks into a chair.\nAct 3.\n\"At the toll gate at the Barri\u00e8re d'Enfer (late February)\"\nPeddlers pass through the barriers and enter the city. Mim\u00ec appears, coughing violently. She tries to find Marcello, who is currently living in a little tavern where he paints signs for the innkeeper. She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who abandoned her the night before, and of Rodolfo's terrible jealousy (\"O buon Marcello, aiuto!\"\u2014\"Oh, good Marcello, help me!\"). Marcello tells her that Rodolfo is asleep inside, and expresses concern about Mim\u00ec's cough. Rodolfo wakes up and comes out looking for Marcello. Mim\u00ec hides and overhears Rodolfo first telling Marcello that he left Mim\u00ec because of her coquettishness, but finally confessing that his jealousy is a sham: he fears she is slowly being consumed by a deadly illness (most likely tuberculosis, known by the catchall name \"consumption\" in the nineteenth century). Rodolfo, in his poverty, can do little to help Mim\u00ec and hopes that his pretended unkindness will inspire her to seek another, wealthier suitor (\"Marcello, finalmente\"\u2014\"Marcello, finally\").\nOut of kindness towards Mim\u00ec, Marcello tries to silence him, but she has already heard all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes to find out what has happened. Mim\u00ec tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mim\u00ec: \"Donde lieta usc\u00ec\"\u2014\"From here she happily left\"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness (quartet: Mim\u00ec, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: \"Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina!\"\u2014\"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!\").\nAct 4.\n\"Back in the garret (some months later)\"\nMarcello and Rodolfo are trying to work, though they are primarily talking about their girlfriends, who have left them and found wealthy lovers. Rodolfo has seen Musetta in a fine carriage and Marcello has seen Mim\u00ec dressed like a queen. The men both express their nostalgia (duet: \"O Mim\u00ec, tu pi\u00f9 non torni\"\u2014\"O Mim\u00ec, will you not return?\"). Schaunard and Colline arrive with a very frugal dinner and all parody eating a plentiful banquet, dance together and sing, before Schaunard and Colline engage in a mock duel.\nMusetta suddenly appears; Mim\u00ec, who took up with a wealthy viscount after leaving Rodolfo in the spring, has left her patron. Musetta found her that day in the street, severely weakened by her illness, and Mim\u00ec begged Musetta to bring her to Rodolfo. Mim\u00ec, haggard and pale, is assisted onto a bed. Briefly, she feels as though she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat (\"Vecchia zimarra\"\u2014\"Old coat\"). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo some time together. Mim\u00ec tells Rodolfo that her love for him is her whole life (aria/duet, Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo: \"Sono andati?\"\u2014\"Have they gone?\").\nTo Mim\u00ec's delight, Rodolfo presents her with the pink bonnet he bought her, which he has kept as a souvenir of their love. They remember past happiness and their first meeting\u2014the candles, the lost key (Mimi playfully confesses that she had figured out that Rodolfo had pocketed it). Mim\u00ec is overwhelmed by a seizure of coughing. The others return, with a gift of a muff to warm Mim\u00ec's hands and a cordial to soothe her cough. Mim\u00ec gently thanks Rodolfo for the muff, which she believes is a present from him, reassures him that she is better, and falls asleep. Musetta prays. Schaunard discovers that Mim\u00ec has died. Rodolfo rushes to the bed, calling Mim\u00ec's name in anguish. He sobs helplessly as the curtain falls.\nInstrumentation.\n\"La boh\u00e8me\" is scored for:\nRecording history.\nThe discography of \"La boh\u00e8me\" is a long one with many distinguished recordings, including the 1972 Decca recording conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Luciano Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Mirella Freni as Mim\u00ec (made before Pavarotti became an international superstar of opera), and the 1973 RCA Victor recording conducted by Sir Georg Solti with Montserrat Caball\u00e9 as Mim\u00ec and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo as Rodolfo which won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. The 1959 recording conducted by Tullio Serafin with Renata Tebaldi as Mim\u00ec and Carlo Bergonzi was included in the soundtrack of the 1987 movie \"Moonstruck\".\nThe earliest commercially released full-length recording was probably that recorded in February 1917 and released on His Master Voice's Italian label La Voce del Padrone. Carlo Sabajno conducted the La Scala Orchestra and Chorus with Gemma Bosini and Reno Andreini as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo. One of the most recent is the 2008 Deutsche Grammophon release conducted by Bertrand de Billy with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villaz\u00f3n as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo.\nThere are several recordings with conductors closely associated with Puccini. In the 1946 RCA Victor recording, Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the world premiere of the opera, conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Jan Peerce as Rodolfo and Licia Albanese as Mim\u00ec. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor. Thomas Beecham, who worked closely with Puccini when preparing a 1920 production of \"La boh\u00e8me\" in London, conducted a performance of the opera in English released by Columbia Records in 1936 with Lisa Perli as Mim\u00ec and Heddle Nash as Rodolfo. Beecham also conducts on the 1956 RCA Victor recording with Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles and Jussi Bj\u00f6rling as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo.\nAlthough the vast majority of recordings are in the original Italian, the opera has been recorded in several other languages. These include: a recording in French conducted by Erasmo Ghiglia with Ren\u00e9e Doria and Alain Vanzo as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo (1960); a recording in German with Richard Kraus conducting the Deutsche Oper Berlin Orchestra and Chorus with Trude Eipperle and Fritz Wunderlich as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo (1956); and the 1998 release on the Chandos Opera in English label with David Parry conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra and Cynthia Haymon and Dennis O'Neill as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo.\nEnrico Caruso, who was closely associated with the role of Rodolfo, recorded the famous aria \"Che gelida manina\" in 1906. This aria has been recorded by nearly 500 tenors in at least seven different languages between 1900 and 1980. In 1981 the A.N.N.A. Record Company released a six LP set with 101 different tenors singing the aria.\nThe missing act.\nIn 1957 Illica's widow died and his papers were given to the Parma Museum. Among them was the full libretto to \"La boh\u00e8me\". It was then discovered that the librettists had prepared an act which Puccini decided not to use in his composition. It is noteworthy for explaining Rodolfo's jealous remarks to Marcello in act 3.\nThe \"missing act\" is located in the timeline between the Caf\u00e9 Momus scene and act 3 and describes an open-air party at Musetta's dwelling. Her protector has refused to pay further rent out of jealous feelings, and Musetta's furniture is moved into the courtyard to be auctioned off the following morning. The four Bohemians find in this an excuse for a party and arrange for wine and an orchestra. Musetta gives Mim\u00ec a beautiful gown to wear and introduces her to a Viscount. The pair dances a quadrille in the courtyard, which moves Rodolfo to jealousy. This explains his act 3 reference to the \"moscardino di Viscontino\" (young fop of a Viscount). As dawn approaches, furniture dealers gradually remove pieces for the morning auction.\nRuggero Leoncavallo composed an opera based the same source material, also titled \"La boh\u00e8me\"; this episode is included in Leoncavallo's treatment which premiered in 1897.\nDerivative works.\nIn 1959 \"Musetta's Waltz\" was adapted by songwriter Bobby Worth for the pop song \"Don't You Know?\", a hit for Della Reese. Earlier, it was used for another song, \"One Night of Love\".\nIn 1969 in Paris, American free-jazz pianist Dave Burrell recorded his \"La Vie de Boh\u00e8me\" with a seven-piece group of European and American musicians. The music on the double-LP is improvised and experimental, but the listener can still discern Puccini's themes, as well as the narrative arc of the complete opera.\nThe opera was adapted into a 1983 short story by the novelist V. S. Pritchett for publication by the Metropolitan Opera Association.\nModernizations.\nBaz Luhrmann produced the opera for Opera Australia in 1990 with modernized supertitle translations, and a budget of only A$60,000 (A$130,545.17 in 2022). A DVD was issued of the stage show. According to Luhrmann, this version was set in 1957 (rather than the original period of 1830) because \"...[they] discovered that 1957 was a very, very accurate match for the social and economic realities of Paris in the 1840s.\" In 2002, Luhrmann restaged his version on Broadway. The production won two awards at the 57th Tony Awards out of six nominations: Catherine Martin for Best Scenic Design and Nigel Levings for Best Lighting Design as well as a special award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre. Joe Jonas appeared in this production in the children's chorus. To play eight times a week for 228 performances, three casts of Mim\u00ecs and Rodolfos (Alfred Boe, Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda, David Miller), and two Musettas (Jessica Comeau, Chlo\u00eb Wright) and Marcellos (Eugene Brancoveanu, Ben Davis), were used in rotation. \"La boh\u00e8me\" was then a key source for the plot of Luhrmann's 2001 jukebox musical film \"Moulin Rouge!\".\n\"Rent\", a 1996 musical by Jonathan Larson, is based on \"La boh\u00e8me\". Here the lovers, Roger and Mimi, are faced with AIDS and progress through the action with songs such as \"Light My Candle\", which have direct reference to \"La boh\u00e8me\". Many of the character names are retained or are similar (Rodolfo is Roger, Colline is Collins, the character Angel is given the surname \"Schunard\", Benoit is Benny) and at another point in the play, Roger's roommate and best friend Mark makes a wry reference to \"Musetta's Waltz\", which is a recurring theme throughout the first act and is played at the end of the second act. The story is set amongst artists living in New York City at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. \nA TV movie was released in 1965 directed by Wilhelm Semmelroth and designed by Franco Zeffirelli, based on the latter's previously directed version for stage. It starred Gianni Raimondi in the role of Rodolfo and Mirella Freni as Mimi. The soundtrack, however, was pre-recorded and lip-synced, and conducted by Herbert von Karajan.\nRobin Norton-Hale directed a new production at the Cock Tavern Theatre, Kilburn, for OperaUpClose in December 2009. For act 2 the entire audience and cast moved downstairs to the pub itself, with the pub's patrons serving as extras in the Cafe Momus scene. In 2010 the production was transferred to the West End's Soho Theatre and won a Laurence Olivier Award.\nA 2019 production by Canada's Against the Grain Theatre featured a translated English libretto, and transposed the story to a contemporary Canadian urban setting. This production toured several Canadian cities before its production at Toronto's Tranzac Club was livestreamed by CBC Gem on 13 October. The CBC broadcast received two Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, for Best Performing Arts Program and Best Direction in a TV Movie.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His 1890 masterpiece \"Cavalleria rusticana\" caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the \"Verismo\" movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Ruggero Leoncavallo, was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, \"L'amico Fritz\" and \"Iris\" have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres.\nMascagni wrote fifteen operas, an operetta, several orchestral and vocal works, and also songs and piano music. He enjoyed immense success during his lifetime, both as a composer and conductor of his own and other people's music and created a variety of styles in his operas.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nMascagni was born on 7 December 1863 in Livorno, Tuscany, the second son of Domenico and Emilia Mascagni. His father owned and operated a bakery. Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti (\"Nanni\") was born the same year in the same city and became Mascagni's lifelong friend and collaborator.\nIn 1876, at the age of 13, Mascagni began musical studies with Alfredo Soffredini, who founded the \"Instituto Musicale di Livorno\" (later called \"Istituto Cherubini\"). Soffredini had just completed his musical studies in Milan. Also a native of Livorno, Soffredini was a composer, teacher and musical critic. Mascagni started composing rapidly: between 1879 and 1880, he wrote several works: \"Sinfonia in do minore\", \"Prima sinfonia in fa maggiore\", \"Elegia\", \"Kyrie\", \"Gloria\" and \"Ave Maria\".\nMusical career: 1880\u20131889.\nThe premiere of Mascagni's first cantata, \"In Filanda\", took place at the Istituto Cherubini on 9 February 1881. Performed at a musical contest in Milan, the cantata won the first prize. In the same year, Mascagni met the musicians Arrigo Boito and Amilcare Ponchielli in Milan.\nIn 1882, he composed his \"Cantata alla gioia\" from a text by Friedrich Schiller, followed by \"La stella di Garibaldi\" for voice and piano, and \"La tua stella\". On 6 May Mascagni left Livorno for Milan. He passed the admission examination of the Milan Conservatory on 12 October. In Milan, Mascagni met the noted composer Giacomo Puccini, and was a student of Amintore Galli, artistic director of the Casa Musicale Sonzogno.\nOn 9 January 1883, Mascagni's sister, Maria, died. The cantata \"In Filanda\" became \"Pinotta\", and was proposed for the musical contest of the Conservatorio, but as his registration was late, it was not accepted.\nIn 1884, he composed \"Ballata\" for tenor and piano; \"M'ama non m'ama\", scherzo for soprano and piano; \"Messagio d'amore\", and \"Alla luna\".\nIn 1885, Mascagni composed \"Il Re a Napoli in Cremona\", a romance for tenor and orchestra, on a text by Andrea Maffei. He left Milan without completing his studies. That year, he began touring as a conductor in the operetta companies of Vittorio Forl\u00ec, Alfonso and Ciro Scognamiglio, and, in Genoa, the company of Luigi Arnaldo Vassallo.\nMascagni met the impresario Luigi Maresca in 1886 and started working with him. That December, Mascagni arrived in Cerignola with Maresca's company. He was accompanied by Argenide Marcellina Carbognani (Lina), his future wife. Helped by the mayor Giuseppe Cannone, Mascagni soon left the company of Maresca, though not without problems.\nHe was appointed as the master of music and singing of the new philharmonia of Cerignola. His reputation grew. He also gave piano lessons. In February 1888, he began work on the \"Messa di Gloria.\" In July 1888, Casa Musicale Sonzogno announced in the \"Teatro Illustrato\" its second competition for a one-act opera, to be judged by a panel including Galli and Antonio Ghislanzoni. The following year, Mascagni completed his composition of \"Cavalleria rusticana\" on 27 May and sent the manuscript to Milan. Mascagni won against seventy-two other operas, including Niccola Spinelli's \"Labilia\" and Vincenzo Ferroni's \"Rudello\".\nMascagni married Lina Carbognani on 3 February 1889. The next day their first son, Domenico Mascagni (\"Mim\u00ec\"), was born. Their son Dino was born on 3 January 1891. A daughter, Emi, was born in 1892.\n1890\u20131899.\nOn 21 February 1890, Mascagni was summoned to Rome to present his opera. The premi\u00e8re of \"Cavalleria rusticana\", winner of the Sonzogno contest, was held 17 May at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. It had outstanding success, and the opera was soon performed in both the north and south of Italy: Florence, Turin, Bologna, Palermo, Milan, Genoa, Naples, Venice and Trieste.\nIn December, Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Budapest. Soon thereafter, the cities of Munich, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Dresden and Buenos Aires welcomed the opera. In March 1891, it was sung in Vienna. At age 26, Mascagni had become internationally famous.\nMascagni premiered his \"L'amico Fritz\", his second most successful opera, on 31 October 1891 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. \"I Rantzau\" premiered on 10 November at the Teatro La Pergola, in Florence, under his personal direction.\nThe composer next completed \"Silvano \" (1894). On 16 February 1895, he premiered \"Guglielmo Ratcliff\" at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan. On 15 March \"Silvano\" was premiered at the same theatre. That year, Mascagni accepted the directorship of the Liceo Rossini in Pesaro and moved his family there.\nOn 2 March 1896, Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of \"Zanetto\" at the Liceo. He continued his composing and directing. On 29 June 1898 in Recanati, Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of his symphonic poem, \"A Giacomo Leopardi\". Mascagni began a collaboration with Luigi Illica, a librettist. Their first work, \"Iris,\" was premiered on 22 November at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome.\nMascagni's father died in May 1899.\n1900\u20131909.\nIn 1900, Mascagni toured Moscow and St. Petersburg and, on 17 January 1901, \"Le maschere\" was premiered in six Italian theatres. Giuseppe Verdi died on 27 January and the following month Mascagni commemorated Verdi's passing. That same year, he conducted Verdi's \"Requiem\" in Vienna.\nMascagni composed the incidental music for Hall Caine's play, \"The Eternal City\" in August 1902; the premi\u00e8re of the play with Mascagni's music took place in London on 2 October.\nIn 1902 and 1903, he toured in Canada and the United States, (in particular Montreal, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston and San Francisco), where he conducted many of his and other composers' works. The tour was mostly a fiasco, except for the visit to San Francisco where Mascagni was extremely well received.\nIn 1903, Mascagni left Pesaro after problems with the authorities. He became director of the \"Scuola Musicale Romana\", in Rome. In the same year, he signed a contract with the French editor Paul de Choudens.\n\"Amica\", based on a poem by Choudens with a French libretto by Paul Collin, was premiered on 16 March 1905, in Monte-Carlo. That year, he had disputes with Ruggero Leoncavallo and Giacomo Puccini. He also had the Livornese premi\u00e8re of \"Le maschere\".\nMascagni was director of the Costanzi for the season beginning in August 1909.\n1910\u20131919.\nOn 4 April 1910, Mascagni began a relationship with Anna Lolli. In October he was reconciled with Puccini.\nMascagni ceased his activity as director of the Scuola Musicale Romana in 1911. That May he left for Buenos Aires, beginning a seven-month tour in South America. The premi\u00e8re of \"Isabeau\" took place in Buenos Aires on 2 June.\nThe Italian premi\u00e8re of \"Isabeau\" was held simultaneously at La Scala in Milan (conductor Tullio Serafin) and at La Fenice in Venice (conductor Mascagni) in 1912. On 28 March, he began to work on \"Parisina\" in Bellevue, near Paris, sometimes with his daughter Emi, his mistress Anna Lolli, and the librettist Gabriele d'Annunzio.\n\"Parisina\" was premiered in Milan on 15 December of that year. Almost all the important Italian composers of the time were present, among them Puccini, Umberto Giordano and Riccardo Zandonai. The new work was premiered in Livorno and Rome in 1914. On 28 July, the events occurred that shortly led to World War I: Puccini and Mascagni were against the involvement of Italy in this war, in which Mascagni's son Dino was later made a prisoner.\nIn 1915 Mascagni wrote music for Nino Oxilia's movie \"Rapsodia Satanica\"; the custom was for silent films to be accompanied live in a theatre by organ, piano, or an orchestra, often using a prepared score (sometimes with original music) with cues for the conductor or musician. Mascagni had a quarrel regarding the rights of Louise de la Ram\u00e9e's \"Two Little Wooden Shoes \"(\"I due Zoccoletti\"), which inspired both Puccini and Mascagni. The subject was retained by Mascagni for \"Lodoletta\". The latter opera was premiered on 30 April 1917 in Rome. The Livornese premi\u00e8re of the opera was on 28 July with Beniamino Gigli as Flammen.\n\"S\u00ec\", Mascagni's operetta, which he had been manoeuvred into writing by the impresario Carlo Lombardo, was premiered on 13 December in Rome.\n1920\u20131939.\nIn 1920 Mascagni composed \"Il piccolo Marat\", which was premiered in Rome on 2 May 1921, followed by a premiere in Buenos Aires in September. The composer returned to South America for a tour beginning in May 1922.\nIn 1923, he composed \"Visione Lirica\". Mascagni appeared on the cover of \"Time\" on 6 September 1926.\nHe moved to the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome in 1927, a place he would not leave until his death.\nIn 1930, Mascagni conducted \"La boh\u00e8me\" in Torre del Lago, as a homage to Puccini, who had died in 1924.

He joined the PNF (Fascist party), following the example of many contemporary musicians, including Giordano.\n\"Nerone\" was premi\u00e8red in Milan on 16 January 1935, followed by the premi\u00e8re in Livorno on 24 August.\nIn June 1936, Mascagni's son Dino died in Somalia.\nLast years.\nIn 1940, celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of his most popular opera, \"Cavalleria rusticana\", took place all over Italy, often with Mascagni conducting. The opera was recorded for \"La Voce del padrone\" (\"His Master's Voice\") at La Scala under the direction of Mascagni, who recorded a special spoken introduction. EMI later reissued the recording on LP and CD.\nIn 1942, after an audience with Pope Pius XII, newspapers quoted Mascagni, a Roman Catholic, as saying that his tuberculosis-stricken niece was cured after receiving a rosary and silver medal blessed by the pope.\nIn April 1943, Mascagni appeared for the last time at La Scala to conduct \"L'amico Fritz\". By that time he had to conduct sitting on a chair. The last season of Mascagni at the Rome Opera (\"Cavalleria rusticana\" and \"L'amico Fritz\") was 1944\u201345.\nMascagni died on 2 August 1945 in his apartment at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome. The funeral ceremony was on 4 August. The Italian authorities were not present. In 1951, his body was transferred from Rome to Livorno, where Mascagni finally received an official homage. On 7 December 1963, the centenary of Mascagni's birth, a plaque was erected in Rome on the Albergo del Sole where Mascagni stayed during the premiere of \"Cavalleria rusticana\".\nSelected works.\nProjects contemplated.\nDuring his long career, Mascagni contemplated writing many operas.

While Mercadante may not have retained the international celebrity of Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti or Gioachino Rossini beyond his own lifetime, he composed as prolifically as any of them, and his development of operatic structures, melodic styles and orchestration contributed significantly to the foundations upon which Giuseppe Verdi built his dramatic technique.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nMercadante was born out of wedlock in Altamura, near Bari in Apulia; his precise date of birth has not been recorded, but he was baptised on 17 September 1795. Mercadante studied flute, violin and composition at the conservatory in Naples, and organized concerts among his compatriots. The opera composer Gioachino Rossini said to the conservatory Director, Niccolo Zingarelli, \"My compliments, Maestro \u2013 your young pupil Mercadante begins where we finish\". In 1817 he was made conductor of the college orchestra, composing a number of symphonies, and concertos for various instruments \u2013 including six for flute about 1818\u20131819, and whose autograph scores are in the Naples conservatory, where they were presumably first performed with him as soloist.\nThe encouragement of Rossini led him to compose for the opera, where he won considerable success with his second such work (\"Violenza e Constanza\"), in 1820. His next three operas are more or less forgotten, but an abridged recording of \"Maria Stuarda, Regina di Scozia\" was issued by Opera Rara in 2006. His next opera, \"Elisa e Claudio\", was a huge success, and had occasional revivals in the twentieth century, most recently by Wexford Festival Opera in 1988.\nHe worked for a time in Vienna, in Madrid, in C\u00e1diz, and in Lisbon, but re-established himself in Italy in 1831. He was invited by Rossini to Paris in 1836, where he composed \"I Briganti\" for four of the best-known singers of the time, Giulia Grisi, Giovanni Battista Rubini, Antonio Tamburini and Luigi Lablache, all of whom worked closely with Bellini. While there, he had the opportunity to hear operas by Meyerbeer and Hal\u00e9vy, which imparted a strong influence on him, especially the latter's \"La Juive\". This influence took the form of greater stress on the dramatic side.\nReturn to Italy, 1831.\nWhen Mercadante returned to Italy after living in Spain and Portugal, Donizetti's music reigned supreme in Naples, an ascendancy which did not end until censorship problems with the latter's \"Poliuto\" caused a final break. But Mercadante's style began to shift with the presentation of \"I Normanni a Parigi\" at the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1832: \"It was with this score that Mercadante entered on the process of development in his musical dramaturgy which, in some aspects, actually presaged the arrival of Verdi, when he launched, from 1837 on, into master works of his artistic maturity: the so-called \"reform operas\".\nThe beginnings of the so-called \"reform movement\", of which Mercadante was part, arose from the publication of a manifesto by Giuseppe Mazzini which he wrote in 1836, the \"Filosofia della musica\".\nIn the period after 1831 he composed some of his most important works. These included \"Il giuramento\" which was premiered at La Scala to 11 march 1837. One striking and innovative characteristic of this opera has been noted:\n..it marks the first successful attempt in an Italian opera premiered in Italy of depriving the prima donna, or some other star singer, of her until-then inalienable right of having the stage to herself at the end. By doing this, Mercadante sounded what was to be the death knell of the age of bel canto.\nEarly in following year, while composing \"Elena da Feltre\" (which premiered in January 1839), Mercadante wrote to Francesco Florimo, laying out his ideas about how opera should be structured, following the \"revolution\" begun in his previous opera:\nI have continued the revolution I began in \"Il giuramento\": varied forms, cabalettas banished, crescendos out, vocal lines simplified, fewer repeats, more originality in the cadences, proper regard paid to the drama, orchestration rich but not so as to swamp the voices, no long solos in the ensembles (they only force the other parts to stand idle to the detriment of the action), not much bass drum, and a lot less brass band.\n\"Elena da Feltre\" followed; one critic found much to praise in it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A work of harmonic daring, subtlety and originally orchestrated, it suddenly makes sense of oft quoted comparisons between Mercadante and Verdi. It has the overall coherence one looks for and finds in middle and late Verdi \u2013 a surprising anticipation, for \"Elena da Feltre\" dates from 1838, the year before Verdi's first opera\nThese temporarily put him in the forefront of composers then active in Italy, although he was soon passed by Giovanni Pacini with \"Saffo\" and Giuseppe Verdi with several operas, especially \"Ernani\".\nLater works.\nSome of Mercadante's later works, especially \"Orazi e Curiazi\", were also quite successful. Many performances of his operas were given throughout the nineteenth century and it has been noted that some of them received far more than did Verdi's early operas over the same period of time.\nThroughout his life he generated more instrumental works than most of his contemporary composers of operas due to his lifelong preoccupation with orchestration, and, from 1840, his position as the Director of the Naples conservatory for the last thirty years of his life. From 1863 he was almost totally blind and dictated all his compositions.\nIn the decades after his death in Naples in 1870, his output was largely forgotten, but it has been occasionally revived and recorded since World War II, although it has yet to achieve anything like the present-day popularity of the most famous compositions by his slightly younger contemporaries: see Donizetti's compositions and Bellini's compositions.\nThe French soloist Jean-Pierre Rampal notably recorded several Mercadante concertos for flute and string orchestra, including the grand and romantic E minor concerto, which has since gained some popularity among concert flautists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

It was serialized in Shogakukan's manga magazine \"Big Comic Spirits\" from November 1980 to April 1987, with the chapters collected in 15 volumes. \"Maison Ikkoku\" is a romantic comedy involving a group of eccentric people who live in a boarding house in 1980s Tokyo. The story focuses primarily on the gradually developing relationships between Yusaku Godai, a poor student down on his luck, and Kyoko Otonashi, a young, recently widowed boarding house manager.\nThe manga was adapted into a 96-episode anime television series created by Studio Deen that ran on Fuji TV from March 1986 to March 1988. A \"Final Chapter\" movie, three original video animations (OVAs), and a music special were also produced, with a live-action film made by Toei in 1986. A live-action TV special aired in May 2007 on TV Asahi, with a finale aired in July 2008. Both the manga and anime have been released in North America by Viz Media.\n\"Maison Ikkoku\" has been both critically and commercially successful, with over 25 million copies in circulation.\nPlot.\nThe story mainly takes place at , a worn and aging boarding house in a fictional Tokyo ward called , where 20-year-old college applicant Yusaku Godai lives. Though honest and good-natured, he is weak-willed and often taken advantage of by the other residents of Maison Ikkoku, each with their offbeat and mischievous personalities: Yotsuya the voyeur, shameless Akemi Roppongi and the Ichinose family, primarily the alcoholic, gossiping stay-at-home mom Hanae Ichinose. As he is about to move out, he is stopped at the door by the beautiful Kyoko Otonashi (n\u00e9e Chigusa), who announces she will be taking over as the resident manager. Godai immediately falls in love with her and decides to stay. Godai and the other tenants find out that despite her young age, Kyoko is a widow: after she married her high school teacher Soichiro, he died shortly thereafter. Godai empathizes with Kyoko and endeavors to free her from her sadness. He manages to work up enough courage to confess his love to her, and just as their nascent relationship begins to develop, Kyoko meets the rich, handsome and charming tennis coach Shun Mitaka at her neighborhood tennis club. Mitaka quickly declares his intention to court Kyoko and states that he is very patient, and can wait until her heart is ready.\nGodai, not willing to give up, continues to chase Kyoko, but through a series of misunderstandings, he is seen by Kyoko and Mitaka walking with the cute and innocent Kozue Nanao, who he had met previously at one of his many part-time jobs. For the rest of the series, Kozue is mistakenly perceived as Godai's girlfriend, including by Kozue herself. Angered by this, Kyoko begins to openly date Mitaka. Despite the misunderstandings, Kyoko and Godai clearly have feelings for each other, and their relationship continues to grow over the course of the series. Godai eventually manages to get into college and, with the help of the Otonashi family, he begins student-teaching at Kyoko's old high school. Almost mirroring Kyoko's first romance, Godai catches the attention of precocious and brazen student Ibuki Yagami, who immediately begins pursuing him. Her outspoken approach stands in stark contrast to Kyoko, which helps Kyoko face her feelings for Godai.\nMeanwhile, Mitaka's endeavors have been hindered by his phobia of dogs, as Kyoko owns a large white dog named Soichiro in honor of her late husband. He eventually overcomes his phobia but, when he is about to propose to Kyoko, his family begins to goad him into an arranged marriage with the pure and innocent heiress Asuna Kujo. Feeling the pressure, Mitaka begins to pursue Kyoko with increased aggression. He slowly realizes that she has decided on Godai and is waiting for him to find a job and propose. Mitaka is completely pulled out of the race following a drunken night, after which he misremembers sleeping with Asuna. When she later announces a pregnancy, he takes responsibility and proposes to Asuna, but finds out too late that it was her dog who was pregnant and not her; however he fully realizes that he has loved her since their first meeting and promises to never make her feel second-best in their marriage.\nAs things begin to really go well for Godai, Kozue Nanao makes a reappearance in his life. Kozue tells Godai and the other Maison Ikkoku tenants that she is thinking of marrying another man, and when Godai said he is planning his own proposal, Kozue misunderstands and believes he intends to propose to her. Kyoko, feeling foolish and betrayed, slaps Godai and demands that he move out. When Godai refuses, he wakes up the next morning to find she has left, moving in with her parents and leaving her room empty. Godai tries to explain himself by visiting Kyoko every day, but she refuses to answer the door or grant him an audience. After her rage cools, Kyoko checks on Maison Ikkoku and runs into the other tenants. They try to convince her to return.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe woman I love ... burns with jealousy, leaps to conclusions, and turns to ice. But when she laughs ... the world is mine.\n\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Yusaku Godai (Rumiko Takahashi, tr. Gerard Jones), Chapter 152\nThe libertine Akemi, sensing that Kyoko is still hesitant, threatens to seduce Godai if Kyoko does not want him. She later tells the other tenants that she only said that to threaten Kyoko into coming back. However, this backfires when Kozue sees Godai leaving a love hotel with Akemi; innocently, he was called there only to cover the room fees. Before she learns the truth, Kozue accepts the marriage proposal from the other man. As Kyoko is about to return to Maison Ikkoku, she learns about the love hotel incident that has ended Godai's relationship with Kozue, but assumes he slept with Akemi. Kyoko insults Godai, tells him that she hates him, and runs away. Godai follows her, pleading that she does not trust him and that, despite the many misunderstandings he has had with other women, she never considered Godai's feelings. He passionately declares that he loves only her: from the first moment he saw Kyoko, she has been the only woman in his eyes. Kyoko finally decides to no longer hold back her feelings for Godai and the two consummate their love; the following morning, she happily confesses that she has been in love with him for the longest time. Having cleared his last barrier after securing a teaching job, Godai proposes to Kyoko and, with the blessings of both families, they get married. The story ends as Godai and Kyoko arrive home with their newborn daughter, Haruka, and Kyoko tells her that Maison Ikkoku is the place where they first met.\nProduction.\nTakahashi created \"Maison Ikkoku\" as a love story that could occur in the real world. She originally only wanted to start the series focusing on Kyoko and Godai's relationship before moving on to include the other tenants to have a \"human drama\", but said the love story attracted her more and took over. She had wanted to create a story about an apartment complex for some time, as when she lived in an apartment in Nakano during college, there was another decrepit apartment behind it. The strange actions of the people living there served as inspiration.\nIt was \"Big Comic Spirits\"'s editor-in-chief Katsuya Shirai who recruited Takahashi for the newly-launching manga magazine. Soichiro Suzuki, Takahashi's third editor on \"Maison Ikkoku\" beginning from the eighth or ninth chapter, explained that having a young up-and-coming female artist attracted much attention for the new magazine. Suzuki also said that Takahashi went with the romantic comedy genre for the new series because of the magazine's older reader demographic, but noted it still had the gag-like feel of \"Urusei Yatsura\" in the beginning. According to both Shirai and Suzuki, \"Maison Ikkoku\" was popular right from the start.\nTakahashi created \"Maison Ikkoku\" simultaneously alongside the weekly \"Urusei Yatsura\". The newer manga's frequency changed as \"Big Comic Spirits\"'s did; it began as a monthly magazine, switched to bimonthly after six months, and became a weekly publication in 1986. In an interview during its serialization, Takahashi stated she usually took two days to create the story and draw rough drafts, and then took one night to finish them. At the time she had three female assistants, refusing to have males so that they would not be distracted. According to Suzuki, this increased to five assistants when it became a weekly serial. The series' title utilizes the French word (\"house\") and translates to \"The House of One-Moment\". The story occurs over a six-year period, approximate to the publication period of the series.\nMedia.\nManga.\nWritten and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, \"Maison Ikkoku\" was serialized in the manga magazine \"Big Comic Spirits\" as 162 chapters between November 15, 1980, and April 20, 1987. The chapters were collected and published in 15 volumes by Shogakukan from May 1, 1982, to July 1, 1987. The series has since been re-released in several different editions. A 10 volume edition was released between September 1, 1992, and June 1, 1993, 10 from 1996 to 1997, and 15 throughout 2007.\nNorth American publisher Viz Media originally released the series, adapted into English by Gerard Jones, in a monthly comic book format from June 1993. This release was collected in 14 graphic novels. The images were \"flipped\" to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored, and some chapters were out of order or completely missing. Four of the five missing chapters were published in \"Animerica Extra\" Vol. 3 Number 1 and Vol. 3 Number 2. Viz later re-released the series in its original format and chapter order across 15 volumes. These were released between September 24, 2003, and February 14, 2006. At New York Comic Con 2019, Viz announced that they would release \"Maison Ikkoku\" in a collector's edition, with the first volume released on September 15, 2020, and the tenth and last on December 27, 2022.\nRadio drama.\nA radio drama was broadcast on November 20, 1982, on NHK Radio 1 as part of an episode of the \"Radio Comics\" program. The segment was hosted by Y\u016b Mizushima and Keiko Yokozawa, and featured manga artist Jun Ishiko as a guest. It also included an interview with Rumiko Takahashi by Mizushima. The music for the episode was composed by Ichirou Mizuki. It featured Mari Okamoto as Kyoko, Kazuhiko Inoue as Godai, Midori Kat\u014d as Hanae Ichinose, Yusaku Yara as Yotsuya, Eiko Hisamura as Akemi, and was narrated by Junpei Takiguchi.\nAnime.\n\"Maison Ikkoku\" was adapted into a ninety-six episode anime television series by Studio Deen and aired on Fuji TV from March 26, 1986, to March 2, 1988. The series was directed by Kazuo Yamazaki for the first 26 episodes, Takashi Anno from episode 27 until 52 and Naoyuki Yoshinaga for the remainder of the series. The production staff had previously worked on the anime adaption of Takahashi's previous work, \"Urusei Yatsura\". After production of that series was completed, the team moved straight onto \"Maison Ikkoku\" and the series took over \"Urusei Yatsura\"'s timeslot. A new HD remaster of the series has been created and released on two Blu-ray boxsets in Japan. The first box was released on December 25, 2013, and the second box followed on April 23, 2014.\nAn animated theatrical film titled \"The Final Chapter\" was released on February 6, 1988, as a double feature with \"Urusei Yatsura Movie 5: The Final Chapter\". On September 25, 1988, an original video animation \"Through the Passing Seasons\" that summarizes the story was released. A video titled \"Karaoke Music Parade\" and collecting all the TV anime's opening and ending animations was released in November 1989. \"Shipwrecked on Ikkoku Island\" was released on January 31, 1991, and adapts a story of the manga, while \"Prelude Maison Ikkoku: When the Cherry Blossoms Return in the Spring\" utilizes all the flashbacks of Kyoko's life before she moved to Maison Ikkoku and was released on June 25, 1992.\nThe anime was licensed for a North American release by Viz Media in 1994, and was put on two-episode VHS dub releases, but Viz dropped the English dub after 36 episodes. The remaining subtitled-only VHS releases went on until volume 32, without finishing the series. Viz released the series as 8 DVD boxsets from June 1, 2003, until June 4, 2006, with the latter episodes newly dubbed. In the newer episodes, Godai was given a new voice actor, as Jason Gray-Stanford was replaced by Brad Swaile. Other characters such as Kozue and Ikuko were also recast.\nLive-action.\nA live-action film adaptation of \"Maison Ikkoku\" was released on October 10, 1986, by the Toei Company. Directed by Shinichir\u014d Sawai and written by Y\u014dz\u014d Tanaka, the movie stars Mariko Ishihara as Kyoko Otonashi, Ken Ishiguro as Yusaku Godai and Masat\u014d Ibu as Yotsuya.\nA live-action TV special premiered on TV Asahi on May 12, 2007. It stars Taiki Nakabayashi as Yusaku and Misaki Ito as Kyoko. A finale to the show was aired on July 26, 2008, under the title \"Maison Ikkoku Kanketsuhen\" and featuring Akina Minami as Kozue Nanao and Ikki Sawamura as Shun Mitaka.\nMusic.\nBeginning in 1986, various collections of theme songs, incidental music, character albums, and music calendars were released on LP, cassette, CD, and VHS. Most of the albums were released through Kitty Records. A \"Maison Ikkoku Sound Theater\" series of 48 discs released the full soundtracks of all 96 episodes as audio dramas. An addition \"Sound Theater\" release contained audio from the \"Side Story: Ikkoku Island Flirtation Story\" and \"Prelude, When the Cherry Blossoms Return in the Spring\" OVAs.\nTwo box sets, \"Maison Ikkoku CD Single Memorial File\" and \"Maison Ikkoku Complete Music Box\", collected all of the theme songs and incidental music from the animated series.\nOther media.\nA couple video games based on \"Maison Ikkoku\" have been released, the first being developed by Microcabin, which was originally released in 1986 for the PC-9801 and PC Engine before being ported to the Famicom in 1988 by Bothtec. Microcabin also created in 1988 for the PC-9801 and MSX2. Three pachislot video games were also released in 2006, 2009 and 2012.\nThe series was featured in the music video \"I'm Alive\" of the American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, released in October 2020. The series was chosen due to the similarities of the female figure of the lyrics of the song to Kyoko Otonashi.\nReception.\n\"Maison Ikkoku\" has over 25 million collected volumes in circulation. In 2002, Christopher Macdonald, co-editor-in-chief of Anime News Network, wrote that while far from her most popular, \"Maison Ikkoku\" is considered by many to be Rumiko Takahashi's best work. Although all her titles have a romantic angle, he said that with its lack of supernatural elements or aliens, \"Maison Ikkoku\"'s simple premise of a university student who falls in love with his landlady is mundane in comparison, but it is this excellently crafted romantic story that makes it her greatest work. Macdonald wrote that what it does have in common with most of Takahashi's other works is \"absolute, unadulterated hilarity\", but this differs still in that it features hilarious situations that actually happen in the real world. Like Macdonald, Comics Beat's Morgana Santilli noted how \"Maison Ikkoku\" is an anomaly in Takahashi's bibliography as it contains no fantasy or magical elements, but does include her signature wacky romcom hijinks of \"jealous would-be lovers, plenty of pratfalls, and needlessly complicated misunderstandings\", which makes it just as charming and fun as more popular works like \"Ranma \u00bd\".\nJason Thompson claimed that while \"Maison Ikkoku\" was not the first men's love-com, it is \"almost certainly the best\" and definitely Takahashi's best work. He also stated that because the main character is a university student, \"Maison Ikkoku\" is \"slightly more sophisticated\" compared to \"Kimagure Orange Road\". Anime News Network (ANN) gave the manga an \"A\" for its story and an \"A\u2212\" for its art, stating that the series shows off Takahashi's skill; \"with a clear cut and rather simple plot, she is able to concentrate on the characters, using them to drive the story, while at the same time ensuring the proper reader reaction intended for each scene.\" They remarked that the story focuses on Yusaku and Kyoko's relationship, with the other characters used only \"to create conflicts, exposition, and comedic relief.\"\nCommenting on the 2020 English release of the manga, Daryl Surat of \"Otaku USA\" wrote \"After decades of \"Maison Ikkoku\" derivatives, the original hit manga remains as delightful as it was back in the 1980s.\" He also noted that unlike \"every other will-they-won't-they Rumiko Takahashi romantic comedy\", this one actually has an ending. Caitlin Moore of ANN called \"Maison Ikkoku\" \"timeless and universal\" and the most grounded and straightforward romance in Takahashi's oeuvre, where, although it is clear from the start who the main couple is and that they will fall in love by the end, it is not clear how that will happen. With Kyoko a widow, she called the manga one of the best portrayals of the slow and messy nature of the grieving process. Although she noted the art as dated, Moore felt it still holds up well with its simple but expressive designs, and that the suburban Tokyo setting gives a timeless feeling. Calling Viz's older translation \"punchy, but not super faithful\", she called the new one a good balance between faithful to the Japanese and natural-reading English. Moore finished her review with \"I have long considered \"Maison Ikkoku\" one of the greatest love stories of all time, but it's so much more than that. It's a romance, a comedy, a coming-of-age story, a story of loss and recovery.\" Right Stuf Inc. called \"Maison Ikkoku\" a classic rom-com that has many of the strengths of modern sitcoms and praised the back-and-forth between characters as always hilarious and the romance between Godai and Kyoko as both nuanced and sweet. They described the art as giving the characters \"a comedic whimsy\", and opined that \"good art is never dated, because good art is timeless.\"\nANN's Allen Divers wrote positive reviews of the anime, saying \"The beauty of \"Maison Ikkoku\" is the fact that the entire cast feels dynamic enough that each could be the center of an episode without pulling away from the main idea of the series.\" and called it a must-see for fans of romantic comedies. Melissa Sternenberg of THEM Anime Reviews gave the show a perfect five star rating, calling the development between the two main characters refreshing and praising the supporting cast for reacting to what happens around them. Although she did point out the music and sound effects might seem dated. She finished saying \"There may never be 'the greatest anime series of all time,' but I would bet a good amount of money that this series would be on most (respected) anime viewers' top five lists.\" TV Asahi released two Top 100 Anime lists in 2005; \"Maison Ikkoku\" came in 80 on the nationwide survey of multiple age-groups, and 89 on the web poll. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw \"Maison Ikkoku\" named Takahashi's third best animated work.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37934", "revid": "51007506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37934", "title": "Gaetano Donizetti", "text": "Italian opera composer (1797\u20131848)\nDomenico Gaetano Maria Donizetti (29 November 1797 \u2013 8 April 1848) was an Italian Romantic composer, best known for his over 70 operas. Along with Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini, he was a leading composer of the \"bel canto\" opera style during the first half of the nineteenth century and a probable influence on other composers such as Giuseppe Verdi. Donizetti was born in Bergamo in Lombardy. At an early age he was taken up by Simon Mayr who enrolled him with a full scholarship in a school which he had set up. There he received detailed musical training. Mayr was instrumental in obtaining a place for Donizetti at the Bologna Academy, where, at the age of 19, he wrote his first one-act opera, the comedy \"Il Pigmalione\", which may never have been performed during his lifetime.\nAn offer in 1822 from Domenico Barbaja, the impresario of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, which followed the composer's ninth opera, led to his move to Naples and his residency there until production of \"Caterina Cornaro\" in January 1844. In all, 51 of Donizetti's operas were presented in Naples. Before 1830, success came primarily with his comic operas, the serious ones failing to attract significant audiences. His first notable success came with an \"opera seria\", \"Zoraida di Granata\", which was presented in 1822 in Rome. In 1830, when \"Anna Bolena\" was first performed, Donizetti made a major impact on the Italian and international opera scene shifting the balance of success away from primarily comedic operas, although even after that date, his best-known works included comedies such as \"L'elisir d'amore\" (1832) and \"Don Pasquale\" (1843). Significant historical dramas did succeed; they included \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" (the first to have a libretto written by Salvadore Cammarano) given in Naples in 1835, and one of the most successful Neapolitan operas, \"Roberto Devereux\" in 1837. Up to that point, all of his operas had been set to Italian libretti.\nDonizetti found himself increasingly chafing against the censorship limitations in Italy (and especially in Naples). From about 1836, he became interested in working in Paris, where he saw greater freedom to choose subject matter, in addition to receiving larger fees and greater prestige. From 1838, beginning with an offer from the Paris Op\u00e9ra for two new works, he spent much of the following 10 years in that city, and set several operas to French texts as well as overseeing staging of his Italian works. The first opera was a French version of the then-unperformed \"Poliuto\" which, in April 1840, was revised to become \"Les martyrs\". Two new operas were also given in Paris at that time. Throughout the 1840s Donizetti moved between Naples, Rome, Paris, and Vienna, continuing to compose and stage his own operas as well as those of other composers. From around 1843, severe illness began to limit his activities. By early 1846 he was obliged to be confined to an institution for the mentally ill and, by late 1847, friends had him moved back to Bergamo, where he died in April 1848 in a state of mental derangement due to neurosyphilis.\nEarly life and musical education in Bergamo and Bologna.\nThe youngest of three sons, Donizetti was born in 1797 in the Borgo Canale quarter of Bergamo, located just outside the city walls. His family was very poor and had no tradition of music, his father Andrea being the caretaker of the town pawnshop. Simone Mayr, a German composer of internationally successful operas, had become \"maestro di cappella\" at Bergamo's principal church in 1802. He founded the Lezioni Caritatevoli school in Bergamo (now the Conservatorio Gaetano Donizetti) in 1805 for the purpose of providing musical training, including classes in literature, beyond what choirboys ordinarily received up until the time that their voices broke. In 1807, Andrea Donizetti attempted to enroll both his sons, but the elder, Giuseppe (then 18), was considered too old. Gaetano (then 9) was accepted.\nWhile not especially successful as a choirboy during the first three trial months of 1807 (there being some concern about a \"difetto di gola\", a throat defect), Mayr was soon reporting that Gaetano \"surpasses all the others in musical progress\" and he was able to persuade the authorities that the young boy's talents were worthy of keeping him in the school. He remained there for nine years, until 1815.\nHowever, as Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook notes, in 1809 he was threatened with having to leave because his voice was changing. In 1810 he applied for and was accepted by the local art school, the Academia Carrara, but it is not known whether he attended classes. Then, in 1811, Mayr once again intervened. Having written both libretto and music for a \"pasticcio-farsa\", \"Il piccolo compositore di musica\", as the final concert of the academic year, Mayr cast five young students, among them his young pupil Donizetti as \"the little composer\". As Ashbrook states, this \"was nothing less than Mayr's argument that Donizetti be allowed to continue his musical studies\".\nThe piece was performed on 13 September 1811 and included the composer character stating the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ah, by Bacchus, with this aria / I'll have universal applause. / They'll say to me, \"Bravo, Maestro! / I, with a sufficiently modest air, / Will go around with my head bent... / I'll have eulogies in the newspaper / I know how to make myself immortal.\nIn reply to the chiding which comes from the other four characters in the piece after the \"little composer\" 's boasts, in the drama the \"composer\" responds with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have a vast mind, swift talent, ready fantasy\u2014and I'm a thunderbolt at composing.\nThe performance also included a waltz which Donizetti played and for which he received credit in the libretto. In singing this piece, all five young men were given opportunities to show off their musical knowledge and talent.\nThe following two years were somewhat precarious for the young Donizetti: the 16-year-old created quite a reputation for what he did do\u2014which is regularly to fail to attend classes\u2014and also for what he did instead, which was to make something of a spectacle of himself in the town.\nHowever, in spite of all this, Mayr not only persuaded Gaetano's parents to allow him to continue studies, but also secured funding from the Congregazione di Carit\u00e0 in Bergamo for two years of scholarships. In addition, he provided the young musician with letters of recommendation to both the publisher Giovanni Ricordi as well as to the Marchese Francesco Sampieri in Bologna (who would find him suitable lodging) and where, at the Liceo Musicale, he was given the opportunity to study musical structure under the Padre Stanislao Mattei.\nIn Bologna, he would justify the faith which Mayr had placed in him. Author John Stewart Allitt describes his 1816 \"initial exercises in operatic style\", the opera \"Il pigmalione\", as well as his composition of portions of \"Olympiade\" and \"L'ira d'Achille\" in 1817, as no more than \"suggest[ing] the work of a student\". Encouraged by Mayr to return to Bergamo in 1817, he began his \"quartet years\" as well as composing piano pieces and, most likely, being a performing member of quartets where he would have also heard music of other composers. In addition, he began seeking employment.\nCareer as an opera composer.\n1818\u20131822: early compositions.\nAfter extending his time in Bologna for as long as he could, Donizetti was forced to return to Bergamo since no other prospects appeared. Various small opportunities came his way and, at the same time, he made the acquaintance of several of the singers appearing during the 1817/18 Carnival season. Among them was the soprano Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis and her husband, the bass Giuseppe de Begnis.\nA coincidental meeting around April 1818 with an old school friend, Bartolomeo Merelli (who was to go on to a distinguished career), led to an offer to compose the music from a libretto which became \"Enrico di Borgogna\". Without a commission from any opera house, Donizetti decided to write the music first and then try to find a company to accept it. He was able to do so when , the impresario of the Teatro San Luca (an early theatre built in 1629, which later became the Teatro Goldoni) in Venice accepted it. Thus \"Enrico\" was presented on 14 November 1818, but with little success, the audience appearing to be more interested in the newly re-decorated opera house rather than the performances, which suffered from the last-minute withdrawal of the soprano Adelaide Catalani due to stage fright and the consequent omission of some her music. Musicologist and Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook provides a quotation from a review in the \"Nuovo osservatore veneziano\" of 17 November in which the reviewer notes some of these performance issues which faced the composer, but he adds: \"one cannot but recognize a regular handling and expressive quality in his style. For these the public wanted to salute Signor Donizetti on stage at the end of the opera.\"\nFor Donizetti, the result was a further commission and, using another of Merelli's librettos, this became the one-act, \"Una follia\" which was presented a month later. However, with no other work forthcoming, the composer once again returned to Bergamo, where a cast of singers made up from the Venice production the month before, presented \"Enrico di Borgogna\" in his home town on 26 December. He spent the early months of 1819 working on some sacred and instrumental music, but little else came of his efforts until the latter part of the year when he wrote \"Il falegname di Livonia\" from a libretto by Gherardo Bevilacqua-Aldobrandini. The opera was given first at the Teatro San Samuele in Venice in December. Other work included expansion of \"Le nozze in villa\", a project which he had started in mid-1819, but the opera was not presented until the carnival season of 1820/21 in Mantua. Little is known about it except its lack of success and the fact that the score has totally disappeared.\n1822\u20131830: Rome, Naples, Milan.\nSuccess in Rome.\nAfter these minor compositions under the commission of Paolo Zancla, Donizetti retreated to Bergamo once again to examine how he could make his career move along. From the point of view of Donizetti's evolving style, Ashbrook states that, in order to please the opera-going public in the first quarter of the 19th century, it was necessary to cater to their tastes, to make a major impression at the first performance (otherwise there would be no others), and to emulate the preferred musical style of the day, that of Rossini whose music \"was the public's yardstick when they were assessing new scores\".\nRemaining in Bergamo until October 1821, the composer busied himself with a variety of instrumental and choral pieces, but during that year, he had been in negotiation with Giovanni Paterni, intendant of the Teatro Argentina in Rome, and by 17 June had received a contract to compose another opera from a libretto being prepared by Merelli. It is unclear as to how this connection came about: whether it had been at Merelli's suggestion or whether, as William Ashbrook speculates, it had been Mayr who had initially been approached by Paterni to write the opera but who, due to advancing age, had recommended his prize pupil. This new \"opera seria\" became Donizetti's \"Zoraida di Granata\", his ninth work. The libretto had been started by August and, between then and 1 October, when Donizetti was provided with a letter of introduction from Mayr to Jacopo Ferretti, the Roman poet and librettist who was later to feature in the young composer's career, much of the music had been composed.\nThe twenty-four-year-old composer arrived in Rome on 21 October, but plans for staging the opera were plagued with a major problem: the tenor cast in the major role died a few days before the opening night on 28 January 1822 and the role had to be re-written for a \"musico\", a mezzo-soprano singing a male role, a not uncommon feature of the era and of Rossini's operas. Opening night was a triumph for Donizetti; as reported in the weekly \"Notizie del giorno\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A new and very happy hope is rising for the Italian musical theatre. The young Maestro Gaetano Donizetti...has launched himself strongly in his truly serious opera, \"Zoraida\". Unanimous, sincere, universal was the applause he justly collected from the capacity audience...\nDonizetti moves to Naples.\nSoon after 19 February, Donizetti left Rome for Naples, where he was to settle for a large part of his life. It appears that he had asked Mayr for a letter of introduction, but his fame had preceded him for, on 28th, the announcement of the summer season at the Teatro Nuovo in the \"Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie\" stated that it would include a Donizetti opera, describing the composer as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a young pupil of one of the most valued Maestros of the century, Mayer (\"sic\"), a large part of whose glory might be called ours, he having modeled his style on that of the great luminaries of the musical art sprung up among us. [His opera in Rome] was accepted with the most flattering applause.\nNews of this work impressed Domenico Barbaja, the prominent intendant of the Teatro San Carlo and other royal houses in the city such as the smaller Teatro Nuovo and the Teatro del Fondo. By late March Donizetti had been offered a contract not only to compose new operas, but also to be responsible for preparing performances of new productions by other composers whose work had been given elsewhere. On 12 May the first new opera, \"La zingara\", was given at the Nuovo \"with hot enthusiasm\", as scholar Herbert Weinstock states.\nIt ran for 28 consecutive evenings, followed by 20 more in July, receiving high praise in the \"Giornale\". One of the later performances became the occasion for Donizetti to meet the then-21-year-old music student, Vincenzo Bellini, an event recounted by Francesco Florimo some sixty years later.\nThe second new work, which appeared six weeks later on 29 June, was a one-act \"farsa\", \"La lettera anonima\". Ashbrook's comments\u2014which reinforce those of the \"Giornali\" critic who reviewed the work on 1 July\u2014recognize an important aspect of Donizetti's burgeoning musical style: [he shows that] \"his concern with the dramatic essence of opera rather than the mechanical working out of musical formulas was, even at this early stage, was already present and active\".\nLate July 1822 to February 1824: assignments in Milan and Rome.\nOn 3 August for what would become \"Chiara e Serafina, ossia I pirati\", Donizetti entered into a contract with librettist Felice Romani, but he was over-committed and unable to deliver anything until 3 October. The premiere had been scheduled for only about three weeks away and, due to the delays and illnesses among the cast members, it did not receive good reviews, although it did receive a respectable 12 performances.\nReturning north via Rome, Donizetti signed a contract for performances of \"Zoraida\" by the Teatro Argentina which included the requirement that the libretto to be revised by Ferretti, given Donizetti's low opinion of the work of the original Neapolitan librettist, Andrea Leone Tottola: he referred to it as \"a great barking\". In addition to the revision, he committed to write another new opera for the Rome's Teatro Valle which would also be set to a libretto written by Ferretti. Donizetti finally returned to Naples by late March.\nImmediately busy in the spring months of 1823 with a cantata, an \"opera seria\" for the San Carlo, and an \"opera buffa\" for the Nuovo, Donizetti also had to work on the revised \"Zoraide\" for Rome. Unfortunately however, the music set for the San Carlo premiere of \"Alfredo il grande\" on 2 July was described in the \"Giornali\" as \"...one could not recognize the composer of \"La zingara\"\". It received only one performance, while his two-act \"farsa\", \"Il fortunato inganno\", given in September at the Teatro del Fondo, received only three performances.\nIn October and for the remainder of the year, he was back in Rome, where he spent time adding five new pieces to \"Zoraida\", which was performed at the Teatro Argentina on 7 January 1824. However, this version was less successful than the original. The second opera for Rome's Teatro Valle also had a libretto by Ferretti, one which has since been regarded as one of his best. It was the \"opera buffa\" \"L'ajo nell'imbarazzo\" (\"The Tutor Embarrassed\"), the premiere of which took place on 4 February 1824 and \"was greeted with wild enthusiasm [and] it was with this opera that [...] Donizetti had his first really lasting success\". Allitt notes that with a good libretto to hand, \"Donizetti never failed its dramatic content\" and he adds that \"Donizetti had a far better sense of what would succeed on the stage than his librettists\".\n1824\u20131830: Palermo and Naples.\nBack in Naples, he embarked upon his first venture into English Romanticism with the \"opera semiseria\", \"Emilia di Liverpool\", which was given only seven performances in July 1824 at the Nuovo. The critical reaction in the \"Giornali\" some months later focused on the weaknesses of the \"semiseria\" genre itself, although it did describe Donizetti's music for \"Emilia\" as \"pretty\". The composer's activities in Naples became limited because 1825 was a Holy Year in Rome and the death of Ferdinand I in Naples caused little or no opera to be produced in either city for a considerable time.\nHowever, he did obtain a year-long position for the 1825/26 season at the Teatro Carolino in Palermo, where he became musical director (as well teaching at the Palermo Conservatory). There, he staged his 1824 version of \"L'ajo nell'imbarazzo\" as well as his new opera \"Alahor in Granata\". But overall, his experience in Palermo does not appear to have been pleasant, mainly because of the poorly managed theatre, the continual indisposition of singers, or their failure to appear on time. These issues caused a delay until January 1827 for the premiere of \"Alahor\", after which he went back in Naples in February, but with no specific commitments until midsummer.\nThat summer was to see the successful presentations at the Teatro Nuovo of the adapted version of \"L'ajo nell'imbarazzo\" given as \"Don Gregorio\" and, a month later, a one-act \"melodramma\" or opera, \"Elvida\", a \"pi\u00e8ce d'occasion\" for the birthday of Queen Maria of the Two Sicilies, which contained some florid music for the tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini; but it only received three performances.\nWriter John Stewart Allitt observes that, by 1827/28, three important elements in Donizetti's professional and personal life came together: Firstly, he met and began to work with the librettist Domenico Gilardoni, who wrote eleven librettos for him, beginning with \"Otto mesi in due ore\" in 1827 and continuing until 1833. Gilardoni shared with the composer a very good sense of what would work on stage. Next, the Naples impresario Barbaja engaged him to write twelve new operas during the following three years. In addition, he was to be appointed to the position of Director of the Royal Theatres of Naples beginning in 1829, a job that the composer accepted and held until 1838. Like Rossini, who had occupied this position before him, Donizetti was free to compose for other opera houses. Finally, in May 1827 he announced his engagement to Virginia Vasselli, the then 18-year-old daughter of the Roman family who had befriended him there.\nThe couple were married in July 1828 and immediately settled in a new home in Naples. Within two months he had written another \"opera semiseria\", \"Gianni di Calais\", from a libretto by Gilardoni. It was their fourth collaboration, and became a success not only in Naples but also in Rome over the 1830/31 season. Writing about the Naples premiere, the correspondent of the \"Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano\" stated: \"The situations that the libretto offers are truly ingenious and do honour to the poet, Gilardoni. Maestro Donizetti has known how to take advantage of them...\", thus reaffirming the growing dramatic skills displayed by the young composer.\n1830\u20131838: international fame.\nIn 1830, Donizetti scored his most acclaimed and his first international success with \"Anna Bolena\", given at the Teatro Carcano in Milan on 26 December 1830 with Giuditta Pasta in the title role. Also, the acclaimed tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini appeared in the role of Percy. With this opera, Donizetti achieved instant fame throughout Europe. Performances were staged \"up and down the Italian peninsula\" between 1830 and 1834 and then throughout Europe's capitals well into the 1840s, with revivals being presented up to about 1881. London was the first European capital to see the work; it was given at the King's Theatre on 8 July 1831.\nIn regard to which operatic form Donizetti was to have the greater success, when the semi-seria work of 1828, \"Gianni di Calais\", was given in Rome very soon after \"Anna Bolena\" had appeared, the \"Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano\" described the relationship between the two forms of opera and concluded that \"in two classes\u2014tragic and comic\u2014very close together...the former wins incomparably over the latter\". This appears to have solidified Donizetti's reputation as a composer of successful serious opera, although other comedies were to appear quite quickly.\nWith his commissions, the years from 1830 to 1835 saw a huge outpouring of work; \"L'elisir d'amore\", a comedy produced in 1832, came soon after \"Anna Bolena\"'s success and is deemed to be one of the masterpieces of 19th-century \"opera buffa\".\nThen came a rapid series of operas from Naples including \"Francesca di Foix\" (May 1831); \"La romanziera e l'uomo nero\" (June 1831); and \"Fausta\" (January 1832). Two new operas were presented in Milan: \"Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali\" (April 1831) and \"Ugo, conte di Parigi\" (March 1832). Rome presented \"Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo\" (January 1833) and \"Torquato Tasso\" (September 1833). \"Otto mesi in due ore\" (1833) was given in Livorno and \"Parisina\" (March 1833) was given in Florence.\nAfter the successful staging of \"Lucrezia Borgia\" in 1833, his reputation was further consolidated, and Donizetti followed the paths of both Rossini and Bellini by visiting Paris, where his \"Marin Faliero\" was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in March 1835. However, it suffered by comparison to Bellini's \"I puritani\" which appeared at the same time.\nDonizetti returned from Paris to oversee the staging of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" on 26 September 1835. It was set to a libretto by Salvadore Cammarano, the first of eight for the composer. The opera was based on \"The Bride of Lammermoor\", the novel by Sir Walter Scott, and it was to become his most famous opera, one of the high points of the \"bel canto\" tradition, the opera reaching a stature similar to that achieved by Bellini's \"Norma\".\nThis \"dramma tragico\" appeared at a time when several factors were moving Donizetti's reputation as a composer of opera to greater heights: Gioachino Rossini had recently retired and Vincenzo Bellini had died shortly before the premiere of \"Lucia\" leaving Donizetti as \"the sole reigning genius of Italian opera\". Not only were conditions ripe for Donizetti to achieve greater fame as a composer, but there was also an interest across the continent of Europe in the history and culture of Scotland. The perceived romance of its violent wars and feuds, as well as its folklore and mythology, intrigued 19th century readers and audiences, and Scott made use of these stereotypes in his novel.\nAt the same time, continental audiences of that time seemed to be fascinated by the Tudor period of 16th century English history, revolving as it does around the lives of King Henry VIII (and his six wives), Mary I of England (\"Bloody Mary\"), Queen Elizabeth I, as well as the doomed Mary, Queen of Scots. Many of these historical characters appear in Donizetti's dramas, operas which both preceded and followed \"Anna Bolena\". They were \"Elisabetta al castello di Kenilworth\", based on Scribe's \"Leicester\" and Hugo's \"Amy Robsart\" (given in Naples in July 1829 and revised in 1830). Then came \"Maria Stuarda\" (\"Mary Stuart\"), based on Schiller's play and given at La Scala in December 1835. It was followed by the third in the \"Three Donizetti Queens\" series, \"Roberto Devereux\", which features the relationship between Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex. It was given at the San Carlo in Naples in October 1837.\nAs Donizetti's fame grew, so did his engagements. He was offered commissions by both La Fenice in Venice\u2014a house he had not visited for about seventeen years and to which he returned to present \"Belisario\" on 4 February 1836. Just as importantly, after the success of his \"Lucia\" at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in Paris in December 1837, approaches came from the Paris Op\u00e9ra. As musicologists Roger Parker and William Ashbrook have stated, \"negotiations with Charles Duponchel, the director of the Op\u00e9ra, took on a positive note for the first time\" and \"the road to Paris lay open for him\", the first Italian to obtain a commission to write a real grand opera.\n1838\u20131840: Donizetti abandons Naples for Paris.\nIn October 1838, Donizetti moved to Paris vowing never to have dealings with the San Carlo again after the King of Naples banned the production of \"Poliuto\" on the grounds that such a sacred subject was inappropriate for the stage. In Paris, he offered \"Poliuto\" to the Op\u00e9ra and it was set to a new and expanded four-act French-language libretto by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe with the title, \"Les Martyrs\". Performed in April 1840, it was his first grand opera in the French tradition and was quite successful. Before leaving that city in June 1840, he had time to oversee the translation of \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" into \"Lucie de Lammermoor\" as well as to write \"La fille du r\u00e9giment\", his first opera written specifically to a French libretto. This became another success.\n1840\u20131843: back and forth between Paris, Milan, Vienna, and Naples.\nAfter leaving Paris in June 1840, Donizetti was to write ten new operas, although not all were performed in his lifetime. Before arriving in Milan by August 1840, he visited Switzerland and then his hometown of Bergamo, eventually reaching Milan where he was to prepare an Italian version of \"La fille du r\u00e9giment\". No sooner was that accomplished than he was back in Paris to adapt the never-performed 1839 libretto \"L'Ange de Nisida\" as the French-language \"La favorite\", the premiere of which took place on 2 December 1840. Then he rushed back to Milan for Christmas, but returned almost immediately and by late February 1841 was preparing a new opera, \"Rita, ou Deux hommes et une femme\". However, it was not staged until 1860.\nDonizetti returned once more to Milan where he stayed with the accommodating Giuseppina Appiano Stringeli with whom he had a pleasant time. Unwilling to leave Milan, but encouraged to return to Paris by Michele Accursi (with whom the composer was to be involved in Paris in 1843), he oversaw the December production of \"Maria Padilla\" at La Scala, and began writing \"Linda di Chamounix\" in preparation for March 1842 travels to Vienna, in which city he had been engaged by the royal court.\nDuring this time and prior to leaving for Vienna, he was persuaded to conduct the premiere of Rossini's \"Stabat Mater\" in Bologna in March 1842. Friends\u2014including his brother-in-law, Antonio Vasselli (known as Tot\u00f2)\u2014continually attempted to persuade him to take up an academic position in Bologna rather than the Vienna court engagement, if for no other reason that it would give the composer a base from which to work and teach and not be continually exhausting himself with travel between cities. But in a letter to Vasselli, he adamantly refused.\nWhen Donizetti went to Bologna for the \"Stabat Mater\", Rossini attended the third performance, and the two men\u2014each former students of the Bologna Conservatory\u2014met for the first time, with Rossini declaring that Donizetti was \"the only maestro in Italy capable of conducting my \"Stabat\" as I would have it\".\nArriving in Vienna in the Spring of 1842 with a letter of recommendation from Rossini, Donizetti became involved in rehearsals for \"Linda di Chamounix\", which was given its premiere in May and which was a huge success. In addition, he was appointed kapellmeister to the chapel of the royal court, the same post which had been held by Mozart.\nHe left Vienna on 1 July 1842 after the Spring Italian season, travelling to Milan, Bergamo (in order to see the now-aging Mayr, but where the deterioration of his own health became more apparent), and then on to Naples in August, a city he had not visited since 1838. A contract with the San Carlo remained unresolved. Also, it appears that he wished to sell his Naples house, but could not bring himself to go through with it, such was the sorrow which remained after his wife's death in 1837.\nHowever, on 6 September he was on his way back to Genoa from where he would leave for a three-month planned stay in Paris to be followed by time in Vienna once again. He wrote that he would work on translations of \"Maria Padilla\" and \"Linda di Chamounix\" and \"God knows what else I'll do\". During the time in Naples, his poor health was again a problem causing him to remain in bed for days at a time.\nArriving once again in Paris in late September 1842, he accomplished the revisions to the two Italian operas and he received a suggestion from Jules Janin, the newly appointed director of the \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien\", that he might compose a new opera for that house. Janin's idea was that it should be a new \"opera buffa\" and tailored to the talents of some major singers including Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache who had been hired. The result turned out to be the comic opera, \"Don Pasquale\", planned for January 1843. While preparations were underway, other ideas came to Donizetti and, discovering Cammarano's libretto for Giuseppe Lillo's unsuccessful 1839 \"Il Conte di Chalais\", he turned it into the first two acts of \"Maria di Rohan\" within twenty-four hours. Another opera with Scribe as librettist was in the works: it was to be \"Dom S\u00e9bastien, roi de Portugal\" planned for November 1843 in Paris.\nWhen \"Don Pasquale\" was presented on 3 January, it was an overwhelming success with performances continuing until late March. Writing in the \"Journal des d\u00e9bats\" on 6 January, the critic \u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze proclaimed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No opera composed expressly for the \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien\" has had a more clamorous success. Four or five numbers repeated, callings-out of the singers, callings-out of the Maestro\u2014in sum, one of those ovations...which in Paris are reserved for the truly great.\n1843\u20131845: Paris to Vienna to Italy; final return to Paris.\nBy 1843, Donizetti was exhibiting symptoms of syphilis and probable bipolar disorder: \"the inner man was broken, sad, and incurably sick\", states Allitt. Ashbrook observes that the preoccupation with work which obsessed Donizetti in the last months of 1842 and throughout 1843 \"suggests that he recognised what was wrong with him and that he wanted to compose as much as he could while he was still able\". But after the success in Paris, he continued working and left once again for Vienna, arriving there by mid-January 1843.\nShortly thereafter, he wrote to Antonio Vasselli outlining his plans for that year, concluding with the somewhat ominous: \"All of this with a new illness contracted in Paris, which has still not passed and for which I am awaiting your prescription.\" But, in the body of the letter, he lays out what he will be aiming to accomplish in 1843: in Vienna, a French drama; in Naples, a planned \"Ruy-Blas\" [but it was never composed]; in Paris for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, \"a Flemish subject\", and for the Op\u00e9ra, \"I am using a Portuguese subject in five acts\" (which was to be \"Dom S\u00e9bastien, Roi de Portugal\", and actually given on 13 November.) Finally, he adds \"and first I am remounting \"Les Martyrs\" which is creating a furor in the provinces\".\nHowever, by early February, he is already writing via an intermediary to Vincenzo Flauto, then the impresario at the San Carlo in Naples, in an attempt to break his agreement to compose for that house in July. He was increasingly becoming aware of the limitations which his poor health is imposing upon him. As it turned out, he was able to revive a half-completed work which had been started for Vienna, but only after receiving a rejection to his request to be released from his Naples' obligations did he work on finishing \"Caterina Cornaro\" by May for a production in Naples in January 1844, but without the composer being present. When it did appear, it was not very successful. As far as the work for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was concerned\u2014\"Ne m'oubliez moi\" it was to be called\u2014it appears that he was able to break his contract with that house, although he had already composed and orchestrated seven numbers.\nWork in Vienna.\nDonizetti's obligations in Vienna included overseeing the annual Italian season at the Theater am K\u00e4rntnertor which began in May. Verdi's \"Nabucco\" (which Donizetti had seen in Milan at its premiere in March 1842 and with which he had been impressed) was featured as part of that season. However, his main preoccupation was to complete the orchestration of \"Maria di Rohan\", which was accomplished by 13 February for planned performances in June. The season began with a very successful revival of \"Linda di Chamounix\". \"Nabucco\" followed, the first production of a Verdi opera in Vienna. The season also included \"Don Pasquale\" in addition to \"The Barber of Seville\". Finally, \"Maria di Rohan\" was given on 5 June. In reporting the reaction to this opera in a teasing letter to Antonio Vasselli in Rome, he tried to build suspense, stating that \"With the utmost sorrow, I must announce to you that last evening I have given my \"Maria di Rohan\" [and he names the singers]. All their talent was not enough to save me from \"a sea of [pause, space] \u2013 applause...Everything went well. Everything.\"\nReturn to Paris.\nReturning to Paris as quickly as possible, Donizetti left Vienna around 11 July 1843 in his newly purchased carriage and arrived on about 20th, immediately getting down to work on finishing \"Dom S\u00e9bastien\", which he describes as a massive enterprise: \"what a staggering spectacle...I am terribly wearied by this enormous opera in five acts which carries bags full of music for singing and dancing.\" It is his longest opera as well as the one on which he spent the most time.\nWith rehearsals in progress at the Op\u00e9ra for \"Dom S\u00e9bastien\", the first performance being planned for 13 November, the composer was also working on readying \"Maria di Rohan\" for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien on the following evening, 14 November. Both were successful, although author Herbert Weinstock states that \"the older opera was an immediate, unquestioned success with both audience and critics\". However, \"Maria di Rohan\" continued for 33 performances in all, whereas \"Dom S\u00e9bastien\" remained in the repertory until 1845 with a total of 32 performances.\n1844: in Vienna.\nOn 30 December 1843, Donizetti was back in Vienna, having delayed leaving until the 20th because of illness. Ashbrook comments on how he was viewed in that city, with \"friends notic[ing] an alarming change in his physical condition\", and with his ability to concentrate and simply to remaining standing often being impaired.\nHaving entered into a contract with L\u00e9on Pillet of the Op\u00e9ra for a new work for the coming year, he found nothing to be suitable and immediately wrote to Pillet proposing that another composer take his place. While waiting to see if he could be relieved from writing a large-scale work if Giacomo Meyerbeer would allow \"Le Proph\u00e8te\" to be staged instead that autumn, he looked forward to the arrival of his brother from Turkey in May and to the prospect of their traveling to Italy together that summer. Eventually, it was agreed that his commitment to the Op\u00e9ra could be postponed until November 1845.\nWhile taking care of some of his obligations to the Viennese court, for the remainder of the month he awaited news on the outcome of the 12 January premiere of \"Caterina Cornaro\" in Naples. By the 31st (or 1 February), he learned the truth: it had been a failure. What was worse were the rumours that it was not in fact Donizetti's work, although a report from Guido Zavadini suggested that it was probably a combination of elements which caused the failure, including the singers' difficulty in finding the right tone in the absence of the maestro, plus the heavily censored libretto. Primarily, however, the opera's failure appears to have been due to the maestro's absence, because he was unable to be present to oversee and control the staging, normally one of Donizetti's strengths.\nThe Italian season in Vienna, which included Bellini's \"Norma\" and revivals of \"Linda di Chamounix\" and of \"Don Pasquale\", also included the first production there of Verdi's \"Ernani\". Donizetti had made a promise to Giacomo Pedroni of the publishing house Casa Ricordi to oversee the production of the opera, which was given on 30 May with Donizetti conducting. The result was a very warm letter from Giuseppe Verdi entrusting the production to his care; it concluded: \"With the most profound esteem, your most devoted servant, G. Verdi.\"\nSummer/Autumn 1844: travel to and within Italy.\nGaetano's brother Giuseppe, on leave from Constantinople, arrived in Vienna in early June. He had intended to leave by about 22nd, but Gaetano's bout of illness delayed his departure, and the brothers traveled together to Bergamo on about 12 or 13 July proceeding slowly but arriving around the 21st.\nWilliam Ashbrook describes the second half of 1844 as a period of \"pathetic restlessness\". He continues: \"Donizetti went to Bergamo, Lovere on Lake Iseo [about 26 miles from Bergamo], back to Bergamo, to Milan [31 July], to Genoa [with his friend Antonio Dolci, on 3 August, where they stayed until 10 August because of illness], to Naples [by steamer, from which he wrote to Vasselli in Rome explaining that the upcoming visit may be last time he would see his brother], [then] to Rome [on 14 September to see Vasselli], back to Naples [on 2 October after being invited back to Naples for the first San Carlo performances of \"Maria di Rohan\" on 11 November, which was immensely successful], to Genoa [on 14 November by boat; arrived on the 19th] and on to Milan again [for two days]\" before reaching Bergamo on 23 November, where his found his old friend Mayr to be very ill. He delayed his departure for as long as possible, but Mayr died on 2 December, shortly after Donizetti had left Bergamo.\nDecember 1844 \u2013 July 1845: last visit to Vienna.\nBy 5 December he was in Vienna writing a letter to his friend Guglielmo Cottrau on 6th and again on 12th, stating \"I am not well. I am in the hands of a doctor.\" While there were periods of relative calm, his health continued to fail him periodically and then there were relapses into depression, as expressed in a letter: \"I am half-destroyed, it's a miracle that I'm still on my feet.\"\nWriting to unnamed Paris friends on 7 February, even after the very positive reaction received at the premiere of a specially prepared \"Dom S\u00e9bastien\" on 6 February 1845 (which he had conducted for three performances of the total of 162 given over the following years until 1884), he grumbles about the reactions of the Parisian audiences and continues with a brief report on his health which, he says, \"if it is no better and this continues, I'll find myself forced to go to spend some months resting in Bergamo.\" At the same time, he rejected offers to compose, one offer coming from London and requiring an opera four months away; the objection of having limited time was given. Other appeals came from Paris, one directly from Vatel, the new impresario of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien, who traveled to Vienna to see the composer. As other biographers also note, there is an increasing sense that, during 1845, Donizetti became more and more aware of the real state of his health and the limitations it has begun to impose on his activities. Other letters into April and May reveal much of the same, and the fact that he did not attend the opening performance of Verdi's \"I due Foscari\" on 3 April, finally seeing it only at its fourth performance, confirms that.\nBy the end of May, no decision as what to do or where to go had been made, but\u2014finally\u2014he decided on Paris where he would claim a forfeit from the Op\u00e9ra for the non-production of \"Le duc d'Albe\", his unfulfilled second commission from 1840 which, although still unfinished, had a completed libretto. He left Vienna for the last time on 10 July 1845.\n1845\u20131848: return to Paris; declining health; return to Bergamo; death.\nBy the time he reached Paris, Donizetti had been suffering from malaises, headaches, and nausea for decades, but had never been formally treated. In early August, he initiated a lawsuit against the Op\u00e9ra which dragged on until April 1846 and in which he prevailed.\nThe culmination of the crisis in Donizetti's health came in August 1845 when he was diagnosed with cerebro-spinal syphilis and severe mental illness. Two doctors, including Dr. Philippe Ricord (a specialist in syphilis), recommended that, along with various remedies, he abandon work altogether and both agreed that the Italian climate would be better for his health. But letters to friends reveal two things: that he continued to work on \"Gemma di Vergy\" that autumn for its performance in Paris on 16 December, and that he revealed a lot about the progression of his illness.\nAs his condition worsened, the composer's brother Giuseppe dispatched his son Andrea to Paris from Constantinople. Arriving there on 25 December, Andrea lodged at the H\u00f4tel Manchester with his uncle, but immediately consulted Dr. Ricord on his uncle's condition. Ricord recorded his opinion in mid-January that, while it ultimately might be better for the composer's health for him to be in Italy, it was not advisable for him to travel until the spring. Consulting two additional doctors as well as Dr. Ricord, Andrea received their written opinion after an examination on 28 January 1846. In summary, it stated that the doctors \"believe that M. Donizetti no longer is capable of calculating sanely the significance of his decisions\".\nInstitutionalization.\nIn February 1846, reluctant to consider going further towards institutionalization, he relied on the further advice of two of the doctors who had examined his uncle in late January. They stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We...certify that M. Gaetan (\"sic\") Donizetti is the victim of a mental disease that brings disorder into his actions and his decisions; that it is to be desired in the interest of his preservation and his treatment that he be isolated in an establishment devoted to cerebral and intellectual maladies.\nTherefore, Andrea agreed to allow his uncle to be taken to a facility which has been described as \"resemb[ling] that of a health spa... with a central hospital more-or-less in the guise of a country house\" and Donizetti left Paris by coach with Andrea, believing that they were travelling to Vienna, where he was due by 12 February to fulfill his contract. Following behind in another coach was Dr. Ricord. After three hours they arrived at the Maison Esquirol in Ivry-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, where an explanation involving an accident was concocted to explain the need to spend the night at a \"comfortable inn\". Within a few days\u2014realizing that he was being confined\u2014Donizetti wrote urgent letters seeking help from friends, but they were never delivered. However, evidence provided from friends who visited Donizetti over the following months, states that he was being treated very well, the facility having a reputation for the care given to its patients. Various aggressive treatments were tried, and were described as having their \"successes, however fleeting\".\nBy the end of May, Andrea had decided that his uncle would be better off in the Italian climate, and three outside physicians were called in for their opinions. Their report concluded with the advice that he leave for Italy without delay. But, as Andrea began to make plans for his uncle's journey to and upkeep in Bergamo, he was forced by the Paris Prefect of Police to have his uncle undergo another examination by other physicians appointed by the Prefect. Their conclusion was the opposite of that of the previous doctors: \"we are of the opinion that the trip should be forbidden formally as offering very real dangers and being far from allowing hope of any useful result.\" With that, the Prefect informed Andrea that Donizetti could not be moved from Ivry. Andrea saw little use in remaining in Paris. He sought a final opinion from the three doctors practising at the clinic, and on 30 August, they provided a lengthy report outlining step-by-step the complete physical condition of their declining patient, concluding that the rigours of travel\u2014the jolting of the carriage, for example\u2014could bring on new symptoms or complications impossible to treat on such a journey. Andrea left for Bergamo on 7 (or 8) September 1846, taking with him a partial score of \"Le duc d'Albe\", the completed score of \"Rita\", and a variety of personal effects, including jewelry.\nAttempts to move Donizetti back to Paris.\nIn late December, early January 1847, visits from a friend from Vienna who lived in Paris\u2014Baron Eduard von Lannoy\u2014resulted in a letter from Lannoy to Giuseppe Donizetti in Constantinople outlining what he saw as a better solution: rather than have friends travel the five hours to see his brother, Lannoy recommended that Gaetano be moved to Paris where he could be taken care of by the same doctors. Giuseppe agreed and sent Andrea back to Paris, which he reached on 23 April. Visiting his uncle the following day, he found himself recognized. He was able to go on to convince the Paris Prefect, by threats of family action and general public concern, that the composer should be moved to an apartment in Paris. This took place on 23 June and, while there, he was able to take rides in his carriage and appeared to be much more aware of his surroundings. However, he was held under virtual house arrest by the police for several more months, although able to be visited by friends and even by Verdi while he was in Paris. Finally\u2014on 16 August\u2014in Constantinople, Giuseppe filed a formal complaint with the Austrian ambassador (given that the composer was an Austrian citizen).\nIn Paris, the police insisted on a further medical examination. Six doctors were called in and, of the six, only four approved of the travel. Then the police sent in their own doctor (who opposed the move), posted gendarmes outside the apartment, and forbade the daily carriage rides. Now desperate, Andrea then consulted three lawyers and sent detailed reports to his father in Constantinople. Finally, action taken by Count Sturmer of the Austrian Embassy in Turkey caused action to be taken from Vienna which, via the Embassy in Paris, sent a formal complaint to the French government. Within a few days, Donizetti was given permission to leave and he set out from Paris on what was to be a seventeen-day trip to Bergamo.\nFinal journey to Bergamo.\nArrangements had been made well ahead of time as to where Donizetti would live when he arrived in Bergamo. In fact, on his second visit to Paris, when it appeared that his uncle would return to Italy, Andrea had an agreement from the noble Scotti family for his uncle to be able to stay in their palace. The accompanying party of four consisted of Andrea, the composer's younger brother Francesco who had come specially from Bergamo for this purpose, Dr. Rendu, and nurse-custodian Antoine Pourcelot. They traveled by train to Amiens, then on to Brussels, after which they traveled in two coaches (one of which was Donizetti's, sent ahead to await the party). They crossed Belgium and Germany to Switzerland, crossing the Alps via the St Gotthard Pass, and came down into Italy arriving in Bergamo on the evening of 6 October, where they were welcomed by friends as well as the mayor.\nBased on the report of the accompanying doctor, Donizetti did not appear to have suffered from the journey. He was settled comfortably in a large chair, speaking very rarely or only in occasional monosyllables, and mostly remaining detached from everyone around him. However, when Giovannina Basoni (who eventually became Baroness Scotti) played and sang arias from the composer's operas, he did appear to pay some attention. On the other hand, when the tenor Rubini visited and, together with Giovannina, sang music from \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", Antonio Vasselli reported that there was no sign of recognition at all. This condition continued well into 1848, more or less unchanged until a serious bout of apoplexy occurred on 1 April followed by further decline and the inability to take in food. Finally, after the intense night of 7 April, Gaetano Donizetti died on the afternoon of 8 April.\nInitially Donizetti was buried in the cemetery of Valtesse but in 1875 his body was transferred to Bergamo's Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore near the grave of his teacher Simon Mayr.\nPersonal life.\nDuring the months he spent in Rome for the production of \"Zoraida\" Donizetti met the Vasselli family, with Antonio initially becoming a good friend. Antonio's sister Virginia was at that point 13. She became Donizetti's wife in 1828. She gave birth to three children, none of whom survived and, within a year of his parents' deaths\u2014on 30 July 1837\u2014she also died from what is believed to be cholera or measles, but Ashbrook speculates that it was connected to what he describes as a \"severe syphilitic infection.\"\nBy nine years, he was the younger brother of Giuseppe Donizetti, who had become, in 1828, Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music at the court of Sultan Mahmud II (1808\u20131839). The youngest of the three brothers was Francesco whose life was spent entirely in Bergamo, except for a brief visit to Paris during his brother's decline. He survived him by only eight months.\nCritical reception.\nAfter the death of Bellini, Donizetti was the most significant composer of Italian opera until Verdi. His reputation fluctuated, but since the 1940s and 1950s his work has been increasingly performed. His best known operas today are \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", \"La fille du r\u00e9giment\", \"L'elisir d'amore\" and \"Don Pasquale\". Giuseppe Mazzini praised Donizetti\u2019s operas for embodying the spirit of the Risorgimento, viewing them as expressions of Italian identity and cultural pride.\nDonizetti's compositions.\nDonizetti, a prolific composer, is best known for his operatic works, but he also wrote music in a number of other forms, including some church music, a number of string quartets, and some orchestral pieces. Altogether, he composed about 75 operas, 16 symphonies, 19 string quartets, 193 songs, 45 duets, 3 oratorios, 28 cantatas, instrumental concertos, sonatas, and other chamber pieces.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was produced by the American manufacturer Bell Helicopter and is closely related to the Model 206A JetRanger civilian helicopter.\nThe OH-58 was originally developed during the early 1960s as the \"D-250\" for the Light Observation Helicopter (LOH). While the rival Hughes OH-6 Cayuse was picked over Bell's submission in May 1965, the company refined its design to create the Model 206A, a variant of which it successfully submitted to the reopened LOH competition two years later. The initial model, designated by the service as the \"OH-58A\", was introduced in May 1969. Successive models followed, often with uprated engines, enhanced protection systems, and other improvements, culminating in the \"OH-58F\". Additional improvements, such as the \"OH-58X\", were proposed but not pursued.\nDuring the 1970s, the US Army became interested in pursuing an advanced scout helicopter, for which the OH-58 would be further developed, evaluated, and ultimately procured as the \"OH-58D Kiowa Warrior\". The OH-58D is equipped to perform armed reconnaissance missions and to provide fire support to friendly ground forces; it is equipped with a distinctive Mast Mounted Sight (MMS) containing various sensors for target acquisition and laser designation. Another visible feature present on most OH-58s are knife-like extensions above and below the cockpit that form part of the passive wire strike protection system. The early-build OH-58s were equipped with a two-bladed main rotor, while the OH-58D and newer variants have a four-bladed rotor.\nThe OH-58 was primarily produced for the United States Army, and deployed in the Vietnam War two months after its entry to service. The US Army made extensive use of various OH-58 models across numerous war zones over the decades, seeing active combat during the Gulf War, the invasion of Panama, and the War in Afghanistan among others. In 2017, the US Army withdrew its remaining OH-58s, using alternative rotorcraft such as the Boeing AH-64 Apache and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to fill the role. The OH-58 has been exported to Austria, Canada, Croatia, the Dominican Republic, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Greece. It has also been produced under license in Australia.\nDevelopment.\nLight Observation Helicopter (LOH).\nOn 14 October 1960, the United States Navy approached 25 helicopter manufacturers to request on behalf of the Army the submission of proposals for a Light Observation Helicopter (LOH). Bell Helicopter was one of the manufacturers approached, and chose to enter the competition along with 12 other manufacturers, including Hiller Aircraft and Hughes Tool Co., Aircraft Division. Bell's design was internally referred to as the \"D-250\", and would be officially designated as the \"YHO-4\". On 19 May 1961, Bell and Hiller were announced as winners of the design competition.\nBell developed the D-250 design into the \"Model 206\", while the HO-4 designation was changed to \"YOH-4A\" in 1962, and produced five prototype aircraft for the Army's test and evaluation phase. On 8 December 1962, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. The YOH-4A was also called the \"Ugly Duckling\" in comparison to other contending aircraft. After a fly off of the Bell, Hughes and Fairchild-Hiller prototypes, the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse was selected in May 1965.\nWhen the YOH-4A was rejected by the Army, Bell went about solving the problem of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the image problem, the helicopter lacked cargo space and only provided cramped quarters for the planned three passengers in the back. The solution was a fuselage redesigned to be more sleek and aesthetic, adding of cargo space in the process. The redesigned aircraft was designated as the \"Model 206A\", and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the \"JetRanger\" denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J \"Ranger\".\nIn 1967, the Army reopened the LOH competition for bids because Hughes Tool Co. Aircraft Division could not meet the contractual production demands. Bell resubmitted for the program using the Bell 206A. Fairchild-Hiller failed to resubmit their bid with the YOH-5A, which they had successfully marketed as the FH-1100. In the end, Bell underbid Hughes to win the contract and the Bell 206A was designated as the OH-58A. Following the U.S. Army's naming convention for helicopters, the OH-58A was named \"Kiowa\" in honor of the Native American tribe.\nAdvanced Scout Helicopter.\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. Army began evaluating the need to improve the capabilities of their scout aircraft. Anticipating the AH-64A's replacement of the venerable AH-1, the Army began shopping the idea of an Aerial Scout Program to stimulate the development of advanced technological capabilities for night vision and precision navigation equipment. The stated goals of the program included prototypes that would: ...possess an extended target acquisition range capability by means of a long-range stabilized optical subsystem for the observer, improved position location through use of a computerized navigation system, improved survivability by reducing aural, visual, radar, and infrared signatures, and an improved flight performance capability derived from a larger engine to provide compatibility with attack helicopters.\nDuring March 1974, the Army created a special task force at Fort Knox to develop the system requirements; by the following year, the task force had devised the requirements for an Advanced Scout Helicopter (ASH) program. The requirements were formulated around an rotorcraft capable of performing in day, night, and adverse weather, and compatible with all advanced weapons systems planned for development and fielding into the 1980s. The program was approved by the System Acquisition Review Council and the Army prepared for competitive development to begin the next year. However, as the Army tried to get the program off the ground, Congress declined to provide funding in the fiscal year 1977 budget and the ASH Project Manager's Office (PM-ASH) was closed on 30 September 1976.\nWhile no development occurred for some years, the program survived as a requirement without funding. On 30 November 1979, the decision was made to defer development of an advanced scout helicopter in favor of modifying existing airframes in inventory as a near term scout helicopter (NTSH) option. The development of a mast-mounted sight would be the primary focus to improve the ability to perform reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition missions while remaining hidden behind trees and terrain. Both the UH-1 and the OH-58 were evaluated as NTSH candidates, but the UH-1 was dropped from consideration due to its larger size and ease of detection. The OH-58, on the other hand demonstrated a dramatic reduction in detectability with a Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS).\nOn 10 July 1980, the Army decided that the NTSH would be a competitive modification program based on developments in the commercial helicopter sector, particularly Hughes Helicopters' Hughes 500D, which had made major improvements over the OH-6.\nArmy Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP).\nThe Army's decision to acquire the NTSH resulted in the \"Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP)\". Both Bell Helicopter and Hughes Helicopters redesigned their scout aircraft to compete for the contract. Bell offered a more robust version of the OH-58 in their \"Model 406\", and Hughes offered an upgraded version of the OH-6. On 21 September 1981, Bell Helicopter Textron was awarded a development contract. On 6 October 1983, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, and the aircraft entered service two years later as the OH-58D.\nInitially intended for attack, cavalry, and artillery roles, the Army only approved a low initial production level and confined the OH-58D's role to field artillery observation. The Army also directed that a follow-on test be conducted to further evaluate it due to perceived deficiencies. On 1 April 1986, the Army formed a task force at Fort Rucker, Alabama, to remedy deficiencies in the AHIP. During 1988, the Army had planned to discontinue the OH-58D and focus on the LHX; however, Congress approved $138 million to expand the program, calling for the AHIP to operate with the Apache as a hunter/killer team; the AHIP would locate targets and the Apache would destroy them in a throwback to the traditional OH-58/AH-1 relationship.\nThe Secretary of the Army directed instead that the aircraft's armament systems be upgraded, based on experience with Task Force 118's performance operating armed OH-58Ds in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Prime Chance, and that the type be used primarily for scouting and armed reconnaissance. The armed aircraft would be known as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, denoting its new armed configuration. Beginning with the 202nd aircraft (s/n 89-0112) in May 1991, all remaining OH-58Ds were produced in the Kiowa Warrior configuration. During January 1992, Bell received its first retrofit contract to convert all remaining OH-58Ds to the Kiowa Warrior configuration.\nProduction.\nOverall 2,325 OH-58 were produced, with an additional 56 Bell 206B-1 also built. Production of new airframes for the A and B models ended in 1977, and the D model in 2000. Conversions of early models to the D standard continued afterward.\nDesign.\nThe Bell OH-58 Kiowa is a family of single-engine single-rotor military helicopters principally used for observation, utility, and direct fire support. The primary role of the original OH-58A was to identify targets for other platforms, such as the Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter and ground artillery; it lacked any armaments and weighed 1,451\u00a0kg (3,200\u00a0lb) when fully loaded, being able to carry a small amount of cargo or up to two passengers. While initial examples were reliant on the crew to conduct observations, later models were furnished with sophisticated sensors to precisely determine a target's location. Payload capacity was also increased considerably on later-build rotorcraft, the OH-58D Kiowa was designed to carry a maximum load of 2,495\u00a0kg, 72% more capacity than the original version.\nEarly Kiowas were fitted with a flexible twin-bladed main rotor; starting with the OH-58D, a four-bladed rigid main rotor was used. This was entirely composed of composite materials, the OH-58D was the first US Army rotorcraft to incorporate an all-composite main rotor hub. Later models were outfitted as light gunships, being equipped with various armaments, such as Stinger air-to-air missiles, a .50-caliber machine gun, podded 70mm Hydra rockets and AGM-114 Hellfire air to ground missiles. Other areas of improvement were the avionics and the cockpit; new navigation and communication systems were installed along with new and larger flight instrumentation, while all light sources were redesigned for compatibility with Night Vision Goggles (NVG). Later versions were outfitted with a glass cockpit, which retained conventional instrumentation as a fallback measure.\nThe OH-58D introduced perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Kiowa family \u2014 the Mast Mounted Sight (MMS), which resembles a beach ball perched above the rotor system. The MMS by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies has a gyro-stabilized platform containing a television system (TVS), a thermal imaging system (TIS), and a laser range finder/designator (LRF/D). These features gave the OH-58D the additional mission capability of target acquisition and laser designation in day or night, limited-visibility and adverse weather. In combination with the 1553 databus, the OH-58D being first US Army helicopter to be fielded with such equipment, target data from the sensors could be directly passed to precision-guided weapons.\nThe MMS was developed by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Huntington Beach, CA. Production took place primarily at facilities in Monrovia, CA. As a result of a merger with Boeing, and a later sale of the business unit, the program is currently owned and managed by DRS Technologies, with engineering support based in Cypress, CA, and production support taking place in Melbourne, FL. On the OH-58F, the MMS was removed, its functions having been replaced by the AAS-53 Common Sensor Payload, which is mounted on the chin.\nOne distinctive feature of operational OH-58s are the knife-like extensions above and below the cockpit which are part of the passive wire strike protection system; it protects 90% of the frontal area of the helicopter from wire strikes that can be encountered at low altitudes by directing wires to the upper or lower blades before they can entangle the rotor blade or landing skids. The OH-58 was the first helicopter to test this system, after which the system was adopted by the US Army for the OH-58 and most of their other helicopters. Various other defensive and survivability measures were incorporated, such as ballistic floor armor, a missile warning system, crashworthy seats, and infrared suppression systems for the engine exhaust.\nOperational history.\nIn May 1969, the first OH-58A Kiowa was officially received at a ceremony held at Bell Helicopter's Fort Worth plant, officiated by Major General John Norton, commanding general of the Army Aviation Materiel Command (AMCOM). Two months later, on 17 August 1969, production OH-58A helicopters arrived in South Vietnam for the first time; their deployment was accompanied by a New Equipment Training Team (NETT) comprising personnel from both the US Army and Bell Helicopters. Although the Kiowa production contract had replaced the LOH contract with Hughes, the OH-58A did not automatically replace the OH-6A in operations; subsequently, the Kiowa and the Cayuse would continue operating in the same theater until the end of the conflict.\nVietnam War.\nOn 27 March 1970, an OH-58A Kiowa (s/n 68-16785) was shot down over South Vietnam, one of the first OH-58A losses of the war. The pilot, Warrant Officer Ralph Quick Jr., was flying Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Benoski Jr. as an artillery spotter. After completing a battle damage assessment for a previous fire mission, the aircraft was damaged by .51 inch (13\u00a0mm) machine gun fire and crashed, killing both crew members. Approximately 45 OH-58A helicopters were destroyed during the Vietnam War due to combat losses and accidents. One of the last combat losses in the theatre was of an OH-58A (s/n 68-16888) from A Troop, 3-17th Cavalry, flown by First Lieutenant Thomas Knuckey. On 27 May 1971, Lieutenant Knuckey was also flying a battle damage assessment mission when his aircraft came under machine gun fire and exploded. Knuckey and his observer, Sergeant Philip Taylor, both died in the explosion.\nOperation Prime Chance.\nDuring early 1988, it was decided that armed OH-58D (AHIP) helicopters from the 118th Aviation Task Force would be phased in to replace the SEABAT (AH-6/MH-6) teams of Task Force 160th to carry out Operation Prime Chance, the escort of oil tankers during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. On 24 February 1988, two AHIP helicopters reported to the Mobile Sea Base Wimbrown VII, and the helicopter team (\"SEABAT\" team after their callsign) stationed on the barge returned to the United States. For the next few months, the AHIP helicopters on the Wimbrown VII shared patrol duties with the SEABAT team on the Hercules. Coordination proved difficult, despite frequent requests from TF-160, the SEABAT team on the Hercules was not replaced by an AHIP detachment until June 1988. The OH-58D helicopter crews involved in the operation received deck landing and underwater survival training from the Navy.\nIn November 1988, the number of OH-58D helicopters that supported Task Force 118 was reduced. However, the rotorcraft continued to operate from the Navy's Mobile Sea Base \"Hercules\", the frigate \"Underwood\", and the destroyer \"Conolly\". OH-58D operations primarily entailed reconnaissance flights at night, and depending on maintenance requirements and ship scheduling, Army helicopters usually rotated from the mobile sea base and other combatant ships to a land base every seven to fourteen days. On 18 September 1989, an OH-58D crashed during night gunnery practice and sank, but with no loss of personnel. When the Mobile Sea Base Hercules was deactivated in September 1989, all but five OH-58D helicopters redeployed to the continental United States.\nGulf War.\nDuring Operation Desert Shield (the build-up to Operation Desert Storm) U.S. Army OH-58Ds would exercise alongside USMC AH-1Ws and assist with targeting and laser spotting. However while this tactic worked and was effective, there is little evidence that this tactic was used, likely to a lack of OD-58Ds.\nDuring Operation Desert Storm, 130 deployed OH-58D helicopters worked alongside the other Army attack helicopters, 145 AH-1 Cobras and 277 AH-64 Apaches, and participated in a wide variety of critical combat ground forces mission. During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, the Kiowas collectively flew nearly 9,000 hours with a 92 percent fully mission capable rate. The Kiowa Warrior had the lowest ratio of maintenance hours to flight hours of any combat helicopter in the war.\nArmy attack helicopters also worked jointly with close air support and support aircraft such as the USAF A-10As, F-16A/Cs, EF-111As, EC-130H Compass Call, F-4G Phantom II \"Wild Weasel\", and E-8 Joint STARS.\nRAID.\nIn 1989, Congress mandated that the Army National Guard would take part in the country's \"war on drugs\", enabling them to aid federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with \"special congressional entitlements\". In response, the Army National Guard Bureau created the Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachments (RAID) in 1992, consisting of aviation units in 31 states with 76 specially modified OH-58A helicopters to assume the reconnaissance/interdiction role in the fight against illegal drugs. During 1994, 24 states conducted more than 1,200 aerial counterdrug reconnaissance and interdiction missions, conducting many of these missions at night. Eventually, the program was expanded to cover 32 states and consisting of 116 aircraft, including dedicated training aircraft at the Western Army Aviation Training Site (WAATS) in Marana, Arizona.\nThe RAID program's mission has now been expanded to include the war against terrorism and supporting U.S. Border Patrol activities in support of homeland defense. The National Guard RAID units' Area of Operation (AO) is the only one in the Department of Defense that is wholly contained within the borders of the United States.\nOperation Just Cause and action in the 1990s.\nDuring Operation Just Cause in 1989, a team consisting of an OH-58 and an AH-1 were part of the Aviation Task Force during the securing of Fort Amador in Panama. The OH-58 was fired upon by Panama Defense Force soldiers and crashed away, in the Bay of Panama. The pilot was rescued, but the co-pilot was killed in action.\nOn 17 December 1994, Army Chief Warrant Officers (CWO) David Hilemon and Bobby Hall left Camp Page, South Korea on a routine training mission along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Their flight was intended to be to a point known as Checkpoint 84, south of the DMZ \"no-fly zone\", but the OH-58C Kiowa strayed nearly into the Kangwon Province, inside North Korean airspace, due to errors in navigating the snow-covered, rugged terrain. The helicopter was shot down by North Korean troops and CWO Hilemon was killed. CWO Hall was held captive and the North Korean government insisted that the crew had been spying. Five days of negotiations resulted in the North Koreans turning over Hilemon's body to U.S. authorities. The negotiations failed to secure Hall's immediate release. After 13 days in captivity, Hall was freed on 30 December, uninjured.\nAfghanistan and Iraq.\nThe U.S. Army employed the OH-58D during Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Between a combination of combat and accidents, over 35 airframes have been lost, resulting in the deaths of 35 pilots. Their presence was also anecdotally credited with saving lives, having been used to rescue wounded despite their small size. In Iraq, OH-58Ds reportedly flew 72 hours per month, while in Afghanistan, the type flew 80 hours per month. During April 2013, Bell stated that the OH-58 collectively accumulated 820,000 combat hours, and had achieved a 90% mission capable rate.\nRetirement.\nThe U.S. Army's first attempt to replace the OH-58 was the RAH-66 Comanche of the Light Helicopter Experimental program, which was canceled in 2004. Airframe age and losses led to the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program and the Bell ARH-70, which was canceled in 2008 due to cost overruns. The third replacement effort was the Armed Aerial Scout program. Due to uncertainty in the AAS program and fiscal restraints, the OH-58F's planned retirement was extended from 2025 to 2036. The Kiowa's scout role was supplemented by tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, the two platforms often acting in conjunction to provide reconnaissance to expose crews to less risk. The OH-58F had the ability to control UAVs directly to safely perform scout missions. In 2011, the Kiowa was scheduled to be replaced by the light version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft in the 2030s.\nIn December 2013, the U.S. Army had 338 Kiowas in its active-duty force and 30 in the Army National Guard. The Army considered retiring the Kiowa as part of a wider restructuring to cut costs and reduce the variety of helicopters operated. The Analysis of Alternatives for the AAS program found that operating the Kiowa alongside RQ-7 Shadow UAVs was the most affordable and capable solution, while the AH-64E Apache Guardian was the most capable immediate solution. One proposal was to transfer all Army National Guard and Army Reserve AH-64s to the active Army for use as scouts to divest the OH-58. The Apache costs 50 percent more than the Kiowa to operate and maintain; studies note that had it been used in place of the Kiowa in Iraq and Afghanistan, total operating costs would have risen by $4 billion, but also saved $1 billion per year in operating and sustainment costs. UH-60 Black Hawks would transfer from the active Army to reserve and Guard units. The aim was to retire older helicopters and retain those with the best capabilities to save money. Retiring the Kiowa would fund Apache upgrades.\nThe Army placed 26 out of 335 OH-58Ds in non-flyable storage during 2014. In anticipation of divestment, the Army looked to see if other military branches, government agencies, and foreign customers had interest in buying the type. The Kiowas were considered to be well priced for foreign countries with limited resources; Bell had not yet agreed to support them if sold overseas. Media expected OH-58s to go to foreign militaries rather than civil operators due to high operating cost. By 2015, the Army had divested 33 OH-58Ds. By January 2016, the Army had divested all but two OH-58D squadrons. In June 2016, members of 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, arrived in South Korea as part of the Kiowa's last deployment in U.S. Army service; during the following year, the unit reequipped with AH-64s. In January 2017, the last Kiowa Warrior performed their last live fire maneuver before retirement.\nEx-U.S. Army OH-58Ds were made available through Excess Defense Article and foreign military sales (FMS) programs. In November 2014, Croatia sent a letter of intent for the acquisition of 16 OH-58Ds. In 2016, Croatia and Tunisia became the first nations to request the helicopters, ordering 16 and 24, respectively. Croatia received the first batch of 5 OH-58Ds at the Zadar-Zemunik air base on 30 June 2016. In early 2018, Greece was granted 70 OH-58Ds via an FMS arrangement, the type has been initially stationed at Hellenic Army Aviation air base at Stefanovikio.\nIn March 2020, the U.S. Army selected the Bell 360 Invictus and Sikorsky Raider X as part of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program to fill the capability gap left by the retirement of the OH-58. On 29 September 2020, the US Army retired its last OH-58Cs from active service at Fort Irwin.&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IJPpoyd9iQ&gt; In February 2024, FARA was cancelled; by this point, there were three abandoned attempts to replace the OH-58 at a cost in excess of $9 billion. The armed scout role has been filled by the AH-64 and the unarmed RQ-7 Shadow UAV; this combination reportedly accomplished 80% of the scouting mission, while also providing greater firepower, durability, and speed.\nVariants.\nOH-58A.\nThe \"OH-58A Kiowa\" is a four-place observation helicopter. It has two-place pilot seating, although the controls in the left seat are designed to be removed to carry a passenger up front. During its development for Vietnam War, it was fitted with the M134 Minigun, a electrically operated machine gun.\nThe Australian Army leased eight OH-58As in 1971 in South Vietnam for eight months. The Australian government procured the OH-58A for the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy as the \"CAC CA-32\". Licensed produced in Australia by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, the CA-32 was the equivalent of the 206B-1 (uprated engine and longer rotor blades). The first twelve of 56 were built in the U.S. then partially disassembled and shipped to Australia, where they were reassembled.\nThe first OH-58As in Australia were given the name \"Kalkadoon\" rather than \"Kiowa\", at the suggestion of army minister Bob Katter Sr. who wished to honor the Kalkadoon people of Queensland rather than a Native American people. The new helicopters were affixed with \"boomerang-shaped decals bearing the name Kalkadoon\". The renaming was apparently poorly received by the Army and was dropped after Katter's term as minister concluded; the helicopters had reportedly been nicknamed \"Kattercopters\" by army personnel. Helicopters in the naval fleet were retired in 2000.\nA total of 74 OH-58As were delivered to the Canadian Armed Forces as \"COH-58A\" and later redesignated \"CH-136 Kiowa\". As many as 12 surplus Kiowas were sold to the Dominican Republic Air Force, and others sold privately in Australia.\nIn 1978, OH-58As began to be converted to the same engine and dynamic components as the OH-58C. In 1992, 76 OH-58A were modified with another engine upgrade, a thermal imaging system, a communications package for law enforcement, enhanced navigational equipment and high skid gear as part of the Army National Guard's (ARNG) Counter-Drug RAID program. The U.S. Army retired its last OH-58A in November 2017.\nOH-58B.\nThe \"OH-58B\" was an export version for the Austrian Air Force. Austria plans to replace the OH-58B by the end of 2030.\nOH-58C.\nEquipped with a more robust engine, the \"OH-58C\" was supposed to solve issues regarding the Kiowa's power. In addition to the improved engine, it had unique IR suppression systems mounted on its exhaust. Early OH-58Cs had flat-panel windscreens as an attempt to reduce glint from the sun, which could reveal its location to enemies. The windscreens had a negative effect of limiting the crew's forward view, a previous strength of the original design.\nThe aircraft was also equipped with a larger instrument panel, roughly one\u2013third bigger than the OH-58A panel, which held larger flight instruments. The panel was also equipped with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible cockpit lighting. The OH-58C were also the first U.S. Army scout helicopter to be equipped with the AN/APR-39 radar detector, which alerted the crew to active anti-aircraft radar systems nearby. Some OH-58Cs were armed with two AIM-92 Stingers and are sometimes referred to as OH-58C/S, the \"S\" referring to the Stinger addition. Called Air-To-Air Stinger (ATAS), the weapon system was intended to provide an air defense capability.\nThe OH-58C was the final Kiowa variant still in service with the U.S. Army, with it used as a training aircraft. On 29 September 2020, the US Army retired the last OH-58Cs from service. The final flight of the US Army OH-58C, tail number 69-16165 occurred at Fort Irwin, California on 29 September 2020.\nOH-58D.\nThe \"OH-58D\" (Bell Model 406) was the result of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). An upgraded transmission and engine gave extra power, needed for nap-of-the-earth flight profiles, and a four-bladed main rotor made it quieter than the two-bladed OH-58C. The OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS) above the main rotor, and a mixed glass cockpit with traditional instruments as \"standby\" for emergencies.\nThe \"Bell 406CS\" \"Combat Scout\" was based on the OH-58D (sometimes referred to as the \"MH-58D\"). Fifteen aircraft were sold to Saudi Arabia. A roof-mounted Saab HeliTOW sight system was opted for in place of the MMS. The 406CS also had detachable weapon hardpoints on each side.\nThe \"AH-58D\" was an OH-58D version operated by Task Force 118 (4th Squadron, 17th Cavalry) and modified with armament in support of Operation Prime Chance. The weapons and fire control systems would become the basis for the Kiowa Warrior. AH-58D is not an official DOD aircraft designation, but is used by the Army in reference to these aircraft.\nThe \"Kiowa Warrior\", sometimes referred to by its acronym \"KW\", is the armed version of the OH-58D. A key difference between the Kiowa Warrior and original AHIP aircraft is a universal weapons pylon found mounted on both sides of the fuselage, capable of carrying combinations of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, air-to-air Stinger (ATAS) missiles, 7-shot Hydra-70 rocket pods, and an M296 0.50 in (12.7\u00a0mm) caliber machine gun. The performance standard of aerial gunnery from an OH-58D is to achieve at least one hit out of 70 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle away. The Kiowa Warrior also includes improvements in available power, navigation, communication, survivability, and deployability.\nOH-58E.\nThe OH-58E was one of 13 design candidates in the \"Advanced Scout Helicopter\" of 1980. The study's conclusion was to launch the \"Army Helicopter Improvement Program\" (AHIP) in 1981 centered on the OH-58D instead.\nOH-58F.\nThe \"OH-58F\" is an OH-58D upgrade. The Cockpit and Sensor Upgrade Program (CASUP) adds a nose-mounted targeting and surveillance system alongside the MMS. The AAS-53 Common Sensor Payload has an infrared camera, color Electro-Optical camera, and image intensifier; via weight and drag reductions, flight performance increased by 1\u20132%. Cockpit upgrades include the Control and Display Subsystem version 5, more storage and processing power, three color multi-function displays, and dual-independent advanced moving maps. It has Level 2 Manned-Unmanned (L2MUM) teaming, the Force Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) display screen, and can be updated to Blue Force Tracker 2. Survivability enhancements include ballistic floor armor and the Common Missile Warning System. It has greater situational awareness, digital inter-cockpit communications, HELLFIRE future upgrades, redesigned wiring harness, Health and Usage Monitoring (HUMS), and enhanced weapons functionality via 1760 digital interface. The OH-58F is powered by a Rolls-Royce 250-C30R3 engine rated at ; it has a dual-channel, full-authority digital engine-controller that operates at required power levels in all environments. Rolls-Royce proposed engine tweaks to raise output by 12%.\nIn October 2012, the first OH-58F was finished. Unlike most military projects, the Army designed and built the new variant itself, which lowered development costs. It weighed , below the target weight and about lighter than the OH-58D. The weight savings are attributed to more efficient wiring and a lighter sensor. The first production aircraft began manufacturing in January 2013 and was handed over to the Army by year end. Low rate production was to start in March 2015, with the first operational squadron being fully equipped by 2016. The Army was to buy 368 OH-58Fs, with older OH-58 variants to be remanufactured. Due to battle damage and combat attrition, total OH-58F numbers would be about 321 aircraft. The OH-58F's first flight occurred on 26 April 2013.\nThe Army chose to retire the Kiowa and end the CASUP upgrades. CASUP and SLEP upgrades were estimated to cost $3 billion and $7 billion respectively. The OH-58D could do 20 percent of armed aerial scout mission requirements, the OH-58F upgrade raised that to 50 percent. Replacing the Kiowa with Apaches and UAVs in scout roles met 80 percent of requirements. In early 2014, Bell received a stop-work order for the Kiowa CASUP program.\nOH-58F Block II.\nOn 14 April 2011, Bell performed the successful first flight of the OH-58F Block II variant. It was Bell's entry in the Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program. It built on the improvements of the F-model, adding features such as the Honeywell HTS900 turboshaft engine, the transmission and main rotors of the Bell 407, and the tail and tail rotor of the Bell 427. Bell started flight demonstrations in October 2012. Bell hoped for the Army to go with their service life extension models instead of the AAS program. The OH-58F is an \"obsolescence upgrade\", while the Block II was seen as the performance upgrade. This gave the Army financial flexibility via the option of upgrading the Kiowa to the OH-58F and later continuing to the Block II when there were sufficient funds. In late 2012, the Army recommended that the AAS program proceed. The Army ended the AAS program in late 2013. In light of sequestration budget cuts in 2013, it was decided that the $16 billion cost to buy new armed scout helicopters was too great.\nOthers.\nThe OH-58X was a modification of the fourth development OH-58D (s/n 69-16322) with partial stealth features and a chin-mounted McDonnell Douglas Electronics Systems turret as a night piloting system; including a Kodak FLIR system with a 30-degree field of view. Avionics systems were consolidated and moved to the nose, making room for a passenger seat in the rear. No aircraft were produced.\nSpecifications (OH-58D).\n\"Data from\" \"Jane's All the World's Aircraft, 1996\u201397\", \"U.S. Army Aircraft Since 1947\"General characteristics* Crew: 2 pilots* Length: ()* Width: ()* Height: ()* Empty weight: ()* Gross weight: ()* Powerplant: 1 \u00d7 Rolls-Royce T703-AD-700A\n turboshaft\n, 650 hp (485 kW) * Main rotor diameter: 1 \u00d7 ()* Main rotor area: ()\nPerformance* Maximum speed: (, )* Cruise speed: (, ) * Range: (, ) * Endurance: Two hours* Service ceiling: ()\nArmament\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37938", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37938", "title": "Ruggero Leoncavallo", "text": "Italian composer (1857\u20131919)\nRuggero (or Ruggiero) Leoncavallo (23 April 1857\u00a0\u2013 9 August 1919) was an Italian opera composer and librettist. Throughout his career, Leoncavallo produced numerous operas and songs, but it is his 1892 opera \"Pagliacci\" that remained his lasting contribution, despite attempts to escape the shadow of his greatest success.\nToday \"Pagliacci\" continues to be his most famous opera and one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the operatic repertory. His other notable compositions include the song \"Mattinata\", popularized by Enrico Caruso, and, to a lesser extent, his version of \"La boh\u00e8me\" which, however, was overshadowed by Puccini's highly successful opera of the same name.\nBiography.\nThe son of Vincenzo Leoncavallo, a police magistrate and judge, Leoncavallo was born in Naples, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, on 23 April 1857.\nAs a child, Leoncavallo moved with his father to the town of Montalto Uffugo in Calabria, where he lived during his adolescence. In 1868 he returned to Naples, where he eventually became a student at San Pietro a Majella Conservatory. From 1876 to 1877, he studied literature under the famed Italian poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci at the University of Bologna. He also lived in Potenza, since 1876 until 1878.\nIn 1879, Leoncavallo's uncle Giuseppe, director of the press department at the Foreign Ministry in Egypt, suggested that his young nephew come to Cairo to showcase his pianistic abilities. Ruggero Leoncavallo arrived in Egypt shortly after the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II had deposed Khedive Ismail (June 1879) and replaced him as Khedive of Egypt with Ismail's son Tewfik Pasha. Mahmud Hamdi Pasha (1863\u20131921), the teenage brother of the new Khedive, appointed Ruggero Leoncavallo \"as his private musician\". His time in Egypt concluded abruptly in mid-1882, as the British intervened in the Urabi revolt of 1879\u20131882 in Alexandria and Cairo led by Ahmed Urabi; the composer fled and travelled to France. In Paris, Leoncavallo found lodging in Montmartre.\nAn agent located in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis secured Leoncavallo employment as an accompanist and instructor for artists who performed in Sunday concerts mostly at caf\u00e9s. In Paris, Leoncavallo met the singer Berthe Rambaud (1869\u20131926) who became his \"preferred student\"; they became partners in Paris in 1888 and married in Milan in 1895. Increasingly inspired by the French romantics, particularly Alfred de Musset, Leoncavallo began work on a symphonic poem based on Musset's poetry entitled \"La nuit de mai\". The work was completed in Paris in 1886 and premiered in April 1887 to critical acclaim. With this success, and now with enough accumulated money, in 1888 Leoncavallo moved to Milan with Rambaud.\nBack in Italy, Leoncavallo spent some years teaching and attempting ineffectively to obtain the production of more than one opera, notably \"Chatterton\". In 1890 he saw the enormous success of Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" and wasted no time in producing his own verismo work, \"Pagliacci\". (According to Leoncavallo, the plot of this work had a real-life origin: he claimed it derived from a murder trial in Montalto Uffugo, over which his father had presided.)\n\"Pagliacci\" was performed in Milan in 1892 with immediate success; today it is the only work by Leoncavallo in the standard operatic repertory. Its most famous aria, \"Vesti la giubba\" (\"Put on the costume\" or, in the better-known older translation, \"On with the motley\"), was recorded by Enrico Caruso and laid claim to being the world's first record to sell a million copies (although this is probably a total of Caruso's various versions of it, made in 1902, 1904 and 1907).\nThe next year his \"I Medici\" was also produced in Milan, but neither it nor \"Chatterton\" (belatedly produced in 1896)\u2014both early works\u2014obtained much lasting favour. Much of \"Chatterton\", however, was recorded by the Gramophone Company (later His Master's Voice) as early as 1908, and remastered on CD almost 100 years later by Marston Records. Leoncavallo himself conducts the performance or at very least supervises the production.\nIt was not until Leoncavallo's \"La boh\u00e8me\" was performed in 1897 in Venice that his talent obtained public confirmation. However, this work was outshone by Puccini's opera of the same name and on the same subject, which had been premiered by the Teatro Regio in Turin in February 1896. Two tenor arias from Leoncavallo's version are still occasionally performed, especially in Italy.\nSubsequent operas by Leoncavallo in the 1900s were: \"Zaz\u00e0\" (the opera of Geraldine Farrar's famous 1922 farewell performance at the Metropolitan Opera), and 1904's \"Der Roland von Berlin\". In 1906 the composer brought singers and orchestral musicians from La Scala to perform concerts of his music in New York, as well as making an extensive tour of the United States. The tour was, all in all, a qualified success. He had a brief success with \"Zingari\", which premiered in Italian in London in 1912, with a long run at the Hippodrome Theatre. \"Zingari\" also reached the United States but soon disappeared from the repertoire.\nAfter a series of operettas, Leoncavallo appeared to have tried for one last serious effort with \"Edipo re\". It had always been assumed that Leoncavallo had finished the work but had died before he could finish the orchestration, which was completed by Giovanni Pennacchio. However, with the publication of Konrad Dryden's biography of Leoncavallo it was revealed that Leoncavallo may not have written the work at all (although it certainly contains themes by Leoncavallo). A review of Dryden's study notes: \"That fine \"Edipo re\" ... was not even composed by [Leoncavallo]. His widow paid another composer to concoct a new opera using the music of \"Der Roland von Berlin\". Dryden didn't find one reference to the opera in Leoncavallo's correspondence nor is there a single note by him to be found in the handwritten score.\" Pennacchio may either have concocted the opera or have had to do more to Leoncavallo's incomplete work to \"fill in the gaps\" using Leoncavallo's earlier music.\nDeath and legacy.\nLeoncavallo died in Montecatini Terme, Tuscany, on 9 August 1919. His funeral was held two days later, with hundreds in attendance, including fellow composer Pietro Mascagni and longtime rival Giacomo Puccini. He was buried in the Cimitero delle Porte Sante in Florence.\n70 years after his death a campaign was launched to move the composer's remains to Brissago, Switzerland, after an alleged letter written by Leoncavallo claimed to show he had desired to be buried there originally, although no such letter was ever found. Leoncavallo became an honorary citizen of Brissago and owned a lavish summer residence, Villa Myriam, in the town; in 1904 the composer had mentioned in a speech that he would not mind having a resting place in the town's Madonna di Porte cemetery, but it was never a written request in his will. Regardless the campaign to move Leoncavallo's remains moved ahead and was granted official approval by Piera Leoncavallo-Grand, the last remaining descendant of the composer; Ruggero Leoncavallo's body was exhumed on 22 September 1989 for transfer to Switzerland. and burial there, alongside the remains of his wife Berthe (who had died in 1926).\nThe Museo Leoncavallo (Leoncavallo Museum) was established in 2002 in Brissago to commemorate the composer. It includes personal items and original manuscripts on display as well as statues representing characters from his operas \"Zaz\u00e0\" and \"Der Roland von Berlin\". The Museo Ruggiero Leoncavallo in the composer's childhood home of Montalto Uffugo was opened in 2010 and also contains various manuscripts and personal items, as well as Leoncavallo's personal piano.\nLittle from Leoncavallo's other operas is heard today, but the baritone arias from \"Zaz\u00e0\" were great concert and recording favourites among baritones and \"Zaz\u00e0\" as a whole is sometimes revived, as is his \"La boh\u00e8me\". The tenor arias from \"La boh\u00e8me\" remain recording favorites.\nLeoncavallo also composed songs, most famously \"Mattinata\", which he wrote for the Gramophone Company (which became His Master's Voice) with Caruso's unique voice in mind. On 8 April 1904, Leoncavallo accompanied Caruso at the piano as they recorded the song. On 8 December 1905 he recorded five of his own pieces for the reproducing piano Welte-Mignon.\nLeoncavallo wrote the libretti for most of his own operas; after the death in 1918 of Arrigo Boito some ranked Leoncavallo as the greatest librettist in Italy. His work for other composers included a contribution to the libretto for Puccini's 1893 work \"Manon Lescaut\".\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Today he is particularly known for his operas \"L'arlesiana\" and \"Adriana Lecouvreur\".\nBiography.\nBorn in Palmi near Reggio di Calabria, Cilea was the son of a prominent lawyer and originally intended to follow his father into a law career. He gave an early indication of an aptitude for music when at the age of four he heard a performance of Vincenzo Bellini's \"Norma\" and was greatly affected by it. He was sent to study music at the Conservatorio di San Pietro a Majella in Naples, where he quickly demonstrated his diligence and precocious talent, earning a gold medal from the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione (Department of Education).\nIn 1889, for his final examination at the end of his course of study, he submitted his opera \"Gina\", with a libretto by Enrico Golisciani which was adapted from the old French play \"Catherine, ou La Croix d'or\" by Baron Anne-Honor\u00e9-Joseph Duveyrier de M\u00e9l\u00e9sville (1787\u20131865). This \"melodramma idilico\" was performed in the college theatre, and it attracted the attention of the publishers Sonzogno, who arranged for a second production, in Florence, in 1892.\nSonzogno also then commissioned from Cilea \"La Tilda\", a verismo opera in three short acts along the lines of Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\". With a libretto by Angelo Zanardini, \"La Tilda\" had a successful first performance in April 1892 at the Teatro Pagliano in Florence, and after performances in a number of Italian theatres, it arrived at the Vienna Exhibition on 24 September 1892, alongside other works from the firm of Sonzogno. The composer never showed much sympathy for this work, the subject of which he reluctantly agreed to set to music in order to please Sonzogno and to avoid throwing away a rare professional opportunity. The loss of the orchestral score has prevented the modern revival of this work. However, a new orchestration by musicologist and composer Giancosimo Russo enabled its modern performance in 2025, from which an audio CD was produced.\nOn 27 November 1897, the Teatro Lirico in Milan saw the premi\u00e8re of Cilea's third opera \"L'Arlesiana\", based on the play by Alphonse Daudet, with a libretto by Leopoldo Marenco. Among the cast was the young Enrico Caruso, who performed with great success the \"Lamento di Federico: \u00c8 la solita storia del pastore\", the \"romance\" which was to keep alive the memory of the opera even to the present day. In reality \"L'Arlesiana\" was a failure which Cilea, being convinced of the work's value, tried repeatedly to remedy, making drastic and detailed alterations throughout the remainder of his life. In the score which we hear today, it is hard to find a single bar which is completely unchanged from the original. The revised opera was however still not successful, apart from a brief period in the 1930s when it benefited from political support which the composer established through personal contact with Mussolini.\nAgain at the Teatro Lirico in Milan, on 6 November 1902 and again with Enrico Caruso, the composer won an enthusiastic reception for \"Adriana Lecouvreur\", a 4-act opera with a libretto by Arturo Colautti, set in 18th century Paris and based upon a play by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe. \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" is the opera of Cilea which is best known to international audiences today, and it reveals the spontaneity of a melodic style drawn from the Neapolitan school combined with harmonic and tonal shading influenced by French composers such as Massenet.\nThere are a number of extant examples documenting Cilea's modest skills as a performer. At the piano Cilea accompanied Caruso in a recording of a part of the duet \"Non piu nobile\" and made another recording with the baritone De Luca at the same time (November 1902). In 1904, for the Gramophone (and Typewriter Company), he accompanied the tenor Fernando de Lucia in \"L'Anima ho stanca\" from Adriana Lecouvreur and in the song \"Lontananza,\" an effort which critic Michael Henstock (in his biography of de Lucia) declares is hardly inspired by de Lucia's fine performances. According to Henstock, even given the crude recording techniques of the day Cilea's piano playing seems square and lifeless.\nCilea's last opera, premi\u00e8red at La Scala in Milan on 15 April 1907 under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, was the 3-act tragedy \"Gloria\", again with a libretto by Colautti, based on a play by Victorien Sardou. The opera was withdrawn after only two performances; and the failure of this work, even though the composer attempted a later revision, was enough to drive him to abandon the operatic stage for good. There are however indications of some later unfulfilled operatic projects, which survive as parts or sketches of libretti, such as \"Il ritorno dell'amore\" by Renato Simoni, \"Malena\" by Ettore Moschino, and \"La rosa di Pompei\", also by Moschino (dated \"Naples, 20 May 1924\"). Some sources also refer to an opera of 1909, completed but never performed, called \"Il matrimonio selvaggio\", but no copy of this survives and Cilea himself made no mention of it in his volumes of memoirs (\"Ricordi\").\nNevertheless, he continued to compose chamber music, and some orchestral music. In 1913 he produced a symphonic poem in honour of Giuseppe Verdi with verses by Sem Benelli, which was first performed at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. After this he devoted himself principally to education and became director of the Conservatorio Vincenzo Bellini in Palermo, and then at his alma mater, the Conservatorio San Pietro a Maiella in Naples, where he ended his teaching career in 1936.\nIn his last years Cilea's eyesight failed but his mind was active enough to encourage and work with singers of the day. Among his last musical activities was his championship of the soprano Magda Olivero (1910\u20132014), whose performances in the title role of \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" he especially admired. Cilea died in Varazze, a town near Savona in Liguria, which offered him honorary citizenship and where he spent the last years of his life. The Conservatorio di Musica and the Teatro Comunale of Reggio di Calabria were renamed in his memory, and his native town of Palmi built a mausoleum in his memory, decorated with scenes from the myth of Orpheus.\nPersonal life.\nCilea married Donna Rosa Lavarello in Varazze on 26 June 1909.\nWorks.\nOperas\nOther works\nVoice and piano\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37941", "revid": "1216158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37941", "title": "Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk", "text": "Series of military utility transport helicopters\nThe Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-blade, twin-engine, medium-lift military utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky submitted a design for the United States Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the \"YUH-60A\" and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61.\nNamed after the Native American war chief Black Hawk, the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the Bell UH-1 Iroquois as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of electronic warfare and special operations variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed.\nMajor variants include the Navy's SH-60 Seahawk, the Air Force's HH-60 Pave Hawk, the Coast Guard's MH-60 Jayhawk and the civilian S-70. In addition to use by U.S. armed forces, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations and produced under contract in Japan as the Mitsubishi H-60.\nDevelopment.\nInitial requirement.\nIn the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements for a helicopter to replace the UH-1 Iroquois, and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated the development of a new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the General Electric T700. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant. The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972. The RFP also included air transport requirements. Transport within the C-130 limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.\nThe UTTAS requirements for improved reliability, survivability and lower life-cycle costs resulted in features such as dual-engines with improved hot and high altitude performance, and a modular design (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry gearboxes; ballistically tolerant, redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and flight controls); crashworthy crew (armored) and troop seats; dual-stage oleo main landing gear; ballistically tolerant, crashworthy main structure; quieter, more robust main and tail rotor systems; and a ballistically tolerant, crashworthy fuel system.\nFour prototypes were constructed, with the first YUH-60A flying on 17 October 1974. Prior to the delivery of the prototypes to the US Army, a preliminary evaluation was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing. Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, for evaluation against the rival Boeing-Vertol design, the YUH-61A, and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research. The Army selected the UH-60 for production in December 1976. Deliveries of the UH-60A to the Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.\nUpgrades and variations.\nAfter entering service, the helicopter was modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying and medical evacuation. An EH-60 variant was developed to conduct electronic warfare and special operations aviation developed the MH-60 variant to support its missions.\nDue to weight increases from the addition of mission equipment and other changes, the Army ordered the improved UH-60L in 1987. The new model incorporated all of the modifications made to the UH-60A fleet as standard design features. The UH-60L also featured more power and lifting capability with upgraded T700-GE-701C engines and an improved gearbox, both from the SH-60B Seahawk. Its external lift capacity increased by up to . The UH-60L also incorporated the SH-60B's automatic flight control system (AFCS) for better flight control with more powerful engines. Production of the L-model began in 1989.\nDevelopment of the next improved variant, the UH-60M, was approved in 2001, to extend the service life of the UH-60 design into the 2020s. The UH-60M incorporates upgraded T700-GE-701D engines, improved rotor blades, and state-of-the-art electronic instrumentation, flight controls and aircraft navigation control. After the U.S. DoD approved low-rate initial production of the new variant, manufacturing began in 2006, with the first of 22 new UH-60Ms delivered in July 2006. After an initial operational evaluation, the Army approved full-rate production and a five-year contract for 1,227 helicopters in December 2007. By March 2009, 100 UH-60M helicopters had been delivered to the Army. In November 2014, the US military ordered 102 aircraft of various H-60 types, worth $1.3 billion.\nFollowing their use in the operation to kill Osama bin Laden in May 2011, it emerged that the 160th SOAR used a secret version of the UH-60 modified with low-observable technology which enabled it to evade Pakistani radar. Analysis of the tail section, the only remaining part of the aircraft which crashed during the operation, revealed extra blades on the tail rotor and other noise reduction measures, making the craft much quieter than conventional UH-60s. The aircraft appeared to include features like special high-tech materials, harsh angles, and flat surfaces found only in stealth jets. Low observable versions of the Black Hawk have been studied as far back as the mid-1970s.\nIn September 2012, Sikorsky was awarded a Combat Tempered Platform Demonstration (CTPD) contract to further improve the Black Hawk's durability and survivability. The company is to develop new technologies such as a zero-vibration system, adaptive flight control laws, advanced fire management, a more durable main rotor, full-spectrum crashworthiness, and damage-tolerant airframe; then they are to transition them to the helicopter. Improvements to the Black Hawk are to continue until the Future Vertical Lift program is ready to replace it.\nIn December 2014, the 101st Airborne Division began testing new resupply equipment called the Enhanced Speed Bag System (ESBS). Soldiers in the field requiring quick resupply have depended on speed bags filled with items airdropped from a UH-60. However, all systems were ad hoc with bags not made to keep objects secure from impacts, so up to half of the airdropped items would be damaged upon hitting the ground. Started in 2011, the ESBS sought to standardize the airdrop resupply method and keep up to 90 percent of supplies intact. The system includes a hands-free reusable linear brake and expendable speed line and a multipurpose cargo bag. When the bag is deployed, the brake applies friction to the rope, slowing it down enough to keep the bag oriented down on the padded base, a honeycomb and foam kit inside to dissipate energy.\nThe ESBS better protects helicopter-dropped supplies, and allows the Black Hawk to fly higher above the ground, up from 10 feet, while travelling , limiting exposure to ground fire. Each bag can weigh and up to six can be deployed at once, dropping at . Since supplies can be delivered more accurately and the system can be automatically released on its own, the ESBS can enable autonomous resupply from unmanned helicopters.\nDesign.\nThe UH-60 features four-blade main and tail rotors, and is powered by two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines. The main rotor is fully articulated and has elastomeric bearings in the rotor head. The tail rotor is canted and features a rigid crossbeam. The helicopter has a long, low profile shape to meet the Army's requirement for transporting aboard a C-130 Hercules, with some disassembly. It can carry 11 troops with equipment, lift of cargo internally or of cargo (for UH-60L/M) externally by sling.\nThe Black Hawk helicopter series can perform a wide array of missions, including the tactical transport of troops, electronic warfare, and aeromedical evacuation. A VIP version known as the VH-60N is used to transport important government officials (e.g., Congress, Executive departments) with the helicopter's call sign of \"Marine One\" when transporting the President of the United States. In air assault operations, it can move a squad of 11 combat troops or reposition a 105\u00a0mm M119 howitzer with 30 rounds ammunition and a four-man crew in a single lift. The Black Hawk is equipped with advanced avionics and electronics for increased survivability and capability, such as the Global Positioning System.\nThe UH-60 can be equipped with stub wings at the top of the fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub wing system is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two and two tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the crashworthy external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total crashworthy tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, it was found that the four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire for the door guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.\nThe unit cost of the H-60 models varies due to differences in specifications, equipment and quantities. For example, the unit cost of the Army's UH-60L Black Hawk is $5.9\u00a0million while the Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk has a unit cost of $10.2\u00a0million.\nOperational history.\nThe UH-60 Black Hawk is in service with 35 countries as of 2024.\nAustralia.\nAustralia bought early model UH-60 in the 1980s, and is buying a fleet of newer versions ones in the 2020s:\nAustralia ordered fourteen S-70A-9 Black Hawks in 1986 and an additional twenty-five Black Hawks in 1987. The first US-produced Black Hawk was delivered in 1987 to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). de Havilland Australia produced thirty-eight Black Hawks under license from Sikorsky in Australia delivering the first in 1988 and the last in 1991. In 1989, the RAAF's fleet of Black Hawks was transferred to the Australian Army. The Black Hawks saw operational service in Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, East Timor and Pakistan.\nIn April 2009, the then-defence chief Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, told the government not to deploy Black Hawks to Afghanistan as at the time they \"lacked armor and self-defense systems\", and despite an upgrade to address this underway, it was more practical to use allies' helicopters. In 2004, the government selected the Multi-Role Helicopter (MRH-90) Taipan, a variant of the NHIndustries NH90, to replace the Black Hawk even though the Department of Defence had recommended the S\u201070M Black Hawk.\nIn January 2014, the Army began retiring the fleet of 34 Black Hawks from service (five had been lost in accidents) and had planned for this to be completed by June 2018. The Chief of Army delayed the retirement of 20 Black Hawks until 2021 to enable the Army to develop a special operations role capable MRH-90. On 10 December 2021, the S-70A-9 Black Hawks were retired from service. On the same day, amid issues with the performance of the MRH-90s the government announced that they would be replaced by UH-60M Black Hawks. In January 2023, the Army announced the acquisition of 40 UH-60Ms with deliveries commencing in 2023.\nBrazil.\nBrazil received four UH-60L helicopters in 1997, for the Brazilian Army peacekeeping forces. It received six UH-60Ls configured for special forces, and search and rescue uses in 2008. It ordered ten more UH-60Ls in 2009; deliveries began in March 2011. In July 2024, the MoD authorized the purchase of 12 additional UH-60Ms, in a US$451 million plan.\nChina.\nIn December 1983, examples of the Aerospatiale AS-332 Super Puma, Bell 214ST SuperTransport and Sikorsky S-70A-5 (N3124B) were airlifted to Lhasa for testing. These demonstrations included take-offs and landings at altitudes to and \"en route\" operations to . At the end of this testing, the People's Liberation Army purchased 24 S-70C-2s, equipped with more powerful GE T700-701A engines for improved high-altitude performance. While designated as civil variants of the S-70 for export purposes, they are operated by the People's Liberation Army Aviation units.\nColombia.\nColombia first received UH-60s from the U.S. in 1987. The Colombian National Police, Colombian Aerospace Force, and Colombian Army use UH-60s to transport troops and supplies to places which are difficult to access by land for counter-insurgency (COIN) operations against drug and guerrilla organizations, for search and rescue, and for medical evacuation. Colombia also operates a militarized gunship version of the UH-60, with stub wings, locally known as \"Arp\u00eda\" ().\nThe Colombian Army became the first worldwide operator of the S-70i with Terrain Awareness and Warning Capability (HTAWS) after taking delivery of the first two units on 13 August 2013.\nIsrael.\nThe Israeli Air Force (IAF) received 10 surplus UH-60A Black Hawks from the U.S. in August 1994. Named \"Yanshuf\" () by the IAF, the UH-60A began replacing Bell 212 utility helicopters. The IAF first used the UH-60s in combat during 1996 in southern Lebanon in Operation Grapes of Wrath against Hezbollah.\nMexico.\nThe Mexican Air Force ordered its first two UH-60Ls in 1991 to transport special forces units, and another four in 1994. In July and August 2009, the Federal Police used UH-60s in attacks on drug traffickers. In August 2011, the Mexican Navy received three upgraded and navalized UH-60M. On 21 April 2014, the U.S. State Department approved the sale of 18 UH-60Ms to Mexico pending approval from Congress. In September 2014, Sikorsky received a $203.6 million (~$ in 2024) firm-fixed-price contract modification for the 18 UH-60s designated for the Mexican Air Force.\nPhilippines.\n2 S-70-A5 VIP helicopters purchased 1983 and was delivered in 1984, this Blackhawk served the 250th PAW for more than 3 decades as a Presidential VVIP transport helicopter. Only 1 remains in service with the 505th Search and Rescue Group.\nIn March 2019, the Philippines' Department of National Defense (DND) signed a contract worth US$241.4 million (~$ in 2024) with Lockheed Martin's Polish subsidiary PZL Mielec for 16 Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawks to the PAF. On 10 December 2020, the PAF commissioned their first batch of six S-70i Blackhawks, with the remaining 10 to be delivered in 2021. In June 2021, the air service received a second batch of five helicopters. In November 2021, the third batch of five arrived.\nOn 22 February 2022, DND and PZL Mielec formally signed the US$624 million contract for 32 additional S-70i Black Hawks, totaling to around 48 units ordered. This will make the Philippine Air Force the largest user of S-70i Blackhawk Helicopters globally.\nPoland.\nIn January 2019, Poland ordered four S-70i Black Hawks with four delivered to the Polish Special Forces in December of that same year. Another four S-70i helicopters are on order with two scheduled for delivery in 2023 and two in 2024. In July 2023, Poland launched a procurement tender for S-70i Black Hawks with a goal to order approximately 32 helicopters.\nSlovakia.\nIn February 2015, the U.S. State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of nine UH-60Ms with associated equipment and support to Slovakia and sent it to Congress for its approval. In April 2015, Slovakia's government approved the procurement of nine UH-60Ms along with training and support. In September 2015, Slovakia ordered four UH-60Ms. The first two UH-60Ms were delivered in June 2017; the Slovak Air Force had received all nine UH-60Ms by January 2020. These are to replace its old Soviet Mil Mi-17s. In 2020, the Slovak minister of defense announced Slovakia's interest in buying two more UH-60Ms.\nSlovak Training Academy (European Air Services / Heli Company) from Ko\u0161ice, a private company, operates some older UH-60As &amp; Bs for pilot training, aerial fire fighting and sky crane operations.\nSweden.\nSweden requested 15 UH-60M helicopters by Foreign Military Sale in September 2010. The UH-60Ms were ordered in May 2011, and deliveries began in January 2012. In March 2013, Swedish ISAF forces began using Black Hawks in Afghanistan for MEDEVAC purposes. The UH-60Ms have been fully operational since 2017. Sweden designates it the Helicopter 16 (Hkp 16). In June 2024, Sweden ordered 12 more UH-60Ms from the US.\nSouth Korea.\nThe Republic of Korea Armed Forces is also an operator and has produced about 130 aircraft under license from Korean Air since the 1990s and domestically producing and introducing the UH-60 simulator. However, the cockpit is analog compared to the digital one in the United States, but since this business started after the 1988 Olympics, there was no such thing as a glass cockpit with an LCD monitor. Currently, the majority of South Korea's UH-60s belong to the Army, including 36 units operated by the Special Operations Aviation Corps.\nTaiwan.\nTaiwan (Republic of China) operated S-70C-1/1A after the Republic of China Air Force received ten S-70C-1A and four S-70C-1 Bluehawk helicopters in June 1986 for Search and Rescue. Four more S-70C-6s were received in April 1998. The ROC Navy received the first of ten S-70C(M)-1s in July 1990. 11 S-70C(M)-2s were received beginning April 2000. In January 2010, the US announced approval for a Foreign Military Sale of 60 UH-60Ms to Taiwan with 30 designated for the Army, 15 for the National Airborne Service Corps (including the one that crashed off Orchid Island in 2018) and 15 for the Air Force Rescue Group (including the one that crashed 2 January 2020).\nTurkey.\nTurkey has operated the UH-60 during NATO deployments to Afghanistan and the Balkans. The UH-60 has also been used in counter-terror/internal security operations.\nThe Black Hawk competed against the AgustaWestland AW149 in the Turkish General Use Helicopter Tender, to order up to 115 helicopters and produce many of them indigenously, with Turkish Aerospace Industries responsible for final integration and assembly. On 21 April 2011, Turkey announced the selection of Sikorsky's T-70.\nIn the course of the coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in Turkey on 15 July 2016, eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks landed in Greece's northeastern city of Alexandroupolis onboard a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece. The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.\nUkraine.\nIn February 2023, Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) published a video showing them operating at least two UH-60s painted in Ukrainian colors. The helicopters appeared to have minimal modifications, namely the addition of two M240 7.62 mm machine guns for defensive purposes. It was confirmed that at least one of these was purchased by a third party, Ace Aeronautics, following a Czech crowdfunding effort that raised US$6 million. On 17 March 2024, Russia claimed to have shot down a UH-60 during the March 2024 western Russia incursion, claiming it was a \"troop transport\" carrying 20 troops into combat. However, it was revealed to be a Mil Mi-8 instead.\nUnited States.\nThe UH-60 entered service with the U.S. Army's 101st Combat Aviation Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division in June 1979. The U.S. military first used the UH-60 in combat during the invasion of Grenada in 1983, and again in the invasion of Panama in 1989. During the Gulf War in 1991, the UH-60 participated in the largest air assault mission in U.S. Army history with over 300 helicopters involved. Two UH-60s (89-26214 and 78\u201323015) were shot down, both on 27 February 1991, while performing Combat Search and Rescue of other downed aircrews, an F-16C pilot and the crew of a MEDEVAC UH-1H that were shot down earlier that day.\nIn 1993, Black Hawks featured prominently in the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia during which two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Black Hawks also saw action in the Balkans and Haiti in the 1990s. U.S. Army UH-60s and other helicopters conducted many air assaults and other support missions during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The UH-60 has continued to serve in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nCustoms and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine (OAM) uses the UH-60 in its operations specifically along the southwest border. The Black Hawk has been used by OAM to interdict illegal entry into the U.S. Additionally, OAM regularly uses the UH-60 in search and rescue operations. Highly modified H-60s were employed during the U.S. Special Operations mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden during Operation Neptune Spear on 2 May 2011. One such MH-60 helicopter crash-landed during the operation and was destroyed by the team before it departed in the other MH-60 and a backup MH-47 Chinook with bin Laden's remains. Two MH-47s were used for the mission to refuel the two MH-60s and as backups. News media reported that the Pakistani government granted the Chinese military access to the wreckage of the crashed 'stealth' UH-60 variant in Abbottabad; Pakistan and China denied the reports, and the U.S. government did not confirm Chinese access.\nThe U.S. Army has signaled its intent to eventually replace the UH-60, launching the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program in 2019, with a new helicopter planned to enter service by 2030. Bell and a joint Sikorsky-Boeing team both entered competing designs. In December 2022, it was announced that the winning design was Bell\u2019s tilt-rotor V-280 Valor, with the US Army awarding an initial contract to develop a prototype by 2025. This award does not guarantee the eventual adoption of the V-280, which would require further contracts. As an Army program, the outcome of FLRAA will not necessarily affect UH-60 variants in service with other branches of the U.S. military.\nAdditional users.\nThe United Arab Emirates requested 14 UH-60M helicopters and associated equipment in September 2008, through Foreign Military Sale. It had received 20 UH-60Ls by November 2010. Bahrain ordered nine UH-60Ms in 2007.\nIn December 2011, the Royal Brunei Air Force (RBAirF / TUDB) ordered twelve S-70i helicopters, which are similar to the UH-60M; four aircraft had been received by December 2013. In June 2012, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress that Qatar requested the purchase of twelve UH-60Ms, engines, and associated equipment. The Royal Brunei Air Force had earlier bought four UH-60, but these were later sold to Malaysia.\nIn May 2014, Croatian Defence Minister Ante Kotromanovi\u0107 announced the beginning of negotiations for the purchase of 15 used Black Hawks. In October 2018, the US via Ambassador Robert Kohorst announced donation of two UH-60M helicopters with associated equipment and crew training to Croatia's Ministry of Defence, to be delivered in 2020. In October 2019, the US State Dept approved the sale of two new UH-60M Black Hawks. In February 2022, the first two helicopters were delivered to Croatia. In January 2024, the State Department approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Croatia for 8 UH-60M helicopters and related equipment and services for an estimated cost of $500 million. The U.S. government has provided $139.4 million in financial assistance for 51 percent of the funding, as a compensation for the Croatian donation of 14 Mi-8 helicopters to Ukraine. The remaining sum is be provided by Croatia's Ministry of Defence in the three-year budget period from 2025 to 2027. The Letter of Offer and Acceptance was signed in March 2024. Delivery of all 8 Black Hawks is expected in 2028.\nTunisia requested 12 armed UH-60M helicopters in July 2014 through Foreign Military Sale. In August 2014, the U.S. ambassador stated that the U.S. \"will soon make available\" the UH-60Ms to Tunisia. The sale of 8 helicopters was approved and helicopters were delivered 2017 and 2018.\nIn January 2015, the Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed that Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) is receiving S-70A Black Hawks from the Brunei government. These helicopters, believed to be four in total, were expected to be transferred to Malaysia by September with M134D miniguns added. The four Black Hawks were delivered to Royal Brunei Air Force (RBAirF / TUDB) in 1999.\nIn 2018, Latvia requested to buy four UH-60M Black Hawks with associated equipment for an estimated cost of $200 million (~$ in 2024). In August 2018, the State Department approved the possible Foreign Military Sale. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale. In November 2018, Latvia ordered four UH-60Ms, and received the first two in December 2022.\nIn 2019, Lithuania announced plans to buy six UH-60M helicopters before ordering four UH-60Ms in 2020. In July 2020, the US State Department approved the possible Foreign Military Sale of six UH-60Ms and associated equipment to Lithuania for $380 million. In November 2020, Lithuania signed a contract worth $213 million for four UH-60Ms with an option to purchase two more aircraft. Preparations are almost complete including facilities and training, with deliveries expected in late 2024.\nIn 2019, Poland ordered four S-70i helicopters for its special forces. As of 2023 there is negotiations to purchase additional S-70i helicopters.\nIn August 2023, the Portuguese Air Force shared a photo on Twitter of the first flight of one of the six UH-60s purchased from Arista Aviation Services. The Portuguese armed forces conducted its first operation flight of its UH-60 in December 2023.\nIn December 2023, the Hellenic Army selected the UH-60Ms for a possible order of 35 aircraft and associated equipment for an estimated cost of $1.95 billion pending the deal clears Congress. This order was approved by US and Greek governments, and a contract for 35 helicopters agreed by April 2024. In Greek service it will replace aged Bell UH-1H and Agusta-Bell AB205. Greece already operates S-70B and MH-60R helicopters.\nFuture and potential users.\nIn February 2013, the Indonesian Army announced its interest in buying UH-60 Black Hawks to modernize its weaponry. The army wants them for combating terrorism, transnational crime, and insurgency to secure the archipelago. In August 2023, Indonesian Aerospace and Lockheed Martin signed an agreement for the procurement of 24 UH-60/S-70 Black Hawks.\nIn 2022, the Royal Air Force and British Army expects to select a helicopter for the New Medium Helicopter program to replace several existing helicopters. Sikorsky has indicated it expects its S-70M to meet the requirement to participate in this procurement selection program.\nVariants.\nThe UH-60 comes in many variants and modifications. The U.S. Army variants can be fitted with stub wings to carry additional fuel tanks or weapons. Variants may have different capabilities and equipment to fulfill different roles.\nFor other Sikorsky S-70 variants, see Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk, Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk, Piasecki X-49 SpeedHawk, and Sikorsky HH-60 Jayhawk articles.\nOperators.\nSee SH-60 Seahawk, HH-60 Pave Hawk, and HH-60 Jayhawk for operators of military H-60/S-70 variants; see Sikorsky S-70 for non-military operators of other H-60/S-70 family helicopters.\nSpecifications (UH-60M).\n\"Data from\" Encyclopedia of Modern Warplanes, International Directory, Tomajczyk, U.S. Army, Lockheed Martin brochure General Electric T700-GE-701D BrochureGeneral characteristics* Crew: 2 pilots + 2 crew chiefs/gunners* Capacity: of cargo internally, including 11 seated troops or 6 stretchers, or of cargo externally\nPerformance* Endurance: * g limits: * Roll rate: \nArmament\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He wrote more than eighty operas, the best known of which is \"Il matrimonio segreto\" (1792); most of his operas are comedies. He also wrote instrumental works and church music.\nCimarosa was principally based in Naples, but spent some of his career in various other parts of Italy, composing for the opera houses of Rome, Venice, Florence and elsewhere. He was engaged by Catherine the Great of Russia as her court composer and conductor between 1787 and 1791. In his later years, returning to Naples, he backed the losing side in the struggle to overthrow the monarchy there, and was imprisoned and then exiled. He died in Venice at the age of 51.\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nCimarosa was born in Aversa, a town near Naples. His family name was Cimmarosa, which is how he is recorded on his baptismal record. He appears to have been an only child. His father, Gennaro, was a stonemason, and within days of Domenico's birth the family moved to Naples where Gennaro found employment on the construction of the Palace of Capodimonte. When Domenico was seven, Gennaro fell from scaffolding and was killed. His widow, Anna, was taken on as a laundress by the monastic order of the Church of San Severo, and Cimarosa received a good education\u2014including musical training\u2014from the monks and clergy of the church. The organist of the monastery, Padre Polcano, took a particular interest in his education and Cimarosa progressed so well in his musical studies that he was admitted to Naples's leading college of music, the Conservatorio di S Maria di Loreto, in 1761, when he was twelve. His teachers were Gennaro Manna and Fedele Fenaroli for composition and Saverio Carcais, the \"maestro de violino\". He was a capable keyboard player, violinist and singer, but composition was his primary concern as a student; in 1770 he, Niccol\u00f2 Antonio Zingarelli and Giuseppe Giordani were senior students in the composition class.\nAs a student, Cimarosa wrote sacred motets and masses, but he first came to public notice with the premiere in 1772 of his first \"commedia per musica\", \"Le stravaganze del conte\", performed at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples. The work met with approval, and was followed in the same year by \"Le pazzie di Stelladaura e di Zoroastro\". This work was also successful, and the fame of the young composer began to spread all over Italy. In 1774, he was invited to Rome to write an opera for the \"stagione\" of that year; and there he produced another comic opera called \"L'italiana in Londra\". In 1777 he married Constanza Suffi, who died the following year.\nSuccessful composer.\nIn the 1770s and 1780s Cimarosa wrote numerous operas for the theatres of Italy. He was best known for his comedies, but wrote serious works from time to time, including \"Caio Mario\" (1780) and \"Alessandro nell'Indie\" (1781). As well as stage works he wrote church music. He was appointed supernumerary organist of the Neapolitan royal court in November 1779, and by the early 1780s he was a visiting maestro at the Ospedaletto di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice.\nFor Rome, he composed operas for three different theatres in the late 1780s and early 1780s; these works included \"Il ritorno di Don Calandrino\", \"L'italiana in Londra\", \"Le donne rivali\", \"Il pittore parigino\" and for La Scala, Milan, following the success there of a revival of \"L'impresario in angustie\", he composed \"La Circe\", a \"dramma per musica\" in three acts, with a story loosely based on the \"Odyssey\". At some point in the 1780s Cimarosa married for the second time; his wife, Gaetana, \"n\u00e9e\" Pallante, was Constanza's step-sister; she and Cimarosa had two sons. She died in 1796.\nIn 1787, Cimarosa went to Saint Petersburg at the invitation of Empress Catherine II. He was one of a succession of Italian composers engaged by the Russian court over the years; others were Vincenzo Manfredini (from 1762 to 1769), Baldassare Galuppi (1765\u20131768), Tommaso Traetta (1768\u20131775), Giovanni Paisiello (1776\u20131784), and Giuseppe Sarti (1785\u20131801). He composed a serious opera, \"Cleopatra\", and revised two of his existing comic pieces \"Le donne rivali\" and \"I due baroni di Rocca Azzurra\". Other compositions for Catherine's court included a Requiem, in G minor (1787). Cimarosa was less successful in Saint Petersburg than some of his compatriots; the works of his subordinate, Martin y Soler, gained more favour with the empress, and this, combined with economies that meant losing most of the Italian singers, and Cimarosa's dislike of the severe Russian winters, led him to leave Russia in June 1791.\nAfter spending three months in Warsaw, Cimarosa arrived in Vienna. His music was already popular there, and the emperor, Leopold II, appointed him Kapellmeister to the court, and commissioned a new opera. The result was \"Il matrimonio segreto\", to a text by Giovanni Bertati, based on the 1766 play, \"The Clandestine Marriage\", by George Colman the Elder and David Garrick. The opera, performed at the Burgtheater on 7 February 1792, was so successful that Leopold had it played again the same evening in his private chambers \u2013 \"the longest encore in operatic history\" as one critic put it. Cimarosa did not consider the work his best, but it has a better libretto than some of his other comic operas, the plot clear, the characters well drawn and elaborate disguises and coincidences dispensed with. The composer's own favourite of his operas was \"Artemisia, regina di Caria\", a serious work, composed for Naples five years later.\nLater years.\nCimarosa's success was international. He was, together with Paisiello, the most popular opera composer in the late 18th century. He composed 60 opere buffe and 20 opere serie, many of which quickly entered the repertoire of opera houses throughout Europe. They were performed in Berlin, Copenhagen, Hamburg, London, Prague and Stockholm, as well as Saint Petersburg, Vienna and all the main Italian cities. Between 1783 and 1790 Haydn conducted performances of thirteen Cimarosa operas for his employers at Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy and many of the pieces were given several times. Cimarosa's \"La ballerina amante\", a \"commedia per musica\" first performed in Naples was chosen as the inaugural work at the Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos, Lisbon, in June 1793.\nThree weeks after the premiere of \"Il matrimonio segreto\" the emperor Leopold died suddenly. His successor, Francis II, was less interested in music than Leopold had been, and in 1793, Cimarosa returned to Naples. In 1796 he was appointed principal organist of the royal chapel, and he continued to produce new operas and revise older ones. He reworked \"L'italiana in Londra\" and \"I due baroni\", adapting them for local taste by adding sections in Neapolitan dialect. The most important new works from this last phase of his career were \"Le astuzie femminili\" (1794) and two serious operas,\" Penelope\" (1794) and \"Gli Orazi e i Curiazi\" (1796); the first two of these were composed for Naples, and the last for La Fenice in Venice.\nDuring the occupation of Naples by the troops of the French Republic, in 1799 Cimarosa joined the liberal party, but the monarchy was soon restored, and took strong measures against those with liberal or revolutionary connections. Cimarosa was imprisoned along with many of his political friends, and escaped the death sentence only through the intercession of influential admirers, including Cardinals Consalvi and Ruffo and Lady Hamilton. He was exiled from Naples, and went to Venice. He was terminally ill by this time, probably with stomach cancer, and he died on 11 January 1801, aged 51, composing until almost the end. His last opera, \"Artemisia\" was left unfinished. A rumour spread that he had been poisoned by agents of the Bourbons, but an inquest showed it to be unfounded. He was buried in the now destroyed Church of St. Michael the Archangel, near where he had lived in Venice.\nWorks.\nAlthough Cimarosa wrote a considerable quantity of instrumental and church music, he was, and remains, best known for his operas. He was famous for his facility as a composer, although he frequently reused material, as was usual in his day, and employed assistants for routine tasks such as composing recitatives. In the article on Cimarosa in \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" (2001), Jennifer E. Johnson and Gordana Lazarevich write that he rose above the mediocrity of some the librettos he set and produced music \"suffused with lightness, elegance and finesse\".\nCimarosa avoided the rigidity of the traditional da capo aria, and wrote solo numbers consisting of more flexible divisions, with changes of tempo, metre and key to reflect the words of his librettists. Johnson and Lazarevich comment that this freedom of form conveys spontaneity and flexibility. Cimarosa's arias often speed up for the closing section, in the style of cabalettas. Providing contrast to the vocal display pieces, he often wrote quite simple arias in the manner of cavatinas. A feature of his scores is the sustained writing for concerted voices. In the words of the \"Grove\" article:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One of Cimarosa's strengths was the composition of witty and vivacious ensembles. \"Il matrimonio segreto\", an ensemble opera in the style of Mozart's \"Le nozze di Figaro\", is composed of eight arias, four duets, three trios, a quartet, a quintet and two finales featuring all six characters.\nHarmonically, Cimarosa was not innovative, remaining content with traditional diatonic conventions. In the view of Johnson and Lazarevich his musical strengths are to be found in \"the richness of his melodic invention, the brilliance and energy of his rhythmic and melodic motifs and his constantly lively accompaniments\".\nCimarosa's approach to orchestration developed over his career. His earlier works are generally written for strings, oboes, horns and trumpets, and occasionally bassoons and flutes. In these pieces the function of the orchestra is to provide discreet support for the voices. During his four years in Saint Petersburg, he began to use clarinets, and to orchestrate more fully and richly. Johnson and Lazarevich instance \"Il matrimonio segreto\", in which a large orchestra \"provides colour and exhibits independent motivic and rhythmic material that serves as commentary on the action\".\nCimarosa wrote a number of piano sonatas, which were discovered in manuscript in the 1920s; the quantity has been asserted as over 80 single-movement works, but it is thought that many of these may in fact belong with each other as three-movement works. The work sometimes referred to as Cimarosa's \"Concerto for oboe\" is in fact a 1949 confection by Arthur Benjamin, consisting of arrangements of movements from the sonatas.\nReputation.\nJohnson and Lazarevich write that Cimarosa's reputation during his lifetime reached a height unsurpassed until Rossini's heyday, and he continued to be highly regarded into the 19th century. Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix preferred Cimarosa's music to Mozart's. He wrote of \"Il matrimonio segreto\", \"It is perfection itself. No other musician has this symmetry, this expressiveness and sense of the appropriate, this gaiety and tenderness, and above all \u2026 incomparable elegance\". Stendhal wrote that Cimarosa, Mozart and Shakespeare were the only passions of his life. To Stendhal, Cimarosa was \"the Moli\u00e8re of composers\", and he claimed to have seen \"Il matrimonio segreto\" more than 100 times.\nHector Berlioz, who hated Italian opera, was not an admirer: \"I should throw to the devil the unique and interminable \"Matrimonio Segreto\", which is nearly as tiresome as \"The Marriage of Figaro\" without being anything like so musical.\" Robert Schumann was impressed by Cimarosa's \"absolutely masterful\" orchestration, but by little else. Eduard Hanslick praised Cimarosa's wonderful facility, masterly compositional strokes and good taste. \"Full of sunshine \u2013 that is the right expression for Cimarosa's music\".\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pacini was born in Catania, Sicily, the son of the buffo Luigi Pacini, who was to appear in the premieres of many of Giovanni's operas. The family was of Tuscan origin, living in Catania when the composer was born. He served as the Florence Conservatory's first director from 1849 through 1862.\nHis first 25 or so operas were written when Gioachino Rossini dominated the Italian operatic stage. But Pacini's operas were \"rather superficial\", a fact which, later, he candidly admitted in his \"Memoirs\". For some years he held the post of \"director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.\" Later, retiring to Viareggio to found a school of music, Pacini took time to assess the state of opera in Italy and, during a five-year period during which he stopped composing, laid out his ideas in his Memoirs. Like Saverio Mercadante, who also reassessed the strength and weaknesses of this period in opera, Pacini's style did change, but he quickly became eclipsed by the rising influence of Giuseppe Verdi on the Italian operatic scene, and many of his operas appeared to be old fashioned and rarely, if ever, appeared outside of Italy.\" Pacini's work is largely forgotten today, although some recordings do exist.\nCareer as composer.\nDuring his lifetime, Pacini wrote some 74 operas. This is less than earlier estimates, which ranged from 80 to 90, since it has now been ascertained that many were just alternate titles for other works. It has been noted that he \"bothered little about harmony and instrumentation\", a fact supported by Rossini who once said: \"God help us if he knew music. No one could resist him\". Certainly, Pacini recognized Rossini's strengths and his dominance during this period: \"Everyone followed the same school, the same fashions, and as a result they were all imitators of the great luminary ... If I was a follower of the great man from Pesaro, so was everyone else\"\nAfter Rossini moved to Paris in 1824, Pacini and his contemporaries (Giacomo Meyerbeer, Nicola Vaccai, Michele Carafa, Carlo Coccia, Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, the brothers Federico and Luigi Ricci, and Saverio Mercadante) collectively began to change the nature of Italian opera and took bel canto singing in a new direction. Orchestration became heavier, coloratura was reduced, especially for men's voices, and more importance was placed on lyrical pathos. While there were exceptions, romantic leads were assigned to tenors (in Rossini's time, they were frequently sung by alto or mezzo-soprano women). Villains became basses or later baritones (while they often were tenors for Rossini). Over time, far more emphasis was placed on the drama.\nThe role that Pacini played in instituting these changes is only now beginning to be recognized. There is little doubt that Pacini and his contemporary Nicola Vaccai exerted a stronger influence on Bellini than has been credited before. This change in attitude can be credited to the revival of two key works: Vaccai's \"Giulietta e Romeo\" and Pacini's \"L'ultimo giorno di Pompei\", both composed in 1825 within a few weeks of each other.\nThe success of many of Pacini's lighter operas especially \"Il Barone di Dolsheim, La sposa fedele,\" and \"La schiava in Bagdad\" (all composed between 1818 and 1820) made Pacini one of the most prominent composers in Italy. His position was greatly enhanced by the rapid-fire successes of \"Alessandro nelle Indie\" (Naples, 1824, revised, Milan, 1826; given and recorded in London in November 2006), \"Amazilia\" (Naples 1824, revised, Vienna, 1827), and the previously mentioned \"L'Ultimo giorno di Pompei\" (Naples, 1825).\nIn \"Alessandro nelle Indie\", the title role of Alessandro was created by a baritonal tenor, Andrea Nozzari, but it was sung by the much lighter-voiced Giovanni David at the Milan revival, indicating Pacini's desire to go in a new direction. \"Arabi nelle Gallie\" (Milan, 1827) reached many of the world's most important stages and was the first Pacini opera to be given in the United States. It was staged frequently in Italy, and it was not until 1830 that Bellini's first success, \"Il pirata\" (also Milan, 1827) passed \"Gli arabi nelle Gallie\" in number of performances at the Teatro alla Scala. While this is not generally recognized, it was Pacini, rather than Donizetti, Mercadante or Bellini, who gave Rossini the stiffest competition in Italy during the 1820s.\nMany operas followed that are almost completely forgotten. However, one of these, \"Il corsaro\" (Rome, 1831) was revived 173 years later, in 2004, albeit only with piano accompaniment. This work is different in many ways from Verdi's later opera by the same name. The title role, Corrado, is a musico role for an alto, and the villainous Seid is a tenor.\nHowever, first Bellini and then Donizetti outstripped Pacini in fame. Many of his later operas, such as \"Carlo di Borgogna\" of 1835, were failures, but this is one of the few Pacini operas currently available on CD, and it has received many warm reviews. Pacini himself was the first to recognize his apparent defeat noted in memoirs: \"I began to realize that I must withdraw from the field. Bellini, the divine Bellini, has surpassed me.\" Some years later, he resumed composing, and, after one more setback, enjoyed his greatest triumph with \"Saffo\" (Naples, 1840).\nAfter \"Saffo\", Pacini entered into another period of prominence. Donizetti had departed for Paris, Bellini had died, and Mercadante's major successes were behind him, thus Verdi offered the only important competition. Pacini's successes during this time period include \"La fidanzata corsa\" (Naples, 1842), \"Maria, regina d'Inghilterra\" (Palermo, 1843), \"Medea\" (Palermo, 1843 with several later revisions, the last of which was in Naples in 1853), \"Lorenzino de' Medici\" (Venice, 1845), \"Bondelmonte\" (Florence, 1845), \"Stella di Napoli\" (Naples,1845) and \"La regina di Cipro\" (Turin, 1846). \"Allan Cameron\" (Venice, 1848) is noteworthy because it deals with the youth of King Charles II, before he was crowned King of England. In contrast\u2014by 1844\u2014Verdi had written \"Nabucco\", \"I Lombardi\", and \"Ernani\", thus outstripping Pacini.\nThis period of accomplishments was followed by a long but slow decline, marked only by the moderate successes of \"La punizione\" (Venice, 1854), \"Il saltimbanco\" (Rome, 1858), and \"Niccol\u00f2 de' Lapi\" (Florence, 1873).\nPacini died in Pescia, Tuscany in 1867. During his lifetime, he produced much music of high caliber. His output of more than 70 stage works is staggering even compared to Rossini (41 operas) and Handel (43\u00a0operas), and he will always be remembered, with Donizetti, as one of the most prolific composers in the history of opera.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37945", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37945", "title": "Giovanni Paisiello", "text": "Italian Classical era composer (1740\u20131816)\nGiovanni Paisiello (or Paesiello; 9 May 1740 \u2013 5 June 1816) was an Italian composer of the Classical era, and was the most popular opera composer of the late 1700s. His operatic style influenced Mozart and Rossini.\nLife.\nPaisiello was born in Taranto in the Apulia region and educated by the Jesuits there. He became known for his beautiful singing voice and in 1754 was sent to the Conservatorio di S. Onofrio at Naples, where he studied under Francesco Durante, and eventually became assistant master. For the theatre of the Conservatorio, which he left in 1763, he wrote some intermezzi, one of which attracted so much notice that he was invited to write two operas, \"La Pupilla\" and \"Il Mondo al Rovescio\", for Bologna, and a third, \"Il Marchese di Tidipano\", for Rome.\nHis reputation now firmly established, he settled for some years at Naples, where, despite the popularity of Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni, Domenico Cimarosa and Pietro Guglielmi, of whose triumphs he was bitterly jealous, he produced a series of highly successful operas, one of which, \"L'idolo cinese\", made a deep impression upon the Neapolitan public. The young Mozart and his father met him in Bologna in 1771.\nIn 1772, Paisiello began to write church music and composed a requiem for Gennara di Borbone, of the reigning dynasty. In the same year, he married Cecilia Pallini, and the marriage was a happy one. In 1776, Paisiello was invited by the empress Catherine the Great of Russia to Saint Petersburg, where he remained for eight years, producing, among other charming works, his masterpiece, \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\", which soon attained a European reputation. The fate of this opera marks an epoch in the history of Italian art; for with it the gentle suavity cultivated by the masters of the 18th century died out to make room for the dazzling brilliance of a later period.\nWhen, in 1816, Gioachino Rossini set another version of the libretto by Cesare Sterbini under the title of \"Almaviva ossia la inutil precauzione\" the fans of Paisiello stormed the stage. Rossini's opera, now known as \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\", is now acknowledged as Rossini's greatest work, while Paisiello's opera is only infrequently produced\u2014a strange instance of poetical vengeance since Paisiello himself had many years previously endeavoured to eclipse the fame of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi by resetting the libretto of his famous intermezzo, \"La serva padrona\".\nPaisiello left Russia in 1784, and, after producing \"Il Re Teodoro\" at Vienna, entered the service of Ferdinand IV of Naples, where he composed many of his best operas, including \"Nina\" and \"La Molinara\". \nThe Irish tenor Michael Kelly witnessed another meeting between Paisiello and Mozart when he visited Vienna later that year. Mozart had just finished a string of piano concertos, K. 449 and 453, written for his pupil Barbara Ployer. When Ployer\u2019s father arranged a performance at his summer estate in D\u00f6bling, Mozart wrote to his father, \"Fr\u00e4ulein Babette will play her new concerto in G and I shall play the Quintet and then we\u2019ll perform together the grand sonata for two pianos. I shall fetch Paisiello with my carriage for I want him to hear my compositions as well as my pupil.\"\nAfter many vicissitudes, resulting from political and dynastic changes, he was invited to Paris (1802) by Napoleon, whose favour he had won five years previously by composing a march for the funeral of General Hoche. Napoleon treated him munificently, while cruelly neglecting two more famous composers, Luigi Cherubini and \u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul, to whom the new favourite transferred the hatred he had formerly borne to Cimarosa, Guglielmi and Piccinni.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Paisiello conducted the music of the court in the Tuileries with a stipend of 10,000 francs and 4,800 for lodging, but he entirely failed to conciliate the Parisian public, who received his opera \"Proserpine\" so coldly that, in 1803, he requested and with some difficulty obtained permission to return to Italy, upon the plea of his wife's ill health. On his arrival at Naples Paisiello was reinstated in his former appointments by Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat, but he had taxed his genius beyond its strength and was unable to meet the demands now made upon it for new ideas. His prospects, too, were precarious. The power of the Bonaparte family was tottering to its fall, and Paisiello's fortunes fell with it. The death of his wife in 1815 tried him severely. His health failed rapidly, and constitutional jealousy of the popularity of others was a source of worry and vexation.\nPaisiello is known to have composed 94 operas, which are known for their gracefully beautiful melodies. Perhaps the best-known tune he ever wrote is \"Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento\" from \"La Molinara\", immortalized when Beethoven composed piano variations based on it. Paganini also wrote violin variations based on the same tune. Another favourite vocal piece is \"Chi vuol la zingarella\" from \"I zingari in fiera\", which vividly portrays the scene of an attractive gypsy girl with its dramatic music. Paisiello also wrote a great deal of church music, including eight masses; as well as fifty-one instrumental compositions and many stand-alone songs. He also composed the Inno al Re, the national anthem of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Manuscript scores of many of his operas were presented to the library of the British Museum by Domenico Dragonetti.\nThe library of the Gerolamini at Naples possesses an interesting manuscript compilation recording Paisiello's opinions on contemporary composers, and exhibiting him as a somewhat severe critic, especially of the work of Pergolesi.\nThe \"Grove Concise Dictionary of Music\" notes that \"Paisiello was one of the most successful and influential opera composers of his time. Most of his over 80 operas are comic and use a simple, direct and spirited style, latterly with sharper characterization, more colourful scoring and warmer melodies (features that influenced Mozart). His serious operas have less than the conventional amount of virtuoso vocal writing; those for Russia are the closest to Gluck's 'reform' approach.\nWorks.\nSacred music for rulers' chapels.\nWorks composed for Napoleon's or King Joseph's chapels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The color's name is derived from the \"Viola\" genus of flowers.\nIn the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, violet is produced by mixing red and blue light, with more blue than red. In the RYB color model historically used by painters, violet is created with a combination of red and blue pigments and is located between blue and purple on the color wheel. In the CMYK color model used in printing, violet is created with a combination of magenta and cyan pigments, with more magenta than cyan. On the RGB/CMY(K) color wheel, violet is located between blue and magenta.\nViolet is closely associated with purple. In optics, violet is a spectral color (referring to the color of different single wavelengths of light), whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red and blue (or violet) light, some of which humans perceive as similar to violet. In common usage, both terms are used to refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue.\nViolet has a long history of association with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye was extremely expensive in antiquity. The emperors of Rome wore purple togas, as did the Byzantine emperors. At one point in history, purple bells were also used in the flag of the Sassanid Empire. During the Middle Ages, violet was worn by bishops and university professors and was often used in art as the color of the robes of the Virgin Mary. In Chinese painting, the color violet represents the \"unity transcending the duality of Yin and yang\" and \"the ultimate harmony of the universe\". In New Age thinking, purple and/or violet is associated with the crown chakra. One European study suggests that violet is the color people most often associate with extravagance, individualism, vanity and ambiguity\nEtymology and definitions.\nThe word \"violet\" as a color name derives from the Middle English and Old French \"violete\", in turn from the Latin \"viola\", the name of the violet flower. The first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1370.\nRelationship to purple.\nViolet is closely associated with purple. In optics, violet is a spectral color: It refers to the color of any different single wavelength of light on the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum (between approximately 380 and 435 nanometers), whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red, blue and violet light, some of which some humans perceive as similar to violet. In common usage, both terms are used to refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue. Historically, violet has tended to be used for bluer hues and purple for redder hues. In the traditional color wheel used by painters, violet and purple are both placed between red and blue, with violet being closer to blue.\nIn science.\nOptics.\nViolet is at one end of the spectrum of visible light, between blue light, which has a longer wavelength, and ultraviolet light, which has a shorter wavelength and is not visible to humans. Violet wavelengths are between approximately 380 and 435 nanometers. The color violet appears dark because the S cones, which contribute very little to the perception of lightness, do not have a high sensitivity to violet light. The reason why to (typical trichromat) humans violet light appears slightly reddish compared to spectral blue (despite spectral red being at the other end of the visible spectrum) is, according to the opponent process hypothesis of color vision, that the S-cone type (i.e. the one most sensitive to short wavelengths) contributes some red to the red-versus-green opponent channel (which at the longer blue wavelengths gets counteracted by the M-cone type). Computer and television screens, using the RGB color model, cannot produce spectral violet light and instead they combine blue light at high intensity with red light at less intensity.\nMonochromatic lamps emitting spectral-violet wavelengths can be roughly approximated by the color named electric violet, which is a composed-light violet producing a similar effect to the human eye.\nChemistry \u2013 pigments and dyes.\nThe earliest violet pigments used by humans, found in prehistoric cave paintings, were made from the minerals manganese and hematite. Manganese is still used today by the Aranda people, a group of indigenous Australians, as a traditional pigment for coloring the skin during rituals. It is also used by the Hopi Indians of Arizona to color ritual objects.\nThe most famous violet-purple dye in the ancient world was Tyrian purple, made from a type of sea snail called the murex, found around the Mediterranean.\nIn western Polynesia, residents of the islands made a violet dye similar to Tyrian purple from the sea urchin. In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the purpura, found on the coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, and the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.\nDuring the Middle Ages, most artists made purple or violet on their paintings by combining red and blue pigments; usually blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with red ochre, cinnabar or minium. They also combined lake colors by mixing dye with powder; woad or indigo dye for blue and cochineal dye for red.\nOrcein, or \"purple moss\", was another common violet dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer's moss (Roccella tinctoria), combined with an ammoniac, usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.\nIn the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. Cudbear is a dye extracted from orchil lichens that can be used to dye wool and silk, without the use of mordant. Cudbear was developed by Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate. The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3\u20134 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-foot high wall built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.\nFrench purple was developed in France at about the same time. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with calcium chloride; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.\nCobalt violet is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as cobalt blue, cerulean blue and cobalt green. It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists, along with manganese violet.\nMauveine, also known as aniline purple and Perkin's mauve, was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered serendipitously during an attempt to make quinine in 1856. Its chemical name is 3-amino-2,\u00b19-dimethyl-5-phenyl-7-(p-tolylamino) phenazinium acetate.\nIn the 1950s, a new family of violet synthetic organic pigments called quinacridones came onto the market. They had originally been discovered in 1896, synthesized in 1936 and manufactured in the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to violet in color, and have the molecular formula C20H12N2O2. They have strong resistance to sunlight and washing, and are used in oil paints, watercolors and acrylics, as well as in automobile coatings and other industrial coatings.\nIn history and art.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nViolet is one of the oldest colors used by humans. Traces of very dark violet, made by grinding the mineral manganese, mixed with water or animal fat and then brushed on the cave wall or applied with the fingers, are found in the prehistoric cave art in Pech Merle, in France, dating back about 25,000 years. It has also been found in the cave of Altamira and Lascaux. It was sometimes used as an alternative to black charcoal. Sticks of manganese, used for drawing, have been found at sites occupied by Neanderthals in France and Israel. From the grinding tools at various sites, it appears it may also have been used to color the body and to decorate animal skins.\nMore recently, the earliest dates on cave paintings have been pushed back farther than 35,000 years. Hand paintings on rock walls in Australia may be even older, dating back as far as 50,000 years.\nBerries of the genus rubus, such as blackberries, were a common source of dyes in antiquity. The ancient Egyptians made a kind of violet dye by combining the juice of the mulberry with crushed green grapes. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls used a violet dye made from bilberry to color the clothing of slaves. These dyes made a satisfactory purple, but it faded quickly in sunlight and when washed.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nViolet and purple retained their status as the color of emperors and princes of the church throughout the long rule of the Byzantine Empire.\nWhile violet was worn less frequently by Medieval and Renaissance kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe's new universities. Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square violet caps and violet robes, or black robes with violet trim.\nViolet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance. Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing violet robes. The 15th-century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini advised artists: \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lacca, ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other)...\" For fresco painters, he advised a less-expensive version, made of a mixture of blue indigo and red hematite.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nIn the 18th century, purple was a color worn by royalty, aristocrats and other wealthy people. Good-quality purple fabric was too expensive for ordinary people.\nThe first cobalt violet, the intensely red-violet cobalt arsenate, was highly toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the 20th century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as cobalt phosphate. Cobalt violet appeared in the second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists with its range of purple colors. Cobalt violet was used by Paul Signac (1863\u20131935), Claude Monet (1840\u20131926) and Georges Seurat (1859\u20131891). Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate and cobalt phosphate are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. Cobalt phosphate is available in two varieties \u2014 a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt magnesium borate, was introduced in the later 20th century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast purple pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable purple pigments are dull by comparison. The high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt have limited its use.\nIn the 1860s, the popularity of using violet colors suddenly rose among painters and other artists. For example, Vincent van Gogh (1853\u20131890) was an avid student of color theory. He used violet in many of his paintings of the 1880s, including his paintings of irises and the swirling and mysterious skies of his starry night paintings, and often combined it with its complementary color, yellow. In his painting of his bedroom in Arles (1888), he used several sets of complementary colors; violet and yellow, red and green and orange and blue. In a letter about the painting to his brother Theo, he wrote, \"The color here...should be suggestive of sleep and repose in general...The walls are a pale violet. The floor is of red tiles. The wood of the bed and the chairs are fresh butter yellow, the sheet and the pillows light lemon green. The bedspread bright scarlet. The window green. The bed table orange. The bowl blue. The doors lilac...The painting should rest the head or the imagination.\"\nIn 1856, a young British chemist named William Henry Perkin was trying to make a synthetic quinine. His experiments produced instead an unexpected residue, which turned out to be the first synthetic aniline dye, a deep purple color called mauveine, or abbreviated simply to mauve (the dye being named after the lighter color of the mallow [mauve] flower). Used to dye clothes, it became extremely fashionable among the nobility and upper classes in Europe, particularly after Queen Victoria wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin's discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear. Perkin developed an industrial process, built a factory, and produced the dye by the ton so almost anyone could wear mauve. It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.\nIn culture.\nPopularity.\nIn a European survey, three percent of respondents said violet is their favorite color, ranking it behind blue, green, red, black and yellow (in that order), and tied with orange. Ten percent called it their least favorite color; brown, pink and gray were more unpopular.\nRoyalty and luxury.\nBecause of its status as the color of Roman emperors, monarchs and princes, purple and violet are often associated with luxury. Certain luxury goods, such as watches and jewelry, are often placed in boxes lined with violet velvet, since violet is the complementary color of yellow and shows gold to best advantage.\nVanity, extravagance and individualism.\nWhile violet is the color of humility in the symbolism of the Catholic Church, it has exactly the opposite meaning in general society. A European poll in 2000 showed it was the color most commonly associated with vanity. As a color that rarely exists in nature and so attracts attention, it is seen as a color of individualism and extravagance.\nHeian period.\nIn Japan, violet was a popular color introduced into dress during the Heian period (794\u20131185). The dye was made from the root of the alkanet plant (\"Anchusa officinalis\"), known as \"murasaki\" in Japanese. At about the same time, Japanese painters began to use a pigment made from the same plant.\nNew Age.\nThe \"New Age Prophetess\", Alice Bailey, in her system called the Seven Rays which classifies humans into seven different metaphysical psychological types, the \"seventh ray\" of \"Ceremonial Order\" is represented by the color violet. People who have this metaphysical psychological type are said to be \"on the Violet Ray\".\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, the color violet is used to represent the Ascended Master St. Germain.\n\"The Invocation of the Violet Flame\" is a system of meditation practice used in the \"I AM\" Activity and by the Church Universal and Triumphant (both Ascended Master Teaching religions).\nReligion.\nIn the Roman Catholic church, violet is worn by bishops and archbishops, red by cardinals and white by the Pope. Ordinary priests wear black. As in many other Western churches, violet is the liturgical color of Advent and Lent, which respectively celebrate the expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the Crucifixion of Jesus and the time for penance and/or mourning.\nA stained glass window installed in the early 1920s in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles depicts God the Father wearing a violet robe.\nAfter the Vatican II Council, which modified many of the rules of the Catholic church, priests began to wear violet robes when celebrating masses for the dead. Black was no longer used, since it was the color of mourning outside the church and deemed inappropriate in a religious ceremony.\nIn Hinduism, violet is used to symbolically represent the seventh, crown chakra (Sahasrara).\nPolitics.\nIn the early 20th century, violet, white and gold were the colors of the women's suffrage movement in the United States, seeking the right to vote for women. The colors were said to represent liberty and dignity. For this reason, the postage stamp issued in 1936 to honor Susan B. Anthony, a prominent leader of the suffrage movement in the United States, was colored the reddish tone of violet sometimes known as red-violet.\nIn 1908, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, co-editor of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) newspaper, designed the color scheme for the suffragette movement in Britain and Ireland, with violet for loyalty and dignity, white for purity and green for hope.\nThe pan-European movement Volt Europa and its national subsidiary parties use violet in their uniforms.\nA small New Age political party in Germany with about 1,150 members is called The Violet Party. It believes in direct democracy, a guaranteed minimum income and politics based on spirituality. It was founded in Dortmund in 2001.\nLesbianism.\nViolet flowers and their color became symbolically associated with lesbianism. It was used as a special code by lesbians and bisexual women for self-identification and also to communicate support for the sexual preference. This connection originates from the poet Sappho and fragments of her poems. In one poem, she describes a lost partner wearing a garland of \"violet tiaras, braided rosebuds, dill and crocus twined around\" her neck. In another fragment, she recalls her partner as having \"put around yourself [many wreaths] of violets and roses.\"\nThe labrys lesbian flag, created in 1999 by graphic designer Sean Campbell, features a labrys superimposed on the inverted black triangle set against a violet background.\nFlags.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the RYB color model historically used in the arts, purple is a secondary color created by combining red and blue pigments. In the CMYK color model used in modern printing, purple is made by combining magenta pigment with either cyan pigment, black pigment, or both. In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, purple is created by mixing red and blue light in order to create colors that appear similar to violet light. According to color theory, purple is considered a cool color.\nPurple has long been associated with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye\u2014made from the secretions of sea snails\u2014was extremely expensive in antiquity. Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. Similarly in Japan, the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy.\nAccording to contemporary surveys in Europe and the United States, purple is the color most often associated with rarity, royalty, luxury, ambition, magic, mystery, piety and spirituality. When combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity, and seduction.\nEtymology and definitions.\nThe modern English word \"purple\" comes from the Old English \"purpul,\" which derives from Latin \"purpura\", which, in turn, derives from the Greek (\"porphura\"), the name of the Tyrian purple dye manufactured in classical antiquity from a mucus secreted by the spiny dye-murex snail. The first recorded use of the word \"purple\" dates to the late 900s AD.\nIn art, history, and fashion.\nIn prehistory and the ancient world.\nPurple first appeared in prehistoric art during the Neolithic era. The artists of Pech Merle cave and other Neolithic sites in France used sticks of manganese and hematite powder to draw and paint animals and the outlines of their own hands on the walls of their caves. These works have been dated to between 16,000 and 25,000 BC.\nPurple textiles, dating back to the early second millennium BCE, were found in Syria, making them the oldest known purple textiles in the world. These findings include textiles from a burial site in Chagar Bazar, dating back to the 18th-16th centuries BCE, as well as preserved textile samples discovered in gypsum at the Royal Palace of Qatna.\nAs early as the 15th century BC, the citizens of Sidon and Tyre, two cities on the coast of Ancient Phoenicia (present day Lebanon), were producing purple dye from a sea snail called the spiny dye-murex. Clothing colored with the Tyrian dye was mentioned in both the \"Iliad\" of Homer and the \"Aeneid\" of Virgil. The deep, rich purple dye made from this snail became known as Tyrian purple.\nThe process of making the dye was long, difficult and expensive. Thousands of the tiny snails had to be found, their shells cracked, the snail removed. Mountains of empty shells have been found at the ancient sites of Sidon and Tyre. The snails were left to soak, then a tiny gland was removed and the juice extracted and put in a basin, which was placed in the sunlight. There, a remarkable transformation took place. In the sunlight the juice turned white, then yellow-green, then green, then violet, then a red which turned darker and darker. The process had to be stopped at exactly the right time to obtain the desired color, which could range from a bright crimson to a dark purple, the color of dried blood. Then either wool, linen or silk would be dyed. The exact hue varied between crimson and violet, but it was always rich, bright and lasting.\nTyrian purple became the color of kings, nobles, priests and magistrates all around the Mediterranean. It was mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament); in the Book of Exodus, God instructs Moses to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth \"of blue, and purple, and scarlet,\" to be used in the curtains of the Tabernacle and the garments of priests. The term used for purple in the 4th-century Latin Vulgate version of the Bible passage is \"purpura\" or Tyrian purple. In the \"Iliad\" of Homer, the belt of Ajax is purple, and the tails of the horses of Trojan warriors are dipped in purple. In the \"Odyssey\", the blankets on the wedding bed of Odysseus are purple. In the poems of Sappho (6th century BC) she celebrates the skill of the dyers of the Greek kingdom of Lydia who made purple footwear, and in the play of Aeschylus (525\u2013456 BC), Queen Clytemnestra welcomes back her husband Agamemnon by decorating the palace with purple carpets. In 950 BC, King Solomon was reported to have brought artisans from Tyre to provide purple fabrics to decorate the Temple of Jerusalem.\nAlexander the Great (when giving imperial audiences as the basileus of the Macedonian Empire), the basileus of the Seleucid Empire, and the kings of Ptolemaic Egypt all wore Tyrian purple.\nThe Roman custom of wearing purple togas may have come from the Etruscans; an Etruscan tomb painting from the 4th century BC shows a nobleman wearing a deep purple and embroidered toga.\nIn Ancient Rome, the \"Toga praetexta\" was an ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border. It was worn by freeborn Roman boys who had not yet come of age, curule magistrates, certain categories of priests, and a few other categories of citizens.\nThe \"Toga picta\" was solid purple, embroidered with gold. During the Roman Republic, it was worn by generals in their triumphs, and by the Praetor Urbanus when he rode in the chariot of the gods into the circus at the Ludi Apollinares. During the Empire, the \"toga picta\" was worn by magistrates giving public gladiatorial games, and by the consuls, as well as by the emperor on special occasions.\nDuring the Roman Republic, when a triumph was held, the general being honored wore an entirely purple toga bordered in gold, and Roman Senators wore a toga with a purple stripe. However, during the Roman Empire, purple was more and more associated exclusively with the emperors and their officers. Suetonius claims that the early emperor Caligula had the King of Mauretania murdered for the splendour of his purple cloak, and that Nero forbade the use of certain purple dyes. In the late empire the sale of purple cloth became a state monopoly protected by the death penalty.\nAccording to the New Testament, Jesus Christ, in the hours leading up to his crucifixion, was dressed in purple (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1: \"porphura\") by the Roman garrison to mock his claim to be 'King of the Jews'.\nThe actual color of Tyrian purple seems to have varied from a reddish to a bluish purple. According to the Roman writer Vitruvius, (1st century BC), the murex shells coming from northern waters, probably \"Bolinus brandaris\", produced a more bluish color than those of the south, probably \"Hexaplex trunculus\". The most valued shades were said to be those closer to the color of dried blood, as seen in the mosaics of the robes of the Emperor Justinian in Ravenna. The chemical composition of the dye from the murex is close to that of the dye from indigo, and indigo was sometimes used to make a counterfeit Tyrian purple, a crime which was severely punished. What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color, but its luster, richness, its resistance to weather and light, and its high price.\nIn modern times, Tyrian purple has been recreated, at great expense. When the German chemist Paul Friedander tried to recreate Tyrian purple in 2008, he needed twelve thousand mollusks to create 1.4 ounces of dye, enough to color a handkerchief. In the year 2000, a gram of Tyrian purple made from ten thousand mollusks according to the original formula cost two thousand euros.\nChina.\nIn ancient China, purple was obtained not through the Mediterranean mollusc, but purple gromwell. The dye obtained did not easily adhere to fabrics, making purple fabrics expensive. Purple became a fashionable color in the state of Qi (\u9f4a, 1046 BC\u2013221 BC) because its ruler, Duke Huan of Qi, developed a preference for it. As a result, the price of purple fabric was over five times that of plain fabric. His minister, Guan Zhong (\u7ba1\u4ef2), eventually convinced him to relinquish this preference.\nChina was the first culture to develop a synthetic purple color.\nAn old hypothesis suggested links between the Chinese purple and blue and Egyptian blue, however, molecular structure analysis and evidence such as the absence of lead in Egyptian blue and the lack of examples of Egyptian blue in China, argued against the hypothesis. The use of quartz, barium, and lead components in ancient Chinese glass and Han purple and Han blue has been used to suggest a connection between glassmaking and the manufacture of pigments, and to prove the independence of the Chinese invention. Taoist alchemists may have developed Han purple from their knowledge of glassmaking.\nLead is used by the pigment maker to lower the melting point of the barium in Han Purple.\nPurple was regarded as a secondary color in ancient China. In classical times, secondary colors were not as highly prized as the five primary colors of the Chinese spectrum, and purple was used to allude to impropriety, in contrast to crimson, which was deemed a primary color and symbolized legitimacy. Nevertheless, by the 6th century AD, purple was ranked above crimson. Several changes to the ranks of colors occurred after that time.\nPurple in the Byzantine Empire and Carolingian Europe.\nThrough the early Christian era, the rulers of the Byzantine Empire continued the use of purple as the imperial color, for diplomatic gifts, and even for imperial documents and the pages of the Bible. Gospel manuscripts were written in gold lettering on parchment that was colored Tyrian purple. Empresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber, and the emperors born there were known as \"born to the purple,\" to separate them from emperors who won or seized the title through political intrigue or military force. Bishops of the Byzantine church wore white robes with stripes of purple, while government officials wore squares of purple fabric to show their rank.\nIn western Europe, the Emperor Charlemagne was crowned in 800 wearing a mantle of Tyrian purple, and was buried in 814 in a shroud of the same color, which still exists (see below). However, after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the color lost its imperial status. The great dye works of Constantinople were destroyed, and gradually scarlet, made with dye from the cochineal insect, became the royal color in Europe.\nThe Middle Ages and Renaissance.\nIn 1464, Pope Paul II decreed that cardinals should no longer wear Tyrian purple, and instead wear scarlet, from kermes and alum, since the dye from Byzantium was no longer available. Bishops and archbishops, of a lower status than cardinals, were assigned the color purple, but not the rich Tyrian purple. They wore cloth dyed first with the less expensive indigo blue, then overlaid with red made from kermes dye.\nWhile purple was worn less frequently by medieval and Renaissance kings and princes, it was worn by the professors of many of Europe's new universities. Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy, and they often wore square/violet or purple/violet caps and robes, or black robes with purple/violet trim. Purple/violet robes were particularly worn by students of divinity.\nPurple and violet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance. Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing purple or violet robes.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nIn the 18th century, purple was still worn on occasion by Catherine the Great and other rulers, by bishops and, in lighter shades, by members of the aristocracy, but rarely by ordinary people, because of its high cost. But in the 19th century, that changed.\nIn 1856, an eighteen-year-old British chemistry student named William Henry Perkin was trying to make a synthetic quinine. His experiments produced instead the first synthetic aniline dye, a purple shade called mauveine, shortened simply to mauve. It took its name from the mallow flower, which is the same color. The new color quickly became fashionable, particularly after Queen Victoria wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of 1862. Prior to Perkin's discovery, mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear. Perkin developed an industrial process, built a factory, and produced the dye by the ton, so almost anyone could wear mauve. It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion.\nPurple was popular with the pre-Raphaelite painters in Britain, including Arthur Hughes, who loved bright colors and romantic scenes.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nAt the turn of the century, purple was a favorite color of the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, who flooded his pictures with sensual purples and violets.\nIn the 20th century, purple retained its historic connection with royalty; George VI (1896\u20131952), wore purple in his official portrait, and it was prominent in every feature of the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, from the invitations to the stage design inside Westminster Abbey. But at the same time, it was becoming associated with social change; with the Women's Suffrage movement for the right to vote for women in the early decades of the century, with Feminism in the 1970s, and with the psychedelic drug culture of the 1960s.\nIn the early 20th century, purple, green, and white were the colors of the Women's Suffrage movement, which fought to win the right to vote for women, finally succeeding with the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. Later, in the 1970s, in a tribute to the Suffragettes, it became the color of the women's liberation movement.\nIn the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, prisoners who were members of non-conformist religious groups, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, were required to wear a purple triangle.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, it was also associated with counterculture, psychedelics, and musicians like Jimi Hendrix with his 1967 song \"Purple Haze\", or the English rock band of Deep Purple which formed in 1968. Later, in the 1980s, it was featured in the song and album \"Purple Rain\" (1984) by the American musician Prince.\nThe Purple Rain Protest was a protest against apartheid that took place in Cape Town, South Africa on 2 September 1989, in which a police water cannon with purple dye sprayed thousands of demonstrators. This led to the slogan \"The Purple Shall Govern\".\nThe violet or purple necktie became very popular at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, particularly among political and business leaders. It combined the assertiveness and confidence of a red necktie with the sense of peace and cooperation of a blue necktie, and it went well with the blue business suit worn by most national and corporate leaders.\nIn science and nature.\nOptics.\nThe meanings of the color terms violet and purple varies even among native speakers of English, for example between United Kingdom and United States. Optics research on purple and violet contains contributions of authors from different countries and different native languages, it is likely to be inconsistent in the use and meaning of the two colors.\nAccording to some speakers/authors of English, purple, unlike violet, is not one of the colors of the visible spectrum. It was not one of the colors of the rainbow identified by Isaac Newton. According to some authors, purple does not have its own wavelength of light. For this reason, it is sometimes called a \"non-spectral color\". According to some speakers of English, purple is simply a combination, in various proportions, of two primary colors, red and blue. According to other speakers of English, the same range of colors is called violet.\nIn some textbooks of color theory, and depending on the geographical-cultural origin of the author, a \"purple\" is defined as any non-spectral color between violet and red (excluding violet and red themselves). In that case, the spectral color violet would not be shades of purple. For other speakers of English, these colors are shades of purple.\nIn the traditional color wheel long used by painters, purple is placed between crimson and violet. However, also here there is much variation in color terminology depending on cultural background of the painters and authors, and sometimes the term violet is used and placed in between red and blue on the traditional color wheel. In a slightly different variation, on the color wheel, purple is placed between magenta and violet. This shade is sometimes called electric purple (see shades of purple).\nIn the RGB color model, named for the colors red, green, and blue, used to create all the colors on a computer screen or television, the range of purples is created by mixing red and blue light of different intensities on a black screen. The standard HTML color purple is created by red and blue light of equal intensity, at a brightness that is between full power and darkness.\nIn color printing, purple is sometimes represented by the color magenta mixed with cyan or black or sometimes by mixing magenta with red or blue. It can also be created by mixing just red and blue alone, but in that case the purple is less bright, with lower\nsaturation or intensity. A less bright purple can also be created with light or paint by adding a certain quantity of the third primary color (green for light or yellow for pigment).\nRelationship with violet.\nPurple is closely associated with violet. In common usage, both refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue. Historically, purple has tended to be used for redder hues and violet for bluer hues. In optics, violet is a spectral color; it refers to the color of any different single wavelength of light on the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, between approximately 380 and 450 nanometers, whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red, blue, and violet light, some of which humans perceive as similar to violet.\nOn a chromaticity diagram, the straight line connecting the extreme spectral colors (red and violet) is known as the line of purples (or 'purple boundary'); it represents one limit of human color perception. The color magenta used in the CMYK printing process is near the center of the line of purples, but most people associate the term \"purple\" with a somewhat bluer tone, such as is displayed by the color \"electric purple\" (a color also directly on the line of purples), shown below.\nOn the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, violet is on the curved edge in the lower left, while purples are on the straight line connecting the extreme colors red and violet; this line is known as the line of purples, or the purple line.\nPigments.\nDuring the Middle Ages, artists usually made purple by combining red and blue pigments; most often blue azurite or lapis-lazuli with red ochre, cinnabar, or minium. They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder; using woad or indigo dye for the blue, and dye made from cochineal for the red.\nDyes.\nThe most famous purple dye in the ancient world was Tyrian purple, made from a type of sea snail called the murex, found around the Mediterranean. (See history section above).\nIn western Polynesia, residents of the islands made a purple dye similar to Tyrian purple from the sea urchin. In Central America, the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail, the purpura, found on the coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies, while the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms, where it symbolized royalty.\nIn the Middle Ages, those who worked with blue and black dyes belonged to separate guilds from those who worked with red and yellow dyes, and were often forbidden to dye any other colors than those of their own guild. Most purple fabric was made by the dyers who worked with red, and who used dye from madder or cochineal, so medieval violet colors were inclined toward red.\nOrcein, or \"purple moss\", was another common purple dye. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, and was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer's moss (Roccella tinctoria), combined with an ammoniac, usually urine. Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.\nFrom the Middle Ages onward, purple dyes for the clothing of common people were often made from the blackberry or other red fruit of the genus rubus, or from the mulberry. All of these dyes were more reddish than bluish, and faded easily with washing and exposure to sunlight.\nA popular new dye which arrived in Europe from the New World during the Renaissance was made from the wood of the logwood tree (H\"aematoxylum campechianum\"), which grew in Spanish Mexico. Depending on the different minerals added to the dye, it produced a blue, red, black or, with the addition of alum, a purple color, it made a good color, but, like earlier dyes, it did not resist sunlight or washing.\nIn the 18th century, chemists in England, France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes. Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time. Cudbear is a dye extracted from orchil lichens that can be used to dye wool and silk, without the use of mordant. Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland: production began in 1758, The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate. The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for 3\u20134 weeks. Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder. The manufacture details were carefully protected, with a ten-feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility, and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy.\nFrench purple was developed in France at about the same time. The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia. Then the extract is acidified, the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed. Then it is dissolved in ammonia again, the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple, then it is precipitated with calcium chloride; the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples.\nCobalt violet is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the 19th century, and is made by a similar process as cobalt blue, cerulean blue and cobalt green. It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists. In spite of its name, this pigment produces a purple rather than violet color.\nMauveine, also known as aniline purple and Perkin's mauve, was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered serendipitously in 1856.\nIts chemical name is 3-amino-2,\u00b19-dimethyl-5-phenyl-7-(p-tolylamino)phenazinium acetate.\nFuchsine was another synthetic dye made shortly after mauveine. It produced a brilliant fuchsia color.\nIn the 1950s, a new family of purple and violet synthetic organic pigments called quinacridone came onto the market. It had originally been discovered in 1896, but were not synthesized until 1936, and not manufactured until the 1950s. The colors in the group range from deep red to bluish purple in color, and have the molecular formula C20H12N2O2. They have strong resistance to sunlight and washing, and are widely used today in oil paints, water colors, and acrylics, as well as in automobile coatings and other industrial coatings.\nAnthocyanins.\nCertain grapes, eggplants, pansies and other fruits, vegetables and flowers may appear purple due to the presence of natural pigments called anthocyanins. These pigments are found in the leaves, roots, stems, vegetables, fruits and flowers of all plants. They aid photosynthesis by blocking harmful wavelengths of light that would damage the leaves. In flowers, the purple anthocyanins help attract insects who pollinate the flowers. Not all anthocyanins are purple; they vary in color from red to purple to blue, green, or yellow, depending upon the level of their pH.\nPurple mountains phenomenon.\nIt has been observed that the greater the distance between a viewers eyes and mountains, the lighter and more blue or purple they will appear. This phenomenon, long recognized by Leonardo da Vinci and other painters, is called aerial perspective or atmospheric perspective. The more distant the mountains are, the less contrast the eye sees between the mountains and the sky.\nThe bluish color is caused by an optical effect called Rayleigh scattering. The sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths. Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light. The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun.\nAt sunrise and sunset, the light is passing through the atmosphere at a lower angle, and traveling a greater distance through a larger volume of air. Much of the green and blue is scattered away, and more red light comes to the eye, creating the colors of the sunrise and sunset and making the mountains look purple.\nThe phenomenon is referenced in the song \"America the Beautiful\", where the lyrics refer to \"purple mountains' majesty\" among other features of the United States landscape. A Crayola crayon called Purple Mountain Majesty in reference to the lyric was first formulated in 1993.\nMythology.\nJulius Pollux, a Greek grammarian who lived in the second century AD, attributed the discovery of purple to the Phoenician god and guardian of the city of Tyre, Heracles. According to his account, while walking along the shore with the nymph Tyrus, the god's dog bit into a murex shell, causing his mouth to turn purple. The nymph subsequently requested that Heracles create a garment for her of that same color, with Heracles obliging her demands giving birth to Tyrian purple.\nAssociations and symbolism.\nRoyalty.\nIn Europe, since some Roman emperors wore a Tyrian purple (\"purpura\") toga praetexta, purple has been the color most associated with power and royalty. The British royal family and other European royalty still use it as a ceremonial color on special occasions. In Japan, purple is associated with the emperor and Japanese aristocracy.\nPiety, faith, penitence, and theology.\nIn the West, purple or violet is a color often associated with piety and religious faith. In AD 1464, shortly after the Muslim conquest of Constantinople, which terminated the supply of Tyrian purple to Roman Catholic Europe, Pope Paul II decreed that cardinals should henceforth wear scarlet, dyed with expensive kermes, although this scarlet was still called \"Cardinal \"purple\"\". Bishops were assigned the color amaranth, being a pale and pinkish purple made then from a less-expensive mixture of indigo and cochineal.\nIn the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic liturgy, violet represents penitence; Anglican and Catholic priests wear a violet stole when they hear confession and a violet stole and chasuble during Advent and Lent. Since the Second Vatican Council of 1962\u20135, priests may wear violet vestments, but may still wear black ones, when officiating at funerals. The \"Roman Missal\" permits black, violet, or white vestments for the funeral Mass. White is worn when a child dies before the age of reason. Students and faculty of theology also wear purple academic dress for graduations and other university ceremonies.\nPurple is also often worn by senior pastors of Protestant churches and bishops of the Anglican Communion.\nThe color purple is also associated with royalty in Christianity, being one of the three traditional offices of Jesus Christ, i. e. king, although such a symbolism was assumed from the earlier Roman association or at least also employed by the ancient Romans.\nVanity, extravagance, individualism.\nIn Europe and America, purple is the color most associated with vanity, extravagance, and individualism. Among the seven deadly sins, it represents pride. It is a color which is used to attract attention.\nThe artificial, materialism and beauty.\nPurple is the color most often associated with the artificial and the unconventional. It is the major color that occurs the least frequently in nature, and was the first color to be synthesized.\nAmbiguity and ambivalence.\nPurple is the color most associated with ambiguity. Like other colors made by combining two primary colors, it is seen as uncertain and equivocal.\nMourning.\nIn Britain, purple is sometimes associated with mourning. In Victorian times, close relatives wore black for the first year following a death (\"deep mourning\"), and then replaced it with purple or dark green trimmed with black. This is rarely practised today.\nIn culture and society.\nCultures of Europe.\nAncient Rome.\nPurple represented the height of Roman virtue and cultural values.\nEngineering.\nThe color purple plays a significant role in the traditions of engineering schools across Canada. Purple is also the color of the Engineering Corp in the British Military.\nRhyme.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSexuality.\nPurple is sometimes associated with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. It is the symbolic color worn on Spirit Day, a commemoration that began in 2010 to show support for young people who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. Purple is closely associated with bisexuality, largely in part to the bisexual pride flag which combines pink \u2013 representing homosexuality \u2013 and blue \u2013 representing heterosexuality \u2013 to create the bisexual purple. The purple hand is another symbol sometimes used by the LGBT community during parades and demonstrations.\nBusiness.\nThe British chocolate company Cadbury chose purple as it was Queen Victoria's favourite color. The company trademarked the color purple for chocolates with registrations in 1995 and 2004. However, the validity of these trademarks is the matter of an ongoing legal dispute following objections by Nestl\u00e9.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner's hanging or a surprise school test. It was first introduced to the public in Martin Gardner's March 1963 Mathematical Games column in \"Scientific American\" magazine.\nThere is no consensus on its precise nature and consequently a canonical resolution has not been agreed on. Logical analyses focus on \"truth values\", for example by identifying it as paradox of self-reference. Epistemological studies of the paradox instead focus on issues relating to \"knowledge\"; for example, one interpretation reduces it to Moore's paradox. Some regard it as a \"significant problem\" for philosophy.\nDescription.\nThe paradox has been described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.\nHaving reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins by concluding that the \"surprise hanging\" can't be on Friday, as if he hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left \u2013 and so it won't be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday.\nHe then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't been hanged by Wednesday noon, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning, he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all.\nThe next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon on Wednesday \u2013 which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. Everything the judge said came true.\nOther versions of the paradox replace the death sentence with a surprise fire drill, examination, pop quiz, A/B test launch, a lion behind a door, or a marriage proposal.\nLogical school.\nFormulation of the judge's announcement into formal logic is made difficult by the vague meaning of the word \"surprise\". An attempt at formulation might be:\nGiven this announcement the prisoner can deduce that the hanging will not occur on the last day of the week. However, in order to reproduce the next stage of the argument, which eliminates the penultimate day of the week, the prisoner must argue that his ability to deduce, from statement (A), that the hanging will not occur on the last day, implies that a second-to-last-day hanging \"would not be surprising\". But since the meaning of \"surprising\" has been restricted to \"not deducible from the assumption that the hanging will occur during the week\" instead of \"not deducible from statement (A)\", the argument is blocked.\nThis suggests that a better formulation would in fact be:\nFitch has shown that this statement can still be expressed in formal logic. Using an equivalent form of the paradox which reduces the length of the week to just two days, he proved that although self-reference is not illegitimate in all circumstances, it is in this case because the statement is self-contradictory.\nEpistemological school.\nVarious epistemological formulations have been proposed that show that the prisoner's tacit assumptions about what he will know in the future, together with several plausible assumptions about knowledge, are inconsistent.\nChow (1998) provides a detailed analysis of a version of the paradox in which a surprise hanging is to take place on one of two days. Applying Chow's analysis to the case of the unexpected hanging (again with the week shortened to two days for simplicity), we start with the observation that the judge's announcement seems to affirm three things:\nAs a first step, the prisoner reasons that a scenario in which the hanging occurs on Tuesday is impossible because it leads to a contradiction: on the one hand, by S3, the prisoner would not be able to predict the Tuesday hanging on Monday evening; but on the other hand, by S1 and process of elimination, the prisoner \"would\" be able to predict the Tuesday hanging on Monday evening.\nChow's analysis points to a subtle flaw in the prisoner's reasoning. What is impossible is not a Tuesday hanging. Rather, what is impossible is a situation in which \"the hanging occurs on Tuesday despite the prisoner knowing on Monday evening that the judge's assertions S1, S2, and S3 are all true.\"\nThe prisoner's reasoning, which gives rise to the paradox, is able to get off the ground because the prisoner tacitly assumes that on Monday evening, he will (if he is still alive) know S1, S2, and S3 to be true. This assumption seems unwarranted on several different grounds. It may be argued that the judge's pronouncement that something is true can never be sufficient grounds for the prisoner \"knowing\" that it is true. Further, even if the prisoner knows something to be true in the present moment, unknown psychological factors may erase this knowledge in the future. Finally, Chow suggests that because the statement which the prisoner is supposed to \"know\" to be true is a statement about his \"inability\" to \"know\" certain things, there is reason to believe that the unexpected hanging paradox is simply a more intricate version of Moore's paradox. A suitable analogy can be reached by reducing the length of the week to just one day. Then the judge's sentence becomes: \"You will be hanged tomorrow, but you do not know that\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common members of the feldspar group are the \"plagioclase\" (sodium-calcium) feldspars and the \"alkali\" (potassium-sodium) feldspars. Feldspars make up about 60% of the Earth's crust and 41% of the Earth's continental crust by weight.\nFeldspars crystallize from magma as both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock. Rock formed almost entirely of calcic plagioclase feldspar is known as anorthosite. Feldspars are also found in many types of sedimentary rocks.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"feldspar\" derives from the German , a compound of the words \"\" (\"field\") and (\"flake\"). had long been used as the word for \"a rock easily cleaved into flakes\"; was introduced in the 18th century as a more specific term, referring perhaps to its common occurrence in rocks found in fields (Urban Br\u00fcckmann, 1783) or to its occurrence as \"fields\" within granite and other minerals (Ren\u00e9-Just Ha\u00fcy, 1804).\nThe change from to \"-spar\" was influenced by the English word \"spar\", meaning a non-opaque mineral with good cleavage. \"Feldspathic\" refers to materials that contain feldspar. The alternative spelling, \"felspar\", has fallen out of use. The term \"felsic\", meaning light coloured minerals such as quartz and feldspars, is an acronymic word derived from \"fel\"dspar and \"si\"lica, unrelated to the obsolete spelling \"felspar\".\nCompositions.\nThe feldspar group of minerals consists of tectosilicates, silicate minerals in which silicon ions are linked by shared oxygen ions to form a three-dimensional network. Compositions of major elements in common feldspars can be expressed in terms of three endmembers:\nSolid solutions between orthoclase and albite are called alkali feldspar. Solid solutions between albite and anorthite are called plagioclase, or, more properly, plagioclase feldspar. Only limited solid solution occurs between K-feldspar and anorthite, and in the two other solid solutions, immiscibility occurs at temperatures common in the crust of the Earth. Albite is considered both a plagioclase and an alkali feldspar.\nThe ratio of alkali feldspar to plagioclase feldspar, together with the proportion of quartz, is the basis for the QAPF classification of igneous rock. Calcium-rich plagioclase is the first feldspar to crystallize from cooling magma, then the plagioclase becomes increasingly sodium-rich as crystallization continues. This defines the continuous Bowen's reaction series. K-feldspar is the final feldspar to crystallize from the magma.\nAlkali feldspars.\nAlkali feldspars are grouped into two types: those containing potassium in combination with sodium, aluminium, or silicon; and those where potassium is replaced by barium. The first of these includes:\nPotassium and sodium feldspars are not perfectly miscible in the melt at low temperatures, therefore intermediate compositions of the alkali feldspars occur only in higher temperature environments. Sanidine is stable at the highest temperatures, and microcline at the lowest. Perthite is a typical texture in alkali feldspar, due to exsolution of contrasting alkali feldspar compositions during cooling of an intermediate composition. The perthitic textures in the alkali feldspars of many granites can be seen with the naked eye. Microperthitic textures in crystals are visible using a light microscope, whereas cryptoperthitic textures can be seen only with an electron microscope.\nAmmonium feldspar.\nBuddingtonite is an ammonium feldspar with the chemical formula: NH4AlSi3O8. It is a mineral associated with hydrothermal alteration of the primary feldspar minerals.\nBarium feldspars.\nBarium feldspars form as the result of the substitution of barium for potassium in the mineral structure. Barium feldspars are sometimes classified as a separate group of feldspars, and sometimes they are classified as a sub-group of alkali feldspars.\nThe barium feldspars are monoclinic and include the following:\nPlagioclase feldspars.\nThe plagioclase feldspars are triclinic. The plagioclase series follows (with percent anorthite in parentheses):\nIntermediate compositions of exsolve to two feldspars of contrasting composition during cooling, but diffusion is much slower than in alkali feldspar, and the resulting two-feldspar intergrowths typically are too fine-grained to be visible with optical microscopes. The immiscibility gaps in plagioclase solid solutions are more complex than those in alkali feldspars. The play of colours visible in some feldspar of labradorite composition is due to very fine-grained exsolution lamellae known as B\u00f8ggild intergrowth. The specific gravity in the plagioclase series increases from albite (2.62) to anorthite (2.72\u20132.75).\nStructure.\nThe structure of a feldspar crystal is based on aluminosilicate tetrahedra. Each tetrahedron consists of an aluminium or silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions. Each oxygen ion, in turn, is shared by a neighbouring tetrahedron to form a three-dimensional network. The structure can be visualized as long chains of aluminosilicate tetrahedra, sometimes described as crankshaft chains because their shape is kinked. Each crankshaft chain links to neighbouring crankshaft chains to form a three-dimensional network of fused four-member rings. The structure is open enough for cations, typically sodium, potassium, or calcium, to fit into it and provide charge balance. \nWeathering.\nChemical weathering of feldspars happens by hydrolysis and produces clay minerals, including illite, smectite, and kaolinite. Hydrolysis of feldspars begins with the feldspar dissolving in water, which happens best in acidic or basic solutions and less well in neutral ones. The speed at which feldspars are weathered is controlled by how quickly they are dissolved. Dissolved feldspar reacts with H+ or OH\u2212 ions and precipitates clays. The reaction also produces new ions in solution, with the variety of ions controlled by the type of feldspar reacting.\nThe abundance of feldspars in the Earth's crust means that clays are very abundant weathering products. About 40% of minerals in sedimentary rocks are clays and clays are the dominant minerals in the most common sedimentary rocks, mudrocks. They are also an important component of soils. Feldspar that has been replaced by clay looks chalky compared to more crystalline and glassy unweathered feldspar grains.\nFeldspars, especially plagioclase feldspars, are not very stable at the Earth's surface due to their high formation temperature. This lack of stability is why feldspars are easily weathered to clays. Because of this tendency to weather easily, feldspars are usually not prevalent in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks that contain large amounts of feldspar indicate that the sediment did not undergo much chemical weathering before being buried. This means it was probably transported a short distance in cold and/or dry conditions that did not promote weathering, and that it was quickly buried by other sediment. Sandstones with large amounts of feldspar are called arkoses.\nApplications.\nFeldspar is a common raw material used in glassmaking, ceramics, and to some extent as a filler and extender in paints, plastics, and rubber. In the US, about 66 % of feldspar is consumed in glassmaking, including glass containers and glass fibre. Ceramics (including electrical insulators, sanitaryware, tableware and tile) and other uses, such as fillers, accounted for the remainder.\nGlass: Feldspar provides both K2O and Na2O for fluxing, and Al2O3 and CaO as stabilizers. As an important source of Al2O3 for glassmaking, feldspar is valued for its low iron and\nrefractory mineral content, a low cost per unit of Al2O3, no volatiles and no waste.\nCeramics: Feldspars are used in the ceramic industry as a flux to form a glassy phase in bodies during firing, and thus promote vitrification. They are also used as a source of alkalies and alumina in glazes. The composition of feldspar used in different ceramic formulations varies depending on various factors, including the properties of the individual grade, the other raw materials and the requirements of the finished products. However, typical additions include: tableware, 15 % to 30 % feldspar; high-tension electrical porcelains, 25 % to 35 %; sanitaryware, 25 %; wall tile, 0 % to 10 %; and dental porcelain up to 80 % feldspar.\nEarth sciences: In earth sciences and archaeology, feldspars are used for potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and luminescence dating.\nMinor use: Some household cleaners (such as Bar Keepers Friend and Bon Ami) use feldspar to give a mild abrasive action.\nProduction.\nThe USGS estimated global production of feldspar in 2020 to be 26 million tonnes, with the top four producing countries being: China 2 million tonnes; India 5 million tonnes; Italy 4 million; Turkey 7.6 million tonnes.\nCommercial grades.\nTypical mineralogical and chemical analyses of three commercial grades used in ceramics are:\nExtraterrestrial.\nIn October 2012, the \"Curiosity\" rover found high feldspar content in a Mars rock.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Usually the resource being considered is running time, i.e. time complexity, but could also be memory or some other resource.\nBest case is the function which performs the minimum number of steps on input data of n elements. Worst case is the function which performs the maximum number of steps on input data of size n. Average case is the function which performs an average number of steps on input data of n elements.\nIn real-time computing, the worst-case execution time is often of particular concern since it is important to know how much time might be needed \"in the worst case\" to guarantee that the algorithm will always finish on time.\nAverage performance and worst-case performance are the most used in algorithm analysis. Less widely found is best-case performance, but it does have uses: for example, where the best cases of individual tasks are known, they can be used to improve the accuracy of an overall worst-case analysis. Computer scientists use probabilistic analysis techniques, especially expected value, to determine expected running times.\nThe terms are used in other contexts; for example the worst- and best-case outcome of an epidemic, worst-case temperature to which an electronic circuit element is exposed, etc. Where components of specified tolerance are used, devices must be designed to work properly with the worst-case combination of tolerances and external conditions.\nBest-case performance for algorithm.\nThe term \"best-case performance\" is used in computer science to describe an algorithm's behavior under optimal conditions. For example, the best case for a simple linear search on a list occurs when the desired element is the first element of the list.\nDevelopment and choice of algorithms is rarely based on best-case performance: most academic and commercial enterprises are more interested in improving average-case complexity and worst-case performance. Algorithms may also be trivially modified to have good best-case running time by hard-coding solutions to a finite set of inputs, making the measure almost meaningless.\nWorst-case versus amortized versus average-case performance.\nWorst-case performance analysis and average-case performance analysis have some similarities, but in practice usually require different tools and approaches.\nDetermining what \"typical input\" means is difficult, and often that average input has properties which make it difficult to characterise mathematically (consider, for instance, algorithms that are designed to operate on strings of text). Similarly, even when a sensible description of a particular \"average case\" (which will probably only be applicable for some uses of the algorithm) is possible, they tend to result in more difficult analysis of equations.\nWorst-case analysis gives a \"safe\" analysis (the worst case is never underestimated), but one which can be overly \"pessimistic\", since there may be no (realistic) input that would take this many steps.\nIn some situations it may be necessary to use a pessimistic analysis in order to guarantee safety. Often however, a pessimistic analysis may be too pessimistic, so an analysis that gets closer to the real value but may be optimistic (perhaps with some known low probability of failure) can be a much more practical approach. One modern approach in academic theory to bridge the gap between worst-case and average-case analysis is called smoothed analysis.\nWhen analyzing algorithms which often take a small time to complete, but periodically require a much larger time, amortized analysis can be used to determine the worst-case running time over a (possibly infinite) series of operations. This amortized cost can be much closer to the average cost, while still providing a guaranteed upper limit on the running time. So e.g. online algorithms are frequently based on amortized analysis.\nThe worst-case analysis is related to the worst-case complexity.\nPractical consequences.\nMany algorithms with bad worst-case performance have good average-case performance. For problems we want to solve, this is a good thing: we can hope that the particular instances we care about are average. For cryptography, this is very bad: we want typical instances of a cryptographic problem to be hard. Here methods like random self-reducibility can be used for some specific problems to show that the worst case is no harder than the average case, or, equivalently, that the average case is no easier than the worst case.\nOn the other hand, some data structures like hash tables have very poor worst-case behaviors, but a well written hash table of sufficient size will statistically never give the worst case; the average number of operations performed follows an exponential decay curve, and so the run time of an operation is statistically bounded.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was launched in 1927 by Colonel Jim Porter after three years of development. The 1960 merger of Newcastle Breweries with Scottish Brewers afforded the beer national distribution, and UK sales peaked in the early 1970s. The beer underwent a resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s with student unions selling it. Brewing moved in 2005 from Newcastle to Dunston, Tyne and Wear, and in 2010 to Tadcaster. In 2017, the Heineken Brewery in Zoeterwoude, Netherlands, also began production. Starting 2019, it has also been brewed by Lagunitas Brewing Company in Petaluma, California, and Chicago, Illinois, for the American and Canadian market, however the original product has also been available again starting in 2025.\nNewcastle Brown Ale is perceived in the UK as a working-man's beer, with a long association with heavy industry: the traditional economic staple of the North East of England. In export markets, it is seen as a trendy, premium import, being predominantly drunk by the young. It was one of the first beers to be distributed in a clear glass bottle and is most readily associated with this form of bottle in the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nTyne Brewery, Newcastle.\nNewcastle Brown Ale was originally created by Lieutenant Colonel James ('Jim') Herbert Porter (b. 1892, Burton upon Trent), a third-generation brewer at Newcastle Breweries, in 1927. Porter had served in the North Staffordshire Regiment in the First World War, earning his DSO with Bar, before moving to Newcastle. Porter had refined the recipe for Newcastle Brown Ale alongside chemist Archie Jones over a period of three years. When Porter actually completed the beer, he believed it to be a failure, as he had actually been attempting to recreate Bass ale. The original beer had an original gravity of 1060\u00ba and was 6.25 ABV, and it sold at a premium price of 9 shillings for a dozen pint bottles.\nNewcastle Brown Ale went into production at Tyne Brewery in 1927, with Newcastle Breweries having occupied the site since 1890, and brewing on the site dating back to 1868.\nThe blue star logo was introduced to the Newcastle Brown Ale bottle in 1928, the year after the beer was launched. The five points of the star represent the five founding breweries of Newcastle.\nAfter the merger of Scottish Brewers with Newcastle Breweries in 1960, Newcastle Brown Ale became a flagship brand of Scottish &amp; Newcastle alongside McEwan's Export and Younger's Tartan Special.\nBy 1997, Scottish and Newcastle claimed that it was the most widely distributed alcoholic product in both pubs and off licences in the country.\nMove to Federation Brewery, Gateshead.\nDespite investing \u00a316.6 million in a new bottling plant at the Tyne Brewery in 1999, Scottish and Newcastle announced its closure on 22 April 2004, in order to consolidate the brewing of beer and ale at the Federation Brewery site in Dunston, Gateshead, which was to pass to them with their \u00a37.2m purchase of the Federation Brewery. The purchase and consolidation at Dunston created the new brewing company, Newcastle Federation Breweries.\nThe last production run of Brown Ale in Newcastle came off the Tyne Brewery line in May 2005. Pre-production trial brews were conducted at Dunston to ensure there was no change in its taste after the move.\nThe Tyne Brewery site was bought by a consortium of Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council, and the regional development agency One NorthEast, as part of the wider Newcastle Science City project. Demolition of the former brewery began on 8 March 2007. The triggering of the controlled demolition of the former Barrack Road bottling plant opposite St James' Park was ceremonially performed by Sir Bobby Robson on 22 June 2008.\nMove to John Smith's Brewery, Tadcaster.\nBottling of Newcastle Brown Ale moved to the John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in 2007.\nHeineken bought Scottish and Newcastle in a joint deal with Carlsberg in 2008.\nIn 2010, Scottish and Newcastle closed the Dunston brewery, moving production of Brown Ale to the John Smiths Brewery in Tadcaster. The company cited the general fall in the market for beer, over-capacity in its plants in general, and the fact that the Dunston site was operating at just 60% capacity\u2014despite the fact that sales of Newcastle Brown Ale had never been higher\u2014as reasons for the closure.\nIn 2015, the caramel colouring, which has been used since the beer was launched, was removed for health reasons. Instead, roasted malt was used to darken the beer.\nMove to Zoeterwoude Brewery, the Netherlands.\nIn 2017, Heineken moved some production from the John Smith's Brewery, Tadcaster, to the Zoeterwoude Brewery in the Netherlands. The company claimed this would allow for shorter order lead times and faster transportation to the U.S. and allow distributors to purchase by the pallet rather than the container. In 2019, the company started making a different version in America and ceased importing Brown Ale from Europe. Newcastle Brown Ale is still brewed in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, for the UK and some EU markets, and also in the Netherlands for the export market. Lagunitas Brewing Company (a Heineken subsidiary) produces a product named Newcastle Brown Ale for the US domestic market. The recipe for this variation has a noticeably different taste compared to the original.\nProduction and distribution.\nNewcastle Brown Ale is brewed with pale malt and crystal malt. It has a lower hopping rate than traditional English bitters.\nThe beer is one of the United Kingdom's leading bottled ales and is in the top 20 highest-selling ales overall, selling around annually. At the time of brewing moving to Dunston in 2005, Newcastle Brown was being exported to 41 countries. At times, over half of the brewery's output is directed overseas to the U.S. In 2010, more than of the beer were sold in the United States, more than double the 2001 total. Newcastle Brown Ale left the United States in 2019. A product labelled \u201cNewcastle Brown Ale\u201d is still sold but it is produced by Lagunitas Brewing Company and has little in common with the original product. The original product returned to the United States in 2025.\nIn Canada and France (Brittany), the beer is available in short and tall bottles and in cans. The beer is also available in British-themed pubs as a draught beer in Australia and New Zealand, brewed in the UK and imported by World Brands Australia Pty Ltd. The UK-brewed bottled, kegs, and cans are widely available in Australian liquor outlets as part of their international range. It is also popular in Canada, available on draught at many British-themed pubs.\nNames and phrases.\nIn 2000, the beer was renamed \"Newcastle Brown\" with the \"Ale\" being removed from the front label. This change, only in the UK, was due to market research claiming that the term \"ale\" was outdated and costing the company sales in the youth drinking markets. The older name was reinstated with no fanfare in 2004, when it was realised that the change had made no difference to sales.\nIn the North East, Newcastle Brown Ale is often given the nickname \"Dog\", alluding to the British euphemism of seeing a man about a dog. It is also known as Broon, \"brown\" pronounced in the Geordie dialect. Elsewhere in the UK, it is known as Newkie Brown.\nServing.\nNewcastle Brown Ale is traditionally sold in Britain in and, more recently, bottles. Typically, the ale is consumed from a Wellington glass. This allows the drinker to regularly top-up the beer and thereby maintain a frothy \"head\". In the United States, it is sold in servings. In April 2010, Heineken USA introduced the Wellington glass, branded as the \"Geordie Schooner,\" for Newcastle Brown Ale consumers in America. The glass features a nucleated base.\nAssociation with the North East.\nLike many British breweries, Newcastle Brown is strongly associated with its local area, in this case north east England. While the name provides a lot of this, the sponsorship of Newcastle United and the depiction of the River Tyne in the blue star has helped ensure its association. Its local provenance gave the brand an association with \"hardy, working class traditions and values\".\nUnder European Union Protected Geographical Status laws introduced in 1992, the name Newcastle Brown Ale was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication in 2000. In 2007, this was removed when brewing of the beer moved away from its place of origin to Tadcaster in Yorkshire. The company was not obliged to make a formal application to cancel it, but not move its production outside the area designated in its PGI application years before.\nThe closure of S&amp;N's Dunston brewery in 2010 left Camerons Brewery in Hartlepool as the only remaining significant volume brewery in the North East of England.\nVariations.\nSpecial editions.\nWhen the Australian brewer Elders IXL launched a takeover bid for Scottish and Newcastle, locals of Newcastle began the \"Keep Us on Top!\" campaign. As a sign of solidarity, the Newcastle Brown label was inverted until the takeover was quashed.\nIn 2005, the last 3,000 bottles produced in Newcastle were given commemorative labels \"121 years of brewing history, last bottles produced at Tyne Brewery April 2005.\" and given to the brewery staff.\nIn 2006, a special production run of 2.5 million bottles celebrated the career of Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who had recently broken the club's scoring record and was about to retire from football. The brewery produced the special editions featuring Newcastle United's black and white stripes and Shearer's portrait, in exchange for a donation to Shearer's testimonial match, and they went on sale from 17 April that year.\nIn 2007, a special edition was released to celebrate local rock band Max\u00efmo Park. The label was designed by the band and the beer released to coincide with the band's concert at Newcastle Metro Radio Arena on 15 December. Also in 2007, a special 80th anniversary themed bottle was distributed.\nIn 2013, Newcastle partnered with Taxi Magic to brew a Black Ale called \"Newcastle Cabbie\" as part of an Anti-Drunk Driving campaign.\nOther Newcastle brands.\nNewcastle Exhibition is a draught pasteurised keg beer (4.3% ABV) first introduced in 1929 and commonly found around the Newcastle area.\nNewcastle Amber Ale (1032 OG) was a light ale available until the 1980s. It was a diluted version of Exhibition. Amber Ale and a much stronger aged stock beer were formerly blended to create Newcastle Brown Ale. This method was discontinued sometime before the brand was moved to Dunston.\nNewcastle Star was a strong bottled beer (7.5% ABV) available from 1999 to 2006.\nIn 2010, Heineken USA launched Newcastle Summer Ale in bottles. In 2011, Heineken USA launched Newcastle Werewolf (fall ale) and Winter IPA. In 2012, Heineken USA will introduce Newcastle Founders ale (an Extra Special Bitter style) as their spring seasonal.\nIn 2012, Summer Ale (4.4%) and Founder's Ale (4.8%) were launched in Tesco across the UK.\nIn winter 2012, Newcastle winter ale (5.2%) and Newcastle nocturnal ale (4.5%) were also launched in Tesco stores across the UK.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The UNECE is one of five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It was established in 1947 in order to promote economic cooperation and integration among its member states.\nThe commission is composed of 56 member states, most of which are based in Europe, as well as a few outside Europe. Its transcontinental Eurasian or non-European member states include: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United States and Uzbekistan.\nHistory.\nThe commission was first proposed in London in the summer of 1946 by the Temporary Subcommission on the Reconstruction of Devastated Areas.\nThe commission was established by the Economic and Social Council on 28 March 1947 in order to \"Initiate and participate in measures for facilitating concerted action for the economic reconstruction of Europe,\" as well as to \"maintain and strengthen the economic relations of the European countries, both among themselves and with other countries of the world.\"\nIt was established at the request of the United Nations General Assembly who called on the Economic and Social Council to create the commission, as well as the Commission for Asia and the Far East, in order to \"give effective aid to countries devastated by war.\"\nEE absorbed the function and resources of the European Central Inland Transport Organization upon its founding.\nAs the commission was established towards the beginning of the Cold War, it faced difficulties in achieving its mandate of economic reconstruction of Europe due to the Iron Curtain: separately the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation was established in 1948 in the west and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in 1949 in the east. The work of the commission had to concern itself only with questions that were of common interest to East and West, as to not cause confrontation. However, since the fall of the Soviet Union, the economic commissions of the United Nations have been expanding their activities in the former Soviet republics.\nMember states.\nThe following are the member states of the commission, along with their date of admission: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCommittees and programmes.\nCommittee on Environmental Policy.\nThe concern of UNECE with problems of the environment dates back at least to 1971, when the group of Senior Advisors to the UNECE governments on environmental issues was created which led to the establishment of the Committee on Environmental Policy, which now meets annually. The Committee provides collective policy direction in the area of environment and sustainable development, prepares ministerial meetings, develops international environmental law and supports international initiatives in the region. CEP works to support countries to enhance their environmental governance and transboundary cooperation as well as strengthen implementation of the UNECE regional environmental commitments and advance sustainable development in the region.\nIts main aim is to assess countries' efforts to reduce their overall pollution burden and manage their natural resources, to integrate environmental and socioeconomic policies, to strengthen cooperation with the international community, to harmonize environmental conditions and policies throughout the region and to stimulate greater involvement of the public and environmental discussions and decision-making.\nCEP is the overall governing body of UNECE environmental activities. The committee's work is based on several strategic pillars: \nCommittee on Forests and the Forest Industry.\nThe first task of UNECE after the Second World War was to coordinate reconstruction effort in Europe. Timber was crucial for construction, and energy, but the forests had been heavily overcut and production and trade were at a standstill. The ECE Timber Committee emerged from the International Timber Conference held in 1947 in Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b in the former Czechoslovakia.\nThe main pillars of the committee's activities have been: the collection and publication of the best available statistics on forests, wood production and trade; the exchange of information on forest working techniques and training of forest workers; periodic surveys of the long-term outlook on forests; technical work on the rational use of wood; reviewing forest product markets; and share experiences on forest and forest sector policy.\nCommittee on Urban Development, Housing and Land Management.\nIn 1947, UNECE set up a Panel on Housing Problems, which later evolved into the Committee on Human Settlements and after the reform in 2005/2006 into the Committee on Housing and Land Management. The committee is an intergovernmental body of all UNECE member States. It provides a forum for the compilation, dissemination and exchange of information and experience on housing, urban development, and land administration policies; and in areas such as Birmingham, a more fiscal issue-UK.\nIn 2020, the CUDHLM created the Forum of Mayors at the Palais des Nations, an event allowing mayors from the UNECE region to exchange their best practices on urban development, housing and land management. UNECE is the first UN Regional Economic Commission to implement such an initiative that facilitates the cooperation between the UN, Member States and cities.\nInland Transport Committee.\nThe UNECE Transport Division has been providing secretariat services to the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29).\nIn addition to acting as secretariat to the World Forum, the Vehicle Regulations and Transport Innovations section serves as the secretariat of the Administrative Committee for the coordination of work, and of the administrative/executives committees of the three agreements on vehicles administered by the World Forum.\nAmong other things, ITC has produced:\nThe World Forum services three UN Agreements:\nStatistical Division.\nThe UNECE Statistical Division provides the secretariat for the Conference and its expert groups, and implements the statistical work programme of UNECE. The Conference brings together chief statisticians from national and international statistical organizations around the world, meaning that the word \"European\" in its name is no longer an accurate description of its geographical coverage. The Statistical Division helps member countries to strengthen their statistical systems, and coordinates international statistical activities in the UNECE region and beyond through the Conference and its Bureau, and the Database of International Statistical Activities. The Statistical Division develops guidelines and training materials on statistical methodology and practices, in response to demands from member countries. It works with different groups of specialists from national and international statistical organizations, and organizes meetings and online forums for statistical experts to exchange experiences on a wide range of topics. The UNECE Statistical Division also provides technical assistance to South-East European, East European, Caucasus and Central Asian countries.\nThe division also provides:\nUNECE conducted the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Fertility and Family Survey in the 1990s in 23 member States, with over 150,000 participants, with hundreds of resulting scientific publications. This activity has hence continued in the form of the Generations and Gender Programme.\nUnited Smart Cities (USC).\nThe United Smart Cities programme is a joint effort between UNECE and the Organization for International Economic Relations (OiER).\nNumerous private business entities and other international and European agencies support the programme, including Environment Agency Austria (EAA), the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), UN-Habitat, and the International Society of City and Regional Planners (ISOCARP). The programme promotes areas of strategic smart city policy and development. The key focus areas as detailed by the programme are:\nImplementing Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe UNECE has presented a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) priorities, which resulted from a mapping and prioritization of its existing activities against the goals. These consist of most SDGs except for SDG 10 (on reduced inequalities), SDG 14 (on life below water), SDG 1 (on poverty reduction), SDG 2 (on hunger), and SDG 4 (on quality education). The social dimension is mostly absent. This can be expected since UNECE does not include the \u201csocial\u201d agenda in its name, unlike two of the other five regional commissions, namely UNESCWA (for Western Asia) and UNESCAP (for Asia and the Pacific).\nThe UNECE, with its long history of working on public-private partnerships, has taken the lead in introducing a format for public-private partnerships for the SDGs, called \u201cPeople-Proof\u201d public-private partnerships. \nSecretariat.\nThe ECE secretariat has been characterized as a \"strong\" secretariat in 1957. The ECE secretariat was led by Gunnar Myrdal in its first decade. Myrdal refused efforts by the Soviet Union to dictate what staff would be employed in the secretariat. During this period, the secretariat sought to promote European integration efforts.\nPublications.\nFrom 1982 to 2007 the IOS Press published the \"Statistical Journal of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \" on behalf of the UNECE.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37963", "revid": "51042287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37963", "title": "European Bank for Reconstruction and Development", "text": "Financial institution which supports more than 30 countries\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, shortened to EBRD (French: \"Banque europ\u00e9enne pour la reconstruction et le d\u00e9veloppement\" or \"BERD\"), is an international financial institution founded in 1991 in Paris. As a multilateral developmental investment bank, the EBRD uses investment as a tool to build market economies.\nInitially focused on the countries of the former Eastern Bloc, it expanded to support development in more than 30 countries from Central Europe to Central Asia. Similar to other multilateral development banks, the EBRD has members from all over the world (North America, Africa, Asia and Australia, see below), with the biggest single shareholder being the United States, but only lends regionally in its countries of operations. Headquartered in London, the EBRD is owned by 77 countries and two European Union institutions, the newest shareholder being Nigeria since February 2025. Despite its public sector shareholders, it invests in private enterprises, together with commercial partners.\nThe EBRD is not to be confused with the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is owned by EU member states and is used to support EU policy. EBRD is also distinct from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB).\nHistory of the EBRD.\nLocated in London, the EBRD was intended at its beginning to focus on the switch from centrally planned economy to market based economy in the Central and Eastern European countries by investing in the private sector, mainly banks, industries and businesses, and by promoting policies that would favor them. It was created as a result of the end of the Cold War because of particular issues regarding the international system in place, the historical and political context at the time. Furthermore, its recipient countries had to ensure that they would work towards \"multi-party democracy and political pluralism\" in which was considered as one of the main particularity of the EBRD distinguishing the latter from other financial institutions. Firstly, notably advocated by European political actors such as the French President Mitterrand in 1989, the idea of creating this financial institution involving the European countries started before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The reception of this proposition was mitigated depending on the country, for instance it received hostility from the British whereas the French were important proponents of the project and influenced the process. In January 1990, negotiations about the EBRD objectives, its lending policy regarding the public and private sectors, started and involved all the EU countries at the time, as well as various other European countries, non-European countries and representatives from the EU and the European Investment Bank. The Soviet Union was represented by its own delegation in the process and thus participated in the negotiations as well as the USA. Later on, because of dissensions on the political and economic objectives of the institution, the inclusion of the Soviet Union was threatened. Considered as short negotiations, the agreement (for reasons relating to the situation in Eastern Europe and to a wave of privatization across Europe) leading to its creation was signed on 29 May 1990 by actors such as 40 states as well as two European organizations and by March 1991 took its first effects as the bank was inaugurated. The creation of the EBRD has led to the financing of various projects in the years following its first operations, for instance there were twenty projects in 1992 in which the EBRD provided financing worth ECU 2.1 billion.\nGovernance.\nDivided between its headquarters located in London, and field offices located elsewhere, the European Bank for reconstruction and development is made of a three-tier structure composed of firstly, the president and the staff, secondly the Board of Governors and finally the Board of Directors. The bank\u2019s structure has changed over time, because of concerns about competition within the institution. In fact, in the beginning of the 90s, there were two different banking divisions (on one side, the merchant banking related to the private sector and on the other side the development banking side working mostly with the public sector). Consequently, the two divisions came to be merged into a single one, substituting this structure with another one instead dividing the bank with seven policy and country regional sub-divisions.\nBoard of Governors.\nRepresentatives from each member state compose this board, they have authority power. Currently (2024-2025) Slovenia is the Chair of Board of Governors, while Iceland and Turkey are the Vice Chairs.\nBoard of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors consists of 23 members elected by the Board of Governors. These members can not be on the Board of Governors. Its function is to direct the general operations of the bank, notably:\nPresident.\nThe EBRD is composed of many members with voting powers, from European and non-European states to the membership of other institutions such as the European Investment Bank, however depending on the geographical location of each member, voting rights differ. More precisely, European and other creditor members hold a majority voting power. At its beginning, the EBRD was owned by more than 40 members, in 2015 the number of countries owning it was 61. and as of March 2022, there were 71 countries as owners.\nThe following presidents have served the EBRD to date (as of March 2022).\nMembership.\nTo become a member of the bank, a country needs to fit the EBRD's Articles of Agreement. These Articles stipulate that a country can only become a Member State if it is a state in Europe or a non-European member of the IMF. Institutions like the European Union and the EIB also participate in the bank operations. Since its foundation the EBRD has almost doubled in membership size. The latest accessions to the bank are countries located in Africa.\nPublic banking.\nThe EBRD is a public bank, meaning that public institutions such as states are shareholders in those institutions. More precisely, public financial institutions are controlled major predominantly by public authorities (more than 50%) whereas in institutions with public participations, public authorities aren't majority shareholders. Public banks were particularly involved in the economic transition of the former Soviet Republics and Central and Eastern European countries as private banks and other sources of financing didn't want to invest for reasons such as those countries\u2019 macroeconomic difficulties as well as political reasons regarding the country\u2019s stability for instance.\nRelationship with the EIB.\nIn the context of the EU\u2019s investment banking, the EBRD and the EIB have been involved in a rivalry regarding the status of the \u201cEU\u2019s premier development bank\u201d. Major criticism about the EBRD in this situation is related to the fact that non-EU countries are also important shareholders whereas the EIB is completely owned by the EU. More recently, another source of rivalry was about becoming the new \u201cEuropean Climate and Sustainable Development Bank (ECSDB).\nPublic banks and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore recently, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, public banks have had their influence and role increased as they have become important actors of the economic recovery response. As for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it has committed \u20ac21 billion between 2020 and 2021 of activities. More precisely, its own package was established within the scope of the Resilience Framework, the Trade Facilitation Programme and the Vital Infrastructure Support Programme etc. In 2020 alone, it has invested \u20ac11 billion as part of 411 projects which corresponds to a 10% raison compared to 2019. 72% of its investments were received by the private sector. Moreover, because of this specific context, the EBRD focused some of its operations in sectors other than green investment meaning that it only focused 29% of its investment in this domain (compared to 46% in 2019).\nFinancing.\nDonors.\nAccording to the EBRD 2020 Sustainability Report, donors provided \u20ac589 million to support EBRD activities, taking the form of grants, loans and risk-mitigating instruments.\nThe EBRD funds come mainly from bilateral donors, from the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), the European Union (EU), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Green Climate Fund (GCF).\nFinancial operations.\nAccording to the EBRD, the bank provides different direct financial instruments such as loans, equity investments and guarantees. It also works on the assistance of SMEs through the intermediary of other banks or investment and venture capital funds which are linked to the EBRD\u2019s investments.\nSteps leading to a loan.\nEach project is analysed, first by the EBRD management with the negotiations and the subsequent signing of a mandate letter drafting the important information about the project plan, the expected expenses as well as the responsibilities. Secondly, the project is to be finally reviewed by the management. Later on, it is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. After being signed for both parties, it becomes legally binding. It leads to the transfer of funds from the EBRD to the client which will in the future start to repay the bank\u2019s loan.\nEnvironmental sustainability.\nThe EBRD is unique among development banks for two reasons. First, it was the first multilateral development bank to have an explicit environmental mandate in its charter (since 1995), and second, in that it will not finance thermal coal mining and coal-fired electricity generation due to their environmental impact.\nThe following table shows the development of investment volume into the Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, in support of the Paris climate goals.\nThe EBRD had pledged, prior to 2015 Paris Agreement, to dedicate above 40 per cent of its financing to green investment by 2020. This goal was accomplished for the first time in 2017. With Russia actually being the biggest donor to an NDEP Support Fund for the environments inside the bank, with total contributions amounting to \u20ac60 million. \u20ac5 million was donated by Russia in the same year of 2015.\nActivities.\nCollaboration of the bank with the European institutions and private actors.\nNot only involving the European institutions, the EBRD financed projects also implicate private actors such as firms as well as foreign investors in the process. As part of its lending policies, the EBRD mostly lends capital to the private sector as lending to the public sector is capped at 40% maximum.\nInfluencing.\nAs a neoliberal institution, the EBRD participates in policy debates by publishing macroeconomic analysis as well as economic forecasts that are used by both governments and international financial institutions.\nMediation.\nMore recently, other than its original lending role, the EBRD has played a mediating role in Europe, for instance in Moldova in 2013 and even in the Central Asian region (most notably in countries such as the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan for instance) by intervening as a third party in commercial disputes which has become one of its major areas of activities. As a mediating actor, the EBRD has managed to involve other actors such as businesses and Chambers of Commerce among others. Moreover, a regional forum on commercial mediation was established by the bank as part of its work, which has managed to involve various representatives from countries in Europe and Asia, such as judges and experts for instance.\nThe initial focus on transition economy.\nIt is notable that one of the main objectives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was to become a link between the European Union, its institutions and the countries it would focus on. As the recipients were previously centrally planned economies, the EBRD centered through its operations on working with the private sector, which was the principal target of central planning. Focusing on the integration and modernisation process, as part of its projects, the EBRD has notably invested in important sectors such as telecommunications in the Central and Eastern European countries.\nTo modern challenges.\nSince the 90s, recipients of EBRD financing have diversified, in fact, from mainly targeting EEC countries, the bank has moved to the Asian continent and increasingly focused on other countries such as China. More generally, Suma Chakrabarti, the EBRD president from 2012 to 2020, has pushed in the beginning of the 2010s for modernizing the bank. Reforms encompassed the bank's structure in itself, for instance by changing the management team, and its processes (for instance about policy dialogue or methodology regarding the concept of transition) in order for them to be more efficient.\nSustainable market economies.\nSince the 2000s, the focus has shifted towards the issue over sustainable market economies, notably in the context of the 2008 financial crisis, which harshly impacted population and their trust in financial institutions, democracy and free market. As a result, a rethinking of the concept of transition has taken place within the EBRD and has impacted the activities of the bank. Furthermore, the concept of transition was reviewed in 2015. In fact, it led to the idea that the ideal market economy is made of a greatly competitive, resilient and integrated market and is complemented by a good governance system conducted by a well-functioning state which has to be environmental friendly and inclusive.\nIn Armenia, EBRD has been operating since 1986, investing over \u20ac2 billion in over 200 projects. More than 90% of these investments have been made in private enterprises. The bank's key areas of investment include the financial sector, SMEs, and sustainable infrastructure. They invest, engage in policy-making, and offer technical assistance in order to encourage these areas locally. The EBRD invests around \u20ac150 million in Armenia's economy every year. Its partner financial institutions lend approximately \u20ac100 million to local SMEs through a variety of programs that promote trade, green energy, and financial access.\nRelated to environment and climate change.\nGradually, climate change and sustainable development became the focus point of the European Union, then consequently found its importance as one of the main challenges that the EBRD has to tackle. It became linked to the objective of forming sustainable market economies. In 2021, Anastassia Obydenkova research has indicated that positive evolutions have been made, for instance that carbon emission from some of the states benefiting from EBRD loans have decreased.\nEBRD key achievements since 2020.\nSource:\nEnvironment.\nThe EBRD agreed a new green economy approach for 2021\u20132025 and adopted a target of becoming a majority green bank by 2025. It invested \u20ac3.2 billion in climate mitigation, climate adaptation and other activities related to environmental issues in 2020. Moreover, the EBRD signed up to the Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles which represent the world\u2019s first global guiding framework for banks, insurers, and investors to invest in the ocean economy in a sustainable way.\nThe EBRD also aims to support the corporate transition to decarbonisation, for instance in Poland (EV battery performance), in Turkey (elimination of plastics in single-use hygiene products), and in Ukraine (green supermarkets); and support green infrastructures.\nPolitical and human rights standards.\nLinked to its objective of contributing to political transformation in the EBRD's country targets in which projects are financed, this institution contributes to political transformation in these same states. From the beginning of the negotiations that led to the creation of the EBRD, the question of democracy and human rights were included in the matter discussed. Those issues are clearly stated in the agreement.\nThe EBRD is devoted to strengthen its approach to human-rights and also to gender-based issues. For instance, it posted a 14.8 percent year-on-year increase in the number of projects it supports that promote gender inclusion. Moreover, the EBRD established a cross-departmental Human Rights Working Group and has developed internal human rights guidance.\nCOVID-19 response.\nThe EBRD provided \u20ac802 million of support under the Vital Infrastructure Support Programme launched in April 2020, an emergency support programme for infrastructure providers which is part of its overall Solidarity Package response to COVID-19 adopted on 13 March 2020. The package delivered emergency liquidity and the EBRD invested more than \u20ac10 billion, both in 2019 and 2020.\nPartnerships with NGOs.\nThe EBRD has signed partnership agreements with Oxfam and Save the Children.\nCriticism.\nAbout the EBRD.\nIn the 90s, the start of the EBRD actions have been considered as slow as the amount of money loaned was rather modest compared to what was available.\nThere have been criticism regarding potential conflict of interest as it appeared that instead of focusing on public interests, some bankers' operations were influenced by their clients' needs, contrary to the objective of the EBRD.\nAccording to Branko Milanovi\u0107, the analysis of global distribution of incomes has shown that the positive globalisation impact has mainly favoured the super-rich part of the population, thus deepening the inequalities of wealth concentration within the population. Furthermore, this uneven concentration is notably visible in the countries benefiting from the EBRD activities. This has led to a reflection over the idea of winners and losers regarding globalisation.\nIn contrast to the highlighted inclusion objective, concerns regarding inclusion, which notably involves gender equality, have been rather absent from the bank's attributions until recently. For instance, a Strategic Gender Initiative was validated by the EBRD President in 2013 as well as various projects involving gender equality related objectives.\nNGOs have criticised the EBRD on the lack of progress the EBRD makes in its main mission, the \u201ctransition towards open and democratic market economies.\u201d\nRegarding its investments.\nInequality of the lending : most projects were related to the Visegrad countries that were the ones with the most developed private sectors meaning that the ERBD was underinvesting in the countries that were the most supposed to receive its participation. For instance, those countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) were involved in 46% of the projects signed during the 1991\u20131993 period.\nEnvironmentally harmful projects.\nSome NGOs have criticized the EBRD for financing projects they consider to be environmentally and socially harmful. Although it has increased its investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy in recent years, the NGOs say the bank diminishes the impacts of green investments by financing carbon-intensive development such as coal, oil, and gas production, transportation, and generation, motorways, airports, fast food, and animal agriculture. Among the contested projects are the Ombla power plant in Croatia, the Kumtor Gold Mine in Kyrgyzstan, and the \u0160o\u0161tanj lignite power plant in Slovenia.\nIn 2025, the EBRD considered investing \u20ac40 million to expand Burger King and Popeyes locations across Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic, but cancelled the plan following opposition by environmental and animal welfare activists.\nThe Balkans.\nThe EBRD's activities in the Balkans have attracted particular controversy and criticism, especially when they have centered on national parks or free-flowing rivers. This has often involved the completed or proposed construction of hydroelectric dams and road infrastructure. Indeed, a 2017 report alleged deficiencies in monitoring and mitigation measures that had been designed to lessen the environmental impact of dam projects financed by the EBRD, while, in March 2018, outdoor clothing label Patagonia helped launch \"The Dam Truth\" campaign, which directly requests international banks including the EBRD to \"stop investing in the destruction of Europe's last wild rivers\".\nIn 2011, the EBRD approved a \u20ac65 million loan to ELEM, the Macedonian electricity utility, for a dam at Boskov Most. The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention requested immediate suspension of the project, with reference to the high biodiversity of the area and its importance as a core reproductive area for the Balkan lynx, one of the most endangered mammals on the planet. In January 2017, the bank cancelled the loan saying the \"conditions for disbursement were not met.\"\nAgain in North Macedonia, the EBRD was criticised by environmentalists after plans were announced to bisect National Park Gali\u010dica in the UNESCO Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Biosphere Reserve with an A3 express road, which would have required certain zones of protection in the national park to be downgraded. Scientists from North Macedonia and across the world signed a declaration in opposition to this and other projects proposed for the Ohrid-Prespa region, a message that was reinforced by a Joint Reactive Monitoring Mission from the World Heritage Centre, ICOMOS and the IUCN, which requested total cancellation of proposed A3 road sections. This recommendation was underlined by the World Heritage Committee at its 41st session in Krak\u00f3w. Eventually, in February 2018, the Republic of North Macedonia abandoned plans for the road, redirecting the EBRD's funds to other infrastructure projects.\nRegarding the targeted countries.\nEven though, its major objectives is to push for democracy and respect of human rights, the EBRD has been accused of not working towards those goals by not applying enough pressure and even \"holding its annual meetings in dictator-run countries\". Furthermore, reports have highlighted the fact that an important part of the loans provided by the EBRD go to countries with authoritarian leaders as of the beginning of 2022, including states such as Belarus or Egypt among others, and this despite its major objective of promoting democracy.\n2014 sanctions against Russia.\nThe EBRD announced on 23 July 2014 that it would suspend new investment projects in Russia, following an earlier declaration by the European Council. The European Council declaration was made in the context of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. As of 2014 Russia has been the biggest funding recipient of all countries. In 2013, the Russian Federation received \u20ac1.8 billion for investments from the EBRD and 1 billion \u20ac from the EIB. Russia employed the funds to finance a variety of projects like pipeline valves, property acquisitions, and a loan to a hypermarket chain. Two Russian projects were awaiting funding from the EBRD: a \u20ac300 million plan for promoting energy efficiency, and a $180 million loan to lease agricultural and forestry equipment. The bank stated that it will continue to manage ongoing projects in Russia. Despite denying Russia new funds, the EBRD continues to insist on its 6.1% of ownership in the Moscow Stock Exchange, seeking profits from Russia with the privatisation of the Soviet economy.\nAzerbaijan's oil and gas sector.\nBuilding the Southern Gas Corridor, European countries and companies support gas exports from Azerbaijan and contribute to Azerbaijan's government finances. The Aliyev regime is considered by many NGOs and watchdogs organizations as repressive and activists and journalists are regularly arrested on false charges and imprisoned. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) wrote in 2015, that \"for more than a decade Azerbaijan has made shameless use of caviar diplomacy to charm European governments, its most important oil and gas clients\". The EEC BankWatch warns that \"Developing Shah Deniz stage 2 and the Southern Gas Corridor is likely to cement further the oppressive structures of the Aliyev government\".\nThe EBRD has invested over 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in 177 projects in Azerbaijan. The EBRD approved three loans for the Shah Deniz gas field (US$200 million, US$250 million and US$100 million) as well as a US$500 million loan for the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP), and stated its financial support to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) could amount to EUR 1.2 billion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It comprises 106 separate municipalities, and its capital city is M\u00e9rida.\nLocated on the northern part of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, it is bordered by the states of Campeche to the southwest and Quintana Roo to the southeast, with the Gulf of Mexico off its northern coast.\nBefore the arrival of Spaniards, the peninsula was a very important region for the Maya civilization that reached the peak of its development here, where the Maya founded the cities of Chichen Itza, Izamal, Motul, Mayapan, Ek' Balam, and Ichkanzih\u00f3o (also called T'ho), now M\u00e9rida.\nAfter the Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n (early 16th to late 17th centuries), the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula became a single administrative and political entity, the Captaincy General of Yucat\u00e1n. Following Mexican independence in 1821 the local Governor proclaimed independence. Yucat\u00e1n became part of the First Mexican Empire in December 1821. Following the collapse of the Empire in March 1823, the first Republic of Yucat\u00e1n (founded in May 1823) voluntarily negotiated annexation to the Federal Republic of United Mexican States on December 21, 1823. On March 16, 1841, as a result of cultural and political conflicts around the federal pact, Yucat\u00e1n declared its independence from Mexico, forming a second Republic of Yucat\u00e1n. Eventually on July 14, 1848, Yucat\u00e1n was forced to rejoin Mexico. In 1858, in the middle of the Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n, the state of Yucat\u00e1n was divided for the first time, establishing Campeche as a separate state (officially in 1863). During the Porfiriato, in 1902, the state of Yucat\u00e1n was divided again to form the Federal territory that later became the present state of Quintana Roo.\nEtymology.\nBefore the arrival of Spaniards in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the name of this region was \"Mayab\". In the Yucatec Maya language, \"mayab\" means \"flat\", and is the source of the word \"Maya\" itself.\nThe name Yucat\u00e1n, also assigned to the peninsula, came from early explorations of the Conquistadors from Europe. Three different explanations for the origin of the name have been proposed.\nThe first two state that the name resulted from confusion between the Maya inhabitants and the first Spanish explorers around 1517:\nProbably the first person to propose the \"I do not understand\" version was the friar Toribio de Benavente Motolin\u00eda. In his book \"Historia de los indios de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a\" (\"History of the Indians of New Spain\") he says\nbecause talking with those Indians of the coast, whatever the Spanish asked the Indians responded: \"Tectet\u00e1n, Tectet\u00e1n\" which means \"I don't understand you, I don't understand you\"; they corrupted the word, and not understanding what the Indians said, they said: \"Yucat\u00e1n is the name of this land\"; and the same happened in a place, a cape, which they also called Cape Cotoch; and \"Cotoch\" in that language means \"house\".\nThe third proposed explanation comes from Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo. In his book \"Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a\" (\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\"), he says \"Yucat\u00e1\" means \"land of yucas\", a plant that was cultivated by the Maya and was an important food source for them.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian era.\nThe origin of the first settlements has not been scientifically confirmed, although the presence of first humans in the area dates from the late Pleistocene or ice age (about 10,000\u201312,000 years), according to the findings in the Lolt\u00fan caves and caverns of Tulum (Women of the Palms).\nThe first Maya moved to the Peninsula circa 250 CE, from the Pet\u00e9n (today northern Guatemala), to settle the southeastern peninsula in the modern Bacalar, Quintana Roo. In 525, the Chan\u00e9s (Maya group that preceded the Itza), moved to the east of the peninsula, founding Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Izamal, Motul, Ek' Balam, Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (modern M\u00e9rida) and Champot\u00f3n. Later, Tutul Xi\u00faes, Toltec descent, who came from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, settled in the region causing displacement of the Itza and Cocomes\u2014a diversified branch of Itz\u00e1\u2014and finally, after years and many battles, the League of Mayapan (composed of the Itza, the Xi\u00fas and Cocomes) was formed, which eventually disintegrated circa 1194, giving way to a period of anarchy and fragmentation into small domains which the Spanish conquistadors found in the 16th century.\nExploration by Spanish soldiers.\nIn 1513, Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n had already conquered the island of Borinqu\u00e9n (now Puerto Rico) and had visited Florida. Ant\u00f3n de Alaminos, who was with Ponce de Le\u00f3n on this latest discovery, suspected that west of Cuba they could find new land. Under their influence, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, supported by the governor of Cuba, organized an expedition commanded by Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba to explore the seas west of the island.\nThis expedition sailed from port of Ajaruco on February 8, 1517, to La Habana and after circling the island and sailing southwest by what is now known as the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, the expedition made landfall at the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on March 1. There are discrepancies about where the first explorers arrived. Some say it was in Isla Mujeres. Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo places it at Cabo Catoche, where they saw a great city which they named the \u00abGran Cairo\u00bb.\nSpanish conquest.\nThe conquest of Yucat\u00e1n was completed two decades after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire by Francisco de Montejo \"el Adelantado\", his son Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" and his nephew, Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\". \"El Adelantado\" was in the expedition of Juan de Grijalva and was with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in the third expedition that eventually became the Conquest of the Aztec Empire. He was subsequently appointed for the conquest of the Maya of Yucat\u00e1n, but failed in his first attempt in 1527\u201328. In 1529 he was appointed Governor of Tabasco, with the order to pacify Tabasco and conquer Yucat\u00e1n and Cozumel.\nFrom Tabasco, Montejo led a new campaign to Yucat\u00e1n from the west (1531\u201335) and failed again in his attempt for conquest. Circa 1535, after many bloody battles with the natives, he reached the complete pacification of the Province of Tabasco and began planning his new foray to Yucat\u00e1n.\n\"El Adelantado\" was appointed governor of Honduras and then of Chiapas. Therefore, he gave his son \"El Mozo\", the mission to consummate the conquest of Yucat\u00e1n. Francisco de Montejo y Le\u00f3n \"el Mozo\" founded the cities of San Francisco de Campeche on October 4, 1540, and M\u00e9rida on January 6, 1542 (in honor of M\u00e9rida, Extremadura). The city of M\u00e9rida was founded over the ruins of the Maya city of Ichkanzih\u00f3o (T'ho) and the stones of old Maya buildings were used for the new buildings. Later, government powers were changed from \"Santa Mar\u00eda de la Victoria\", Tabasco, to M\u00e9rida on June 11, 1542. The newly founded M\u00e9rida was besieged by the Maya troops of Nachi Cocom (overlord or 'Halach uinik' in Yucatec Maya language). It was a definitive battle for the Conquest of Yucat\u00e1n. With that victory, the Spaniards consolidated their control of the western part of the peninsula.\nFrancisco de Montejo \"El Adelantado\" appointed his nephew, Francisco de Montejo \"el Sobrino\", to head the conquest of the eastern Yucat\u00e1n, which was achieved after many bloody battles, ending with the foundation of the city of Valladolid on May 28, 1543.\nCanek rebellion, during the colonial Yucat\u00e1n.\nOppressive policies of inequality and prejudice were imposed on the native Maya by the Spanish colonial government. In November 1761, Jacinto Canek, a Maya from the town of Cisteil (now located in Yaxcab\u00e1 Municipality), led an armed uprising against the government, which was quickly put down. Captured insurgents were taken to M\u00e9rida, where they were tried and tortured. As a warning to the population against rebellion, Cisteil was burned and covered with salt.\nThis abortive rebellion was not of great consequence to the colonial regime, but it marked the history of the peninsula and clearly delineated anti-colonial tensions in the region. The uprising was a precursor to the social upheaval that would explode less than a century later, as the Caste War. The Canek rebellion is remembered today as a symbol of the racial and social conflict that predominated for centuries in the Spanish colonies.\nYucat\u00e1n in independent Mexico.\nBecause of its geographical remoteness from the center of New Spain, especially from Mexico City, Yucat\u00e1n was not militarily affected by the Mexican War of Independence, though the influence was felt in other ways. In 1820 Lorenzo de Zavala, member of Sanjuanistas (a group of creoles who met at the church of San Juan in downtown M\u00e9rida), created the \"Patriotic Confederation\", which eventually divided into two groups: the supporters of the Spanish government under the C\u00e1diz Constitution and another led by Zavala, which sought outright independence from Spain. Mariano Carrillo Albornoz then Governor of Yucat\u00e1n, sent Zavala and Manuel Garc\u00eda Sosa as deputies of the Cortes of C\u00e1diz to Madrid, while the other liberals were imprisoned. While this was happening in Yucat\u00e1n, the Plan of Iguala was proclaimed in the current state of Guerrero (at that time part of the Intendency of Mexico).\nOn September 15, 1821, in the Hall of Councils of the City of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n declared its independence from Spain. Almost immediately, Governor Juan Mar\u00eda Echeverri sent two representatives to negotiate the incorporation of Yucat\u00e1n into the Mexican Empire. The incorporation took place on November 2, 1821.\nRepublic of Yucat\u00e1n.\nThe Mexican Empire was quickly overthrown (1823) under the Plan of Casa Mata, and the provinces of the erstwhile empire became independent states. The first Republic of Yucat\u00e1n, declared on May 29, 1823, joined the Federal Republic of the United Mexican States as the Federated Republic of Yucat\u00e1n on December 23, 1823.\nThe second Republic of Yucat\u00e1n emerged when the federal pact signed by Yucat\u00e1n and endorsed in the Constitution of Yucat\u00e1n of 1825 was broken by the centralist government of Mexico from 1835. In 1841 the state of Tabasco decreed its separation from Mexico and Miguel Barbachano, then governor of Yucat\u00e1n, sent a commission headed by Justo Sierra O'Reilly to meet with Tabasco authorities to propose the creation of an independent federal republic from Mexico formed by the two states. The idea failed when Tabasco rejoined Mexico in 1842.\nOn August 22, 1846, Mexican interim president Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas restored the 1824 constitution and federalism. Two years later, during the government of president Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera, Miguel Barbachano ordered the reinstatement of Yucat\u00e1n to Mexico under the Constitution of Yucat\u00e1n of 1825. A decisive factor for the reinstatement was the Caste War, which forced Yucat\u00e1n to seek outside help. In 1852 due to internal struggles between opposing political factions, the \"Territory of Campeche\" was created. On April 29, 1863, during the government of Mexican President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, Campeche gained its current status as an independent state.\nFlag of the Republic of Yucat\u00e1n.\nThe flag of Yucat\u00e1n was raised on March 16, 1841. The period of the Republic of Yucat\u00e1n was the only one in which the banner was officially used by the authorities of Yucat\u00e1n.\nRodolfo Men\u00e9ndez de la Pe\u00f1a, historian, describes the flag of Yucat\u00e1n: \"The flag of Yucat\u00e1n was divided into two parts: green on left, the right, with three divisions, red up and down and white in the middle. In the green field highlighted, five stars, symbolizing the five departments that Yucatan was divided by decree of November 30, 1840: M\u00e9rida, Izamal, Valladolid, Tekax and Campeche.\"\nThe flag did not have official recognition in the state however, it maintained a strong recognition among the people of the state.\nCaste War.\nThe Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n was a conflict that lasted from 1847 to 1901. It began with the revolt of native Maya people led by Maya chiefs Jacinto Pat and Cecilio Chi, against the population of European descent called \"Yucatecos\", who had political and economic control. A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the north-west of the Yucat\u00e1n and the independent Maya in the south-east. It officially ended with the occupation of the Maya capital of Chan Santa Cruz by the Mexican army in 1901, although skirmishes with villages and small settlements that refused to acknowledge Mexican control continued for over another decade.\nAdam Jones wrote: \"This ferocious race war featured genocidal atrocities on both sides, with up to 200,000 killed.\"\nBecause of the conflict, on November 24, 1902, Yucat\u00e1n had a second territorial division when Porfirio D\u00edaz decreed the creation of the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo, with capital in the port of \"Payo Obispo\" (today Chetumal). In little more than half a century, Yucat\u00e1n lost more than two thirds of its original territory.\nThe henequen industry.\nIn the late 19th century, the henequen industry grew to unprecedented power in the Yucatan. The henequen grown in the Yucatan was used around the world for rope and twine, and became known as sisal rope, named after the seaside town of Sisal, from where the rope was shipped. Today Sisal is a sleepy fishing village, being rediscovered by locals and visitors as a beach location for vacation homes. The henequen industry provided financial autonomy to the isolated Yucat\u00e1n. The fiber of the henequ\u00e9n plant (known as \"sosquil\" (maya: \"sos k\u00ed\")) was manufactured into twine and rope, used in riggings, string, sacks, rugs, and many other items. It became the chief export item of the Yucat\u00e1n, making many local families very wealthy. That wealth is today evident in the architecture of the colonial city of M\u00e9rida, as well as in the more than 150 haciendas that are spread throughout the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nKorean immigration to Mexico began in 1905. The first Korean migrants settled in Yucat\u00e1n as workers in henequen plantations. Labour brokers began advertising in newspapers in the Korean port city of Incheon in 1904 for workers willing to go to Mexico to work on henequen plantations for four- or five-year contracts. A total of more than one thousand were recruited and departed from Incheon on board a British cargo ship on 4 April 1905, despite efforts by the Korean government to block their departure. Once their contracts were up, most settled in Mexico, either continuing to work on henequen plantations or moving to various cities in the country.\nHundreds of prosperous haciendas abounded in the state until the advent of synthetic products after World War II, the cultivation of henequ\u00e9n in other parts of the world and the self-serving actions of some of the leading henequen-growing families led to the gradual decline of the Yucatan's monopoly on the industry.\nThe great influx of wealth during that period from the henequen industry focused mainly on M\u00e9rida, the capital of Yucat\u00e1n State. It allowed the city of M\u00e9rida to install street lights and a tram system even before Mexico City. It is said that in the early 20th century, the city had the largest number of millionaires per capita in the world. Today, Paseo de Montejo (inspired by the Parisian avenue Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es), is lined with the elegant houses built during that time. These houses are mostly now renovated and serve as everything from private homes to banks, hotels and restaurants. Many of the haciendas today have also been renovated and now serve as private homes, event venues and upscale luxury hotels.\nLate 20th century.\nUntil the mid-20th century most of Yucat\u00e1n's contact with the outside world was by sea; trade with the US and Cuba, as well as Europe and other Caribbean islands, was more significant than that with the rest of Mexico. In the 1950s Yucat\u00e1n was linked to the rest of Mexico by railway, followed by highway in the 1960s, ending the region's comparative isolation. Today Yucat\u00e1n still demonstrates a unique culture from the rest of Mexico, including its own style of food.\nCommercial jet airplanes began arriving in M\u00e9rida in the 1960s, and additional international airports were built first in Cozumel and then in the new planned resort community of Canc\u00fan in the 1980s, making tourism a major force in the economy of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nThe first Maya governor of Yucat\u00e1n, Francisco Luna Kan, was elected in 1976.\nToday, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is a major tourism destination, as well as home to one of the largest indigenous populations in Mexico, the Maya people.\nGeography.\nThe State of Yucat\u00e1n is located on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It borders the states of Campeche to the southwest, Quintana Roo to the east and southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. As a whole, the state is extremely flat with little or no topographic variation, with the exception of the Puuc hills, located in the southern portion of the state.\nDemography.\nLargest cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLanguages.\nThe most widespread indigenous language of Yucat\u00e1n is Yucatec Maya, spoken natively by approximately 800,000 people in Yucat\u00e1n and adjacent Quintana Roo and Campeche, especially in rural areas. The Spanish spoken in Yucat\u00e1n has lexical and some phonological borrowing from Mayan and employs many words of Mayan origin, such as ' (\"fat\"), ' (\"navel\") and \"\" (\"urinate\").\nKorean immigration.\nIn 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants \u2013 802 men and 231 women and children \u2013 departed from the port of Chemulpo, Incheon, aboard the ship \"Ilford\" to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. At Coatzacoalcos, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso, with the final destination being the city of M\u00e9rida. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucat\u00e1n henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout Yucat\u00e1n in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucat\u00e1n, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further. Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernment.\nThe Constitution of Yucat\u00e1n provides that the government of Yucat\u00e1n, like the government of every other state in Mexico, consists of three powers: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary.\nExecutive power rests in the governor of Yucat\u00e1n, who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a six-year term with no possibility of reelection. Legislative power rests in the Congress of Yucat\u00e1n which is a unicameral legislature composed of 25 deputies. Judicial power is invested in the High Court of Justice of Yucat\u00e1n and its district courts.\nMunicipalities.\nThe State of Yucat\u00e1n is divided into 106 municipalities, each headed by a municipal president (mayor). Usually municipalities are named after the city that serves as municipal seat; e.g. the municipal seat of the municipality of M\u00e9rida is the city of M\u00e9rida.\nPolitics.\nThe 2024 local election in Yucat\u00e1n was held on 2 June.

{"id": "37966", "revid": "5718152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37966", "title": "Himalayas", "text": "Mountain range in Asia\nThe Himalayas, or Himalaya, is a mountain range in Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest. More than 100 peaks exceeding elevations of above sea level lie in the Himalayas.\nThe Himalayas abut on or cross territories of six countries: Nepal, India, China, Bhutan, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, and China. The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world's major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo\u2013Brahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 600\u00a0million people; 53\u00a0million people live in the Himalayas. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The summits of several\u2014Kangchenjunga (from the Indian side), Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi, and Kailash in the Tibetan Transhimalaya\u2014are off-limits to climbers.\nThe Himalayas were uplifted after the collision of the Indian tectonic plate with the Eurasian plate, specifically, by the folding, or nappe-formation of the uppermost Indian crust, even as a lower layer continued to push on into Tibet and add thickness to its plateau; the still lower crust, along with the mantle, however, subducted under Eurasia. The Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The Indus-Yarlung suture zone, along which the headwaters of these two rivers flow, separates the Himalayas from the Tibetan plateau; the rivers also separate the Himalayas from the Karakorams, the Hindu Kush, and the Transhimalaya. The range varies in width from in the west to in the east.\nEtymology.\nThe name of the range hails from the Sanskrit ( 'abode of snow'), from ( 'frost/cold') and ( 'dwelling/house'). The cognates include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThis name was also previously transcribed as \"Himmaleh\", as in Emily Dickinson's poetry and Henry David Thoreau's essays.\nThe name of the range is sometimes also given as Himavan in older writings, including the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. Himavat (Sanskrit: \u0939\u093f\u092e\u0935\u0924\u094d\")\" or Himavan Himav\u0101n (Sanskrit: \u0939\u093f\u092e\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d) is a Hindu deity who is the personification of the Himalayan Mountain Range. Other epithets include Himaraja (Sanskrit: \u0939\u093f\u092e\u0930\u093e\u091c, lit.\u2009'king of snow') 'The Land of Snow' () in Tibetan, or Parvateshwara (Sanskrit: \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930, lit.\u2009'lord of mountains').\nGeography and key features.\nThe Himalayas consists of four parallel mountain ranges from south to north: the Sivalik Hills on the south; the Lower Himalayan Range; the Great Himalayas, which is the highest and central range; and the Tibetan Himalayas on the north. The Karakoram are generally considered separate from the Himalayas.\nIn the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the peaks of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna in Nepal, separated by the Kali Gandaki Gorge. The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections, both ecologically and orographically \u2013 the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki, the Kora La, is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and K2 (the highest peak of the Karakoram range). To the east of Annapurna are the peaks of Manaslu and across the border in Tibet, Shishapangma. To the south of these lies Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the Kathmandu Valley lies the valley of the Bhote/Sun Kosi river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China \u2013 the Araniko Highway/China National Highway 318. Further east is the Mahalangur Himal with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: Cho Oyu, Everest, Lhotse, and Makalu. The Khumbu region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The Arun river drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the Kangchenjunga massif on the border with India, the third-highest mountain in the world, the most easterly summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kangchenjunga is in the Indian state of Sikkim. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to Lhasa, Tibet, which passes over the Nathu La pass into Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan. The highest mountain in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum, which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged, with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of Namche Barwa, situated in Tibet, inside the great bend of the Yarlang Tsangpo river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the Kangri Garpo mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo, including Gyala Peri, however, are also sometimes included in the Himalayas.\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to Rara Lake, the largest lake in Nepal. The Karnali River rises in Tibet but cuts through the centre of the region. Further west, the border with India follows the Sarda River and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of Gurla Mandhata. Just across Lake Manasarovar from this lies the sacred Mount Kailash in the Kailash Ranges, which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism and Bonpo. In Uttarakhand, the Himalayas are regionally divided into the Kumaon and Garhwal Himalayas with the high peaks of Nanda Devi and Kamet. The state is also home to the important pilgrimage destinations of Chota Chaar Dhaam, with Gangotri, the source of the holy river Ganges, Yamunotri, the source of the river Yamuna, and the temples at Badrinath and Kedarnath.\nThe next Himalayan Indian state, Himachal Pradesh, is noted for its hill stations, particularly Shimla, the summer capital of the British Raj, and Dharamsala, the centre of the Tibetan community and government in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the Sutlej river, the most easterly of the five tributaries of the Indus, cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form much of the disputed Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir where lie the mountainous Jammu region and the renowned Kashmir Valley with the town and lakes of Srinagar. The Himalayas form most of the south-west portion of the disputed Indian-administered union territory of Ladakh. The twin peaks of Nun Kun are the only mountains over in this part of the Himalayas. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000\u00a0m peak of Nanga Parbat, which rises over above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000\u00a0m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat where the Himalayas intersect with the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, in the disputed Pakistani-administered territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. Some portion of the Himalayas, such as the Kaghan Valley, Margalla Hills, and Galyat tract, extend into the Pakistani provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.\nGeology.\nTectonics, the recurring physical changes that affect the arrangement of the Earth's crust, and plate tectonics, the movement of large regions of the Earth's crust in the manner of planar rigid bodies, are key to understanding the formation of the Himalayas. The Earth's crust rests directly on its mantle. Tectonic plates, comprising the crust and the upper portions of their underlying mantle, are moved around by convection in the asthenosphere. The oceanic crust, found beneath oceans, is, on average, thick. It is created from upwelling magma at mid-ocean ridges and predominantly consists of basalt, the principal igneous rock on Earth. In contrast, the continental crust underlying dry land has an average thickness of and is rich in silica, which is less dense than basalt. It makes the continental tectonic plates more buoyant than the oceanic. \nIndia's defining geologic processes, which began 70\u00a0million years ago, had involved India rifting, or splitting away, from Gondwana, and the Indian continental plate along with the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate above it jointly moving northward. As these eventually reached the Eurasian plate, the less buoyant oceanic plate subducted, or slid under Eurasia and was carried into the deeper asthenosphere. In contrast, the Indian continental plate was obstructed because of its thickness and buoyancy. The lateral compression generated by the obstruction caused the plate to be sheared horizontally. Its lower crust and mantle slid under, but one layer of the upper crust piled up in sheets (called nappes) ahead of the subduction zone. Geophysicist Peter Molnar noted that most of the Himalayas are \"slices of rock that once were the top part of India's crust.\" This is the process of mountain building, or orogeny, in the Himalayas. \nBefore the orogeny, the Eurasian coastline had been similar to today's Central Andes. Along such coastlines, the adjoining oceanic plate subducts and erupts as volcanoes. Magma, which eventually crystallizes into granite, rises into the Earth's crust below the active volcanoes but not to the surface. When India's continental plate pushed against Eurasia, not only did a part of the upper crust fold in nappes, but another stiffer part began to push against (or drag) Eurasia's ancient volcanic mountains farther north. As a result, the crust of this formerly coastal region shortened under compression and thickened to become what is today the Tibetan Plateau. Isostatic equilibrium, or the balance between the gravitational force pulling down on the crust and the force of buoyancy pushing up from the mantle, gives the Tibetan Plateau its notable thickness and altitude.\nThe Indian plate was not the only landmass that had rifted from Gondwana and drifted northward toward Eurasia. Before the India-Eurasia collision in Middle Paleocene (60 Mya) and subsequent Himalayan orogeny, two other landmasses, the Qiangtang terrane and Lhasa terrane, had drifted up from Gondwana. Qiangtang, a geological region in what is today northern Tibet, had done so in Late Triassic (237\u2013201 Mya). The Lhasa terrane collided with the southern boundary of the Qiangtang in the Early Cretaceous (145\u2013100 Mya). The collision caused the lithospheric mantle of the Lhasa terrane to thicken and shorten, forming a barrier that later prevented the Indian lithosphere from fully subducting under Tibet and leading to further thickening of the Tibetan plateau. The suture zones, or remains of the subduction zone and the terranes that are joined, are found in the Tibetan plateau. The Qiantang and Lhasa terranes were part of the string of microcontinents Cimmeria, today constituting parts of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, China, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, which had rifted from Gondwana earlier, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean above them and opening the Neo-Tethys Ocean between them and Gondwana, eventually colliding with Eurasia, and creating the Cimmerian Orogeny.\nAfter the Lhasa terrane had adjoined Eurasia, an active continental margin opened along its southern flank, below which the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate had begun to subduct. Magmatic activity along this flank produced the Gangdese batholith in what is today the Tibetan trans-Himalaya. Another subduction zone opened to the west, in the ocean basin above the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc. This island arc\u2014formed by one oceanic plate subducting beneath another, its magma rising and creating continental crust\u2014drifted north, closed its ocean basin and collided with Eurasia.\nThe collision of India with Eurasia closed the Neo-Tethys Ocean. The suture zone (in this instance, the remnants of the Neo-Tethys subduction zone pinched between the two continental crusts), which marks India's welding to Eurasia, is called the Indus-Yarlung suture zone. It lies north of the Himalayas. The headwaters of the Indus River and the Yarlung Tsangpo (later in its course, the Brahmaputra) flow along this suture zone. These two Eurasian rivers, whose courses were continually diverted by the rising Himalayas, define the western and eastern limits, respectively, of the Himalayan mountain range.\nDuring the India-Eurasia collision, two elongated protrusions located on either side of the northern border of the Indian continent generated areas of extreme deformation. A point where mountain ranges with different directions of extension, and thus formed by tectonic forces at varying angles, converge is called a syntaxis (\"Greek\": convergence). The two syntaxes, Nanga Parbat and Namche Barwa, on the northwestern and northeastern corners of the Indian continent, respectively, are characterized by the quick upward movement of land or rocks that were once deeply buried and significantly altered by extreme heat and pressure. Geologists have estimated the rate of uplift of these rocks to be per year, or per million years. The protruding regions have some of the highest mountain peaks at and , respectively. The regions also have the greatest topographical relief in the interior of a continent, approximately over a horizontal distance of . Nanga Parbat has a narrow, anticline, or arch-shaped fold whose crest dips sharply to the north, perpendicular to the general direction along which the Himalayas extend. The Indus and Yarlung Tsangpo, which originally emptied into the New-Tethys, now bend around the Nanga Parbat and Namche Barwa, respectively, to eventually empty into the Indian Ocean.\nGeologists Wolfgang Frisch, Martin Meschede, and Ronand Blakey write, \"India rapidly marched northward towards Asia with a velocity of ca. 20\u00a0cm/yr, a plate velocity that exceeds any modern example. This velocity considerably slowed to ca. 5\u00a0cm/yr following the collision, yet India continued to protrude into Asia for more than 2000 km. ... The irregular northern margin of the Indian continental crust first came into contact with Eurasia along its northwestern corner, approximately 55\u00a0Ma. As a consequence, India underwent a counter-clockwise rotation to close the remaining part of the Neotethys in scissor-like fashion from west to east. The closure of the Neotethys was completed approximately 40 Ma.\"\nToday, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards. The Indian plate is moving at per year, and over the next 10\u00a0million years, it will travel into Asia. Approximately 20\u00a0mm per year of the India\u2013Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5\u00a0mm annually, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\nThe Himalayan mountain range consists of three sub-ranges: (1) the Higher- or \"Tethys\" Himalayas, (2) the Lesser Himalayas, and (3) the Siwaliks. The nappes\u2014large, stacked sheets of rock\u2014found in the Tethys Himalayan mountain range, are primarily composed of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone formed from the accumulation and compression of sediments like sand, mud, and shells deposited in the Neo-Tethys seabed during the Paleogene\" (66 Mya\u201323 Mya). Below the sedimentary rocks in the Higher and Lesser Himalayas is a bottom layer, or basement, composed of metamorphic rock formed much earlier during the Pan-African-Cadomian orogeny between 650 Mya and 550\u00a0Mya. The lowest subrange, the Siwaliks, represents the sedimentary rock deposits washed off the rising Himalayas in a foreland basin, a low-lying crustal region, at their foot. It primarily consists of sandstones, shales, and conglomerates formed during the Neogene period (23 Mya to 2.6\u00a0Mya).\nGeologists Wolfgang Frisch, Martin Meschede, and Ronand Blakey further write, \"The Siwaliks are both underlain and overlain by thrusts; they have been overridden by the nappe stack of the Higher and Lesser Himalayas and, in turn, are thrust over more interior parts of the Indian continent. Each of the three mega-units is internally imbricated into several individual nappes. Fensters (windows) and klippen provide important structural information regarding the thrust belts and help document the existence of broad thrust sheets, some of which record thrust distances in excess of 100 km. A fenster or window is an erosional hole through a thrust sheet that exposes a tectonically lower unit framed by a higher unit; a klippe is detached by erosion and forms a remnant of a nappe or higher thrust sheet\nthat rests on top of a lower unit.\"\nHydrology.\nDespite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major continental divide, and a number of rivers cut through the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. Himalayas' rivers drain into two large systems:\nThe northern slopes of Gyala Peri and the peaks beyond the Tsangpo, sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the Irrawaddy River, which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the Andaman Sea. The Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow River all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the \"circum-Himalayan rivers\".\nGlaciers.\nThe great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic. Some even refer to this region as the \"Third Pole\". The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about , or 3600\u20134400 Gt (1012 kg) of fresh water. Its glaciers include the Gangotri and Yamunotri (Uttarakhand) and Khumbu glaciers (Mount Everest region), Langtang glacier (Langtang region), and Zemu (Sikkim).\nOwing to the mountains' latitude near the Tropic of Cancer, the permanent snow line is among the highest in the world, at typically around . In contrast, equatorial mountains in New Guinea, the Rwenzoris, and Colombia have a snow line some lower. The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large perennial rivers.\nIn recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of glacier retreat across the region as a result of climate change. For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Studies have measured an approximately 13% overall decrease in glacial coverage in the Himalayas over the last 40\u201350 years. Local conditions play a large role in glacial retreat, however, and glacial loss can vary locally from a few m/yr to 61 m/yr. A marked acceleration in glacial mass loss has also been observed since 1975, from about 5\u201313 Gt/yr to 16\u201324 Gt/yr. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons. The global climate change will affect the water resources and livelihoods of the Greater Himalayan region.\nLakes.\nThe Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Pangong Tso, which is spread across the border between India and China, at the far western end of Tibet, is among the largest with a surface area of .\nSouth of the main range, the lakes are smaller. Tilicho Lake in Nepal, in the Annapurna massif, is one of the highest lakes in the world. Other lakes include Rara Lake in western Nepal, She-Phoksundo Lake in the Shey Phoksundo National Park of Nepal, Gurudongmar Lake, in North Sikkim, Gokyo Lakes in Solukhumbu district of Nepal, and Lake Tsongmo, near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.\nSome of the lakes present the danger of a glacial lake outburst flood. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake in the Rowaling Valley, in the Dolakha District of Nepal, is rated as the most dangerous. The lake, which is located at an altitude of , has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting. The mountain lakes are known to geographers as \"tarns\" if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above .\nTemperate Himalayan wetlands provide important habitat and layover sites for migratory birds. Many mid and low altitude lakes remain poorly studied in terms of their hydrology and biodiversity, like Khecheopalri in the Sikkim Eastern Himalayas.\nClimate.\nTemperature.\nThe physical factors determining the climate in any location in the Himalayas include latitude, altitude, and the relative motion of the Southwest monsoon. From north to south, the mountains cover more than eight degrees of latitude, spanning temperate to subtropical zones. The colder air of Central Asia is prevented from blowing down into South Asia by the physical configuration of the Himalayas. This causes the tropical zone to extend farther north in South Asia than anywhere else in the world. The evidence is unmistakable in the Brahmaputra valley as the warm air from the Bay of Bengal bottlenecks and rushes up past Namcha Barwa, the eastern anchor of the Himalayas, and into southeastern Tibet. Temperatures in the Himalayas cool by 2.0 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) for every increase of altitude.\nAs the physical features of mountains are irregular, with broken jagged contours, there can be wide variations in temperature over short distances. Temperature at a location on a mountain depends on the season of the year, the bearing of the sun with respect to the face on which the location lies, and the mass of the mountain, i.e. the amount of matter in the mountain. As the temperature is directly proportional to received radiation from the sun, the faces that receive more direct sunlight also have a greater heat buildup. In narrow valleys\u2014lying between steep mountain faces\u2014there can be dramatically different weather along their two margins. The side to the north with a mountain above facing south can have an extra month of the growing season. The mass of the mountain also influences the temperature, as it acts as a heat island, in which more heat is absorbed and retained than the surroundings, and therefore influences the heat budget or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature from the winter minimum to the summer maximum.\nThe immense scale of the Himalayas means that many summits can create their own weather, the temperature fluctuating from one summit to another, from one face to another, and all may be quite different from the weather in nearby plateaus or valleys.\nPrecipitation.\nThe Himalayan hydroclimate is crucial for South Asia, where annual summer monsoon floods impact millions.\nA critical influence on the Himalayan climate is the Southwest Monsoon. Variability in monsoon rainfall, influenced by local Hadley circulation and tropical sea surface temperatures, is the main factor behind wet and dry years. This is not so much the rain of the summer months as the wind that carries the rain. Different rates of heating and cooling between the Central Asian continent and the Indian Ocean create large differences in the atmospheric pressure prevailing above each. In the winter, a high-pressure system forms and remains suspended above Central Asia, forcing air to flow in the southerly direction over the Himalayas. But in Central Asia, as there is no substantial source for water to be diffused as vapour, the winter winds blowing across South Asia are dry. In the summer months, the Central Asian plateau heats up more than the ocean waters to its south. As a result, the air above it rises higher and higher, creating a thermal low. Off-shore high-pressure systems in the Indian Ocean push the moist summer air inland toward the low-pressure system. When the moist air meets mountains, it rises and upon subsequent cooling, its moisture condenses and is released as rain, typically heavy rain. The wet summer monsoon winds cause precipitation in India and all along the layered southern slopes of the Himalayas. This forced lifting of air is called the orographic effect.\nWinds.\nThe vast size, huge altitude range, and complex topography of the Himalayas mean they experience a wide range of climates, from humid subtropical in the foothills, to cold and dry desert conditions on the Tibetan side of the range. For much of the Himalayas\u2014in the areas to the south of the high mountains, the monsoon is the most characteristic feature of the climate and causes most of the precipitation, while the western disturbance brings winter precipitation, especially in the west. Heavy rain arrives on the southwest monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism \u2013 the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter, and spring.\nUsing the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid-elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as \"Cwa\", Humid subtropical climate with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a subtropical highland climate (\"Cwb\").\nThe intensity of the southwest monsoon diminishes as it moves westward along the range, with as much as of rainfall in the monsoon season in Darjeeling in the east, compared to only during the same period in Shimla in the west.\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold, and generally windswept, particularly in the west where it has a cold desert climate. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during the late winter and spring months.\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by 0.2 to 1.2\u00a0\u00b0C for every rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates, from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to tundra and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well-exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the rain shadow of large mountains can be significant, for example, leading to near desert conditions in the Upper Mustang, which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri massifs and has annual precipitation of around , while Pokhara on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ( a year). Thus, although annual precipitation is generally higher in the east than in the west, local variations are often more important.\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region. The rain shadowing of Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the Taklamakan and Gobi.\nEcology.\nThe flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall, and soil conditions, combined with the very high snow line, supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure), combined with extreme cold, favor extremophile organisms.\nAt high altitudes, the elusive and previously endangered snow leopard is the main predator. Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic bharal or Himalayan blue sheep. The Himalayan musk deer is also found at high altitudes. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near-endemic herbivores include the Himalayan tahr, the takin, the Himalayan serow, and the Himalayan goral. The critically endangered Himalayan subspecies of the brown bear is found sporadically across the range, as is the Asian black bear. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, red pandas feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down, the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered Gee's golden langur and the Kashmir gray langur, with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas, respectively.\nThe unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to climate change. \"Hydrangea hirta\" is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially rhododendron, apple, and \"box myrtle\". The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is \"Juniperus tibetica,\" located at in Southeastern Tibet.\nClimate-related concerns.\nSimilar to the mountains, the communities living near the Himalayas are experiencing climate change and its negative impacts significantly more than other parts of the world. Some of the impacts that the communities are facing include erratic rainfall, flooding, rising temperatures, and landslides. These impacts can have extreme negative effects on the villages living in the area especially as the temperatures rise at higher rates than many other places in the world (Alexander et al., 2014). There are more than 1.9 million people who are highly vulnerable due to climate change with an additional 10\u00a0million people at risk in Nepal. Nepal is among the top ten most vulnerable Global South countries due to climate change in the world, standing at number 4 as of 2010 according to the climate change risk atlas. According to NAPA (National Adaptation Program of Action) of Nepal, many threats including floods, droughts, and landslides are an imminent threat to the glacial lake area. With this in consideration, climate change policy and framework for LAPA (Local Adaptation Plans of Action) were prepared in 2011 primarily focusing on addressing climatic hazards.\nHealth impacts.\nLocal communities are suffering from food scarcity and malnutrition as well as an increasing risk to diseases such as malaria and dengue fever as temperatures rise and allow these diseases to migrate further north. There is also an increasing risk of water borne illnesses accompanied by an increasing lack of safe drinking water. Illness is not the only danger to the communities as temperatures sky rocket. With the climate changing weather patterns are also changing and more extreme weather events are occurring putting local communities more at risk to physical harm and death during erratic weather events. Marginalized groups including children and women are experiencing more severe impacts from climate change and are often more exposed to disease and injury. Over the last couple years these health impacts have gotten increasingly worse and more common. Recent studies have shown that dengue fever has had a consistent pattern of epidemic in Nepal in the years 2010, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022 with the largest in terms of severity occurring in 2022. 54,784 reported cases were recorded from all 77 districts in seven provinces. These diseases are simply in addition to other diseases that can be seen with the rise of global temperatures and air pollution. Many vulnerable groups are experiencing an increase in respiratory illness, cardiac illnesses, and asthma. The heat can lead to issues such as a strain on respiratory illnesses, heat stroke, and fever. There is also the increased risk of cancer. Many lower income communities such as the himalayan villages suffer from exposure to more pollution or in some cases exposure to toxic chemicals which has led to an increased rate of cancer in these communities as well as an increased risk of death.\nAgricultural impacts.\nThe increasing temperatures are also leading to a decrease in territory for local wildlife. This trend has decreased the prey populations of at-risk predators, such as snow leopards. Seeking alternative food sources, snow leopards and other predators attack local farmers' livestock. This livestock consists of yaks, oxen, horses, and goats. Snow leopards have killed about 2.6% of the local livestock per year in response to their shrinking habitat. The overall loss, about a quarter of the average income of local farmers, has had a major impact on the local economy. In retaliation, farmers have begun killing snow leopards, seeking to protect their livestock and their livelihoods.\nPolicy changes.\nNepal is a part of the Paris agreement and thus is required to have a climate action plan and is being tracked by the Climate Action Tracker. According to the Climate Action Tracker, Nepal is \"almost sufficient\" on its track to reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement. There are two factors that hold Nepal back from reaching sufficient status and thus stand out. There is no Climate Finance Plan and emissions and temperature rising rate ranking at critically insufficient. Nepal has many goals, however, that are on track with the Paris Agreement. The first of note being a goal of net-zero emissions by 2045. To reach this goal Nepal submitted two separate plans to account for whatever future they experience the first being WAM (with additional measures) and the second being WEM (with existing measures). WEM is based primarily on already existing policies and highlights the energy sector as the main target for CO2 reduction. The WAM scenario introduces a far more ambitious strategy for reducing emissions. In this scenario the focus is primarily on an intervention method and disruption of the energy sector reducing the use of fossil fuels and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. This pathway heavily relies on reducing emissions from energy sources while preserving the carbon-absorbing capacity of the LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry) sector. Under this scenario, it is anticipated that net CO2 emissions will remain negative from 2020 to 2030, approach 'zero' between 2035 and 2045, and then revert to negative values by 2050. The goal of this scenario is to accelerate the journey toward achieving carbon neutrality before 2045. These policies along with many more have Nepal on track to stay beneath the 1.5 threshold set by the Paris Agreement.\nIn May 2025 the representatives of himalayan nations, experts met in Nepal for the first \"Sagarmatha Sambaad\" (Everest Dialog) about stopping climate change and its effects on the region. Minister Deuba remarked \"Climate change is a global crisis transcending national boundaries. Nothing less than a global alliance based on justice and solidarity can hope to make a dent on the existential crisis that climate change brings in its wake\". The United Nations leader send a message to the conference in which he reminded that glaciers giving water to rivers are metling in a fast and increasing rate and \"reduced water flow in river systems such as the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Indus threatens not only water but also food production for nearly two billion people across South Asia\". The conference issued a \"Sagarmatha Call for Action\" to protect the region from climate change. One of the proposals is a common climate fund for Himalayan nations. Climate experts criticized the outcomes, saying that the real challenge is to implement the decisions. Also the conference only addressed the issue of glacier melt, while in recent times, climate migration due to lack of rainfall also became a major concern.\nLocal adaptation.\nIn recent years many citizens of these Himalayan communities have started to notice the extreme effects of climate change by experiencing nature itself. They have noticed a decrease in precipitation especially in lowland districts, fluctuating temperatures during months of the year that are typically cooler, and changes in weather patterns even compared to early 2000s weather. Many local villagers have identified climate change simply through the availability of certain native plants decreasing or shifting seasons. The concept of climate change has now been aligned with the risk of natural disasters and has increased awareness in the local communities. These impacts of climate change have greatly affected agriculture in the area and has forced farmers to change crops and when they plant them. In response to this rather than push for policy change, citizens have begun to adapt to climate change. According to Dhungana, 91.94% of the respondents experienced drought as major climatic hazards then floods at 83.87%, landslides at 70.97%, and forest fires at 67.74%. In response to this citizens have begun adapting and adopting new practices. As a response to drought at the high altitudes, plantations are planting more protective trees, drought resistant plants, and have begun adopting irrigation practices drawing from nearby streams. In response to flooding, farmers have created more basins, dam construction, and small drainage canals.\nThe response to landslides includes plantation grasses in previously barren areas, Gabion wall construction, avoiding livestock grazing in landslide-prone areas, and a prohibition on tillage in areas at risk of landslides. To fight the increased rate of forest fires, citizens have begun beating the fires with green branches and mud, construction of fire lines, and are raising awareness about the wildfires. Fire lines are lines of varying width built through the leaf litter of a forest floor down to the soil and minerals to prevent a spread of fire past the line. The main reason for these adaptations is to decrease the risk that climate change poses over these marginalized communities while taking advantage of the moment and allowing for a positive change towards a more sustainable or adaptable future. Major barriers to these adaptations include a lack of funds, a lack of knowledge, a lack of technology, a lack of time, and lack of mandatory policy.\nReligions.\nThere are many cultural and mythological aspects associated with the Himalayas. In Jainism, Mount Ashtapada of the Himalayan mountain range is a sacred place where the first Jain \"tirthankara\", Rishabhanatha, attained \"moksha\". It is believed that after Rishabhanatha attained \"nirvana\", his son, Bharata, had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 \"tirthankara\"s with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it \"Sinhnishdha\". For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavat, the king of all mountains and the father of the goddess Parvati. The Himalayas are also considered to be the father of the goddess Ganga (the personification of river Ganges). Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus are the temple complex in Pashupatinath and Muktinath, also known as Shaligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called shaligrams.\nThe Buddhists also lay a great deal of importance on the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where Buddhism started in Bhutan. The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or \"mahasiddhas\". They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa. The Himalayan people's diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages, and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing. The shapes and materials of the people's homes reflect their practical needs and beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place great importance on jewelry. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewelry. Several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam and Hinduism. A notable example of a religious site is Paro Taktsang, where Padmasambhava is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan.\nA number of Vajrayana Buddhist sites are situated in the Himalayas, in Tibet, Bhutan, and in the Indian regions of Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Spiti, and Darjeeling. There were over 6,000 monasteries in Tibet, including the residence of the Dalai Lama. Bhutan, Sikkim, and Ladakh are also dotted with numerous monasteries.\nResources.\nThe Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites. Different parts of the plants \u2013 root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark \u2013 are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an \"Abies pindrow\" tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an \"Andrachne cordifolia\" is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a \"Callicarpa arborea\" is used for skin ailments. Nearly a fifth of the gymnosperms, angiosperms, and pteridophytes in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.\nMost of the population in some Asian and African countries depends on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such. Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region. The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The policy was implemented by the United States government, enunciated in a note of January 7, 1932, to the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China, of nonrecognition of international territorial changes imposed by force. The doctrine was an application of the principle of \"ex injuria jus non oritur\". Since the entry into force of the United Nations Charter, international law scholars have argued that states are under a legal obligation not to recognize annexations as legitimate, but this view is controversial and not supported by consistent state practice.\nNamed after Henry L. Stimson, U.S. Secretary of State in the Herbert Hoover administration (1929\u20131933), the policy followed Japan's unilateral seizure of Manchuria in northeastern China following action by Japanese soldiers in Shenyang on September 18, 1931. The doctrine was also invoked by U.S. Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles in the Welles Declaration on July 23, 1940, which announced nonrecognition of the Soviet annexation and incorporation of the three Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This remained the official U.S. position until the Baltic states regained independence in 1991.\nIt was not the first time that the U.S. had used nonrecognition as a political tool or symbolic statement. President Woodrow Wilson had refused to recognize the Mexican Revolutionary governments in 1913 and Japan's Twenty-One Demands upon China in 1915.\nThe Japanese invasion of Manchuria in late 1931 placed Stimson in a difficult position. It was evident that appeals to the spirit of the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact had no impact on either the Chinese or the Japanese, and Stimson was further hampered by President Herbert Hoover's clear indication that he would not support economic sanctions as a means to bring peace in the Far East.\nOn January 7, 1932, Stimson sent similar notes to China and Japan that incorporated a diplomatic approach that had been used by earlier secretaries facing crises in the Far East. Later known as the Stimson Doctrine or sometimes the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine the notes read in part as follows:\n[T]he American Government deems it to be its duty to notify both the Imperial Japanese Government and the Government of the Chinese Republic that it cannot admit the legality of any situation de facto nor does it intend to recognize any treaty or agreement entered into between those Governments, or agents thereof, which may impair the treaty rights of the United States or its citizens in China, including those that relate to the sovereignty, the independence, or the territorial and administrative integrity of the Republic of China, or to the international policy relative to China, commonly known as the open door policy; and that it does not intend to recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27th, 1928, to which treaty both China and Japan as well as the United States are parties.\nStimson had stated that the U.S. would not recognize any changes made in China that would curtail American treaty rights in the area, that the \"open door\" must be maintained, and would refuse any legitimacy to territorial changes made in violation of the 1928 Pact. The declaration had few material effects on the Western world, which was burdened by the Great Depression, and Japan went on to establish a puppet state in Manchuria and later bomb Shanghai. The doctrine was criticized on the grounds that its only effect was to alienate the Japanese.\nThe Stimson Doctrine, originally intended only as a political declaration, attracted the attention of the League of Nations, which adopted a resolution on March 11, 1932, that \"it is incumbent upon members of the League of Nations not to recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Pact of Paris.\" It also acquired legal force for the members of the Organization of American States after it was included in the Saavedra Lamas Treaty and the Montevideo Convention of 1933, later followed by the Charter of the Organization of American States of 1948.\nAfter the entry into force of the UN Charter, international law establishes a general prohibition on the use of force. Consequently, international legal doctrine argues that annexations are illegal, and states are under a legal obligation to comply with the Stimson Doctrine by not recognizing as legitimate territorial changes made through annexations. This view, however, is controversial and not supported by consistent state practice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37969", "revid": "16947970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37969", "title": "Ramen", "text": "Japanese noodle dish\n is a Japanese noodle dish. It is a part of Japanese Chinese cuisine. It includes served in several flavors of hot broth. Common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including , nori (dried seaweed), lacto-fermented bamboo shoots (\"menma\"), \"naruto\", and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the \"tonkotsu\" (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the \"miso\" ramen of Hokkaido.\nThe origins of ramen can be traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in the late 19th century. While the word \"ramen\" is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese word \"l\u0101mi\u00e0n\" (), meaning \"pulled noodles\", the ramen does not actually derive from any lamian dishes. Lamian is a part of northern Chinese cuisine, whereas the ramen evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes from regions such as Guangdong, reflecting the demographics of Chinese immigrants in Yokohama. Ramen was largely confined to the Chinese community in Japan and was never popular nationwide until after World War II (specifically the Second Sino-Japanese War), following increased wheat consumption due to rice shortages and the return of millions of Japanese colonial settlers from China. In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the dish.\nRamen was originally looked down upon by the Japanese due to racial discrimination against the Chinese and its status as an inexpensive food associated with the working class. Today, ramen is considered a national dish of Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings. Examples include Sapporo's rich miso ramen, Hakodate's salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata's thick, flat noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, Tokyo-style ramen with soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama's Iekei ramen with soy-flavored pork broth, Wakayama's soy sauce and pork bone broth, and Hakata's milky \"tonkotsu\" (pork bone) broth. Ramen is offered in various establishments and locations, with the best quality usually found in specialist ramen shops called \"r\u0101men'ya\" ().\nRamen's popularity has spread outside of Japan, becoming a cultural icon representing the country worldwide. In Korea, ramen is known both by its original name \"ramen\" () as well as \"ramyeon\" (), a local variation on the dish. In China, ramen is called \"r\u00ecsh\u00ec l\u0101mi\u00e0n\" (/ \"Japanese-style lamian\"). Ramen has also made its way into Western restaurant chains. Instant ramen was exported from Japan in 1971 and has since gained international recognition. The global popularity of ramen has sometimes led to the term being used misused in the Anglosphere as a catch-all for any noodle soup dish.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"ramen\" is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese \"lamian\" (, 'pulled noodles'). A common misconception is that ramen is a Japanese adaptation of lamian, but the two dishes have no direct relation, and how ramen came to adopt its name from lamian remains unclear. Ramen evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes, primarily Cantonese, as opposed to northern Chinese noodle dishes that may feature lamian.\nThe word first appeared in Japan in Seiichi Yoshida's \"How to Prepare Delicious and Economical Chinese Dishes\" (1928). In the book, Yoshida describes how to make \"ramen\" using flour and \"kansui\", kneading it by hand, and stretching it with an illustration. He also states that \"ramen\" is better suited for soup or cold noodles than for baked noodles. In this case, however, \"ramen\" refers to actual lamian (hand-pulled noodles), not the noodle soup dish.\nThere are various theories on how the dish came to be named \"ramen\", but the most plausible is that the term was misapplied by Japanese colonizers. After the end of World War II in 1945, millions of Japanese settler colonists were repatriated to Japan from China. They may have labeled the southern Chinese noodle dishes in Japan \"ramen\", based on their superficial resemblance to lamian dishes they had encountered in northern China, particularly in the Japanese-backed puppet state of Manchukuo. This timing aligns with the first mention of \"ramen\" as a dish appearing in Hatsuko Kuroda's \"Enjoyable Home Cooking\" (1947). \nChinese immigrants in Japan initially served a wide variety of Chinese noodle soup dishes, and referred to them by their specific names. However, they were collectively referred to as by the Japanese. \"Nankinmachi\" (Nanjing Town) was the common Japanese term for areas where Chinese people settled, and the Japanese used the term \"Nankin\" to describe newly imported Chinese things. For example, in 1903, in Yokohama Chinatown, then known as \"Nankinmachi\", there was a . \nThe dish was renamed in 1910 by Kan'ichi Ozaki, the founder of the first specialized ramen shop. The Japanese regarded Chinese civilization as inferior and this name change reflected broader imperialist attitudes within Japanese society towards China. The word \"washoku\" was used for Japanese cuisine, \"yoshoku\" symbolized Western cuisine, and Chinese cuisine was called \"shina\" \"ryori\". In the decades following, would be the most commonly used name for ramen.\nAfter World War II, the word s\"hina\" (, meaning 'China') acquired a pejorative connotation through its association with anti-Chinese racism and Japanese imperialism. The word s\"hina\" was replaced with \"ch\u016bka\" across various terms in the Japanese language. \"Ch\u016bka\" is derived from the Japanese reading of , an official name used by the two governments claiming sovereignty over China, the Republic of China () and People's Republic of China (). \"Shina ry\u014dri\" was changed to \"ch\u016bka ry\u014dri\", and likewise, the term replaced \"shina soba\".\nThe Nissin Chikin Ramen, created by Momofuku Ando, was released in 1958, and the name () began to spread across the country. Today is the most popular name, but remains prevalent in areas such as Takayama. The two terms can be used interchangeably, though is also often used to refer to more \"classic\" styles of ramen. \nHistory.\nOrigin.\nRamen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups. It is first recorded to have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. However, the dishes ancestral to ramen already existed in Japan within the Chinese community since the 1880s. Although ramen takes its name from \"lamian,\" it did not originate from the hand-pulled lamian noodles of northern China, since the noodles used in ramen are cut, not pulled. Rather, ramen is largely derived from southern Chinese noodle dishes, particularly those from Cantonese cuisine. This is reflective of Yokohama Chinatown's demographics, as the majority of Chinese settlers there were Cantonese, followed by Shanghainese.\nS\u014dmen is another type of noodle of Chinese origin made from wheat flour, but in Japan it is distinguished from the noodles used in ramen. The noodles used for ramen today are called and are made with \"kansui\" (, alkaline salt water).\nThe official diary of Sh\u014dkoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, , mentions eating , noodles with \"kansui\", in 1488. \"J\u012bngd\u00e0imi\u00e0n\" is the noodle of the Yuan dynasty. This is the earliest record of \"kansui\" noodles being eaten in Japan.\nOne theory says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui, who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule. Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen. However, the noodles Mitsukuni ate were a mixture of starch made from lotus root and wheat flour, which is different from \"ch\u016bkamen\" with \"kansui\".\nAccording to historians, the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to Japan in the late 19th century by Chinese immigrants living in Yokohama Chinatown. By 1884, Chinese noodle soups had grown popular in Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Hakodate, however, this popularity was mostly concentrated among Chinese immigrants. The Chinese served a variety of noodle soup dishes and referred to them by their specific names, such as \"char siu tang mian\" (roast pork noodle soup) and \"rousi tang mian\" (sliced pork noodle soup)\".\" The Japanese referred to all these noodle soup dishes as \"Nankin soba ('Nanjing noodles')\". These noodle soups were particularly in high demand among Chinese students, who missed the cuisine of their homelands and found Japanese food bland in comparison. \nThe Japanese government passed a law in 1899 allowing resident aliens to own businesses outside their designated settlements. This development, in addition to increased labor demands, led to a spread of Chinese immigrants throughout Japan. By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Guangzhou and Shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles, a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a \"charumera\" (, from the Portuguese ) to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording.\nFirst store.\nAccording to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop was \"Rairaiken\" (), which opened in 1910 in Asakusa, Tokyo. The Japanese founder, Kan'ichi Ozaki (\u5c3e\u5d0e\u8cab\u4e00), employed twelve Cantonese cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for Japanese customers. In contrast to most Japanese, who held prejudiced views toward Chinese cuisine, Ozaki grew up in Yokohama, where he experienced Chinese food firsthand and witnessed the popularity of noodle dishes in the city's Chinatown. Early versions of ramen were wheat noodles in broth topped with char siu. Ozaki changed the name of the noodle dishes from \"Nankin soba\" to \"Shina soba\". The store also served standard Cantonese fare like wontons and shumai, and is sometimes regarded as the origin of Japanese-Chinese fusion dishes like \"ch\u016bkadon\" and \"tenshindon\". \n\"Rairaiken\"'s original store closed in 1976, but related stores with the same name currently exist in other places, and have connections to the first store.\nIn 1925, a Chinese traveller named Fan Qinxing from Zhejiang province opened a ramen shop called \"Genraiken\" in Kitakata as an homage to the popular \"Rairaiken\".\nIn 1933, Fu Xinglei (\u5085\u8208\u96f7), one of the twelve original chefs, opened a second \"Rairaiken\" in Y\u016btenji, Meguro Ward, Tokyo.\nIn 1968, one of Kan'ichi Ozaki's apprentices opened a store named \"Shinraiken\" (\"New Raiken\") in Chiba Prefecture.\nIn 2020, Ozaki's grandson and great-great-grandson re-opened the original \"Rairaiken\" as a store inside Shin-Yokohama R\u0101men Museum.\nPopularization and modernization.\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Formosa island. The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages. \nDuring the same period, millions of Japanese colonizers returned from China and other parts of East Asia. It was only in 1947, in the post-war period, that the term \"ramen\" was first recorded in Japan to refer to the southern Chinese noodle dish that originated in Yokohama Chinatown, possibly because it superficially resembled the lamian dishes they had encountered in northern China. Many Japanese repatriates were familiar with Chinese cuisine and opened \"yatai\" (food stalls) selling ramen. Jiaozi, a staple food of northern China, also began to be served as a complement to ramen at these stalls. These jiaozi were called \"gyoza\" by the Japanese, a name likely adopted in the puppet state of Manchukuo and derived from the Manchu word \"giyose\". \nFrom 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons, but wheat also found its way into ramen, which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule. Although the Americans maintained Japan's wartime ban on outdoor food vending, flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets, where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters related to the \"yakuza\" who extorted vendors for protection money. Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation.\nBy 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out \"yatai\" starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks. Ramen provided a rare opportunity for small-scale postwar entrepreneurship. The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein. The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan's rice-based culture. Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.\nIn 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water.\nBeginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994.\nToday ramen is one of Japan's most popular foods, with Tokyo alone containing around 5,000 ramen shops, and more than 24,000 ramen shops across Japan. \"Tsuta\", a ramen restaurant in Tokyo's Sugamo district, received a Michelin star in December 2015.\nTypes.\nA wide variety of ramen exists in Japan, with geographical and vendor-specific differences even in varieties that share the same name. Usually varieties of ramen are differentiated by the type of broth and tare used. There are five components to a bowl of ramen: tare, aroma oil, broth, noodles, and toppings.\nNoodles.\nThe type of noodles used in ramen are called , which are derived from traditional Chinese alkaline noodles known as (). Most are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and \"kansui\", derived from the Chinese (), a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Ramen is not to be confused with different kinds of noodle such as soba, udon, or somen.\nThe origin of isn't clear. It is said to originate in Inner Mongolia. Making noodles with lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture. But since there is no natural or \"kansui\" in Japan, it was difficult to make or \"ch\u016bkamen\" before the Meiji Restoration (1868).\nRamen comes in various shapes and lengths. It may be thick, thin, or even ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled.\nTraditionally, ramen noodles were made by hand, but with growing popularity, many ramen restaurants prefer to use noodle-making machines to meet the increased demand and improve quality. Automatic ramen-making machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid-20th century produced by such Japanese manufacturers as Yamato MFG. and others.\nSoup.\nSimilar to Chinese soup bases, ramen soup is generally made from chicken or pork, though vegetable and fish stock is also used. This base stock is often combined with dashi stock components such as katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), saba bushi (mackerel flakes), shiitake, and kombu (kelp). Ramen stock is usually divided into two categories: chintan and paitan.\nTare.\nTare is a sauce that is used to flavor the broth. The main purpose of tare is to provide salt to the broth, but tare also usually adds other flavors, such as umami. There are three main kinds of tare.\nToppings.\nAfter basic preparation, ramen can be adorned with any number of toppings, including but not limited to:\nPreference.\nSeasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper, black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic. Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.\nMost ramen restaurants offer a system known as (), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a \"refill\" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.\nRegional variations.\nWhile standard versions of ramen are available throughout Japan since the Taish\u014d period, the last few decades have shown a proliferation of regional variations, commonly referred to as \"ramen\" ( \"regional ramen\"). Some of these which have gone on to national prominence are:\nRelated dishes.\nThere are many related, Chinese-influenced noodle dishes in Japan. The following are often served alongside ramen in ramen establishments. They do not include noodle dishes considered traditionally Japanese, such as soba or udon, which are almost never served in the same establishments as ramen.\nRestaurants in Japan.\nRamen is offered in various types of restaurants and locations including ramen shops, \"izakaya\" drinking establishments, lunch cafeterias, karaoke halls, and amusement parks. Many ramen restaurants only have a counter and a chef. In these shops, the meals are paid for in advance at a ticket machine to streamline the process. Some restaurants also provide \"Halal\" ramen (using chicken) in Osaka and Kyoto\nHowever, the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist restaurants. As restaurants offer mainly ramen dishes, they tend to lack variety in the menu. Besides ramen, some of the dishes generally available in a restaurant include other dishes from Japanese Chinese cuisine such as fried rice (called or ), jiaozi (called \"gyoza\"), and beer. often feature Chinese-inspired decorations. The bowls used to serve ramen may be designed to include Chinese motifs such as yunleiwen, loong, fenghuang, and the character for double happiness. Chinese spoons are more commonly used to drink the soup in ramen, as opposed to the Japanese ladle (otamajakushi), which is typically used for soba and udon. \nFrom January 2020 to September 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, many ramen restaurants were temporarily closed, with 34 chains filing for bankruptcy by September 2020. Ramen restaurants are typically narrow and seat customers closely, making social distancing difficult.\nOutside Japan.\nRamen became popular in China where it is known as (, lit.\u2009'Japanese-style lamian'). Restaurant chains serve ramen alongside Japanese dishes, such as tempura and yakitori. In Japan, these dishes are not traditionally served with ramen, but gyoza, \"kara-age\", and others from Japanese Chinese cuisine.\nIn Korea, there is a variation of ramen called \"ramyeon\" (; ), made much spicier than ramen. There are different varieties, such as kimchi-flavored . While usually served with egg or vegetables such as carrots and scallions, some restaurants serve variations of containing additional ingredients such as dumplings, \"tteok\", or cheese as toppings. Famous ramyeon brands include Shin Ramyeon and Buldak Ramyeon.\nOutside of Asia, particularly in areas with a large demand for Asian cuisine, there are restaurants specializing in Japanese-style foods such as ramen noodles. For example, Wagamama, a UK-based restaurant chain serving pan-Asian food, serves a ramen noodle soup and in the United States and Canada, Jinya Ramen Bar serves ramen.\nChef Antonio de Livier of Mexico City is credited with a Mexican variation called \"birriamen\" (a portmanteau of birria and ramen) where the broth incorporates the consom\u00e9 broth that the beef, lamb or goat is cooked in. The variation later gained popularity in the Los Angeles area.\nInstant ramen.\nInstant ramen noodles were exported from Japan by Nissin Foods starting in 1971, bearing the name \"Oodles of Noodles\". One year later, it was re-branded \"Nissin Cup Noodles\", packaged in a foam food container (It is referred to as Cup Ramen in Japan), and subsequently saw a growth in international sales. Over time, the term \"ramen\" became used in North America to refer to other instant noodles.\nWhile some research has claimed that consuming instant ramen two or more times a week increases the likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions, including diabetes and stroke, especially in women, those claims have not been reproduced and no study has isolated instant ramen consumption as an aggravating factor. However, instant ramen noodles, known to have a serving of 43 g, consist of very high sodium. At least 1,760\u00a0mg of sodium are found in one packet alone. It consists of 385 kilocalories, 55.7 g of carbohydrates, 14.5 g of total fat, 6.5 g of saturated fat, 7.9 g of protein, and 0.6\u00a0mg of thiamine.\nCanned version.\nIn Akihabara, Tokyo, vending machines distribute warm ramen in a steel can known as . It is produced by a popular local ramen restaurant in flavors such as and curry, and contains noodles, soup, \"menma\", and pork. It is intended as a quick snack, and includes a small folded plastic fork.\nIn popular culture.\nEmoji.\nIn October 2010, an emoji was approved for Unicode 6.0 for \"Steaming Bowl\", that depicts Japanese ramen noodles in a bowl of steaming broth with chopsticks. In 2015, the icon was added to Emoji 1.0.\nFilm.\nThe main storyline of \"Tampopo\", a 1985 Japanese comedy billed as the first \"ramen western\", concerns a trucker helping a widowed ramen shop owner reach the top of her craft.\nMuseum.\nThe Shin-Yokohama R\u0101men Museum is a museum about ramen, in the Shin-Yokohama district of K\u014dhoku-ku, Yokohama.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37973", "revid": "50983740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37973", "title": "John Maynard Keynes", "text": "British economist (1883\u20131946)\nJohn Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes ( ; 5 June 1883 \u2013 21 April 1946), was an English economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. Originally trained in mathematics, he built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles. One of the most influential economists of the 20th century, he produced writings that are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and its various offshoots. His ideas, reformulated as New Keynesianism, are fundamental to mainstream macroeconomics. He is known as the \"father of macroeconomics\".\nKeynes was educated at King's College at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated in 1904 with a B.A. in mathematics. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment, and since wages and labour costs are rigid downwards the economy will not automatically rebound to full employment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. After the 1929 crisis, Keynes also turned away from a fundamental pillar of neoclassical economics: free trade. He criticized Ricardian comparative advantage theory (the foundation of free trade), considering the theory's initial assumptions unrealistic, and became definitively protectionist. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\", published in early 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all capitalist governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of World War II but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.\nHis influence began to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the British and American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy. The 2008 financial crisis sparked the 2008\u20132009 Keynesian resurgence. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the 2008 financial crisis by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.\nWhen \"Time\" magazine included Keynes among its in 1999, it reported that \"his radical idea that governments should spend money they don't have may have saved capitalism\". \"The Economist\" has described Keynes as \"Britain's most famous 20th-century economist\". In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the Bank of England, and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.\nEarly life and education.\nJohn Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge, England, on 5 June 1883, to an upper-middle-class family. His father, John Neville Keynes, was an economist and a lecturer in moral sciences at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer who went on to become the town's first female mayor. Keynes was the firstborn and was followed by two more children\u00a0\u2013 Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and Geoffrey Keynes in 1887. Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Archibald Hill.\nAccording to the reminiscences of his brother Geoffrey, their parents were loving and attentive. They attended a Congregational Church14 and remained in the same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes received considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, \"because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home\".14\nIn January 1889, at the age of five and a half, Keynes started at the kindergarten of the Perse School for Girls for five mornings a week. He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but his health was poor leading to several long absences. He was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother. In January 1892, at eight and a half, he started as a day pupil at St Faith's preparatory school. By 1894, Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith's headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that Keynes was \"head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school\" and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton.\nIn 1897, Keynes won a King's Scholarship to Eton College, where he displayed talent in a wide range of subjects, particularly mathematics, classics and history: in 1901, he was awarded the Tomline Prize for mathematics. At Eton, Keynes experienced the first \"love of his life\" in Dan Macmillan, older brother of the future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.27 Despite his middle-class background, Keynes mixed easily with upper-class pupils.\nIn 1902, Keynes left Eton for King's College, Cambridge, after receiving a scholarship for this also, to read mathematics. Alfred Marshall begged Keynes to become an economist, although Keynes's own inclinations drew him towards philosophy, especially the ethical system of G. E. Moore. Keynes was elected to the University Pitt Club and was an active member of the semi-secretive Cambridge Apostles society, a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students. Like many members, Keynes retained a bond to the club after graduating and continued to attend occasional meetings throughout his life. While at the University of Cambridge, Keynes was president of the Cambridge Union Society and Cambridge University Liberal Club. He was said to be an atheist.\nIn May 1904, he received a first-class BA in mathematics. Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends, Keynes continued to involve himself with the university over the next two years. He took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term, which constituted his only formal education in the subject. He took civil service exams in 1906.\nThe economist Harry Johnson wrote that the optimism imparted by Keynes's early life is a key to understanding his later thinking.\nKeynes was always confident he could find a solution to whatever problem he turned his attention to and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good.\nKeynes's optimism was also cultural, in two senses: he was of the last generation raised by an empire still at the height of its power and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.\nCareer.\nIn October 1906 Keynes began his Civil Service career as a clerk in the India Office. He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on probability theory, through a lectureship in economics at first funded personally by economists Alfred Marshall and Arthur Pigou. He became a fellow of King's College in 1909.\nBy 1909 Keynes had also published his first professional economics article in \"The Economic Journal\", about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India. He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.\nIn 1911 Keynes was made the editor of \"The Economic Journal\". By 1913 he had published his first book, \"Indian Currency and Finance\". In that book, Keynes analysed in great detail the monetary arrangements of India, from the late 19th century onwards. The Indian Rupee notes were convertible into silver coin which in turn had growing convertibility into gold coin, pound sterling, at a ratio of 15:1. Keynes recommended policies to speed up the conversion of Rupee into gold \u2013 effectively recommending a gold exchange standard. \nHe was then appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance\u00a0\u2013 the same topic as his book\u00a0\u2013 where Keynes showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems. His written work was published under the name \"J M Keynes\", though to his family and friends he was known as Maynard. (His father, John Neville Keynes, was also always known by his middle name).\nFirst World War.\nThe British Government called on Keynes's expertise during the First World War. While he did not formally rejoin the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments\u00a0\u2013 the gold equivalent of banknotes\u00a0\u2013 but with Keynes's help, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was necessary.\nIn January 1915 Keynes took up an official government position at the Treasury. Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist Robert Lekachman, Keynes's \"nerve and mastery became legendary\" because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble a supply of Spanish pesetas.\nThe secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.\nOn the introduction of military conscription in 1916, he applied for exemption as a conscientious objector, which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing his government work.\nIn the 1917 King's Birthday Honours, Keynes was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath for his wartime work, and his success led to the appointment that had a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 Versailles peace conference. He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold.\nVersailles peace conference.\nKeynes's experience at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit its ability to buy exports from other countries\u00a0\u2013 thus hurting not just Germany's economy but that of the wider world.\nUnfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the 1918 coupon election were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the Heavenly Twins\u00a0\u2013 the judge Lord Sumner and the banker Lord Cunliffe, whose nickname derived from the \"astronomically\" high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.\nThe three principal players at the Paris conferences were Britain's Lloyd George, France's Georges Clemenceau and America's President Woodrow Wilson.\nIt was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were well received by the public only if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.\nLloyd George did, however, win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.\nWilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany\u00a0\u2013 he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.\nTowards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown over two-thirds of the cost of European reconstruction on the United States.\nLloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds and led to his resignation from the Treasury.\nIn June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the British Bank of Northern Commerce, a job that promised a salary of \u00a32,000 in return for a morning per week of work.234\nKeynes's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\", published in 1919. This work has been described as Keynes's best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear\u00a0\u2013 his passion as well as his skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the book contained appeals to the reader's sense of compassion:209\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable, \u2013 abhorrent and detestable, even if it was possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe.\u2014\u200a\nAlso present was striking imagery such as \"year by year Germany must be kept impoverished and her children starved and crippled\" along with bold predictions which were later justified by events:251\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing.\u2014\u200a\nKeynes's followers assert that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923, and again by the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of the Second World War. However, historian Ruth Henig claims that \"most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out\".\nOnly a small fraction of reparations was ever paid. In fact, historian Stephen A. Schuker demonstrates in \"American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919\u201333\", that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German out payments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.\nSchuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and supported hyperinflation on political grounds. Nevertheless, \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment\u00a0\u2013 it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy-making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.\nIn the 1920s.\nKeynes had completed his \"A Treatise on Probability\" before the war but published it in 1921.283 The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of probability theory, championing the important view that \"probabilities\" were no more or less than truth values intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic interval approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, \"c\", in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor Alfred Marshall which Joseph Schumpeter called \"the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read\". Mary Paley Marshall was \"entranced\" by the memorial, while Lytton Strachey rated it as one of Keynes's \"best works\".342\nIn 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with \"A Revision of the Treaty\".245 He attacked the post-World War I deflation policies with \"A Tract on Monetary Reform\" in 1923329\u00a0\u2013 a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works. During the 1920s Keynes's pro-stimulus views had only limited effect on policymakers and mainstream academic opinion\u00a0\u2013 according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was \"muddled\". The \"Tract\" had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard, as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor Winston Churchill to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing \"The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill\" and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.\nDuring the Great Depression.\nKeynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. The work, \"Treatise on Money\", was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested\u00a0\u2013 which can happen if interest rates are too high\u00a0\u2013 then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate\u00a0\u2013 or indeed meaningful\u00a0\u2013 indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular, he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and labour.\nKeynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits during recessions were a good thing and a natural product of an economic slump. He wrote, \"For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill.\"\nAt the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published \"The Means to Prosperity\", which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. \"The Means to Prosperity\" contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.\nKeynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the as he was dismayed by its imperialist ambitions and its treatment of Jews. Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States. In 1931, he received considerable support for his views on counter-cyclical public spending in Chicago, then America's foremost center for economic views alternative to the mainstream.507 However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the depression, until just before the outbreak of war. In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by Felix Frankfurter to address President Roosevelt directly, which he did by letters and face-to-face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of each other. However, according to Skidelsky, the consensus is that Keynes's efforts began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy only after 1939.\nKeynes's \"magnum opus\", \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" was published in 1936.It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes's favourite students, and later economist, David Bensusan-Butt. The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. Although Keynes stated in his preface that his General Theory was only secondarily concerned with the \"applications of this theory to practice\", the circumstances of its publication were such that his suggestions shaped the course of the 1930s. In addition, Keynes introduced the world to a new interpretation of taxation: since the legal tender is now defined by the state, inflation becomes \"taxation by currency depreciation\". This hidden tax meant a) that the standard of value should be governed by deliberate decision; and (b) that it was possible to maintain a middle course between deflation and inflation. This novel interpretation was inspired by the desperate search for control over the economy which permeated the academic world after the Depression. The \"General Theory\" challenged the earlier neoclassical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a \"special case\" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in Say's law, which, simply put, states that \"supply creates its demand\", and that in a free-market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs.\nAn innovation from Keynes was the concept of price stickiness\u00a0\u2013 the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue that it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"aggregate demand\" and \"aggregate supply\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria\u00a0\u2013 and in those cases, it is on the state, not the market, that economies must depend for their salvation. In contrast, Keynes argued that demand is what creates supply and not the other way around. He questioned Say's Law by asking what would happen if the money that is being given to individuals is not finding its way back into the economy and is saved instead. He suggested the result would be a recession. To tackle the fear of a recession Say's Law suggests government intervention. This government intervention can be used to prevent any further increase in savings in the form of a decreased interest rate. Decreasing the interest rate will encourage people to start spending and investing again, or so it is stated by Say's Law. The reason behind this is that when there is little investing, savings start to accumulate and reach a stopping point in the flow of money. During the normal economic activity, it would be justified to have savings because they can be given out as loans but in this case, there is little demand for them, so they are doing no good for the economy. The supply of savings then exceeds the demand for loans and the result is lower prices or lower interest rates. Thus, the idea is that the money that was once saved is now re-invested or spent, assuming lower interest rates appeal to consumers. To Keynes, however, this was not always the case, and it couldn't be assumed that lower interest rates would automatically encourage investment and spending again since there is no proven link between the two.\nThe \"General Theory\" argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can enhance employment and total income \"only\" by \"first\" increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low-employment equilibrium. The demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.\nThe book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth,\" he wrote in 1928. \"With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them.\"\nThe \"General Theory\" is often viewed as the foundation of modern macroeconomics. Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s.\nYet his ideas were soon to achieve widespread acceptance, with eminent American professors such as Alvin Hansen agreeing with the \"General Theory\" before the outbreak of World War II.\nKeynes himself had only limited participation in the theoretical debates that followed the publication of the \"General Theory\" as he suffered a heart attack in 1937, requiring him to take long periods of rest. Among others, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists have argued that as a result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the IS\u2013LM model (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas). Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were directed largely towards the practical side of economics: the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the Bretton Woods Conference.\nIn the \"General Theory\" and later, Keynes responded to the socialists who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against one another, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later to the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.\nAlthough Keynes has been widely criticised\u00a0\u2013 especially by members of the Chicago school of economics\u00a0\u2013 for advocating in their view irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programmes of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.\nSecond World War.\nDuring the Second World War, Keynes argued in \"How to Pay for the War\", published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than deficit spending, to avoid inflation. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post-war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April. In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a hereditary peerage in the King's Birthday Honours. On 7 July his title was gazetted as \"Baron Keynes, of Tilton, in the County of Sussex\" and he took his seat in the House of Lords on the Liberal Party benches.\nAs the Allied victory began to look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor and new global institutions\u00a0\u2013 a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions as managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The US's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proven correct by events.\nThe two new institutions, later known as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision. There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large trade surplus; instead, the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the deficit countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations. Yet, Keynes was still pleased when accepting the final agreement, saying that if the institutions stayed true to their founding principles, \"the brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.\"\nPostwar.\nAfter the war, Keynes continued to represent the United Kingdom in international negotiations despite his deteriorating health. He succeeded in obtaining preferential terms from the United States for new and outstanding debts to facilitate the rebuilding of the British economy.https://\nJust before his death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a professor of social economics and advisor to the Bank of England, of his hopes that Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: \"I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago.\"https://\nEconomic viewpoint.\nViews on free trade and protectionism.\nTurning point of the Great Depression.\nAccording to Keynesian theory, trade deficits are harmful. The countries that import more than they export weaken their economies. When the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and gross domestic product (GDP) slows down. Furthermore, surplus countries exert a \"negative externality\" on their trading partners. They get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners. John Maynard Keynes believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.\nAt the beginning of his career, Keynes was an economist close to Alfred Marshall, deeply convinced of the benefits of free trade. From the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, he gradually adhered to protectionist measures.\nOn 5 November 1929, when heard by the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, Keynes indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance. The committee's report states in a section entitled \"import control and export aid\", that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employment. Thus, the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country's growth.\nIn January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, Keynes proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce imports. In the autumn of 1930, he proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports. In the \"Treatise on Money\", published in the autumn of 1930, he took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.\nOn 7 March 1931, in the \"New Statesman and Nation\", he wrote an article entitled \"Proposal for a Tariff Revenue\". He pointed out that the reduction in wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets. Instead, he proposed the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralise the effects on the balance of trade. The application of customs tariffs seemed to him \"unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be\". Thus, for Keynes, an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminated. He proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).\nIn 1932, in an article entitled \"The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs\", published in \"The Listener\", he envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering them indispensable to Britain.\nCritique of the theory of comparative advantage.\nIn the post-crisis situation of 1929, Keynes judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealistic. He criticised, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.\nAs early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, he doubted the intensity of the gain from specialisation in the case of manufactured goods. While participating in the MacMillan Committee, he admitted that he no longer \"believed in a very high degree of national specialisation\" and refused to \"abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive\". He also criticised the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in his view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.\nIn the \"Daily Mail\" of 13 March 1931, he called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility \"nonsense\" since it states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until he finds a job. But for Keynes, this change of job may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible. Generally speaking, for Keynes, the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.\nIn July 1933, he published an article in the \"New Statesman and Nation\" entitled \"National Self-Sufficiency\", in which he criticised the argument of the specialisation of economies, which is the basis of free trade. He thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Instead of the specialisation of economies advocated by the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, he prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations. In it he refutes the principle of peacemaking trade. His vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new markets. He defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of protectionism.\nHe notes in \"National Self-Sufficiency\":\nHe also writes in \"National Self-Sufficiency\":{\nLater, Keynes had a written correspondence with James Meade centred on the issue of import restrictions. Keynes and Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariff. In March 1944 Keynes began a discussion with Marcus Fleming after the latter had written an article entitled \"Quotas versus depreciation\". On this occasion, we see that he has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the Great Depression. He considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalances. Thus, for Keynes, currency depreciation was no longer sufficient and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits. To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to him to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).\nViews on trade imbalances.\nKeynes was the principal author of a proposal\u00a0\u2013 the so-called Keynes Plan\u00a0\u2013 for an International Clearing Union. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by \"creating\" additional \"international money\", and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because \"American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships\".\nThe new system is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on the regulation of international trade, to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would have an incentive to reduce it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits. He proposed a global bank that would issue its currency\u00a0\u2013 the bancor\u00a0\u2013 which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand\u00a0\u2013 countries running surpluses exert a \"negative externality\" on trading partners, and pose, far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.\nIn his 1933 \"Yale Review\" article \"National Self-Sufficiency\", he already highlighted the problems created by free trade. His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of \"The Economist\", \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"336\nThese ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression when\u00a0\u2013 in the opinion of Keynes and others\u00a0\u2013 international lending, primarily by the US, exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.\nInfluenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, \"An Outline of Money\", devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the \"problem of balance\". However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns\u00a0\u2013 and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses\u00a0\u2013 have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes's insights have slipped from view. They received some attention again after the 2008 financial crisis.\nViews on inflation.\nKeynes has been characterised as being indifferent or even positive about mild inflation. He had expressed a preference for inflation over deflation, saying that if one has to choose between the two evils, it is \"better to disappoint the rentier\" than to inflict pain on working-class families. Keynes was also aware of the dangers of inflation. In \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\", he wrote:https:// &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.\nViews on alienation.\nKeynes was not deeply concerned with alienation and did not explicitly use the term in his writings. While Keynes was pro-business and viewed capitalism as essential for economic growth, he acknowledged that it created economic insecurity and dissatisfaction, which could alienate workers, yet he believed this was only a temporary problem. In his book the Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren (1930), he envisioned a future where society would become so wealthy that the pursuit of money for its own sake would become irrelevant, effectively eliminating alienation. He believed that continuous economic growth would eventually reduce the need for excessive labor and alleviate extreme inequality, allowing people to pursue more fulfilling lives. While Keynes' optimistic vision has not fully materialized, global wealth has grown significantly since his time. Yet, alienation remains a pressing issue, especially during periods of rising inequality, suggesting that economic growth alone may not be enough to eliminate the problem. \u00a0\nInfluence and legacy.\nKeynesian ascendancy 1939\u201379.\nFrom the end of the Great Depression to the mid-1970s, Keynes provided the main inspiration for economic policymakers in Europe, America and much of the rest of the world. While economists and policymakers had become increasingly won over to Keynes's way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s, it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment. According to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith (then a US government official charged with controlling inflation), in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending, \"one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas\".\nThe Keynesian Revolution was associated with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee, whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.\nNeo-Keynesian economics.\nIn the late 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson) attempted to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings in terms of formal mathematical models. In what had become known as the neoclassical synthesis, they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years.\nBy the 1950s, Keynesian policies were adopted by almost the entire developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.\nIn late 1965 \"Time\" magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from Milton Friedman (later echoed by US President Richard Nixon), \"We are all Keynesians now\". The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing and reported that \"Washington's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes's central theme: the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency, but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government.\" The article also states that Keynes was one of the three most important economists who ever lived, and that his \"General Theory\" was more influential than the \"magna opera\" of other famous economists, such as Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\".\nMultiplier.\nThe concept of the multiplier was first developed by R.F. Kahn in his article \"The relation of home investment to unemployment\" in \"The Economic Journal\" of June 1931. The Kahn multiplier was the employment multiplier; Keynes took the idea from Kahn and formulated the investment multiplier.\nKeynesian economics out of favour 1979\u20132007.\nKeynesian economics were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but forces had begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then-young Milton Friedman. Initially, the society had little impact on the wider world\u00a0\u2013 according to Hayek it was as if Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.\nFriedman, however, began to emerge as a formidable critic of Keynesian economics from the mid-1950s, and especially after his 1963 publication of \"A Monetary History of the United States\".\nOn the practical side of economic life, \"big government\" had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s, but the balance began to shift towards the power of private interests in the 1960s. Keynes had written against the folly of allowing \"decadent and selfish\" speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label \"Gnomes of Zurich\" being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.\nCriticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his \"General Theory\". For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.\nFriedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once\u00a0\u2013 a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.\nKeynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics\u00a0\u2013 by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy-making.\nNot all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes\u00a0\u2013 Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called \"Keynesian\". Writing in \"The American Prospect\", Robert Kuttner argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls, which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham's law phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong ones).\nHistorian Peter Pugh has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam War, which was against Keynesian advice.\nA more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework\u00a0\u2013 the resulting body of work largely composing New Keynesian economics. In 1992 Alan Blinder wrote about a \"Keynesian Restoration\", as work based on Keynes's ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia, though in the mainstream it was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking. In the world of policy making, free market influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government level\u00a0\u2013 in powerful normative institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and US Treasury, and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the \"Financial Times\" and \"The Economist\".\nKeynesian resurgence 2008\u201309.\nThe 2008 financial crisis led to public skepticism about the free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the \"Financial Times\", announced the death of the dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.\nEconomist Robert J. Shiller had begun advocating robust government intervention to tackle the financial crises, specifically citing Keynes. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman also actively argued the case for vigorous Keynesian intervention in the economy in his columns for \"The New York Times\".\nOther prominent economic commentators who have argued for Keynesian government intervention to mitigate the 2008 financial crisis included George Akerlof, J. Bradford DeLong, Robert Reich and Joseph Stiglitz.\nNewspapers and other media have also cited work relating to Keynes by Hyman Minsky, Robert Skidelsky, Donald Markwell and Axel Leijonhufvud.\nA series of major bailouts were pursued during the 2008 financial crisis, starting on 7 September 2008 with the announcement that the US Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the US subprime mortgage market\u00a0\u2013 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide. This was in stark contrast to the action imposed on Indonesia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when it was forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time, prompting a bank run.\nMuch of the post-crisis discussion reflected Keynes's advocacy of international coordination of fiscal or monetary stimulus, and of international economic institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, which many had argued should be reformed as a \"new Bretton Woods\", and should have been even before the crises broke out.\nThe IMF and United Nations economists advocated a coordinated international approach to fiscal stimulus. Donald Markwell argued that in the absence of such an international approach, there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s.\nBy the end of December 2008, the \"Financial Times\" reported that \"the sudden resurgence of Keynesian policy is a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades.\"\nIn December 2008, Paul Krugman released his book \"The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\", arguing that economic conditions similar to those that existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published \"\", a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as it does not take into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.\nIn the March 2009 speech entitled \"Reform the International Monetary System\", Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's bancor. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).\nAlthough Zhou's ideas had not been broadly accepted, leaders meeting in April at the 2009 G-20 London summit agreed to allow $250\u00a0billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF, to be distributed globally. Stimulus plans were credited for contributing to a better-than-expected economic outlook by both the OECD\nand the IMF, in reports published in June and July 2009. Both organisations warned global leaders that recovery was likely to be slow, so counter-recessionary measures ought not be rolled back too early.\nWhile the need for stimulus measures was broadly accepted among policymakers, there had been much debate over how to fund the spending. Some leaders and institutions, such as Angela Merkel\nand the European Central Bank,\nexpressed concern over the potential impact on inflation, national debt and the risk that a too-large stimulus will create an unsustainable recovery.\nAmong professional economists the revival of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, there is a growing academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.\nNew Keynesian economics.\nNew Keynesian economics developed in the 1990s and early 2000s as a response to the critique that macroeconomics lacked microeconomic foundations. New Keynesianism developed models to provide microfoundations for Keynesian economics. It incorporated parts of new classical macroeconomics to develop the new neoclassical synthesis, which forms the basis for mainstream macroeconomics today.\nTwo main assumptions define the New Keynesian approach to macroeconomics. Like the New Classical approach, New Keynesian macroeconomic analysis usually assumes that households and firms have rational expectations. However, the two schools differ in that New Keynesian analysis usually assumes a variety of market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume that there is imperfect competition in price and wage setting to help explain why prices and wages can become \"sticky\", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.\nWage and price stickiness, and the other market failures present in New Keynesian models, imply that the economy may fail to attain full employment. Therefore, New Keynesians argue that macroeconomic stabilisation by the government (using fiscal policy) and the central bank (using monetary policy) can lead to a more efficient macroeconomic outcome than a \"laissez faire\" policy would.\nOverall views.\nPraise.\nOn a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went\u00a0\u2013 even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.\nAustrian School economist Friedrich Hayek was Keynes's most prominent contemporary critic, with sharply opposing views on the economy. Yet after Keynes's death, he wrote: \"He was the one really great man I ever knew, and for whom I had unbounded admiration. The world will be a very much poorer place without him.\" Colleague Nicholas Davenport recalled, \"There were deep emotional forces about Maynard ... One could sense his humanity. There was nothing of the cold intellectual about him.\"\nLionel Robbins, former head of the economics department at the London School of Economics, who engaged in many heated debates with Keynes in the 1930s, had this to say after observing Keynes in early negotiations with the Americans while drawing up plans for Bretton Woods:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This went very well indeed. Keynes was in his most lucid and persuasive mood: and the effect was irresistible. At such moments, I often find myself thinking that Keynes must be one of the most remarkable men that have ever lived \u2013 the quick logic, the birdlike swoop of intuition, the vivid fancy, the wide vision, above all the incomparable sense of the fitness of words, all combine to make something several degrees beyond the limit of ordinary human achievement.\nDouglas LePan, an official from the Canadian High Commission, wrote:https://\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am spellbound. This is the most beautiful creature I have ever listened to. Does he belong to our species? Or is he from some other order? There is something mythic and fabulous about him. I sense in him something massive and sphinx like, and yet also a hint of wings.\nBertrand Russell named Keynes one of the most intelligent people he had ever known, commenting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Keynes's intellect was the sharpest and clearest that I have ever known. When I argued with him, I felt that I took my life in my hands, and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool.\nKeynes's obituary in \"The Times\" included the comment: \"There is the man himself\u00a0\u2013 radiant, brilliant, effervescent, gay, full of impish jokes ... He was a humane man genuinely devoted to the cause of the common good.\"\nCritiques.\nAs a man of the centre described by some as having the greatest impact of any 20th-century economist, Keynes attracted considerable criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. In the 1920s, Keynes was seen as anti-establishment and was mainly attacked from the right. In the \"red 1930s\", many young economists favoured Marxist views, even in Cambridge, and while Keynes was engaging principally with the right to try to persuade them of the merits of more progressive policy, the most vociferous criticism against him came from the left, who saw him as a supporter of capitalism. From the 1950s and onwards, most of the attacks against Keynes have again been from the right.\nIn 1931, Friedrich Hayek extensively critiqued Keynes's 1930 \"Treatise on Money\". After reading Hayek's \"The Road to Serfdom\", Keynes wrote to Hayek: \"Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it.\" He concluded the letter with the recommendation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion with the results of your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them. Your greatest danger is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States.\nOn the pressing issue of the time, whether deficit spending could lift a country from depression, Keynes replied to Hayek's criticism in the following way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I should... conclude rather differently. I should say that what we want is not no planning, or even less planning, indeed I should say we almost certainly want more. But the planning should take place in a community in which as many people as possible, both leaders and followers wholly share your moral position. Moderate planning will be safe enough if those carrying it out are rightly oriented in their minds and hearts to the moral issue.\nAsked why Keynes expressed \"moral and philosophical\" agreement with Hayek's \"Road to Serfdom\", Hayek stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because he believed that he was fundamentally still a classical English liberal and wasn't quite aware of how far he had moved away from it. His basic ideas were still those of individual freedom. He did not think systematically enough to see the conflicts. He was, in a sense, corrupted by political necessity.\nAccording to some observers, Hayek felt that the post-World War II \"Keynesian orthodoxy\" gave too much power to the state, and that such policies would lead toward socialism.\nWhile Milton Friedman described \"The General Theory\" as \"a great book\", he argues that its implicit separation of nominal from real magnitudes is neither possible nor desirable. Macroeconomic policy, Friedman argues, can reliably influence only the nominal. He and other monetarists have consequently argued that Keynesian economics can result in stagflation, the combination of low growth and high inflation that developed economies suffered in the early 1970s. More to Friedman's taste was the \"Tract on Monetary Reform\" (1923), which he regarded as Keynes's best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stability.\nJoseph Schumpeter was an economist of the same age as Keynes and one of his main rivals. He was among the first reviewers to argue that Keynes's \"General Theory\" was not a general theory, but a special case. He said the work expressed \"the attitude of a decaying civilisation\". After Keynes's death Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece \"Keynes the Economist\"\u00a0\u2013 on a personal level he was very positive about Keynes as a man, praising his pleasant nature, courtesy and kindness. He assessed some of Keynes's biographical and editorial work as among the best he'd ever seen. Yet Schumpeter remained critical of Keynes's economics, linking Keynes's childlessness to what Schumpeter saw as an essentially short-term view. He considered Keynes to have a kind of unconscious patriotism that caused him to fail to understand the problems of other nations. For Schumpeter, \"Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil: it dies there and becomes poisonous as it dies.\" He \"admired and envied Keynes, but when Keynes died in 1946, Schumpeter's obituary gave Keynes this same off-key, perfunctory treatment he would later give Adam Smith in the \"History of Economic Analysis\", the \"discredit of not adding a single innovation to the techniques of economic analysis.\"\nLudwig von Mises, an Austrian economist, describes a Keynesian system as believing it can solve most problems with \"more money and credit\" which leads to a system of \"inflationism\" in which \"prices (of goods) rise higher and higher.\" Murray Rothbard wrote that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a \"dismal monetary and banking situation,\" since it allows for the central bankers that have the exclusive ability to print money to be \"unchecked and out of control.\" Rothbard went on to say in an interview that, \"There is one good thing about (Karl) Marx: he was not a Keynesian.\"\nPresident Harry S. Truman was sceptical of Keynesian theorising. He told Leon Keyserling, a Keynesian economist who chaired Truman's Council of Economic Advisers: \"Nobody can ever convince me that government can spend a dollar that it's not got.\"\nViews on race.\nSome critics have sought to show that Keynes had sympathies towards Nazism, and a number of writers have described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterised as antisemitic, while others as philosemitic.\nScholars have suggested that these reflect clich\u00e9s current at the time that he accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.\nAllegations that he was racist or had totalitarian beliefs have been rejected by Robert Skidelsky and other biographers. Professor Gordon Fletcher wrote that \"the suggestion of a link between Keynes and any support of totalitarianism cannot be sustained\". Once the aggressive tendencies of the Nazis towards Jews and other minorities had become apparent, Keynes made clear his loathing of Nazism. As a lifelong pacifist he had initially favoured peaceful containment of Nazi Germany, yet he began to advocate a forceful resolution while many conservatives were still arguing for appeasement. After the war started, he roundly criticised the Left for losing their nerve to confront Adolf Hitler, saying:https://\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The intelligentsia of the Left were the loudest in demanding that the Nazi aggression should be resisted at all costs. When it comes to a showdown, scarce four weeks have passed before they remember that they are pacifists and write defeatist letters to your columns, leaving the defence of freedom and civilisation to Colonel Blimp and the Old School Tie, for whom Three Cheers.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nKeynes's early romantic and sexual relationships were exclusively with men. Keynes had been in relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel De Mendi Macmillan.27 Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan would go on to be chairman of the Macmillan Publishers founded by his grandfather, which first published Keynes' \"Economic Consequences of the Peace\".18\nAttitudes in the Bloomsbury Group, in which Keynes was avidly involved, were relaxed about homosexuality. Keynes, together with writer Lytton Strachey, had reshaped the Victorian attitudes of the Cambridge Apostles: \"since [their] time, homosexual relations among the members were for a time common\", wrote Bertrand Russell. The artist Duncan Grant has been described as \"the supreme male love of Keynes's life\", and their sexual relationship lasted from 1908 to 1915. Keynes was having sex on a number of occasions with Lytton Strachey, though they were, for the most part, love rivals rather than lovers. Keynes had won the affections of Arthur Hobhouse and, as with Grant, fell out with a jealous Strachey over it. Strachey had previously found himself put off by Keynes, not least because of his manner of \"treat[ing] his love affairs statistically\". Other notable lovers included writer Francis Birrell, Grant's partner Bunny Garnett, classicist John Tresidder Sheppard, brother of Lytton and psychoanalyst James Strachey, and Indian academic Benoy Kumar Sarkar.\nPolitical opponents have used Keynes's sexuality to attack his academic work. One line of attack held that he was uninterested in the long-term ramifications of his theories because he had no children. Donald Kagan, in \" On the Origins of War\", quotes Sally Marks and Stephen A. Schuker to suggest that \"[Keynes's] passion for Carl Melchior\" distorted his position in favor of Germany.\nKeynes's friends in the Bloomsbury Group were initially surprised when, in his later years, he began pursuing affairs with women, demonstrating himself to be bisexual. Ray Costelloe (who later married Oliver Strachey) was an early heterosexual interest of Keynes. In 1906, Keynes had written of this infatuation that, \"I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit, but as she isn't male I haven't [been] able to think of any suitable steps to take.\"104\nMarriage.\nIn 1921, Keynes wrote that he had fallen \"very much in love\" with Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's \"Ballets Russes\".https:// In the early years of his courtship, he maintained an affair with a younger man, Sebastian Sprott, in tandem with Lopokova, but eventually chose Lopokova exclusively. They were married in 1925, with Keynes's former lover Duncan Grant as best man. \"What a marriage of beauty and brains, the fair Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes\" was said at the time. Keynes later commented to Strachey that beauty and intelligence were rarely found in the same person, and that only in Duncan Grant had he found the combination. The union was happy, with biographer Peter Clarke writing that the marriage gave Keynes \"a new focus, a new emotional stability and a sheer delight of which he never wearied\". The couple hoped to have children but this did not happen.\nAmong Keynes's Bloomsbury friends, Lopokova was, at least initially, subjected to criticism for her manners, mode of conversation and supposedly humble social origins\u00a0\u2013 the last of the ostensible causes being particularly noted in the letters of Vanessa and Clive Bell, and Virginia Woolf. In her novel \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1925), Woolf bases the character of Rezia Warren Smith on Lopokova. E.\u00a0M.\u00a0Forster later wrote in contrition about \"Lydia Keynes, whose every word should be recorded\"; \"How we all used to underestimate her\".\nKeynes had no children, and his wife outlived him by 35 years, dying in 1981.\nSupport for the arts.\nKeynes thought that the pursuit of money for its own sake was a pathological condition, and that the proper aim of work is to provide leisure. He wanted shorter working hours and longer holidays for all.\nKeynes was interested in literature in general and drama in particular and supported the Cambridge Arts Theatre financially, which allowed the institution to become one of the major British stages outside London.\nKeynes's interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, as a member of CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. From the start, the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.\nKeynes built up a substantial collection of fine art, including works by Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edgar Degas, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso and Georges Seurat (some of which can now be seen at the Fitzwilliam Museum). He enjoyed collecting books; he collected and protected many of Isaac Newton's papers. In part on the basis of these papers, Keynes wrote of Newton as \"the last of the magicians.\"\nPhilosophical and spiritual views.\nKeynes, like other members of the Bloomsbury Group, was greatly influenced by the philosophy of G. E. Moore, which in 1938 he described as \"still my religion under the surface\". According to Moore, states of mind were the only valuable things in themselves, the most important being \"the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects\". Virginia Woolf's biographer tells an anecdote of how Virginia Woolf, Keynes and T. S. Eliot discussed religion at a dinner party, in the context of their struggle against Victorian era morality.\nKeynes may have been religiously confirmed, but according to Cambridge University he was clearly an agnostic for all his life. According to one biographer, \"he was never able to take religion seriously, regarding it as a strange aberration of the human mind\" but also added that he came to \"value it for social and moral reasons\" later in life. Another biographer writes that he \"broke the family faith and became a 'ferocious agnostic'\" during his time at Eton. One Cambridge acquaintance remembered him as \"an atheist with a devotion to King's chapel\". At Cambridge, he was strongly associated with the Cambridge Heretics Society, an avowed atheist group which promoted secularism and humanism.\nInvestments.\nKeynes was ultimately a successful investor, building up a private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street crash of 1929, which he did not foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of \u00a3500,000\u00a0\u2013 . The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various charities and philanthropies and despite his ethical reluctance to sell on a falling market in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.\nKeynes managed the endowment of King's College, Cambridge starting in the 1920s, initially with an unsuccessful strategy based on market timing but later shifting to focus in the publicly traded stock of small and medium-sized companies that paid large dividends. This was a controversial decision at the time, as stocks were considered high-risk and the centuries-old endowment had traditionally been invested in agricultural land and fixed income assets like bonds. Keynes was granted permission to invest a small minority of assets in stocks, and his adroit management resulted this portion of the endowment growing to become the majority of the endowment's assets. The active component of his portfolio outperformed a British equity index by an average of 6% to 8% a year over a quarter century, earning him a favourable mention by later investors such as Warren Buffett and George Soros.\nJoel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments describes Keynes as an early practitioner of value investing, a school of thought formalised in the US by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School during the 1920s and 1930s. However, Keynes is believed to have developed his ideas independently. Keynes is also regarded as a pioneer of financial diversification as he recognised the importance of holding assets with \"opposed risks\" as he wrote \"since they are likely to move in opposite directions when there are general fluctuations\"; and also as an early international investor who avoided home country bias by investing substantially in stocks outside the United Kingdom. Ken Fisher characterised Keynes as an exception to the rule that economists usually make horrible investors.\nKeynes joined the Board of the National Mutual Life Assurance Society in 1919 and served as chairman from 1921 to 1938. Keynes introduced a policy of active trading of fixed interest stocks, coupled with investment in equities. \"Keynes was the first to give [investment trading] the seal of respectability and to apply it to a life assurance fund\".\nOlivier Accominotti and David Chambers have pointed out that Keynes did not make use of currency trading and the carry trade in his investments. Keynes understood the strategy however, but considered that in his time the separation of the interest rates was not sufficient to pay for the costs of transporting the capital as gold, as he explained to the Macmillan Committee of 1930.\nPolitical life.\nKeynes was a lifelong member of the Liberal Party, which until the 1920s had been one of the two main political parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economic policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third-party status by the growing workers-oriented Labour Party.\nIn 1939 Keynes had the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP with the University of Cambridge seat. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of Magdalene College had obtained agreement that none of the major parties would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.\nKeynes was a proponent of eugenics. He served as director of the British Eugenics Society from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before his death, Keynes declared eugenics to be \"the most important, significant and, I would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists.\"\nKeynes once remarked that \"the youth had no religion save communism and this was worse than nothing.\" Marxism \"was founded upon nothing better than a misunderstanding of Ricardo\", and, given time, he (Keynes) \"would deal thoroughly with the Marxists\" and other economists to solve the economic problems their theories \"threaten to cause\". In 1925, Keynes said \"the class war will find me on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.\"\nIn 1931 Keynes had the following to say on Leninism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How can I accept a doctrine, which sets up as its bible, above and beyond criticism, an obsolete textbook [\"Das Kapital\"] which I know not only to be scientifically erroneous but without interest or application to the modern world? How can I adopt a creed which, preferring the mud to the fish, exalts the boorish proletariat above the bourgeoisie and the intelligentsia who, with whatever faults, are the quality of life and surely carry the seeds of all human advancement? Even if we need a religion, how can we find it in the turbid rubbish of the red bookshop? It is hard for an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe to find his ideals here, unless he has first suffered some strange and horrid process of conversion which has changed all his values.\u2014\u200a\nKeynes was a firm supporter of women's rights and in 1932 became vice-chairman of the Marie Stopes Society which provided birth control education. He also campaigned against job discrimination against women and unequal pay. He was an outspoken campaigner for reform of the laws against homosexuality.\nDeath.\nThroughout his life, Keynes worked energetically for the benefit both of the public and his friends; even when his health was poor, he laboured to sort out the finances of his old college. Helping to set up the Bretton Woods system, he worked to institute an international monetary system that would be beneficial for the world economy. In 1946, Keynes suffered a series of heart attacks, which ultimately proved fatal. They began during negotiations for the Anglo-American loan in Savannah, Georgia, where he was trying to secure favourable terms for the United Kingdom from the United States, a process he described as \"absolute hell\". A few weeks after returning from the United States, Keynes died of a heart attack at Tilton, his farmhouse home near Firle, East Sussex, England, on 21 April 1946, at the age of 62.https:// Against his wishes (he wanted his ashes to be deposited in the crypt at King's), his ashes were scattered on the Downs above Tilton.\nBoth of Keynes's parents outlived him: his father John Neville Keynes (1852\u20131949) by three years, and his mother Florence Ada Keynes (1861\u20131958) by twelve. Keynes's brother Sir Geoffrey Keynes (1887\u20131982) was a distinguished surgeon, scholar and bibliophile. Keynes's sister, Margaret Hill (1885\u20131970) was a prominent social reformer. His nephews include Richard Keynes (1919\u20132010), a physiologist, and Quentin Keynes (1921\u20132003), an adventurer and bibliophile. His niece, Polly Hill (1914\u20132005), was an economic anthropologist and emeritus fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge.\nCultural representations.\nIn John Buchan's novel \"Island of Sheep\" (1936) the character of the financier Barralty is based on Keynes.\nIn the film \"Wittgenstein\" (1993), directed by Derek Jarman, Keynes was played by John Quentin.\nThe docudrama \"Paris 1919\", based around Margaret MacMillan's book, featured Paul Bandey as Keynes.\nIn the BBC series about the Bloomsbury Group, \"Life in Squares\", Keynes was portrayed by Edmund Kingsley.\nThe novel \"Mr Keynes' Revolution\" (2020) by E.J. Barnes is about Keynes's life in the 1920s.\n\"Love Letters\", based on the correspondence of Keynes and Lydia Lopokova, was performed by Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham-Carter at Charleston in 2021.\nPublications.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArticles and pamphlets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They natively speak Belarusian, an East Slavic language. More than 9\u00a0million people proclaim Belarusian ethnicity worldwide. Nearly 7.99\u00a0million Belarusians reside in Belarus, with the United States and Russia being home to more than 500,000 Belarusians each. The majority of Belarusians adhere to Eastern Orthodoxy.\nName.\nDuring the Soviet era, Belarusians were referred to as \"Byelorussians\" or \"Belorussians\" (from Byelorussia, derived from Russian \"\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\"). Before, they were typically known as \"White Russians\" or \"White Ruthenians\" (from White Russia or White Ruthenia, based on \"\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c\"). Upon Belarusian independence in 1991, they became known as \"Belarusians\" (from Belarus, derived from \"\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c\"), sometimes spelled as \"Belarusans\", \"Belarussians\" or \"Belorusians\".\nThe term \"White Rus\"' (), also known as \"White Ruthenia\" or \"White Russia\" (as the term \"Rus' \" is often conflated with its Latin forms \"Russia\" and \"Ruthenia\"), was first used in the Middle Ages to refer to the area of Polotsk. The name \"Rus' \" itself is derived from the Rus' people which gave the name to the territories of Kievan Rus'. The chronicles of Jan of Czarnk\u00f3w mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke Jogaila and his mother at \"\" in 1381. During the 17th century, the Russian tsars used the term to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, during the Russian Civil War, the term \"White Russian\" became associated with the White movement.\nGeographic distribution.\nBelarusians are an East Slavic ethnic group, who constitute the majority of Belarus' population. Belarusian minority populations live in countries neighboring Belarus: Ukraine, Poland (especially in the Podlaskie Voivodeship), the Russian Federation and Lithuania. At the beginning of the 20th century, Belarusians constituted a minority in the regions around the city of Smolensk in Russia.\nSignificant numbers of Belarusians emigrated to the United States, Brazil and Canada in the early 20th century. During Soviet times (1917\u20131991), many Belarusians were deported or migrated to various regions of the USSR, including Siberia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.\nSince the 1991 breakup of the USSR, several hundred thousand Belarusians have emigrated to the Baltic states, the United States, Canada, Russia, and EU countries.\nLanguages.\nThe two official languages of Belarus are Belarusian and Russian. Russian was made co-official with Belarusian after the 1995 Belarusian referendum, which also established that the flag (with the hammer and sickle removed), anthem, and coat of arms would be those of the BSSR. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly stated that the referendum violated international standards. Members of the opposition claimed that the organization of the referendum involved several serious violations of legislation, including a violation of the constitution.\nGenetics.\nBelarusians, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from a Cro-Magnon population that arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago; Neolithic farmers who migrated from Asia Minor during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago; and Yamnaya steppe pastoralists who expanded into Europe from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.\nHistory.\nThe Neolithic and the Bronze Age.\nBalts have historically inhabited most of the territory of present-day Belarus, particularly The upper Dnieper River basin, Sozh, Berezina, Pripyat, and Western Dvina river regions. Many ancient place names in Belarus are of Baltic origin. These names predate Slavic settlement, showing that Balts lived in these areas before the arrival of Slavs which began around the 6th\u20137th centuries AD. In Belarus, Balts gradually assimilated into Slavic tribes, especially during the 1st millennium AD.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nAccording to Russian archaeologist Valentin Sedov, it was intensive contacts with the Balts that contributed to the distinctiveness of the Belarusian tribes from the other Eastern Slavs.\nThe Baltic population gradually became Slavic, undergoing assimilation, a process that for eastern and central Belarus ended around the 12th century. Most of present-day Belarusian lands in the 8th-9th centuries were inhabited by 3 tribal unions: the Krivichs, Dregoviches and Radimichs. Of these, the Krivichs played the most important role; Polotsk, founded by them, was the most important cultural and political center during this period. The principalities formed at that time on the territory of Belarus were part of Kievan Rus'. The process of the beginning of the East Slavic linguistic community and the separation of Belarusian dialects slowly took place.\nIn the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\nThe lands of modern-day Belarus played a central role in the history and development of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Over time, East Slavic populations \u2014 today broadly identified as Belarusians \u2014 came to comprise a substantial portion of the Grand Duchy's population, territory, and administrative structure. Beginning with the reigns of Grand Dukes Mindaugas and Gediminas, the Duchy expanded rapidly eastward and southward. By the mid-14th century, most of the territories of modern Belarus \u2014 including Polotsk, Vitebsk, Minsk, Turov, and Pinsk \u2014 had been incorporated into the Lithuanian state. These regions were historically part of the Kievan Rus' cultural and political sphere and retained strong Orthodox Christian and East Slavic traditions. Their elites, while politically integrated into the Lithuanian state, continued to identify with the Rus' legacy and maintained local self-governance to varying degrees. The nobility of Belarusian territories often referred to as Ruthenian szlachta were full participants in the political life of the Grand Duchy. Many of them were bilingual or trilingual, speaking Ruthenian, Polish, and Latin, and later came under increasing Polish cultural influence, especially after the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the Union of Brest in 1596, which created the Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church. While a modern Belarusian national identity did not yet exist, the Ruthenian-speaking population of the GDL played a key role in shaping the Duchy\u2019s culture, legal traditions, and demographic landscape. These populations are widely recognized by scholars as the cultural and linguistic ancestors of modern Belarusians. Over the next two centuries, Belarusian lands experienced growing Polonization and religious shifts, although Ruthenian continued to be used in some official contexts until the late 17th century, when it was replaced by Polish.\nAfter the Partitions of the Commonwealth in the late 18th century, most Belarusian territories were annexed by the Russian Empire, where a new phase of identity development, repression, and cultural shifts began.\nIn the Russian Empire.\nFollowing the destruction of Poland\u2013Lithuania with the Third Partition in 1795, Empress Catherine of Russia created the Belarusian Governorate from the Polotsk and Mogilev Governorates. However, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia banned the use of the word Belarus in 1839, replacing it with the designation Northwestern Krai. Due to the ban, various different names were used for naming the inhabitants of those territories. It was part of the Pale of Settlement, which was the region where Jews were allowed permanent residency.\n20th century.\nDuring World War I and the fall of Russian Empire, a short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic was declared in March 1918. Thereafter, modern Belarus' territory was split between the Second Polish Republic and Soviet Russia during the Peace of Riga in 1921. The latter created the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was reunited with Western Belarus during World War 2 and lasted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which was ended by the Belovezh Accords in 1991. The modern Republic of Belarus exists since then.\nMore than two million people were killed in Belarus during the three years of German occupation in 1941\u201344, around a quarter of the region's population, or even as high as three million killed or thirty percent of the population.\nCuisine.\nBelarusian cuisine shares the same roots as the cuisines of other Eastern and Northern European countries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37977", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37977", "title": "Millet", "text": "Group of grasses (food grain)\nMillets () are a highly varied group of small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food. Most millets belong to the tribe Paniceae.\nMillets are important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa, especially in India, Mali, Nigeria, and Niger, with 97% of production in developing countries. The crop is favoured for its productivity and short growing season under hot dry conditions. The millets are sometimes understood to include the widely cultivated sorghum; apart from that, pearl millet is the most commonly cultivated of the millets. Finger millet, proso millet, barnyard millet, little millet, kodo millet, browntop millet and foxtail millet are other important crop species.\nMillets may have been consumed by humans for about 7,000 years and potentially had \"a pivotal role in the rise of multi-crop agriculture and settled farming societies\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"millet\" is derived via Old French \"millet, millot\" from Latin \"millium\", 'millet', ultimately from Proto-Indo-European \"*mele-\", 'to crush'.\nDescription.\nCharacteristics.\nMillets are small-grained, annual, warm-weather cereals belonging to the grass family. They are highly tolerant of drought and other extreme weather conditions and have a similar nutrient content to other major cereals.\nTaxonomic history.\nIn 1753, Carl Linnaeus described foxtail millet as \"Panicum italicum\". In 1812, Palisot de Beauvois grouped several taxa into \"Setaria italica\". \nThe genus \"Pennisetum\" was divided by Otto Stapf in 1934 into the section \"penicillaria\", with 32 species including all the cultivated ones, and four other sections. In 1977, J. Brunken and colleagues classed the wild \"P. violaceum\" as part of the cultivated species \"P. glaucum\" (pearl millet).\nFinger millet was described as \"Eleusine coracana\" by Joseph Gaertner in 1788.\nEvolution.\nPhylogeny.\nThe millets are closely related to sorghum and maize within the PACMAD clade of grasses, and more distantly to the cereals of the BOP clade such as wheat and barley. \nWithin the Panicoideae, sorghum (great millet) is in the tribe \"Andropogoneae\", while pearl millet, proso, foxtail, fonio, little millet, sawa, Japanese barnyard millet and kodo are in the tribe \"Paniceae\". Within the Chloridoideae, finger millet is in the tribe \"Cynodonteae\", while teff is in the tribe \"Eragrostideae\".\nTaxonomy.\nThe different species of millets are not all closely related. All are members of the family Poaceae (the grasses), but they belong to different tribes and subfamilies. Commonly cultivated millets are:\nEragrostideae tribe in the subfamily Chloridoideae:\nPaniceae tribe in the subfamily Panicoideae:\nAndropogoneae tribe, also in the subfamily Panicoideae:\nDomestication and spread.\nThe cultivation of common millet as the earliest dry crop in East Asia has been attributed to its resistance to drought, and this has been suggested to have aided its spread. Asian varieties of millet made their way from China to the Black Sea region of Europe by 5000 BC.\nMillet was growing wild in Greece as early as 3000 BC, and bulk storage containers for millet have been found from the Late Bronze Age in Macedonia and northern Greece. Hesiod states that \"the beards grow round the millet, which men sow in summer.\" Millet is listed along with wheat in the third century BC by Theophrastus in his \"Enquiry into Plants\".\nEast Asia.\nProso millet (\"Panicum miliaceum\") and foxtail millet (\"Setaria italica\") were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. Some of the earliest evidence of millet cultivation in China was found at Cishan, where proso millet husk phytoliths and biomolecular components have been identified around 10,300\u20138,700 years ago in storage pits along with remains of pit-houses, pottery, and stone tools related to millet cultivation. Evidence at Cishan for foxtail millet dates back to around 8,700 years ago. Noodles made from these two varieties of millet were found under a 4,000-year-old earthenware bowl containing well-preserved noodles at the Lajia archaeological site in north China; this is the oldest evidence of millet noodles in China.\nPalaeoethnobotanists have found evidence of the cultivation of millet in the Korean Peninsula dating to the Middle Jeulmun pottery period (around 3500\u20132000 BC). Millet continued to be an important element in the intensive, multicropping agriculture of the Mumun pottery period (about 1500\u2013300 BC) in Korea. Millets and their wild ancestors, such as barnyard grass and panic grass, were also cultivated in Japan during the J\u014dmon period sometime after 4000 BC.\nIn the Zhengluo region of China, two millet species (foxtail millet and proso millet) were grown, enabling the people to survive the cooling of the global climate around 2200 BC. Chinese myths attribute the domestication of millet to Shennong, a legendary emperor of China, and Hou Ji, whose name means Lord Millet.\nIndian subcontinent.\nLittle millet (\"Panicum sumatrense\") is believed to have been domesticated around 3000 BC in the Indian subcontinent and Kodo millet (\"Paspalum scrobiculatum\") around 3700 BC, also in the Indian subcontinent. \nPearl millet had arrived in the Indian subcontinent by 2000 BC to 1700 BC.\nBrowntop millet (\"Urochloa ramosa\") was likely domesticated in the Deccan near the beginning of the third millennium BCE and spread throughout India, though was later superseded by other millets. Various millets have been mentioned in some of the Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (\"priya\u1e45gu\"), Barnyard millet (\"a\u1e47u\") and black finger millet (\"\u015by\u0101m\u0101ka\"), indicating that millet cultivation was happening around 1200 BC in India. Upon request by the Indian Government in 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations declared 2023 as International Year of Millets. \nCultivation of Finger millet had spread to South India by 1800 BC.\nAfrica.\nPearl millet (\"Pennisetum glaucum\") was domesticated in the Sahel region of West Africa from \"Pennisetum violaceum\". Early archaeological evidence in Africa includes finds at Birimi in northern Ghana (1740 cal BC) and Dhar Tichitt in Mauritania (1936\u20131683 cal BC) and the lower Tilemsi valley in Mali (2500 to 2000 cal BC). Studies of isozymes suggest domestication took place north east of the Senegal River in the far west of the Sahel and tentatively around 6000 BC. \nFinger millet is native to the highlands of East Africa and was domesticated before the third millennium BC.\nEurope.\nBroomcorn or proso millet (\"Panicum miliaceum\") came to Europe from East Asia as early as the 17th century BC in Vinogradnyi Sad, Ukraine. At around 1500 BC it reached Italy and southeastern Europe; around 1400 BC it came to central Europe, and from 1200 BC, it arrived in northern Germany.\nAgriculture.\nCultivation.\nPearl millet is one of the two major dryland crops (alongside sorghum) in the semiarid, impoverished, less fertile agriculture regions of Africa and southeast Asia. Millets are not only adapted to poor, dry infertile soils, but they are also more reliable under these conditions than most other grain crops.\nMillets, however, do respond to high fertility and moisture. On a per-hectare basis, millet grain production can be 2 to 4 times higher with use of irrigation and soil supplements. Improved varieties of millet with enhanced disease resistance can significantly increase farm yield. There has been cooperation between poor countries to improve millet yields. For example, 'Okashana 1', a variety developed in India from a natural-growing millet variety in Burkina Faso, doubled yields. This variety was selected for trials in Zimbabwe. From there it was taken to Namibia, where it was released in 1990 and enthusiastically adopted by farmers. 'Okashana 1' became the most popular variety in Namibia, the only non-Sahelian country where pearl millet\u2014locally known as \"mahangu\"\u2014is the dominant food staple for consumers. 'Okashana 1' was then introduced to Chad. The variety has significantly enhanced yields in Mauritania and Benin.\nPests and diseases.\nMillets are subject to damage by many insect pests, including corn borers, Stemborers, the caterpillars of numerous moths in the families Erebidae and Noctuidae, the millet midge, many species of flies in the Muscidae, Hemipteran bugs of many families including aphids, and species of thrips, beetles, and grasshoppers.\nAmong the many diseases of millets are serious fungal infections such as anthracnose, blast, charcoal rot, downy mildew, ergot, grain mould, rust, and sheath rot. Bacterial diseases are generally less serious; they include bacterial leaf spot, leaf stripe and leaf streak. Viral diseases are again generally less serious, except for a few diseases such as maize stripe virus, maize mosaic virus, sorghum red stripe virus, and maize streak virus.\nProduction.\nIn 2022, global production of millet was 30.9 million tonnes. India is the top millet producer worldwide, with 11.8 million tonnes grown annually \u2013 some 38% of the world total and nearly triple its nearest rival. Eight of the remaining nine nations in the top 10 producers are in Africa, ranging from Niger (at 3.7 million tonnes) to Chad (0.7 million tonnes); the sole exception is China, number three in global production, at 2.7 million tonnes.\nResearch.\nResearch on millets is carried out by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and ICAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research in Telangana, India, and by the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service at Tifton, Georgia, United States.\nUses.\nAs food.\nPer capita consumption of millets as food varies in different parts of the world, with consumption being the highest in Western Africa. In the Sahel region, millet is estimated to account for about 35 percent of total cereal food consumption in Burkina Faso, Chad and the Gambia. In Mali and Senegal, millets constitute roughly 40 percent of total cereal food consumption per capita, while in Niger and arid Namibia it is over 65 percent (see \"mahangu\"). Other countries in Africa where millets are a significant food source include Ethiopia, Nigeria and Uganda. Millet is also an important food item for the population living in the drier parts of many other countries, especially in eastern and central Africa, and in the northern coastal countries of western Africa. In developing countries outside Africa, millet has local significance as a food in parts of some countries, such as China, India, Burma and North Korea.\nIn Ukraine, millet was historically a common ingredient in the diet of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, in the form of a porridge called kulish. This dish, primarily made with millet, served with stewed vegetables and meat, cooked in a cauldron, remains a part of modern Ukrainian cuisine. In Germany, it is eaten sweet, for example with milk and berries for breakfast. \nIn Russia, millet porridge also remains common and is promoted for its health benefits. Millet porridge made with pumpkin is particularly common. In the Lipetsk Oblast, ritual and daily meals from millet include (). These are millet fritters.\nMillet is the main ingredient in , a Vietnamese sweet snack. It contains a layer of smashed millet and mung bean topped with sliced dried coconut meat wrapped in a crunchy rice cake. In Karnataka, India, finger millet is made into \"ragi rotti\" flatbread and \"ragi mudde\" dough lumps. \nIn parts of Africa, millet is mixed with milk to make a drink called brukina. Dough lumps are eaten as fura in the Sahel region of West Africa.\nPeople affected by gluten-related disorders who need a gluten-free diet, such as coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers, can replace gluten-containing cereals in their diets with millet. There remains a risk of contamination with gluten-containing cereals.\nAlcoholic beverages.\nIn the Himalayas, including in Nepal, Sikkim, and Darjeeling, millet is fermented into tongba, an alcoholic drink.\nIn India, alcoholic beverages including rakshi are produced from millets.\nAs forage.\nMillet is sometimes used as a forage crop, to produce animal feed. Compared to forage sorghum, animals including lambs gain weight faster on millet, and it has better hay or silage potential, although it produces less dry matter. Millet does not contain toxic prussic acid, sometimes found in sorghum. The rapid growth of millet as a grazing crop allows flexibility in its use. Farmers can wait until sufficient late spring / summer moisture is present and then make use of it. It is ideally suited to irrigation where livestock finishing is required.\nNutrition.\nThe table shows the nutrient content of the grains of different species of millet, raw, compared to other staples.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37978", "revid": "47450475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37978", "title": "Totnes", "text": "Town in Devon, England\nTotnes ( or ) is a market town and civil parish at the head of the estuary of the River Dart in Devon, England, within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is about west of Paignton, about west-southwest of Torquay and about east-northeast of Plymouth. It is the administrative centre of the South Hams District Council.\nTotnes has a long recorded history, dating back to 907, when its first castle was built. By the twelfth century it was already an important market town, and its former wealth and importance may be seen from the number of merchants' houses built in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Today, the town has a sizeable alternative and New Age community, known as a place where one can live a bohemian lifestyle, though has in recent times also gained a reputation as being a hotspot for conspiracy theorists within the UK.\nThe 2021 census recorded a population of 9,214, a 14% increase from the 2011 census which gave a population of 8,076.\nHistory.\nTotnes in myth and legend.\nAccording to the written by Geoffrey of Monmouth in around 1136, \"the coast of Totnes\" was where Brutus of Troy, the mythical founder of Britain, first came ashore on the island. Set into the pavement of Fore Street is the Brutus Stone, a small granite boulder onto which, according to local legend, Brutus first stepped from his ship. As he did so, he was supposed to have declaimed:Here I stand and here I rest. And this town shall be called Totnes.\nThe stone is far above the highest tides and the tradition is not likely to be of great antiquity, being first mentioned in John Prince's \"Worthies of Devon\" in 1697. It is possible that the stone was originally the one from which the town crier, or \"bruiter\" called out his news; or it may be \"le Brodestone\", a boundary stone mentioned in several 15th century disputes: its last-known position in 1471 was below the East Gate.\nThe Middle English prose \"Brut\" (c.\u20091419) places the fight between Brutus' general Corineus, and the British giant Gogmagog \"at Totttenes\", while Cornish antiquary Richard Carew suggested that the fight may have begun near the town, but ended at Plymouth Hoe. The \"Historia\" has several other landings at the Totness coast: the Roman general Vespasian, Constantine of Brittany at the port of Totnes, Aurelius Ambrosius and his brother Uther Pendragon attempting to win back the throne of Britain from the usurper Vortigern, the Saxons at war with King Arthur, and in one version Cadwallo fighting against the Mercians. The \"Historia\" also mentions the town in a prophecy of Merlin: \"after [the dragon of Worcester] shall succeed the boar of Totness, and oppress the people with grievous tyranny. Gloucester shall send forth a lion, and shall disturb him in his cruelty, in several battles. He shall trample him under his feet, and terrify him with open jaws.\"\nAncient and medieval history.\nThe first authentic history of Totnes is in AD\u00a0907, when it was fortified by King Edward the Elder as part of the defensive ring of burhs built around Devon, replacing one built a few years earlier at nearby Halwell. The site was chosen because it was on an ancient trackway which forded the river at low tide. Between the reigns of Edgar and William II (959\u20131100) Totnes intermittently minted coins. Some time between the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the compilation of the Domesday Book in 1086, William the Conqueror granted the burh to Juhel of Totnes, who was probably responsible for the first construction of the castle. Juhel did not retain his lordship for long, however, as he was deprived of his lands in 1088 or 1089, for rebelling against William II.\nThe name \"Totnes\" (first recorded in AD\u00a0979) comes from the Old English personal name \"Totta\" and \"ness\" or headland. Before reclamation and development, the low-lying areas around this hill were largely marsh or tidal wetland, giving the hill much more the appearance of a \"ness\" than today.\nBy the 12th century, Totnes was already an important market town, due to its position on one of the main roads of the South West, in conjunction with its easy access to its hinterland and the easy navigation of the River Dart.\nModern history.\nBy 1523, according to a tax assessment, Totnes was the second-richest town in Devon, and the sixteenth richest in England, ahead of Worcester, Gloucester and Lincoln.\nIn 1553, King Edward VI granted Totnes a charter allowing a former Benedictine priory building that had been founded in 1088 to be used as Totnes Guildhall and a school. In 1624, the Guildhall was converted to be a magistrates' court. Soldiers were billeted here during the English Civil War and Oliver Cromwell visited for discussions with the general and parliamentary commander-in-chief Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1646.\nThe population in the 1841 census was 3,849.\nUntil 1887, the Guildhall was also used as the town prison with the addition of prison cells. It remained a magistrates' court until 1974. In 1990, a serious fire broke out on the High Street, resulting in the historic Eastgate structure being destroyed and an estimated \u00a310 million in damage.\nIn 2006 Totnes become the first transition town of the transition initiative.\nPermaculture designer Rob Hopkins developed this idea with his students and later with Naresh Giangrande developed the transition model in his home town of Totnes, which has since featured in many articles and films showing this concept. Totnes has adopted an Energy Descent Plan, as a response in answer to the twin problems of greenhouse gas emissions and peak oil. As a result of a series of public gatherings with experts, and the organisation of a number of special interest groups, the community has come together with lecturers and trainers shared with Schumacher College, through a process of participative strategic planning, to hone their skills in project development. As a result of the initiatives in Totnes, a large number of other communities have started \"Transition Town\" projects, and there are now more than 400 around the world, ranging from small communities to whole cities (e.g. Berlin). Totnes hosts the Sea Change Festival that has been running in the town and neighbouring Dartington since 2016.\nGovernance.\nTotnes' borough charter was granted by King John, probably around 1206; at any rate, the 800th anniversary of the charter was celebrated in 2006, although Totnes lost its borough status in local government reorganisation in 1974. Totnes was served by Totnes electoral borough from 1295 until the Reform Act 1867, but was restored by the Representation of the People Act 1884. The constituency of Totnes was abolished a second time in 1983, and formed part of the South Hams constituency until 1997, when it was restored as the Totnes county constituency: as such it returns one member of parliament (MP) to Parliament.\nIn August 2009, Totnes became the first constituency to select the Conservative's prospective parliamentary candidate through an open primary that was organised by the local Conservative Association. Dr Sarah Wollaston won the Totnes primary in August 2009, and went on to be elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election. In 2019, she moved to Change UK, and then to the Liberal Democrats, for whom she contested Totnes in the 2019 general election, coming second when the seat reverted to the Conservatives. In 2024 after a tactical voting primary the Liberal Democrats won the seat and Caroline Voaden became the MP.\nTotnes has been represented by the Greens on Devon County Council since 2009.\nTotnes has a mayor who is elected by the sixteen town councillors each year. Follaton House, on the outskirts of the town, is the headquarters of the South Hams District Council. The town is twinned with the French town of Vire, after which Vire Island on the River Dart near the \"Plains\" is named. There is also a longstanding local joke that Totnes is twinned with the fantasy land of Narnia.\nGeography.\nThe town is built on a hill rising from the west bank of the River Dart, which separates Totnes from the suburb of Bridgetown. It is at the lowest bridging point of the river which here is tidal and forms a winding estuary down to the sea at Dartmouth. The river continues to be tidal for about above the town, until it meets Totnes Weir, built in the 17th century.\nToday there are two road bridges, a railway bridge and a footbridge over the river in the town. Totnes Bridge is the nearest bridge to the sea and is a road bridge built in 1826\u201328 by Charles Fowler. At low tide the foundations of the previous stone bridge are visible just upstream\u2014it was probably built in the early 13th century and widened in 1692. Before the first stone bridge was built there was almost certainly a wooden bridge here, and a tidal ford for heavy vehicles was just downstream. In 1982 a new concrete bridge was built about upstream as part of the Totnes inner relief road. Its name, Brutus Bridge, was chosen by the local residents. A further upstream, the railway bridge carries the National Rail Exeter to Plymouth line over the river. Immediately upstream of the railway bridge is a footbridge, built in 1993 to provide access to the Totnes (Riverside) terminus of the South Devon Railway.\nEconomy.\nTotnes has attracted a sizeable \"alternative\" community, and the town is known as a place where one can live a \"New Age\" lifestyle. There are a number of facilities for artists, painters and musicians, and there is a twice-weekly market offering antiques, musical instruments, second-hand books, handmade clothing from across the world, and local organically produced products. In 2007, \"Time\" magazine declared Totnes the capital of new age chic. In 2005, \"Highlife\", the British Airways magazine, declared it one of the world's Top 10 Funky Towns.\nIn March 2007 Totnes was the first town in Britain to introduce its own local alternative currency, the Totnes pound, to support the local economy of the town. Fourteen months later, 70 businesses within the town were trading in the \"Totnes Pound,\" accepting them as payment and offering them to shoppers as change from their purchases. The initiative was part of the transition town concept, which was pioneered by Rob Hopkins, who had recently moved to Totnes. The Totnes pound was discontinued in 2019.\nEmphasising the town's continuing history of boatbuilding, between 1998 and 2001 Pete Goss built his revolutionary but ill-fated 120-foot Team Philips catamaran there, which had to be abandoned mid-Atlantic when it started to break up.\nLoss of revenue from Dartington College of Arts, which moved to Falmouth in 2010, was partially offset by increased tourism due to interest in Totnes's status as a transition town.\nLandmarks.\n Totnes is said to have more listed buildings per head than any other town.\nThe Norman motte-and-bailey Totnes Castle, now owned by English Heritage, was built during the reign of William I, probably by Juhel of Totnes. The late medieval church of St Mary with its west tower, visible from afar, is built of rich red Devonian sandstone. A prominent feature of the town is the Eastgate\u2014an arch spanning the middle of the main street. This Elizabethan entrance to the walled town was destroyed in a fire in September 1990, but was rebuilt.\nThe ancient Leechwell, so named because of the supposed medicinal properties of its water, and apparently where lepers once came to wash, still provides fresh water. The Butterwalk is a Tudor covered walkway that was built to protect the dairy products once sold here from the sun and rain. Totnes Elizabethan House Museum is in one of the many authentic Elizabethan merchants' houses in the town, built around 1575.\nTransport.\nThe A38 passes about to the west of Totnes, connected to the town by the A384 from Buckfastleigh and the A385 which continues to Paignton. The town also lies on the A381 between Newton Abbot and Salcombe.\nTotnes railway station is situated on the Exeter-to-Plymouth line, and has trains direct to London Paddington, Plymouth and Penzance, and as far north as Aberdeen.\nNearby, Totnes (Riverside) railway station is at the southern end of the South Devon Railway Trust which runs tourist steam locomotives along the line that follows the River Dart up to Buckfastleigh.\nBus services are provided by Stagecoach South West, Tally Ho Coaches and County Bus. Totnes also has a town minibus service provided by Bob The Bus. Lomax Tours run coach trips from Totnes.\nSince the River Dart is navigable to seagoing boats as far as Totnes, the estuary was used for the import and export of goods from the town until 1995.\nEducation.\nKing Edward VI Community College, more popularly known as KEVICC, is the local secondary school which shares its name with the former grammar school set up by King Edward VI over 450 years ago. At the western edge of the town is the Dartington Hall Estate, which formerly included the Schumacher College and the Dartington College of Arts until their closures in September 2024 and July 2010, respectively. There are also a number of alternative private schools in the Totnes area, providing primary and secondary education.\nMedia.\nLocal TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the nearby Beacon Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter.\nLocal radio stations are BBC Radio Devon on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 100.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Devon on 105.5 FM and Soundart Radio, a community based station which broadcast on 102.5 FM and online through Radioplayer.\nThe \"Totnes Times\" is a local newspaper serving the town and the surrounding South Hams area in Devon. It is owned by Tindle Newspapers. Published weekly, it appears on Thursdays. Its first issue dated 7 April 1860 was under the title of \"The Totnes Weekly Times\". There have been several title changes over the years. In the 1931 edition of Willing's Press Guide it is listed as the \"Totnes Times and Devon News\". A microfiche archive of the newspaper is held at Totnes Archive on the Totnes Museum site.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is controlled by the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional and is contested by 20 teams over a 38-matchday period.\nSince its inception, 62 teams have competed in La Liga, with nine teams crowned champions. Real Madrid and Barcelona have dominated the competition, winning 36 and 28 titles respectively. In the 1940s, Valencia, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs. Real Madrid and Barcelona led the charge in the 1950s, each winning four titles. During the 1960s and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated with fourteen titles, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winning four. During the 1980s and 1990s, Real Madrid remained prominent, while the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad enjoyed success, each winning two titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona have been the most successful club, winning seventeen titles, with Real Madrid close behind. La Liga has seen other champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a.\nAs of the 2024\u201325 season, La Liga is ranked third in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, behind the English Premier League and Italian Serie A. La Liga has led the coefficient rankings for more years than any league, and has also produced the continent's top-rated club more times than any other league overall. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's Player awards (19) and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).\nLa Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally, with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018\u201319 season. This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind fellow Big Five leagues the Premier League and the Bundesliga. La Liga is also the seventh wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, the NHL, and the Bundesliga.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, it was sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and known as \"Liga BBVA\". Then, from 2016 to 2023, it was sponsored by Banco Santander and known as \"LaLiga Santander\". Since 2023, it has been sponsored by Electronic Arts and is known as \"LaLiga EA Sports\".\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 38 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season.\nPromotion and relegation.\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\" and the \"Segunda Divisi\u00f3n\". The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the \"Segunda Divisi\u00f3n\", and the top two teams from the \"Segunda Divisi\u00f3n\" promoted to La Liga, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history;\nTie breaker rules.\nIf points are equal between two or more clubs, the rules are:\nQualification for European competitions.\nCurrent criteria.\nThe top four teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league stage.\nThe fifth place team in La Liga and the winner of the also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League group stage. However, if the winner also finished in the top five places in La Liga, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in La Liga. Furthermore, the sixth place (or seventh if sixth already qualifies due to the ) team qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League play-off round.\nThe number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years. As of the end of the 2023\u201324 season, the ranking of Spain (and de facto La Liga) is second.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nIn April 1928, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Acha, a director at Arenas de Getxo, first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain. After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part, the Real Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de F\u00fatbol eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\" in 1929. Arenas, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Real Uni\u00f3n were all selected as previous winners of the . Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Espanyol and Europa qualified as runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knockout competition. Only three of the founding clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao) have never been relegated from the \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\".\n1930s: Athletic Bilbao dominion.\nAlthough Barcelona won the first \"Liga\" in 1929 and Ricardo Zamora's Real Madrid won their first titles in 1932 and 1933, it was Athletic Bilbao that set the early pace winning La Liga in 1930, 1931, 1934 and 1936 (in addition to four Copa trophies), and they also achieved the biggest win in La Liga history by beating Barcelona 12\u20131; This team, coached by Fred Pentland, is known by the nickname \"First historic squad\", notably forming an attacking partnership with Bata, Guillermo Gorostiza, Jos\u00e9 Iraragorri, Chirri II and Lafuente. In 1935, Real Betis, then known as \"Betis Balompi\u00e9\", won their only title to date. \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\" was suspended during the Spanish Civil War.\nIn 1937, the teams in the Republican area of Spain, with the notable exception of the two Madrid clubs, competed in the Mediterranean League and Barcelona emerged as champions. Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a \"Liga\" title. This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise Levante's Copa de la Espa\u00f1a Libre win as equivalent to trophy. Nevertheless, the governing body of Spanish football has not made an outright decision yet.\n1940s: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia emerge.\nWhen the \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\" resumed after the Spanish Civil War, it was Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n (nowadays \"Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\"), Valencia, and Barcelona that emerged as the strongest clubs. Atl\u00e9tico were only awarded a place during the 1939\u201340 season as a replacement for Real Oviedo, whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in 1941. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atl\u00e9tico team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in 1942, 1944, and 1947. They were also runners-up in 1948 and 1949.\nAthletic Bilbao was one of the clubs most affected by the war, since many of its players (sympathizers of the Republican faction) went into exile in Latin America and very few returned. But thanks to a search for young talents, they managed to form the well-known \"Second historic squad\" made up of Rafael Iriondo, Venancio P\u00e9rez, Jos\u00e9 Luis Panizo, Agust\u00edn Ga\u00ednza and the mythical scorer Telmo Zarra (Spanish top scorer in La Liga history, among other records). They won a La Liga and Copa del General\u00edsimo double in 1943 and won the Cup again in 1944, 1945 and 1950, in addition to an Copa Eva Duarte (official predecessor of the Supercopa). Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of Spain, Barcelona began to emerge as a force under the legendary Josep Samitier. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with Barcelona he scored 133 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five Copa Del Rey. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in 1945. Under Samitier and legendary players C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez, Josep Escol\u00e0, Estanislau Basora and Mariano Gonzalvo, Barcelona dominated La Liga in the late 1940s, winning back to back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949. The 1940s proved to be a successful season for Barcelona, winning three La Liga titles and one Copa Del Rey, but the 1950s proved to be a decade of dominance, not just from Barcelona, but from Real Madrid.\n1950s: FC Barcelona and Real Madrid Dominate.\nAlthough Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, previously known as \"Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n\", were champions in 1950 and 1951 under mastermind Helenio Herrera, the 1950s continued the success FC Barcelona had during the late 1940s.\nDuring this decade, FC Barcelona's first golden era emerged under coach Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk, winning back-to-back La Liga and Copa Del Rey doubles in 1951\u201352 and 1952\u201353. In 1952, FC Barcelona made history yet again by winning five distinctive trophies in one year. This team, composed of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, Mariano Gonzalvo, C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez \u00c1lvarez, and Joan Segarra, won La Liga, Copa Del Rey, Copa Eva Duarte (predecessor of Spanish Super Cup), Latin Cup and Copa Martini &amp; Rossi. Their success in winning five trophies in one year earned them the name 'L\u2019equip de les cinc Copes' or The Team of the Five Cups.\nIn the latter parts of the 1950s, coached by Helenio Herrera and featuring Luis Su\u00e1rez, Barcelona won yet again back-to-back La Liga's, winning them in 1959 and 1960. In 1959, Barcelona also won another double of La Liga / Copa Del Rey, conquering three doubles in the 1950s.\nThe 1950s also saw the beginning of the Real Madrid dominance. During the 1930s through the 1950s there were strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases, clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. During the 1950s, however, these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalised Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s. Di St\u00e9fano, Pusk\u00e1s, Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s. Real Madrid won their third La Liga in 1954 \u2014 their first since 1933 \u2014 and retained their title in 1955. In 1956, Athletic Bilbao won their sixth La Liga title, but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958.\nAll in all, Barcelona and Real Madrid won four La Liga titles each in the 1950s, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winning two and Athletic Bilbao winning one during this decade.\n1960s\u20131970s: Real Madrid superiority.\nReal Madrid dominated La Liga between 1960 and 1980, being crowned champions 14 times. Real Madrid won five La Liga titles in a row from 1961 to 1965 as well as winning three doubles between 1960 and 1980. During the 1960s and 1970s, only Atl\u00e9tico Madrid offered Real Madrid any serious challenge. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were crowned La Liga champions four times in 1966, 1970, 1973, and 1977. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid also finished second place in 1961, 1963, and 1965. In 1971, Valencia won their fourth La Liga title in 1971 under Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, and the Johan Cruyff-inspired Barcelona won their ninth La Liga in 1974.\n1980s: Real Madrid dominate but the Basque Clubs disrupt their monopoly.\nReal Madrid's monopoly in La Liga was interrupted significantly in the 1980s. Although Real Madrid won another five La Liga titles from 1986 to 1990 under the brilliance of Emilio Butrague\u00f1o and Hugo S\u00e1nchez, the Basque clubs of Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao also dominated the 1980s. Real Sociedad won their first La Liga titles in 1981 and 1982; Luis Arconada, Roberto L\u00f3pez Ufarte and Txiki Begiristain stood out from this team. Later, Athletic Bilbao also managed to win two consecutive La Liga titles in 1983 and 1984, also achieving their fifth La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1984; The stars Andoni Zubizarreta, Santi Urkiaga, Andoni Goikoetxea, Dani, Manuel Sarabia and Estanislao Argote made this success possible. For its part, Barcelona won their tenth La Liga title in 1985 under coach Terry Venables, their first La Liga win since 1974.\n1990s: Barcelona's Dream Team.\nJohan Cruyff returned to Barcelona as manager in 1988, and assembled the legendary \"Dream Team\". When Cruyff took control of his Barcelona side, they had won only two La Liga titles in the past 20 years. Cruyff decided to build a team composed of international stars and La Masia graduates in order to restore Barcelona to their former glory days. This team was formed by international stars Romario, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. Cruyff's Dream Team also consisted of La Masia graduates Pep Guardiola, Albert Ferrer and Guillermo Amor, as well as Basque Andoni Zubizarreta.\nJohan Cruyff changed the way modern football was played, and incorporated the principles of Total Football into this team. The success of possession-based football was revolutionary, and Cruyff's team won their first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994. In total, Cruyff won eleven trophies in eight years, making him the most successful manager in Barcelona's history, until the record was broken by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pep Guardiola two decades later.\nBarcelona's run ended with Real Madrid winning La Liga in 1995. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid won their ninth La Liga title in 1996, as well as their only Liga/Copa Del Rey double, before Real Madrid added another league title to their cabinet in 1997. After the success of Cruyff, another Dutchman \u2013 Ajax manager, Louis van Gaal \u2013 arrived at the Camp Nou, and with the talents of Lu\u00eds Figo, Luis Enrique, and Rivaldo, Barcelona won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999, including their fourth double of Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1998. All in all, Barcelona won six La Liga titles in the 1990s.\n2000s: Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia's re-emergence.\nThe 21st century continued the success Barcelona had in the 1990s under Johan Cruyff, dominating La Liga. Although Real Madrid had been prominent, Barcelona created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s\u201370s. Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles. This new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions. Between 1999\u20132000 and 2004, Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a finished in the top three on five occasions, a better record than either Real Madrid or Barcelona, and in 2000, under Javier Irureta, Deportivo became the ninth team to be crowned champions. Valencia were one of the strongest teams in Europe in the early to mid 2000s; they were crowned La Liga champions in 2002 and 2004 under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, whilst also being runners-up in the UEFA Champions League in 2000 and 2001 under Hector Cuper and winning the UEFA Cup in 2004 and the in 1999.\nReal Madrid won their first Liga titles of the century in 2001 and 2003. With world-class players like Ra\u00fal, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Real Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308. Barcelona won their first title of the new millennium after Real Madrid and Valencia had shared the last four titles under the brilliance of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o in the 2004\u201305 season. Barcelona retained the title to make it back-to-back wins in the 2005\u201306 season.\n2010s: Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico.\nIn 2009\u201310, Real Madrid achieved a record 96 points but still finished behind Barcelona, who amassed 99 points. Barcelona then won a third straight La Liga title in the 2010\u201311 season with 96 points to Real's 92, but Real Madrid ended their winning streak in the 2011\u201312 season under the management of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Mesut \u00d6zil and Karim Benzema. Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title with a record 100 points, a record 121 goals scored and a record +89 goal difference. The following year, in the 2012\u201313 season, Barcelona won yet another La Liga title under coach Tito Vilanova, replicating the 100 points record Real Madrid achieved the previous year. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, under the management of Diego Simeone, won their tenth La Liga title in 2013\u201314, their first since 1996. They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominion over the league. In the 2014\u201315 season, under the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez nicknamed 'MSN', Barcelona made history by becoming the first team to achieve a second Treble, and winning a sixth Liga/Copa Del Rey double. Barcelona continued their dominance, and in the 2015\u201316 season they won a back-to-back Liga/Copa Del Rey double, something that had not been achieved since the 1950s. Real Madrid brought back the La Liga title under the management of Zinedine Zidane in 2016\u201317, but Barcelona won the title again in the 2017\u201318 season, as well as winning their eighth double, for seven La Liga titles in ten years. Barcelona retained the title yet again and won their 26th La Liga title in the 2018\u201319 season, for eight La Liga titles in eleven years. Real Madrid reclaimed the title in 2019\u201320, winning the season that was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2020s: present.\nThe 2020\u201321 season started on 12 September, and was won by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, with Real Madrid as runners-up. In August 2021, La Liga clubs approved a \u20ac2.7 billion deal to sell 10% of the league to CVC Capital Partners. The 2021\u201322 season was won by Real Madrid with four games to spare, while the 2022\u201323 season was won by Barcelona with four games to spare.\nIn 2023, La Liga rebranded itself with a new logo and new sponsor. EA (Electronic Arts) replaced the Spanish financial services giant Santander that was the title sponsor of the league for seven years. LaLiga EA Sports and LaLiga Hypermotion are the names of the \"Primera\" and \"Segunda\" Divisions, starting in the 2023\u201324 season and for the following four seasons. Following the flash floods disaster that hit Spain at the end of October, claiming the lives of over 200 people, the Spanish league postponed all matches scheduled to be played in the Valencian region on Thursday. The games played after the floods opened in a moment of silence.\nIn December 2024, La Liga obtained a court order that allowed them to compel internet service providers to block access to IP addresses belonging to Cloudflare within Spain in an effort to block piracy sites that were using Cloudflare's services. In February 2025, the order was implemented, causing access issues to websites and services unrelated to the piracy concerns within Spain. Several football teams such as Valencia and Girona, as well as the streaming platform Movistar Plus+ were affected by the blocks. Cloudflare and cybersecurity group RootedCON filed separate legal actions thereafter to overturn the order, but the Commercial Court No. 6 of Barcelona dismissed the challenges in March, \"stating that no evidence was presented to show that blocking caused any damage.\" Software developers created tools in response to the blocks to ensure the legitimate websites and services could still be accessed during the period when the IP addresses of piracy websites are being blocked in Spain.\nClubs.\n20 teams contest the league in its current season, including the top 17 sides from the 2024\u201325 season and three promoted from the 2024\u201325 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Levante and Elche were promoted directly, and Oviedo won the promotion play-off.\nSeasons in La Liga.\nThere are 63 teams that have taken part in 95 La Liga championships that were played from the 1929 season until the 2025\u201326 season. The teams in bold compete in La Liga currently. The teams in italics represent defunct teams. The year in parentheses represents the most recent year of participation at this level. Athletic Bilbao, Barcelona, and Real Madrid are the only teams that have played La Liga football in every season.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLa Liga clubs in Europe.\nThe \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\" is currently third in the UEFA rankings of European leagues based on their performances in European competitions over a five-year period, behind England's Premier League and Italy's Serie A, but ahead of Germany's Bundesliga and France's Ligue 1.\nReal Madrid, Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have been in the top ten most successful clubs in European football in terms of total European trophies. These three clubs, along with Sevilla and Valencia, are the only Spanish clubs to have won five or more international trophies. Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a are the joint fifth-most participating Spanish team in the Champions League with Sevilla \u2014 after Real Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2014 with five consecutive Champions League appearances, including a semi-finals appearance in 2003\u201304.\nDuring the 2005\u201306 European season, La Liga became the first league to have its clubs win both the Champions League and UEFA Cup since 1997, as Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League and Sevilla won the UEFA Cup. This feat was repeated four times in five seasons: during the 2013\u201314 season Real Madrid won their tenth Champions League title and Sevilla won their third Europa League, during the 2014\u201315 season Barcelona won their fifth Champions League title and Sevilla won their fourth Europa League, during the 2015\u201316 season Real Madrid won their eleventh Champions League title and Sevilla won their fifth Europa League (becoming the first team to win the title three times in a row), and during the 2017\u201318 season Real Madrid won their thirteenth Champions League title and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid won their third Europa League.\nIn 2015, La Liga became the first league to enter five teams in the Champions League group stage, with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Valencia qualifying via their league position and Sevilla qualifying by virtue of their victory in the Europa League, courtesy of a rule change.\nPlayers.\nEligibility of non-EU players.\nIn La Liga in 2020, each club is allowed five non-EU players but are only allowed to name three non-EU players in each matchday squad.\nPlayers can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry, he can claim Spanish citizenship after playing in Spain for five years. Sometimes, this can lead to a triple-citizenship situation; for example, Leo Franco, who was born in Argentina, is of Italian heritage yet can claim a Spanish passport, having played in La Liga for over five years.\nIn addition, players from the ACP countries\u2014countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement\u2014are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.\nIndividual awards.\nUntil the 2008\u201309 season, no official individual awards existed in La Liga. In the 2008\u201309 season, the governing body created the LFP Awards (now called La Liga Awards), awarded each season to individual players and coaches. The majority of these awards were discontinued after the 2015\u201316 season. Additional awards relating to La Liga are distributed, some not sanctioned by the Liga de Futbol Profesional or RFEF and therefore not regarded as official. The most notable of these are four awarded by Spain's largest sports paper, \"Marca\", namely the Pichichi Trophy, awarded to the top scorer of the season; the Ricardo Zamora Trophy, for the goalkeeper with the fewest goals allowed per game (minimum 28 games); the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Trophy, for the player judged to be the best overall player in the division; and the Zarra Trophy, for the top scorer among Spanish domestic players.\nSince the 2013\u201314 season, La Liga has also bestowed the monthly manager of the month and player of the month awards.\nTransfers.\nThe first La Liga player to be involved in a transfer which broke the world record was Luis Su\u00e1rez in 1961, who moved from Barcelona to Inter Milan for \u00a3152,000 (\u00a3\u00a0million in 2023). 12 years later, Johan Cruyff was the first player to join a club in La Liga for a record fee of \u00a3922,000 (\u00a3\u00a0million in 2023), when he moved from Ajax to Barcelona. In 1982, Barcelona again set the record by signing Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors for \u00a35 million (\u00a3\u00a0million in 2023). Real Betis set the world record in 1998 when they signed Den\u00edlson from S\u00e3o Paulo for \u00a321.5 million (\u00a3\u00a0million in 2023).\nFour of the last six world transfer records have been set by Real Madrid, signing Lu\u00eds Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo (plus a deal for Kak\u00e1 days before Ronaldo which fell just below a world record due to the way the fee was calculated) and finally Gareth Bale, who was bought in 2013 for \u00a385.3m (\u20ac103.4m or $140m at the time; \u00a3m in 2023) from Tottenham Hotspur.\nBrazilian forward Neymar was the subject of an when he joined Barcelona from Santos in 2013, and his outgoing transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 set a new world record fee at \u20ac222m via his buyout clause. Barcelona soon invested a large amount of the money received from this transfer in a replacement, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, whose deal \u2013 \u20ac105m \u2013 was the second most expensive ever before Philippe Coutinho's transfer to Barcelona for \u20ac142m in January 2018.\n\"As of 2025[ [update]]\"\nPlayer records.\nMost appearances.\nBoldface indicates a player still active in La Liga. \"Italics\" indicates a player still active outside La Liga.\nMost goals.\nBoldface indicates a player still active in La Liga. \"Italics\" indicates a player still active outside La Liga.\nSponsors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37983", "revid": "48609429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37983", "title": "Typex", "text": "British cipher machine\nTypex (also spelled Type X or TypeX) was the primary cipher machine used by the British military during World War II by and into the early Cold War. Based on the commercial Enigma, it was significantly enhanced to increase its security, providing robust encrypted military and government communications from 1937 throughout the late 1950s. New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries continued to use Typex well until early 1970s.\nDescription.\nLike Enigma, Typex was a rotor machine. Typex came in a number of variations, but all contained five rotors, as opposed to three or four in the Enigma. Like the Enigma, the signal was sent through the rotors twice, using a \"reflector\" at the end of the rotor stack. On a Typex rotor, each electrical contact was doubled to improve reliability.\nOf the five rotors, typically the first two were stationary. These provided additional enciphering without adding complexity to the rotor turning mechanisms. Their purpose was similar to the plugboard in the Enigmas, offering additional randomization that could be easily changed. Unlike Enigma's plugboard, however, the wiring of those two rotors could not be easily changed day-to-day. Plugboards were added to later versions of Typex.\nThe major improvement the Typex had over the standard Enigma was that the rotors in the machine contained multiple notches that would turn the neighbouring rotor. This eliminated an entire class of attacks on the system, whereas Enigma's fixed notches resulted in certain patterns appearing in the cyphertext that could be seen under certain circumstances.\nSome Typex rotors came in two parts, where a \"slug\" containing the wiring was inserted into a metal casing. Different casings contained different numbers of notches around the rim, such as 5, 7 or 9 notches. Each slug could be inserted into a casing in two different ways by turning it over. In use, all the rotors of the machine would use casings with the same number of notches. Normally five slugs were chosen from a set of ten.\nOn some models, operators could achieve a speed of 20 words a minute, and the output ciphertext or plaintext was printed on paper tape. For some portable versions, such as the Mark III, a message was typed with the left hand while the right hand turned a handle.\nSeveral Internet Typex articles say that only Vaseline was used to lubricate Typex machines and that no other lubricant was used. Vaseline was used to lubricate the rotor disc contacts. Without this there was a risk of arcing which would burn the insulation between the contacts. For the rest of the machine two grades of oil (Spindle Oils 1 and 2) were used. Regular cleaning and maintenance was essential. In particular, the letters/figures cam-cluster balata discs had to be kept lubricated.\nHistory and development.\nBy the 1920s, the British Government was seeking a replacement for its book cipher systems, which had been shown to be insecure and which proved to be slow and awkward to use. In 1926, an inter-departmental committee was formed to consider whether they could be replaced with cipher machines. Over a period of several years and at large expense, the committee investigated a number of options but no proposal was decided upon. One suggestion was put forward by Wing Commander Oswyn G. W. G. Lywood to adapt the commercial Enigma by adding a printing unit but the committee decided against pursuing Lywood's proposal.\nIn August 1934, Lywood began work on a machine authorised by the RAF. Lywood worked with J. C. Coulson, Albert P. Lemmon, and Ernest W. Smith at Kidbrooke in Greenwich, with the printing unit provided by Creed &amp; Company. The first prototype was delivered to the Air Ministry on 30 April 1935. In early 1937, around 30 Typex Mark I machines were supplied to the RAF. The machine was initially termed the \"RAF Enigma with Type X attachments\".\nThe Typex Mark II and the more compact Mark III and VI are the most widely described but several distinct Typex models were developed over its operational lifespan.\nThe development of Typex Mark II, the successor to the original Typex cipher machine, began in February 1937. By June 1938, the Typex Mark II was demonstrated to the cipher-machine committee, who approved an order for 350 units. The Mark II was significantly larger than the Enigma, weighing approximately and measuring \u00d7 \u00d7 due to the incorporation of two printers: one for plaintext and one for ciphertext. Following successful trials, After trials, the machine was adopted by the RAF, Army and other government departments. During World War II, a large number of Typex machines were manufactured by the tabulating machine manufacturer Powers-Samas.\nTypex Mark III was a more portable variant, using the same drums as the Mark II machines powered by turning a handle (it was also possible to attach a motor drive). The maximum operating speed is around 60 letters a minute, significantly slower than the 300 achievable with the Mark II.\nTypex Mark VI was another handle-operated variant, measuring \u00d7 \u00d7 , weighing and consisting of over 700 components.\nPlugboards for the reflector were added to the machine from November 1941.\nFor inter-Allied communications during World War II, the Combined Cipher Machine (CCM) was developed, used in the Royal Navy from November 1943. The CCM was implemented by making modifications to Typex and the United States ECM Mark II machine so that they would be compatible.\nTypex Mark VIII was a Mark II fitted with a morse perforator.\nTypex 22 (BID/08/2) and Typex 23 (BID/08/3) were late models, that incorporated plugboards for improved security. Mark 23 was a Mark 22 modified for use with the CCM. In New Zealand, Typex Mark II and Mark III were superseded by Mark 22 and Mark 23 on 1 January 1950. The Royal Air Force used a combination of the Creed Teleprinter and Typex until 1960. This amalgamation allowed a single operator to use punch tape and printouts for both sending and receiving encrypted material.\nTypex machines were modified to have the same inner wirings as the Enigma machine to routinely decipher Enigma messages at Bletchey Park.\nErskine estimates that around 12,000 Typex machines were built by the end of World War II.\nSecurity and use.\nLess than a year into the war, the Germans could read all British military encryption other than Typex, which was used by the British armed forces and by Commonwealth countries including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Royal Navy decided to adopt the RAF Type X Mark II in 1940 after trials; eight stations already had Type X machines. Eventually over 600 machines were required. New Zealand initially got two machines at a cost of \u00a3115 (GBP) each for Auckland and Wellington.\nFrom 1943 the Americans and the British agreed upon a Combined Cipher Machine (CCM). The British Typex and American ECM Mark II could be adapted to become interoperable. While the British showed Typex to the Americans, the Americans never permitted the British to see the ECM, which was a more complex design. Instead, attachments were built for both that allowed them to read messages created on the other.\nIn 1944 the Admiralty decided to supply 2 CCM Mark III machines (the Typex Mark II with adaptors for the American CCM) for each \"major\" war vessel down to and including corvettes but not submarines; RNZN vessels were the \"Achilles\", \"Arabis\" (then out of action), \"Arbutus\", \"Gambia\" and \"Matua\".\nAlthough a British test cryptanalytic attack made considerable progress, the results were not as significant as against the Enigma, due to the increased complexity of the system and the low levels of traffic.\nA Typex machine without rotors was captured by German forces at Dunkirk during the Battle of France and more than one German cryptanalytic section proposed attempting to crack Typex; however, the \"B-Dienst\" codebreaking organisation gave up on it after six weeks, when further time and personnel for such attempts were refused.\nOne German cryptanalyst stated that the Typex was more secure than the Enigma since it had seven rotors, therefore no major effort was made to crack Typex messages as they believed that even the Enigma's messages were unbreakable.\nAlthough the Typex has been attributed as having good security, the historic record is much less clear. There was an ongoing investigation into Typex security that arose out of German POWs in North Africa claiming that Typex traffic was decipherable.\nA brief excerpt from the report\nTOP SECRET U [ZIP/SAC/G.34]\nTHE POSSIBLE EXPLOITATION OF TYPEX BY THE GERMAN SIGINT SERVICES\nThe following is a summary of information so far received on German attempts to break into the British Typex machine, based on P/W interrogations carried out during and subsequent to the war. It is divided into (a) the North African interrogations, (b) information gathered after the end of the war, and (c) an attempt to sum up the evidence for and against the possibility of German successes.\nApart from an unconfirmed report from an agent in France on 19 July 1942 to the effect that the GAF were using two British machines captured at DUNKIRK for passing their own traffic between BERLIN and GOLDAP, our evidence during the war was based on reports that OKH was exploiting Typex material left behind in TOBRUK in 1942.\nTypex machines continued in use long after World War II. The New Zealand military used TypeX machines until the early 1970s, disposing of its last machine in about 1973.\nAdvantages over Enigma.\nAll the versions of the Typex had advantages over the German military versions of the Enigma machine. The German equivalent teleprinter machines in World War II (used by higher-level but not field units) were the Lorenz SZ 40/42 and Siemens and Halske T52 using Fish cyphers.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

National Guard units are under the dual control of U.S. state governments and the U.S. federal government.\nThe majority of National Guard soldiers and airmen hold a civilian job full-time while serving part-time as a National Guard member. These part-time guardsmen are augmented by a full-time cadre of Active Guard &amp; Reserve (AGR) personnel in both the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, plus Army Reserve Technicians in the Army National Guard and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) in the Air National Guard.\nThe National Guard is a joint activity of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) composed of reserve components of the United States Army and the United States Air Force: the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, respectively.\nColonial militias were formed during the British colonization of the Americas from the 17th century onward. The first colony-wide militia was formed by Massachusetts in 1636 by merging small, older local units, and several National Guard units can be traced back to this militia. The various colonial militias became state militias when the United States became independent. The title \"National Guard\" was used in 1824 by some New York State militia units, named after the French National Guard in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette. \"National Guard\" became a standard nationwide militia title in 1903, and has specifically indicated reserve forces under mixed state and federal control since 1933.\nOrigins.\nOn December 13, 1636, the first militia regiments in North America were organized in Massachusetts. Based upon an order of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's General Court, the colony's militia was organized into three permanent regiments to better defend the colony. Today, the descendants of these first regiments - the 181st Infantry, the 182nd Infantry, the 101st Field Artillery, and the 101st Engineer Battalion of the Massachusetts Army National Guard \u2013 share the distinction of being the oldest units in the U.S. military. December 13, 1636, thus marks the beginning of the organized militia, and the birth of the National Guard's oldest organized units is symbolic of the founding of all the state, territory, and District of Columbia militias that collectively make up today's National Guard.\nPrevious to this, unregulated militias were mustered sporadically in Spanish and English colonies. On September 16, 1565, in the newly established Spanish town of St. Augustine, militia were assigned to guard the expedition's supplies while their leader, Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, took the regular troops north to attack the French settlement at Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River. This Spanish militia tradition and the tradition that was established in England's North American colonies provided the basic nucleus for Colonial defense in the New World.\nThe militia tradition continued with the New World's first permanent English settlements. Jamestown Colony (established in 1607) and Plymouth Colony (established in 1620) both had militia forces, which initially consisted of every able-bodied adult male. By the mid-1600s every town had at least one militia company (usually commanded by an officer with the rank of captain), and the militia companies of a county formed a regiment (usually commanded by an officer with the rank of major in the 1600s or a colonel in the 1700s). The first federal laws regulating the militia were the Militia acts of 1792.\nFrom the nation's founding through the early 1900s, the United States maintained only a minimal army and relied on state militias, directly related to the earlier Colonial militias to supply the majority of its troops. As a result of the Spanish\u2013American War, Congress was called upon to reform and regulate state militias' training and qualification.\nU.S. Senator Charles W. F. Dick, a Major General in the Ohio National Guard and the chair of the Committee on the Militia, sponsored the 1903 Dick Act towards the end of the 57th U.S. Congress. Under this legislation, passed January 21, 1903, the organized militia of the states were given federal funding and required to conform to Regular Army organization within five years. The act also required National Guard units to attend twenty four drills and five days annual training a year, and, for the first time, provided for pay for annual training. In return for the increased federal funding which the act made available, militia units were subject to inspection by Regular Army officers, and had to meet certain standards.\nIt required the states to divide their militias into two sections. The law recommended the title \"National Guard\" for the first section, known as the organized militia, and \"Reserve Militia\" for all others.\nDuring World War I, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916, which required the use of the term \"National Guard\" for the state militias and further regulated them. Congress also authorized the states to maintain Home Guards, which were reserve forces outside the National Guards deployed by the federal government.\nIn 1933, with the passage of the National Guard Mobilization Act, Congress finalized the split between the National Guard and the traditional state militias by mandating that all federally funded soldiers take a dual enlistment/commission and thus enter both the state National Guard and the National Guard of the United States, a newly created federal reserve force. The National Defense Act of 1947 created the Air Force as a separate branch of the Armed Forces and concurrently created the Air National Guard of the United States as one of its reserve components, mirroring the Army's structure.\nOrganization.\nTerritorial organization.\nThe National Guard of the several states, territories, and the District of Columbia serves as part of the first line of defense for the United States. The state National Guard is organized into units stationed in each of the 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia, and operates under their respective state or territorial governor, except in the instance of Washington, D.C., where the National Guard operates under the President of the United States or their designee. The governors exercise control through the state adjutants general. Governors may call up the National Guard for active duty to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.\nNational Guard Bureau.\nThe National Guard is administered by the National Guard Bureau, a joint activity of the Army and Air Force under the Department of Defense. The National Guard Bureau provides a communication channel for state National Guards to the DoD. The National Guard Bureau also provides policies and requirements for training and funds for state Army National Guard and state Air National Guard units, the allocation of federal funds to the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, and other administrative responsibilities prescribed under \u00a0https://. The National Guard Bureau is headed by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB), who is a four-star general in the Army or Air Force and is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nThe National Guard Bureau is headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, and is a joint activity of the Department of Defense to conduct all the administrative matters pertaining to the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. The chief is either an Army or an Air Force four-star general officer, and is the senior uniformed National Guard officer, and is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this capacity, he serves as a military adviser to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council and is the Department of Defense's official channel of communication to the Governors and to State Adjutants General on all matters pertaining to the National Guard. He is responsible for ensuring that the more than half a million Army and Air National Guard personnel are accessible, capable, and ready to protect the homeland and to provide combat resources to the Army and the Air Force. He is appointed by the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief.\nConstitutional basis.\nThe respective state National Guards are authorized by the Constitution of the United States. As originally drafted, the Constitution recognized the existing state militias, and gave them vital roles to fill: \"to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasion.\" (Article I, Section 8, Clause 15). The Constitution distinguished \"militias,\" which were state entities, from \"Troops,\" which were unlawful for states to maintain without Congressional approval. (Article I, Section 10, Clause 3). Under current law, the respective state National Guards and the State Defense Forces are authorized by Congress to the states and are referred to as \"troops.\" \u00a0https://.\nAlthough originally state entities, the Constitutional \"Militia of the Several States\" were not entirely independent because they could be federalized. According to Article I, Section 8; Clause 15, the United States Congress is given the power to pass laws for \"calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.\" Congress is also empowered to come up with the guidelines \"for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress\" (clause 16). The President of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the state militias \"when called into the actual Service of the United States.\" (Article II, Section 2).\nThe traditional state militias were redefined and recreated as the \"organized militia\"\u2014the National Guard, via the Militia Act of 1903. They were now subject to an increasing amount of federal control, including having arms and accoutrements supplied by the central government, federal funding, and numerous closer ties to the Regular Army.\nProposed Space National Guard.\nProposals for the establishment of a National Guard component for the United States Space Force has existed for years, even as early as 2018.\nA report by the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the creation of a Space National Guard, as proposed by the National Guard Bureau, would cost an additional $100 million per year in operations and support costs, with a onetime cost of $20 million in the construction of new facilities. This report directly contradicted the statement by the National Guard Bureau that a Space National Guard would only have a onetime cost at creation, and then be cost-neutral.\nThe report also analyzed the cost of the creation of a larger Space National Guard, which would be ~33% of the Space Force, calculating that the annual operating cost would be $385 million to $490 million per year.\nHowever, several states already have existing National Guard space operations, including Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, New York, Arkansas, and Ohio; there is also a space component in the Guam Air National Guard.\nStandards.\nBoth the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are expected to adhere to the same moral and physical standards as their \"full-time\" active duty and \"part-time\" reserve federal counterparts. The same ranks and insignia of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are used by the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, respectively, and National Guard members are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The respective state National Guards also bestow state awards for services rendered both at home and abroad. Under Army and Air Force regulations, these awards may be worn while in state, but not federal, duty status. Regular Army and Army Reserve soldiers are also authorized to accept these awards, but are not authorized to wear them. \nOther organizations.\nState defense forces.\nMany states also maintain their own state defense forces. Although not federal entities like the National Guard of the United States, these forces are components of the state militias like the individual state National Guards.\nThese forces were created by Congress in 1917 as a result of the state National Guards' being deployed and were known as Home Guards. In 1940, with the onset of World War II and as a result of its federalizing the National Guard, Congress amended the National Defense Act of 1916, and authorized the states to maintain \"military forces other than National Guard.\" This law authorized the War Department to train and arm the new military forces that became known as State Guards. In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War and at the urging of the National Guard, Congress reauthorized the separate state military forces for a time period of two years. These state military forces were authorized military training at federal expense, and \"arms, ammunition, clothing, and equipment,\" as deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Army. In 1956, Congress finally revised the law and authorized \"State defense forces\" permanently under Title 32, Section 109, of the United States Code.\nNaval militias.\nAlthough there are no Naval or Marine Corps components of the National Guard of the United States, there is a Naval Militia authorized under federal law, \u00a0https://. Like the soldiers and airmen in the National Guard of the United States, members of the Naval Militia are authorized federal appointments or enlistments at the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy.\u00a0https://. To receive federal funding and equipment, a state naval militia must be composed of at least 95% of Navy, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps Reservists. As such, some states maintain such units. Some states also maintain naval components of their State Defense Force. Recently, Alaska, California, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Texas and Ohio have had or currently maintain naval militias. Other states have laws authorizing them but do not currently have them organized. To receive federal funding, as is the case in the National Guard, a state must meet specific requirements such as having a set percentage of its members in the federal reserves.\u00a0https://.\nDuties and administrative organization.\nNational Guard units can be mobilized for federal active duty to supplement regular armed forces during times of war or national emergency declared by Congress, the President or the Secretary of Defense. They can also be activated for service in their respective states upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state or territory where they serve, or in the case of Washington, D.C., by the Commanding General. Unlike U.S. Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually, except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments (TDY). The types of activation are as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNational Guard active duty character.\nThe term \"activated\" simply means that a unit or individual of the reserve components has been placed on orders. The purpose and authority for that activation determine limitations and duration of the activation. The Army and Air National Guard may be activated in a number of ways as prescribed by public law. Broadly, under federal law, there are two titles in the United States Code under which units and troops may be activated: as federal soldiers or airmen under Title 10 (\"Armed Forces\") and as state soldiers or airmen performing a federally-funded mission under Title 32 (\"National Guard\"). Outside federal activation, the Army and Air National Guard may be activated under state law. This is known as state active duty (SAD).\nState and territory duty.\nWhen National Guard units are not under federal control, the governor is the commander-in-chief of the units of his or her respective state or territory (such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands). The President of the United States commands the District of Columbia National Guard, though this command is routinely delegated to the Commanding General of the DC National Guard. States are free to employ their National Guard forces under state control for state purposes and at state expense as provided in the state's constitution and statutes. In doing so, governors, as commanders-in-chief, can directly access and utilize the Guard's federally assigned aircraft, vehicles and other equipment so long as the federal government is reimbursed for the use of fungible equipment and supplies such as fuel, food stocks, etc. This is the authority under which governors activate and deploy National Guard forces in response to natural disasters. It is also the authority under which governors deploy National Guard forces in response to human-made emergencies such as riots and civil unrest, or terrorist attacks.\nFederal duty.\nTitle 10 service means full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. The term used is \"federalized\". Federalized National Guard forces have been ordered by the President to active duty either in their reserve component status or by calling them into Federal service in their militia status.\nThere are several forms:\nFederalized with the soldier's or airman's consent and the consent of their Governor.\nIn time of national emergency declared by the President for any unit or any member for not more than 24 consecutive months.\nWhen the President determines that it is necessary to augment the active forces for any operational mission for any unit or any member for not more than 270 days.\nWhenever an insurrection occurs in any state against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor call into Federal service such of the militia of the other states. This is a statutory exception to the PCA.\nWhenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, assemblages, or rebellion make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any state or territory, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any state. This is another statutory exception to the PCA.\nThe President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a state, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.\nAir and Army National Guard can specifically be called into Federal service in case of invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute Federal law with active forces.\nIn the categories listed above, Army and Air National Guard units or individuals may also be mobilized for non-combat purposes such as the State Partnership Program, humanitarian missions, counter-drug operations, and peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions. An example of a National Guard being federalized was the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in 1963 where the Alabama National Guard was federalized in order to allow black students to enroll at the University of Alabama.\nHistory.\nColonial history.\nOn December 13, 1636, the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony ordered that the Colony's scattered militia companies be organized into North, South and East Regiments\u2014with the goal of increasing accountability to the colonial government and responsiveness during conflicts with indigenous Pequot Indians. Under this act, white males between the ages of 16 and 60 were obligated to possess arms and to take part in the defense of their communities by serving in nightly guard details and participating in weekly drills. The modern-day 101st Field Artillery Regiment, 182nd Infantry Regiment, 101st Engineer Battalion and 181st Infantry Regiment of the Massachusetts Army National Guard are directly descended from the original colonial regiments formed in 1636.\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nThe Massachusetts militia began the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, The Massachusetts militia units were mobilized either during or shortly after the above battles and used to form, along with units from Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire, the Army of Observation during the Siege of Boston. On July 3, 1775, General George Washington, under the authority of the Continental Congress, assumed command of the Army of Observation and the new organization became the Continental Army from which the United States Army traces its origins.\nThroughout the war, militia units were mobilized when British forces entered their geographic areas and participated in most of the battles fought during the war.\nNineteenth century.\nThe early United States distrusted a standing army - in emulation of a long-standing British distrust - and kept the number of professional soldiers small. During the Northwest Indian War, the majority of soldiers were provided by state militias. There are nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812.\nThe Marquis de Lafayette visited the U.S. in 1824\u201325. The 2nd Battalion, 11th New York Artillery, was one of many militia commands who turned out in welcome. This unit decided to adopt the title \"National Guard,\" in honor of Lafayette's French National Guard. The Battalion, later the 7th Regiment, was prominent in the line of march on the occasion of Lafayette's final passage through New York en route home to France. Taking note of the troops named for his old command, Lafayette alighted from his carriage, walked down the line, clasping each officer by the hand as he passed.\nMilitia units provided 70% of the soldiers that fought in the Mexican\u2013American War, and also provided the majority of soldiers in the early months of the American Civil War The majority of soldiers in the Spanish\u2013American War were from the National Guard.\nIndustrialization and labor unrest.\nLabor unrest in the industrial and mining sections of the Northeast and Midwest led to demands for a stronger military force within the states.\nOn July 14, 1877, workers on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) began to stop trains in Martinsburg, West Virginia in response to wage cuts. This protest developed into the national Great Railroad Strike of 1877. West Virginia governor Henry M. Mathews was the first state commander-in-chief to send in troops to break-up the protests, and this action has been viewed in retrospect as an incident that would transform the National Guard.\nAfter the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, calls for military suppression of labor strikes grew louder, and National Guard units proliferated. In many states, large and elaborate armories, often built to resemble medieval castles, were constructed to house militia units. Businessmen and business associations donated monies for the construction of armories and to supplement funds of the local National Guard units. National Guard officers also came from the middle and upper classes.\nNational Guard troops were deployed to suppress strikers in some of the bloodiest and most significant conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Homestead Strike, the Pullman Strike of 1894, and the Colorado Labor Wars.\nTwentieth century.\nThroughout the 19th century the Regular U.S. Army was small, and the state militias provided the majority of the troops during the Mexican\u2013American War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish\u2013American War. With the Militia Act of 1903, the militia was more organized and the name \"National Guard\" recommended. In 1908, the prohibition on National Guard units serving overseas was dropped. This resulted in constitutional debates within the U.S. government surrounding the legality of the use of the National Guard overseas, culminating in 1912 when U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham declared the 1908 amendment to be unconstitutional. The National Defense Act of 1916 contained a provision whereby the president could discharge National Guard members from the militia and draft them into the Army in the event of a war, allowing for their use overseas. This resulted in former National Guard members being discharged from the Army entirely (also losing their status as state troops) when they left service, so the 1920 amendments to the act defined the National Guard's dual role as a state and federal reserve force; the \"National Guard while in the service of the United States\" as a component of the Army of the United States could be ordered to active duty by the president, be deployed overseas if they so wished, and the Guardsmen would then revert to their status as state troops. The dual state and federal status proved confusing, so in 1933, the National Defense Act of 1916 was amended again. It finally severed the National Guard's traditional connection with the militia clause of the Constitution, providing for a new component called the \"National Guard of the United States\" that was to be a reserve component of the Army of the United States at all times. This is the beginning of the present legal basis of the National Guard. In World War I, National Guard soldiers made up 40 percent of the men in U.S. combat divisions in France. In World War II, the National Guard made up 18 divisions. \nOne hundred forty thousand Guardsmen were mobilized during the Korean War and over 63,000 for Operation Desert Storm. They have also participated in U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Kosovo and for natural disasters, strikes, riots and security for the Olympic Games when they have been in the States.\nFollowing World War II, the National Guard aviation units that had previously been part of the U.S. Army Air Corps and its successor organization, the U.S. Army Air Forces, became the Air National Guard (ANG), one of two reserve components of the newly established United States Air Force.\nDomestic affairs.\nWithin hours of the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of April 1906, the California National Guard maintained order, protected lives and property and distributed relief supplies. Its role was controversial and it was withdrawn after 40 days. Federal troops also were used.\nOn September 24, 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the entire Arkansas National Guard to ensure the safe entry of the Little Rock Nine to Little Rock Central High School the following day. Governor Orval Faubus had previously used members of the guard to deny the students entry to the school.\nThe New York National Guard were ordered by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to respond to the Rochester 1964 race riot in July of that year. The California Army National Guard were mobilized by the Governor of California Edmund Gerald Brown Sr. during the Watts Riots, in August 1965, to provide security and help restore order.\nElements of the Ohio Army National Guard were ordered to Kent State University by Ohio's governor Jim Rhodes to quell anti-Vietnam War protests, culminating in their shooting into a crowd of students on May 4, 1970, killing four and injuring nine. The massacre was followed by the Student strike of 1970.\nDuring the Vietnam War, service in the National Guard was highly sought after, as an enlistment in the Guard generally prevented a person from being sent to combat; only a handful of Guard units were ever deployed to Vietnam. In 1968, the National Guard had only 1.26% black soldiers.\nDuring the Vietnam War, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara created the Selective Reserve Force (SRF) in October 1965. Since funding was not available to train and equip the entire National Guard adequately, the SRF would be a core group of 150,000 National Guardsmen available and ready for immediate overseas deployment if needed. SRF units were supposed to be authorized at 100% strength, receive priority training funds and modern equipment, and have more training and do 58 hours of drills of four hours each a year rather than the standard 48 hours of drills.\nThe 2nd Battalion 138th Field Artillery of the Kentucky Army National Guard was ordered to service in Vietnam in late 1968. The unit served in support of the regular 101st Airborne Division. The Battalion's C Battery lost nine men killed and thirty-two wounded when North Vietnamese troops overran Fire Base Tomahawk on June 19, 1969.\nDuring the early 1980s, the governors of California and Maine refused to allow deployment of their states' National Guard units to Central America. In 1986, Congress passed the Montgomery Amendment, which prohibited state governors from withholding their consent. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled against the governor of Minnesota, who had sued over the deployment of the state's National Guard units to Central America.\nDuring the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, when portions of south central Los Angeles erupted in chaos, overwhelming the Los Angeles Police Department's ability to contain the violence, the California Army National Guard and selected units of the California Air National Guard were mobilized to help restore order. The National Guard were attributed with five shootings of people suspected of violating the curfew order placed on the city.\nDuring the 1993 Waco siege of the Branch Davidians, elements of the Alabama and Texas Army National Guard were called in to assist the ATF and the follow on effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the National Guard's involvement was limited to several specific areas; surveillance and reconnaissance, transport, maintenance and repairs, training and instruction, helicopters, unarmed tactical ground vehicles. The Army National Guard helicopters were also used to do photographic reconnaissance work. Training for ATF agents included such subjects as Close Quarters Combat, and combat medical instruction, and a mock up of the Mount Carmel complex was constructed at Fort Hood, Texas for rehearsals. ATF also received several surplus helmets, flack vests, canteens, first aid dressings, empty magazines, and some night-vision equipment, in addition to MREs and diesel fuel. The FBI would request and receive the use of Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicles, and tank retrieval vehicles, as well as overflights by UH-1 and CH-47 helicopters.\nPost Cold War reductions.\nAs a result of the Bottom Up Review and post-Cold War force cutbacks, the Army National Guard maneuver force was reduced to eight divisions (from ten; the 26th Infantry and 50th Armored were consolidated in the northeastern states) and fifteen 'enhanced brigades,' which were supposed to be ready for combat operations, augmenting the active force, within 90 days.\n2000s.\nNational Guard units played a major role in providing security and assisting recovery efforts in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nIn 2005, National Guard members and reservists were said to constitute a larger percentage of frontline fighting forces than in any war in U.S. history (about 43 percent in Iraq and 55 percent in Afghanistan). There were more than 183,366 National Guard members and reservists on active duty nationwide who left behind about 300,000 dependents, according to U.S. Defense Department statistics. In 2011, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. stated that \"Every Guard brigade has deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, and over 300,000 Guardsmen have deployed in this war.\"\nIn January and February 2007, National Guard troops from 8 states were activated to go help shovel snow, drop hay for starving cattle, deliver food and necessities to stranded people in their houses, and help control traffic and rescue stranded motorists in blizzards dropping feet of snow across the country.\nIn the first quarter of 2007, United States Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates announced changes to the Guard deployment policy aimed at shorter and more predictable deployments for National Guard troops. \"Gates said his goal is for Guard members to serve a one-year deployment no more than every five years... Gates is imposing a one-year limit to the length of deployment for National Guard Soldiers, effective immediately.\" Prior to this time, Guard troops deployed for a standard one-year deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan would serve for 18 or more months including training and transit time. During the transition to the new policy for all troops in the pipeline, deployed or soon to be deployed, some will face deployments faster than every five years. \"The one-to-five year cycle does not include activations for state emergencies.\"\nPrior to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, the National Guard's general policy regarding mobilization was that Guardsmen would be required to serve no more than one year cumulative on active duty (with no more than six months overseas) for each five years of regular drill. Due to strains placed on active duty units following the attacks, the possible mobilization time was increased to 18 months (with no more than one year overseas). Additional strains placed on military units as a result of the invasion of Iraq further increased the amount of time a Guardsman could be mobilized to 24 months. Current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman is involuntarily activated for more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period.\nTraditionally, most National Guard personnel serve \"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\", although personnel in highly operational or high demand units serve far more frequently. Typical examples are pilots, navigators and aircrewmen in active flying assignments, primarily in the Air National Guard, and to a lesser extent in the Army National Guard, and special operations airmen and soldiers in both. A significant number also serve in a full-time capacity in roles such as Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) or Air Reserve Technician or Army Reserve Technician (ART).\nThe \"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\" slogan has lost most of its relevance since the Iraq War, when nearly 28% of total U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan at the end of 2007 consisted of mobilized personnel of the National Guard and other Reserve components. In July 2012, the Army's top general stated his intention to increase the annual drill requirement from two weeks per year to up to seven weeks per year.\nPrior to 2008, the functions of Agricultural Development Teams were within Provincial Reconstruction Teams of the U.S. government. Today, ADTs consist of soldiers and airmen from the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. Today, ADTs bring \"an effective platform for enhanced dialogue, building confidence, sharing interests, and increasing cooperation amongst the disparate peoples and tribes of Afghanistan.\" These teams are not only affiliated with the military, they frequently work across agencies, for example with USAID and the Department of State. ADTs provide education and expertise on the ground, while also providing security and order that is traditionally affiliated with the military. These teams have been essential to the counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan as a public diplomacy tool to build relations with the local people in the tribes and provinces of the country.\nADTs provide classroom instruction and teachings to Afghans about how to improve their farming practices during non-seasonal growing months, which allows the farmers to use skills in the winter to prepare for farming in the summer and fall. This enhances agricultural production and the Afghan economy as a whole. Agricultural education also improves lines of communication and builds trust between the people, the U.S. government, and the Host Nation. Additionally, through word of mouth in the provinces ideas are spread that inform others about these farming techniques, that may not have had direct interaction with the ADTs. The National Guard ADTs also introduce their U.S. civilian colleagues to the Afghan University personnel, which further strengthens relations and trust in the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan.\nADTs also enhance public diplomacy in Afghanistan by providing security to the local provinces they are working within. This tool has provided the teams with the civilian-military partnership that is needed to conduct public diplomacy and defeat the insurgents in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama said that the U.S. will enhance agricultural development instead of big reconstruction projects to build Afghanistan's economy, to have an immediate impact on the Afghan people. Today, these projects include \"...basic gardening practices, to large watershed and irrigation projects. There are also projects that teach bee keeping and livestock production: all of which will have a positive impact on unemployment, hunger, and the ability to sustain future generations.\nMore and more Afghan tribal leaders have been requesting additional ADTs, which illustrates how important the use of public diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people. The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province is one of the most stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan.\nIn 2006, Congress considered giving the president the full authority to mobilize National Guard units within the U.S. without the consent of state governors. However, this was met with resistance from states governors and members of the National Guard. The act was eventually passed, but instead, the president's authority was expanded to mobilize the reserve components for domestic operations without the consent of the governor, only during a natural disaster, terrorist attack, epidemic or other public health emergency. The following year, that authority was repealed.\n2020s.\nIn 2020, the National Guard was activated for 11,000,000 \"man days\" in support of natural disasters, civil unrest, food distribution at food banks, and COVID-19 testing and vaccination. This was the highest number of activation days since World War II.\nIn 2025, 2,000 soldiers of the California National Guard were federalized by President Donald Trump by a presidential memorandum to respond to incidents of violence and civil disorder against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other United States Government personnel who were performing Federal functions in Los Angeles for 60 days. On August 11th, Trump announced the deployment of National Guards to Washington D.C. An additional deployment of National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee was announced on September 15.\nProposals for a Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force consisting of two units of 300 soldiers of the National Guard were reported by \"The Washington Post\" in August 2025. The force would be used to supress civil unrest at short notice.\nRelevant laws.\nConstitutional Basis.\nAlthough the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention the \"National Guard\", it uses the term \"Militia\" to describe a state-based military force.\n Clause 15. The Congress shall have Power * * * To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.\n Clause 16. The Congress shall have Power * * * To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\nThese clauses serve as the constitutional basis for the modern National Guard. The Constitution outlines the federal and state governments' authority over militias in several clauses, including granting Congress the power to call forth, organize, arm, and discipline the Militia. It also designates the President as the Commander in Chief of the state Militias, when they are called into service for the United States.\nThe National Guard was formally established by Congress through later legislation, as described in the following section.\nFederal Legislative Acts.\nThe United States Congress has enacted various laws that control the National Guard:\nNotable members.\nPresidents.\nMilitia service was a common trait among presidents of the United States, 18 of whom have served in colonial or state militias and two have served in the National Guard since it was established in 1903. Among these, three served in colonial militias (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison), 15 served in state militias (James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Chester A. Arthur, William Henry Harrison, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt), one in the Army National Guard (Harry S. Truman) and one (George W. Bush) served in the Air National Guard.\nNumber of guardsmen by state, territory and D.C..\nA member of the National Guard, often called a \"guardsman,\" is a person who has signed an Enlistment Contract and has subscribed to an Enlistment Oath, is still alive, or has not yet been discharged. The subscription to the oath (typically a recitation) and the signature must be witnessed by a person, typically a Guard officer, authorized as an official witness. The term of the enlistment, or membership, runs from the date on the contract through the date on the discharge or the death certificate.\nThe \"number of guardsmen\" is a statistic generated by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), an agency of the DoD tasked with tracking the identities of all persons in the active military, its reserves, and civilians employed by it. Membership in the Guard may be regarded as an independent variable. It changes constantly. Its value at any instant cannot be known exactly. It can, however, be estimated from the records of the DMDC. Its data and reports are for the most part inaccessible to the general public, but it does make available some reports under the category \"DoD Personal, Workforce Reports &amp; Publications.\"\nThe series \"Military and Civilian Personnel by Service/Agency by State/Country (Updated Quarterly),\" containing the statistics on membership in the National Guard by state, territory, and D.C., is updated every 3rd month at the end of the month. For example, one was generated on June 30, 2017. Like all statistics, these numbers of guardsmen are a sample culled according to a certain method. The report states that it uses the sources: \"Active Duty Master File, RCCPDS, APF Civilian Master, CTS Deployment File, Civilian Deployment.\" The probabilities of the statistics being accurate to various percentages are not stated.\nBelow is a sample summary of a profile of National Guard membership as of September 30, 2020. Only the non-total columns come from the source. The totals are calculated from the data.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37992", "revid": "1646408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37992", "title": "Hippocratic Oath", "text": "Oath of ethics taken by physicians\nThe Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the foundational expression of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value. It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.\nText of the oath.\nThe original oath was written in Ancient Greek, between the fifth and third centuries BC. Although it is traditionally attributed to the Greek doctor Hippocrates and it is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus, modern scholars do not regard it as having been written by Hippocrates himself. The oldest manuscript containing the oath dates to roughly the 10th\u201311th century, held in the Vatican Library, although papyrus fragments of the oath have been found as early as the 3rd century AD.\nBelow is the Hippocratic Oath, in Ancient Greek, from the 1923 Loeb edition, followed by the English translation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Translation by W.H.S. Jones\nContext and interpretation.\nThe oath is arguably the best known text of the Hippocratic Corpus, although most modern scholars do not attribute it to Hippocrates himself, estimating it to have been written in the fourth or fifth century BC. Its general ethical principles are also found in other works of the Corpus: the work entitled \"Physician\" mentions the obligation to keep the \"holy things\" of medicine within the medical community (i.e. not to divulge secrets); it also mentions the special position of the doctor with regard to his patients, especially women and girls. In antiquity, the punishment for breaking the Hippocratic oath could range from a penalty to losing the right to practice medicine. However, several aspects of the oath contradict patterns of practice established elsewhere in the Corpus. Most notable is its ban on the use of the knife, even for small procedures such as lithotomy, even though other works in the Corpus provide guidance on performing surgical procedures.\nEuthanasia.\nProviding poisonous drugs would certainly have been viewed as immoral by contemporary physicians if it resulted in murder. However, the absolute ban described in the oath also forbids euthanasia. Several accounts of ancient physicians willingly assisting suicides have survived. Multiple explanations for the prohibition of euthanasia in the oath have been proposed: it is possible that not all physicians swore the oath, or that the oath was seeking to prevent widely held concerns that physicians could be employed as political assassins.\nAbortion.\nThe oath's stance on abortion was unclear even in the ancient world where physicians debated whether the specification of pessaries was a ban on simply pessaries, or a blanket ban on all abortion methods: In the earliest surviving reference to the oath, written in 43 AD, Scribonius Largus was adamant that it precluded abortion. In the 1st or 2nd century AD work \"Gynaecology\", Soranus of Ephesus wrote that one party of medical practitioners followed the Oath and banished all abortifacients, while the other party\u2014to which he belonged\u2014was willing to prescribe abortions, but only for the sake of the mother's health. William Henry Samuel Jones believes that, although the oath prohibited abortions, it may not have been condemned under all circumstances. John M. Riddle argues that because Hippocrates specified pessaries, he only meant pessaries and therefore it was acceptable for a Hippocratic doctor to perform abortions using oral drugs, violent means, a disruption of daily routine or eating habits, and more. Other scholars, most notably Ludwig Edelstein, believe that the author intended to prohibit any and all abortions. It is also possible the ban means forbidding the women specifically from deciding to have an abortion, limiting the right of that decision to the men. Olivia De Brabandere writes that regardless of the author's original intention, the vague and polyvalent nature of the relevant line has allowed both professionals and non-professionals to interpret and use the oath in several ways. While many Christian versions of the Hippocratic Oath, particularly from the Middle Ages, explicitly prohibited abortion, the prohibition is often omitted from many oaths taken in US medical schools today, though it remains controversial.\nReligious themes.\nThe oath stands out among comparable ancient texts on medical ethics and professionalism through its heavily religious tone, a factor which makes attributing its authorship to Hippocrates particularly difficult. Phrases such as \"but I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art\" suggest a deep, almost monastic devotion to the art of medicine. He who keeps to the oath is promised \"reputation among all men for my life and for my art\". This contrasts heavily with Galenic writings on professional ethics, which employ a far more pragmatic approach, where good practice is defined as effective practice, without reference to deities. The oath's importance among the medical community is nonetheless attested by its appearance on the tombstones of physicians, and by the fourth century AD it had come to stand for the medical profession. The oath continued to be in use in the Byzantine Christian world with its references to pagan deities replaced by a Christian preamble.\n\"First do no harm\".\nAlthough it is often said that \"First do no harm\" () is a part of the original Hippocratic oath, no such phrase from which \"First\" or \"Primum\" can be translated appears in the text of the original oath, although a similar intention is vowed by, \"I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm\". Another related phrase is found in Epidemics, Book I, of the Hippocratic school: \"Practice two things in your dealings with disease: either help or do not harm the patient\" and it likely took shape from longstanding popular nonmedical expression.\nModern versions and relevance.\nThe Hippocratic Oath has been eclipsed as a document of professional ethics by more extensive works, the first example in modern times was by Thomas Percival at Manchester Royal Infirmary(UK) who published a code of 'medical ethics' in 1803. This was then adopted by other medical associations such as the American Medical Association's \"Code of Medical Ethics\" (first adopted in 1847), and the British General Medical Council's \"Good Medical Practice\". These documents provide a comprehensive overview of the obligations and professional behaviour of a doctor to their patients and wider society. Doctors who violate these codes may be subjected to disciplinary proceedings, including the loss of their license to practice medicine. Nonetheless, the length of these documents has made their distillations into shorter oaths an attractive proposition. In light of this fact, several updates to the oath have been offered in modern times, some facetious.\nIn 1948, the World Medical Association (WMA) drafted a medical oath, called the Declaration of Geneva. \"During the post World War II and immediately after its foundation, the WMA showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world. The WMA took up the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world's physicians. It noted that in those years the custom of medical schools to administer an oath to its doctors upon graduation or receiving a license to practice medicine had fallen into disuse or become a mere formality\". In Nazi Germany, medical students did not take the Hippocratic Oath, although they knew the ethic of \"nil nocere\"\u2014do no harm.\nIn the 1964, Louis Lasagna, Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University, wrote a modern version of the Hippocratic Oath in which the prayer was omitted, that focused on \"utmost respect for human life from its beginning\", making it a more secular obligation, not to be taken in the presence of any gods, but before only other people. This version is still in use today by many US medical schools:\n I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:\nI will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.\nI will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.\nI will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.\nI will not be ashamed to say \"I know not\", nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.\nI will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.\nI will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.\nI will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.\nI will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.\nIf I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.\nIn a 1989 survey of 126 US medical schools, only three of them reported use of the original oath, while thirty-three used the Declaration of Geneva, sixty-seven used a modified Hippocratic Oath, four used the Oath of Maimonides, one used a covenant, eight used another oath, one used an unknown oath, and two did not use any kind of oath. Seven medical schools did not reply to the survey. As of 1993, only 14% of medical oaths prohibited euthanasia, and only 8% prohibited abortion. In a 2000 survey of US medical schools, all of the then extant medical schools administered some type of professional oath. Among schools of modern medicine, sixty-two of 122 used the Hippocratic Oath, or a modified version of it. The other sixty schools used the original or modified Declaration of Geneva, Oath of Maimonides, or an oath authored by students or faculty or both. As of 2018, all US medical school graduates made some form of public oath but none used the original Hippocratic Oath. A modified form or an oath unique to that school is often used. A review of 18 of these oaths was criticized for their wide variability: \"Consistency would help society see that physicians are members of a profession that's committed to a shared set of essential ethical values.\" All nineteen osteopathic schools in the United States used the Osteopathic Oath, which is taken in place of or in addition to the Hippocratic Oath. The Osteopathic Oath was first used in 1938, and the current version has been in use since 1954.\nThere is no direct punishment for breaking the Hippocratic Oath, although an arguable equivalent in modern times is medical malpractice, which carries a wide range of punishments, from imprisonment to civil penalties. Medical professionals may also be subject to other parts of the criminal and civil law for conduct contrary to both an oath taken and to a more general prohibition on, for example, doing physical or other harm to other persons. In the United States, several major judicial decisions have made reference to the classical Hippocratic Oath, either upholding or dismissing its bounds for medical ethics: \"Roe v. Wade\", \"Washington v. Harper\", \"Compassion in Dying v. State of Washington\" (1996), and \"Thorburn v. Department of Corrections\" (1998).\nIn France, it is common for new medical graduates to sign a written oath.&lt;ref name=\"Letters, BMJ 8/8/1994\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 1995, Sir Joseph Rotblat, in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, suggested a Hippocratic Oath for Scientists.\nIn November 2005, Saparmurat Niyazov, then leader of Turkmenistan, declared that doctors should swear an oath to him instead of the Hippocratic Oath.\nIn 2022, at a college in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, medical students took the Charaka shapath, a Sanskrit oath attributed to ancient sage and physician \"Maharishi Charak\" instead of the Hippocratic oath. The state government subsequently dismissed the Dean of the Madurai medical college for this act. However, he was reinstated by the Tamil Nadu government and assumed office 4 days later.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The bundle, or \"roll of toilet paper\", is specifically known as a toilet roll, loo roll, or bog roll (in Britain).\nThere are other uses for toilet paper, as it is a readily available household product. It can be used for blowing the nose or wiping the eyes (or other uses of facial tissue). It can be used to wipe off sweat or absorb it. Some people may use the paper to absorb the bloody discharge that comes out of the vagina during menstruation. Toilet paper can be used in cleaning (like a less abrasive paper towel). As a teenage prank, \"toilet papering\" is a form of temporary vandalism.\nMost modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in septic tanks, whereas some other bathroom and facial tissues are not. Wet toilet paper rapidly decomposes in the environment. Toilet paper comes in various numbers of plies (layers of thickness), from one- to six-ply, with more back-to-back plies providing greater strength and absorbency. Most modern domestic toilet paper is white, and embossed with a pattern, which increases the surface area of the paper, and thus, its effectiveness at removing waste. Some people have a preference for whether the orientation of the roll on a dispenser should be \"over\" or \"under\".\nThe use of paper for hygiene has been recorded in China in the 6th century AD, with specifically manufactured toilet paper being mass-produced in the 14th century. Modern commercial toilet paper originated in the 19th century, with a patent for roll-based dispensers being made in 1883.\nHistory.\nAlthough paper had been known as a wrapping and padding material in China since the 2nd century BC, a reference to the use of toilet paper dates back as early as c.\u2009589 when the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531\u2013591) wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuring the later Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 AD), an Arab traveller to China in the year 851 AD remarked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuring the early 14th century, it was recorded that in what is now Zhejiang alone, ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper were manufactured annually. During the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644 AD), it was recorded in 1393 that an annual supply of 720,000 sheets of toilet paper (approximately ) were produced for the general use of the imperial court at the capital of Nanjing. From the records of the Imperial Bureau of Supplies of that same year, it was also recorded that for the Hongwu Emperor's imperial family alone, there were 15,000 sheets of special soft-fabric toilet paper made, and each sheet of toilet paper was perfumed.\nElsewhere, wealthy people wiped themselves with wool, lace or hemp, while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers, or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags, wood shavings, leaves, grass, hay, stones, pessoi, sand, moss, water, snow, ferns, plant husks, fruit skins, seashells, or corncobs, depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. In Ancient Rome, a sponge on a stick was commonly used, and, after use, placed back in a pail of vinegar. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b). These are all cited in the classic \"Biblical and Talmudic Medicine\" by the German physician Julius Preuss (Eng. trans. Sanhedrin Press, 1978).\nThe 16th-century French satirical writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, in Chapter XIII of Book 1 of his novel sequence \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\", has his character Gargantua investigate a great number of ways of cleansing oneself after defecating. Gargantua dismisses the use of paper as ineffective, rhyming that: \"Who his foul tail with paper wipes, Shall at his ballocks leave some chips.\" (Sir Thomas Urquhart's 1653 English translation). He concludes that \"the neck of a goose, that is well downed\" provides an optimum cleansing medium.\nThe rise of publishing by the eighteenth century led to the use of newspapers and cheap editions of popular books for cleansing. Lord Chesterfield, in a letter to his son in 1747, told of a man who purchased\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a common edition of Horace, of which he tore off gradually a couple of pages, carried them with him to that necessary place, read them first, and then sent them down as a sacrifice to Cloacina; thus was so much time fairly gained...\nIn many parts of the world, especially where toilet paper or the necessary plumbing for disposal may be unavailable or unaffordable, toilet paper is not used. Also, in many parts of the world people consider using water a much cleaner and more sanitary practice than using paper. Cleansing is then performed with other methods or materials, such as water, for example using a bidet, a lota, rags, sand, leaves (including seaweed), corn cobs, animal furs, sticks or hands; afterwards, hands are washed with water and possibly soap.\nAs a commodity.\nJoseph Gayetty is widely credited with being the inventor of modern commercially available toilet paper in the United States. Gayetty's paper, first introduced in 1857, was available as late as the 1920s. Gayetty's Medicated Paper was sold in packages of flat sheets, watermarked with the inventor's name. Original advertisements for the product used the tagline \"The greatest necessity of the age! Gayetty's medicated paper for the water-closet\".\nSeth Wheeler of Albany, New York, obtained the earliest United States patents for toilet paper and dispensers, the types of which eventually were in common use in that country, in 1883. Toilet paper dispensed from rolls was popularized when the Scott Paper Company began marketing it in 1890.\nThe manufacturing of this product had a long period of refinement, considering that as late as the 1930s, a selling point of the Northern Tissue company was that their toilet paper was \"splinter free\". The widespread adoption of the flush toilet increased the use of toilet paper, as heavier paper was more prone to clogging the trap that prevents sewer gases from escaping through the toilet.\nSofter, two ply toilet roll was introduced in Britain in 1942, by St Andrew Mills in Walthamstow; this became the famous Andrex.\nMoist toilet paper, called wet wipes, was first introduced in the United Kingdom by Andrex in the 1990s. It has been promoted as being a better method of cleaning than dry toilet paper after defecation, and may be useful for women during menstruation. It was promoted as a flushable product but it has been implicated in the creation of fatbergs; by 2016 some municipalities had begun education campaigns advising people not to flush used wet wipes.\nMore than seven billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the United States where an average of 23.6 rolls per capita per year is used.\nIn 1973, Johnny Carson joked in his \"Tonight Show\" monologue about comments made by Wisconsin congressman Harold V. Froehlich about the possibility of a toilet paper shortage. Subsequently, consumers purchased abnormal amounts, causing an actual shortage in the United States for several months.\nToilet paper has been one of the commodities subject to shortages in Venezuela starting in the 2010s; the government seized one toilet paper factory in an effort to resolve the problem.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, toilet paper shortages were reported in March 2020 in multiple countries due to hoarding and panic buying. At first, few believed the pandemic would be serious. Later, people realized they might need to stock up on certain items in case of a shelter-in-place order, or in case they did not know how long such an order would last; suppliers could not assure that they could keep up with demand. However, manufacturers continued to produce even more than they had before. Demand was higher for the types of toilet paper used at home. In some countries the bidet was already seen as a solution, and a survey before the pandemic had indicated an increasing number of Americans would be interested. Amid the panic buying during the pandemic, the Australian toilet paper brand Quilton donated a million of toilet paper rolls to vulnerable Australians who were struggling due to the shortages of toilet paper.\nDescription.\nToilet paper is available in several types of paper, a variety of patterns, decorations, and textures, and it may be moistened or perfumed, although fragrances sometimes cause problems for users who are allergic to perfumes. The average measures of a modern roll of toilet paper is c. 10\u00a0cm (3\u00a0in.) wide, and 12\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in.) in diameter, and weighs between and . An alternative method of packing the sheets uses interleaved sheets in boxes, or in bulk for use in dispensers. \"Hard\" single-ply paper has been used as well as soft multi-ply.\nSheet size.\nThe format of individual sheets of toilet paper, which is given by a perforation line, varies nationally. In Germany, Holland, France, Poland, Switzerland, for example, about postcard size is standard (about 100 \u00d7 140 mm), so about DIN format (DIN A6 105 \u00d7 148 mm). In England, the usual format is already somewhat wider, about 115 \u00d7 135 mm. The most extreme landscape format with 115 \u00d7 102 mm exists in Thailand. The most extreme portrait format (not counting toilet paper rolls without any perforation) is 100 \u00d7 366 mm; a promotional toilet paper from Schmidt Spiele in Germany. Manufactured toilet paper sheet in the United States was sized \u00d7 . Since 1999 the size of a sheet has been shrinking; Kimberly-Clark reduced the length of a sheet to . Scott, in 2006, reduced the length of their product to . The width of sheets was later reduced giving a general sheet size of long and wide. Larger sizes remain available.\nSheet ply.\nThe ply of a toilet paper refers to the number of layers per sheet. Rolls are typically available in single-ply, 2-ply, 3-ply, and 4-ply.\nRoll length.\nPhrases like \"single roll\", \"double roll\", \"triple roll\", \"jumbo roll\", and \"mega roll\" commonly used in retail advertising refer to the number of sheets per roll (though the actual number of sheets is also usually disclosed on packaging). A longer roll needs to be replaced less often, but the very largest sizes do not fit all toilet paper dispensers, especially in older homes.\nMaterials.\nToilet paper is usually manufactured from pulpwood trees, but is also sometimes made from sugar cane byproducts or bamboo.\nToilet paper products vary greatly in the distinguishing technical factors, such as size, weight, roughness, softness, chemical residues, \"finger-breakthrough\" resistance, water-absorption, etc. The larger companies have very detailed, scientific market surveys to determine which marketing sectors require or demand which of the many technical qualities. Modern toilet paper may have a light coating of aloe or lotion or wax worked into the paper to reduce roughness.\nQuality is usually determined by the number of plies (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet paper is typically of the lowest grade of paper, has only one or two plies, is very coarse and sometimes contains small amounts of embedded unbleached/unpulped paper; it was typically called \"hard\" toilet paper. A brand disinfected with carbolic acid was manufactured in Sheffield, United Kingdom under the Izal brand name by Newton Chambers until 1981. Mid-grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness and is somewhat stronger. Premium toilet paper may have lotion and wax and has two to four plies of very finely pulped paper. If it is marketed as \"luxury\", it may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti-bacterial chemicals), or treated with aloe or other perfumes.\nTo advance decomposition of the paper in septic tanks or drainage, the paper used has shorter fibres than facial tissue or writing paper. The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres). Compaction of toilet paper in drain lines, such as in a clog, prevents fibre dispersion and largely halts the breakdown process.\nA German quip says that the toilet paper of Nazi Germany was so rough and scratchy that it was almost unusable, so many people used old issues of the \"V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter\" instead, because the paper was softer.\nColor and design.\nColored toilet paper in colors such as pink, lavender, light blue, light green, purple, green, and light yellow (so that one could choose a color of toilet paper that matched or complemented the color of one's bathroom) was commonly sold in the United States from the 1960s. Up until 2004, Scott was one of the last remaining U.S. manufacturers to still produce toilet paper in beige, blue, and pink. However, the company has since cut production of colored paper altogether.\nColored toilet paper remains commonly available in some European countries. Here in solid color toilet paper base, apart from the natural tones between white and gray or beige, pastel shades prevail: pink, apricot, light yellow and light blue. In rare cases, pale purple or pale green can be found. However, rich colors are rarely used, such as black, wine red, neon green, royal blue. Flat printed toilet paper is uncommon. If there is printing, it is often one color. Common print colors are pink and pinkish red, also blue, more rarely purple, orange, brown or green.\nDesign.\nToday, in the United States, plain unpatterned colored toilet paper has been mostly replaced by patterned toilet paper, normally white, with embossed decorative patterns or designs in various colors and different sizes depending on the brand. The patterns are in most cases \"scatter patterns\", that is, a motif is distributed (\"scattered\") several times (irregularly) over the surface. Stripes and dot patterns are rare. Occasionally, toilet papers have an embossed crocodile, wave, circle or check pattern. Some are additionally printed. Ornaments usually stand on their own as self-contained units. They never go uninterrupted (for example, as a border) from the first to the last sheet.\nMotifs.\nPredominant is everything that is associated \"softness\" and \"fluffiness\". There are decorations with bears, cats, rabbits, down feathers, clouds. Another motifs are things associated with \"lightness\": Clouds, downy feathers, leaves of all kinds, butterflies, flying birds. Another association is anything associated with pleasant fragrance: especially flowers of all kinds. Rare are motifs intended to appear noble, such as the Bourbon lily. Less rare are allusions to water, such as fish, shells and other aquatic creatures.\nToilet papers are also provided with texts (jokes, poems), joke motifs (banknotes, politicians in their own or neighbouring companies) or advertising imprints.\nTexture.\nToilet paper is offered in different qualities. The cheapest toilet papers have a texture close to cr\u00eape paper. They are often made of recycled material. Expensive toilet papers are made from particularly absorbent, delicate tissue paper. Toilet paper usually has a smooth surface. With several intentions, it is occasionally embossed. On the one hand, the embossing can serve to stabilize the paper. Furthermore, wiping can become more effective. Thirdly, there are design reasons. In Switzerland, in particular, there are often toilet paper with burls. In Germany, the number of plies is considered a quality feature. In the USA, Great Britain and Japan, the quality feature is that the toilet paper is as delicate and fine as possible.\nAdditives.\nSome toilet papers are perfumed. Popular scents are chamomile, peach or rose. Other toilet papers are impregnated with antibacterial additives.\nInstallation.\nDispensers.\nA toilet roll holder, also known as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. There are at least seven types of holders:\nSome commercial or institutional toilet paper is wrapped around a cylinder to many times the thickness of a standard toilet paper roll.\nOrientation.\nThere are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a horizontal axle parallel to the wall: the toilet paper may hang \"over\" or \"under\" the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by habit. In surveys of American consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60\u201370% of respondents prefer \"over\". Most Americans think it should go over the top, like a waterfall.\nDecoration.\n\"Toilegami\" refers to toilet paper origami. Like table napkins, some fancy Japanese hotels fold the first squares of toilet paper on its dispenser to be presented in a fashionable way.\nRecreational use.\nIn the United States, toilet paper has been the primary tool in a prank known as \"TP-ing\" (pronounced \"teepeeing\"). TP-ing, or \"toilet papering\", is often favored by adolescents and is the act of throwing rolls of toilet paper over cars, trees, houses and gardens, causing the toilet paper to unfurl and cover the property, creating an inconvenient mess.\nChildren and cats may unroll an entire roll of toilet paper by spinning it until it completely unravels on the floor, or as a game by children wadding up one end, putting it in the toilet bowl without tearing it and then using the flushing of the toilet to pull new paper into the toilet, with the objective of flushing the entire roll down the toilet section at a time without the toilet paper breaking. Special toilet paper insert holders with an oblong shape were invented to prevent continuous unrolling without tearing to discourage this practice.\nToilet paper pranks include talking toilet paper holders and inserts that are activated by the unrolling of the toilet paper and will loudly play an embarrassing message calling attention to the person defecating.\nOther gags include custom toilet paper printed with jokes, stories or politician's images.\nMechanics.\nAlexander Balankin and coauthors have studied the behavior of toilet paper under tensile stress and during wetting and burning.\nToilet paper has been used in physics education to demonstrate the concepts of torque, moment of inertia, and angular momentum; and the conservation of momentum and energy.\nEnvironmental considerations.\nOne tree produces about 800 rolls () of toilet paper and about 83 million rolls are produced per day. Global toilet paper production consumes 27,000 trees daily.\nMore than seven billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the United States alone. Americans use an average of 141 rolls per capita a year which is equivalent to of tissue paper per year. This figure is about 50% more than the average of other Western countries or Japan. The higher use in the United States may be explained by the fact that other countries people use bidets or spray hoses to clean themselves. Millions of trees are harvested in North and South America leaving ecological footprint concerns.\nAs of 2009[ [update]], between 22% and 48% of the toilet paper used in the United States comes from tree farms in the U.S. and South America, with the rest mostly coming from old, second growth forests, and, some from virgin forests.\nAlternatives to virgin wood pulp.\nToilet paper made from recycled paper avoids the direct environmental impact of cutting down trees, and is commercially available. Recycled newspaper can contain BPA, an endocrine disruptor.\nToilet paper produced from bamboo is commercially available, and is in some ways more environmentally friendly than virgin pulpwood, because bamboo grows faster, taking less land and less water. For North American consumers, the Natural Resources Defense Council recommends recycled tree pulp over bamboo toilet paper, because tree forests promote more biodiversity and bamboo products must be shipped from Asia.\nToilet paper produced from bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane, is commercially available, and avoids cutting down any plants because sugarcane is already grown for sugar production.\nThe most eco-friendly alternatives are to rely solely on soap and water for anal hygiene.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It is produced by plants and animals from the amino acid tryptophan.\nNicotinic acid is also a prescription medication. Amounts far in excess of the recommended dietary intake for vitamin functions will lower blood triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and raise blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol). There are two forms: immediate-release and sustained-release nicotinic acid. Initial prescription amounts are 500\u00a0mg/day, increased over time until a therapeutic effect is achieved. Immediate-release doses can be as high as 3,000\u00a0mg/day; sustained-release as high as 2,000\u00a0mg/day. Despite the proven lipid changes, nicotinic acid has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already prescribed a statin drug. A 2010 review had concluded that nicotinic acid was effective as a mono-therapy, but a 2017 review incorporating twice as many trials concluded that prescription nicotinic acid, while affecting lipid levels, did not reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions, nor fatal or non-fatal strokes. Prescription nicotinic acid was shown to cause hepatotoxicity and increase risk of type 2 diabetes. Nicotinic acid prescriptions in the United States had peaked in 2009 at 9.4million, declining to 800thousand by 2020. In 2023, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the US, with more than 500,000 prescriptions.\nNicotinic acid has the formula C6H5NO2 and belongs to the group of the pyridinecarboxylic acids. As the precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, it is involved in DNA repair.\nExtra-terrestrial nicotinic acid has been found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and in sample-returns from the asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition.\nThe term \"niacin\" was originally coined from \"nicotinic acid vitamin\", with the goal of distancing the nutrient B3 from the drug nicotine in tobacco. As a result, it originally referred to the nutritional entity of vitamin B3. However, in American English, the term has also come to mean \"nicotinic acid\" in the context of high-dose use as a prescription medicine. In other varieties of English, the medicine is only ever called \"nicotinic acid\". The term \"nicotinic acid\" unambiguously refers to the substance and the prescription medicine containing it, which treats elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. When used as a drug, daily doses range from 500 to 3,000\u00a0mg/day. High-dose nicotinamide does not have this medicinal effect.\nVitamin B3 has several vitamers that can act in place of each other, including nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. It is precursor of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These compounds are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Vitamin intake recommendations made by several countries are that intakes of 14\u201318\u00a0mg/day are sufficient to meet the needs of healthy adults.\n Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both used for prevention and treatment of pellagra, a disease caused by lack of the vitamin.\nAs a dietary supplement.\nIn the United States, nicotinic acid is sold as a non-prescription dietary supplement with a range of 100 to 1000\u00a0mg per serving. These products often have a Structure/Function health claim allowed by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). An example would be \"Supports a healthy blood lipid profile.\" The American Heart Association strongly advises against the substitution of dietary supplement nicotinic acid for prescription nicotinic acid because of potentially serious side effects, which means that nicotinic acid should only be used under the supervision of a health care professional, and because manufacture of dietary supplement nicotinic acid is not as well-regulated by the FDA as prescription nicotinic acid. More than 30\u00a0mg nicotinic acid consumed as a dietary supplement can cause skin flushing. Face, arms and chest skin turns a reddish color because of vasodilation of small subcutaneous blood vessels, accompanied by sensations of heat, tingling and itching. These signs and symptoms are typically transient, lasting minutes to hours; they are considered unpleasant rather than toxic.\nAs lipid-modifying medication.\nPrescription nicotinic acid, commonly labeled as niacin in the United States, is available in immediate-release and slow-release formulations. It is used to treat primary hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. It is used either as a monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-modifying drugs. Dosages start at 500\u00a0mg/day and are often gradually increased to as high as 3000\u00a0mg/day for immediate release or 2000\u00a0mg/day for slow release (also referred to as sustained release) to achieve the targeted lipid changes (lower LDL-C and triglycerides, and higher HDL-C). Prescriptions in the US peaked in 2009, at 9.4million and had declined to 800thousand by 2020. In 2023, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions.\nSystematic reviews found no effect of prescription nicotinic acid on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions, nor fatal or non-fatal strokes despite raising HDL cholesterol in patients already taking statins. Reported side effects include an increased risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes.\nMechanisms.\nNicotinic acid reduces synthesis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The lipid-therapeutic effects of nicotinic acid are partly mediated through the activation of G protein-coupled receptors, including hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2)and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3 (HCA3), which are highly expressed in body fat. HCA2 and HCA3 inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and thus suppress the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from body fat, reducing their availability to the liver to synthesize the blood-circulating lipids in question. A decrease in free fatty acids also suppresses liver expression of apolipoprotein C3 and PPARg coactivator-1b, thus increasing VLDL-C turnover and reducing its production. Nicotinic acid also directly inhibits the action of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis.\nThe mechanism behind nicotinic acid increasing HDL-C is not totally understood, but seems to occur in various ways. Nicotinic acid increases apolipoprotein A1 levels by inhibiting the breakdown of this protein, which is a component of HDL particles. It also inhibits HDL-C hepatic uptake by suppressing production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. It stimulates the ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, resulting in reverse cholesterol transport.\nCombined with statins.\nExtended release nicotinic acid was combined with lovastatin (Advicor), and with simvastatin (Simcor), as prescription drug combinations. The combination niacin/lovastatin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. The combination niacin/simvastatin was approved by the FDA in 2008. Subsequently, large outcome trials using these nicotinic acid and statin therapies were unable to demonstrate incremental benefit of nicotinic acid beyond statin therapy alone. The FDA withdrew approval of both drugs in 2016. The reason given: \"Based on the collective evidence from several large cardiovascular outcome trials, the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL-cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events.\" The drug company discontinued the drugs.\nContraindications.\nPrescription immediate release (Niacor) and extended release (Niaspan) nicotinic acid are contraindicated for people with either active or a history of liver disease because both, but especially Niaspan, have been associated with instances of serious, on occasion fatal, liver failure. Both products are contraindicated for people with existing peptic ulcer disease, or other bleeding problems because nicotinic acid lowers platelet count and interferes with blood clotting. Both products are also contraindicated for women who are pregnant or expecting to become pregnant because safety during pregnancy has not been evaluated in human trials. These products are contraindicated for women who are lactating because it is known that nicotinic acid is excreted into human milk, but the amount and potential for adverse effects in the nursing infant are not known. Women are advised to either not nurse their child or discontinue the drug. High-dose nicotinic acid has not been tested or approved for use in children under 16 years.\nAdverse effects.\nThe most common adverse effects of medicinal nicotinic acid (500\u20133000\u00a0mg) are flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling) of the face, neck and chest, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration on an empty stomach.\nThe acute adverse effects of high-dose nicotinic acid therapy (1\u20133\u00a0grams per day) \u2013 which is commonly used in the treatment of hyperlipidemias \u2013 can further include hypotension, fatigue, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, heartburn, blurred or impaired vision, and macular edema. With long-term use, the adverse effects of high-dose nicotinic acid therapy (750\u00a0mg per day) also include liver failure (associated with fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite), hepatitis, and acute liver failure; these hepatotoxic effects of nicotinic acid occur more often when extended-release dosage forms are used. The long-term use of nicotinic acid at greater than or equal to 2\u00a0grams per day also significantly increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, diabetes, dyspepsia, and diarrhea.\nFlushing.\nFlushing \u2013 a short-term dilatation of skin arterioles, causing reddish skin color \u2013 usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, although sometimes can persist for weeks. Typically, the face is affected, but the reaction can extend to neck and upper chest. The cause is blood vessel dilation due to elevation in prostaglandin GD2 (PGD2) and serotonin. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not to be involved in the reaction. Flushing is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or itching sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing.\nPrevention of flushing requires altering or blocking the prostaglandin-mediated pathway. Aspirin taken half an hour before the nicotinic acid prevents flushing, as does ibuprofen. Taking nicotinic acid with meals also helps reduce this side effect. Acquired tolerance will also help reduce flushing; after several weeks of a consistent dose, most people no longer experience flushing. Slow- or \"sustained\"-release forms of nicotinic acid have been developed to lessen these side effects. Nicotinamide and inositol nicotinate can be used as no-flush forms of vitamin B3, however the efficacy of the latter is dubious.\nLiver damage.\nNicotinic acid in medicinal doses can cause modest elevations in serum transaminase and unconjugated bilirubin, both biomarkers of liver injury. The increases usually resolve even when drug intake is continued. However, less commonly, the sustained release form of the drug can lead to serious hepatotoxicity, with onset in days to weeks. Early symptoms of serious liver damage include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, followed by jaundice and pruritus. The mechanism is thought to be a direct toxicity of elevated serum niacin. Lowering dose or switching to the immediate release form can resolve symptoms. In rare instances the injury is severe, and progresses to liver failure.\nDiabetes.\nThe high doses of nicotinic acid used to treat hyperlipidemia have been shown to elevate fasting blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes. Long-term nicotinic acid therapy was also associated with an increase in the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes.\nOther adverse effects.\nHigh doses of nicotinic acid can also cause niacin maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina, which leads to blurred vision and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after niacin intake ceases. Niaspan, the slow-release product, has been associated with a reduction in platelet content and a modest increase in prothrombin time.\nPharmacology.\nPharmacodynamics.\nActivating HCA2 has effects other than lowering serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations: antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, improved endothelial function and plaque stability, all of which counter development and progression of atherosclerosis.\nNicotinic acid inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Niacin produces a rise in serum unconjugated bilirubin in normal individuals and in those with Gilbert's Syndrome. However, in the Gilbert's Syndrome, the rise in bilirubin is higher and clearance is delayed longer than in normal people. One test used to aid in diagnosing Gilbert's Syndrome involves intravenous administration of nicotinic acid (niacin) in a dose of 50\u00a0mg over a period of 30 seconds.\nPharmacokinetics.\nBoth nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine. Absorption is facilitated by sodium-dependent diffusion, and at higher intakes, via passive diffusion. Unlike some other vitamins, the percent absorbed does not decrease with increasing dose, so that even at amounts of 3-4 grams, absorption is nearly complete. With a one gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 \u03bcg/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged nicotinic acid or nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes.\nNicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both converted into the coenzyme NAD. NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency. In the liver, nicotinamide is converted to storage nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). As needed, liver NAD is hydrolyzed to nicotinamide and nicotinic acid for transport to tissues, there reconverted to NAD to serve as an enzyme cofactor. Excess nicotinic acid is methylated in the liver to N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) and excreted in urine as such or as the oxidized metabolites N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-Methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (2PY and 4PY). Decreased urinary content of these metabolites is a measure of niacin deficiency.\nProduction.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn addition to absorbing niacin from diet, nicotinic acid can be synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan, a five-step process with the penultimate compound being quinolinic acid (see figure). Some bacteria and plants utilize aspartic acid in a pathway that also goes to quinolinic acid. For humans, the efficiency of conversion is estimated as requiring 60mg of tryptophan to make 1mg of niacin. Riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron are required for the process. Pellagra is a consequence of a corn-dominant diet because the niacin in corn is poorly bioavailable and corn proteins are low in tryptophan compared to wheat and rice proteins.\nIndustrial synthesis.\nNicotinic acid was first synthesized in 1867 by oxidative degradation of nicotine with potassium chromate and sulfuric acid \u2014 this is the origin of the name. Nicotinic acid is prepared by hydrolysis of nicotinonitrile, which, as described above, is generated by oxidation of 3-picoline. Oxidation can be effected by air, but ammoxidation is more efficient. In the latter process, nicotinonitrile is produced by ammoxidation of 3-methylpyridine. Nitrile hydratase is then used to catalyze nicotinonitrile to nicotinamide, which can be sold directly or converted to nicotinic acid. Alternatively, ammonia, acetic acid and paraldehyde are used to make 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine, which is then oxidized to nicotinic acid. New \"greener\" catalysts are being tested using manganese-substituted aluminophosphates that use acetyl peroxyborate as non-corrosive oxidant, avoiding producing nitrogen oxides as do traditional ammoxidations.\nThe demand for commercial production includes for animal feed and for food fortification meant for human consumption. According to \"Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry\", worldwide 31,000 tons of nicotinamide were sold in 2014.\nClimate impact.\nThe production of nicotinic acid creates nitrous oxide as a by-product, which is a potent greenhouse gas. In 2018, it was discovered that a nicotinic acid factory in Visp, Switzerland, was responsible for around one percent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Eventually, catalytic scrubbing technology that eliminates most of the emissions was installed in 2021.\nChemistry.\nThis colorless, water-soluble solid is a derivative of pyridine, with a carboxyl group (COOH) at the 3-position. Other forms of vitamin B3 include the corresponding amide nicotinamide, where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group (CONH2).\nPreparations.\nPrescription products can be immediate release (Niacor, 500\u00a0mg tablets) or extended release (Niaspan, 500 and 1000\u00a0mg tablets). Niaspan has a film coating that delays release of the nicotinic acid, resulting in an absorption over a period of 8\u201312 hours. This reduces vasodilation and flushing side effects, but increases the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release drug.\nPrescription nicotinic acid preparations in combination with statin drugs (discontinued) are described above. A combination of niacin and laropiprant had been approved for use in Europe and marketed as Tredaptive. Laropiprant is a prostaglandin D2 binding drug shown to reduce niacin-induced vasodilation and flushing side effects. A clinical trial showed no additional efficacy of Tredaptive in lowering cholesterol when used together with other statin drugs, but did show an increase in other side effects. The study resulted in the withdrawal of Tredaptive from the international market.\nHistory.\nNiacin as a chemical compound was first described by chemist Hugo Weidel in 1873 in his studies of nicotine, but that predated by many years the concept of food components other than protein, fat and carbohydrates that were essential for life. Vitamin nomenclature was initially alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with niacin as vitamin B3.\nCorn (maize) became a staple food in the southeast United States and in parts of Europe. A disease that was characterized by dermatitis of sunlight-exposed skin was described in Spain in 1735 by Gaspar Casal. He attributed the cause to poor diet. In northern Italy it was named \"pellagra\" from the Lombard language (\"agra\" = holly-like or serum-like; \"pell\" = skin). In time, the disease was more closely linked specifically to corn. In the US, Joseph Goldberger was assigned to study pellagra by the Surgeon General of the United States. His studies confirmed a corn-based diet as the culprit, but he did not identify the root cause.\nNicotinic acid was extracted from liver by biochemist Conrad Elvehjem in 1937. He later identified the active ingredient, referring to it as \"pellagra-preventing factor\" and the \"anti-blacktongue factor.\" It was also referred to as \"vitamin PP\", \"vitamin P-P\" and \"PP-factor\", all derived from the term \"pellagra-preventive factor\". In the late 1930s, studies by Tom Douglas Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper confirmed that nicotinic acid cured pellagra in humans. The prevalence of the disease was greatly reduced as a result. Nicotinic acid was initially synthesized by oxidizing nicotine with potassium chromate and sulfuric acid. Hence, in 1942, when flour enrichment with nicotinic acid began, a headline in the popular press said \"Tobacco in Your Bread.\" In response, the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association approved of the Food and Nutrition Board's new names \"niacin\" and \"niacin amide\" for use primarily by non-scientists. It was thought appropriate to choose a name to dissociate nicotinic acid from nicotine, to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contains nicotine, or that cigarettes contain vitamins. The resulting name \"niacin\" was derived from \"nicotinic acid\" + \"vitamin\".\nCarpenter found in 1951, that niacin in corn is biologically unavailable, and can be released only in very alkaline lime water of pH 11. This explains why a Latin-American culture that used alkali-treated cornmeal to make tortilla was not at risk for niacin deficiency. The modern explanation is that alkali treatment enhances the bioavailability of tryptophan, not directly for any form of the vitamin.\u00a75.2\nIn 1955, Altschul and colleagues described large amounts of nicotinic acid as having a lipid-lowering property. As such, niacin is the oldest known lipid-lowering drug. Lovastatin, the first 'statin' drug, was first marketed in 1987.\nExtra-terrestrial occurrence.\nExtra-terrestrial nicotinic acid has been found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and in sample-returns from the asteroids 162173 Ryugu and 101955 Bennu.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
