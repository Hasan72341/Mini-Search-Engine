The lyrics come from the \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", a poem written by American lawyer Francis Scott Key on September 14, 1814, after he witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort after the battle.\nThe poem was set to the music of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a social club in London. Smith's song, \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" (or \"The Anacreontic Song\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. This setting, renamed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", soon became a popular patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing, in part because the melody sung today is the soprano part. Although the poem has four stanzas, typically only the first is performed with the other three being rarely sung.\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was first recognized for official use by the United States Navy in 1889. On March 3, 1931, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution (46\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://) making the song the official national anthem of the United States, which President Herbert Hoover signed into law. The resolution is now codified at \u00a0https://.\nHistory.\nFrancis Scott Key's lyrics.\nOn August 28, 1814, William Beanes, a physician who resided in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was arrested by British forces in his home after the Burning of Washington and the Raid on Alexandria. A friend of Key's, Beanes was accused of aiding the detention of several British Army stragglers who were ransacking local homesteads in search of food.\nOn September 2, 1814, Key wrote a letter from his home in Georgetown to his mother, ending with:\nI am going in the morning to Baltimore to proceed in a flag-vessel to Genl Ross. Old Dr Beanes of Marlbro' is taken prisoner by the Enemy, who threaten to carry him off \u2013 Some of his friends have urged me to apply for a flag &amp; go &amp; try to procure his release. I hope to return in about 8 or 10 days, though [it] is uncertain, as I do not know where to find the fleet. \u2013 As soon as I get back I hope I shall be able to set out for Fred[ericksburg] \u2013 ...\nUnder sanction from President Madison, on September 3, Key traveled by land from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, where he arrived on the morning of September 4. He located Col. John Stuart Skinner, an American agent for prisoners of war, who leased a sloop-rigged packet ship belonging to John and Benjamin Ferguson, brothers who owned a cargo and passenger service between Baltimore and Norfolk. The ship had a nine-man crew and was captained by a co-owner, John Ferguson. They sailed from Baltimore the next day (September 5) out through the Patapsco River and then south, down the Chesapeake Bay. As recorded in the British ships' logs, on September 6, they had rendezvoused with HMS \"Royal Oak\" and several British troopships near the mouth of the Patuxant. There they learned Beanes was aboard HMS \"Tonnant\" further down in the bay. Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm assigned the frigate \"Hebrus\" to escort the American sloop to Tangier Island, where he thought \"Tonnant\" was located.\nOn September 7, around noon, they spotted \"Tonnant\" near the mouth of the Potomac. The flagship then anchored and brought Key and Skinner aboard.\nIt was aboard \"Tonnant\", after dinner, that Skinner and Key secured the release of Beanes after conversing with Major-General Robert Ross and Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Ross initially refused to release Beanes, but relented after reading letters, brought by Key, written by wounded British prisoners of war praising American doctors for their kind treatment. Because Key and Skinner had overheard details of the plans for the attack on Baltimore, they were prevented from going ashore until after the battle, several days later.\nFrom \"Tonnant\", Key, Skinner, and Beanes were transferred to the frigate HMS \"Surprise\" on the morning of September 8. The fleet then slowly moved up the Chesapeake toward Baltimore. The truce vessel was in tow with \"Surprise\". On September 11, off the North Point peninsula, Colonel Skinner insisted that they be transferred back to their own truce vessel, which they were allowed to do, under guard. It was still tethered to \"Surprise\". Admiral Cochrane then transferred his flag to the shallow-draft \"Surprise\" so he could move in with the bombardment squadron. Having advanced into the Patapsco River, the 16-ship attack force began to fire on Fort McHenry at sunrise on September 13; the bombardment would last 25 hours.\nDuring the rainy day and through the night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the fort's smaller \"storm flag\" () continued to fly, but once the bomb and Congreve rocket barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn. On the morning of September 14, the storm flag had been lowered and the large garrison flag () had been raised.\nDuring the bombardment, HMS \"Erebus\" provided the \"rockets' red glare\", while the heavy-mortar bomb ships HMS \"Terror\", \"Volcano\", \"Devastation\", \"Meteor\" and \"Aetna\" provided the \"bombs bursting in air\". Around 1,500 to 1,800 bomb shells and over 700 rockets were fired at the fort but with minimal casualties and damage being done. Four men died and 24 were wounded in the fort. The ships were forced to fire from their maximum range (with minimal accuracy) to stay out of range of the fort's formidable cannon fire.\nKey was inspired by the U.S. victory and the sight of the large U.S. flag flying triumphantly above the fort. This flag (as well as the storm flag), with 15 stars and 15 stripes, had been made by Mary Young Pickersgill together with other workers in her home on Baltimore's Pratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the Star-Spangled Banner, and is today on display in the National Museum of American History, a treasure of the Smithsonian Institution. It was restored in 1914 by Amelia Fowler, and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.\nAboard the ship that morning, Key began writing his lyrics on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket. Late afternoon on September 16, Key, Skinner and Beanes were released from the fleet and they arrived in Baltimore that evening. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was staying. His finished manuscript was untitled and unsigned. When printed as a broadside, the next day, it was given the title \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". It was first published nationally in \"The Analectic Magazine\".\nMuch of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the wording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of \"The Anacreontic Song\". The song, known as \"When the Warrior Returns\", was written in honor of Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart on their return from the First Barbary War.\nSince the 1990s, the anthem has become controversial due to perceived racism in the anthem's lyrics and Key's active support of slavery. The anthem's third stanza uses the phrase \"the hireling and slave\", which had been interpreted by several commentators to refer to American slaves who escaped to the British military during the war, as Britain offered them freedom and the opportunity to join the Corps of Colonial Marines to fight against U.S. forces. Key was also a slaveholder throughout much of his life. According to \"The Nation\", Key's \"message to the blacks fighting for freedom was unmistakable\u2014we will hunt you down and the search will leave you in terror because, when we find you, your next stop is the gloom of the grave\". The reference to slaves, which was perceived as being racist towards Black Americans, purportedly prevented the song being adopted as the U.S. national anthem for almost a century.\nConversely, University of Michigan professor Mark Clague and Key's biographer has claimed that the poem celebrates the courage of the American soldiers, both black and white, who helped defend the fortress and the city. The controversial phrase, \"the hireling and the slave\", according to Clague, actually refers to British armed forces personnel and their American collaborators regardless of race, who are promised either death on the battlefield or, similarly to United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution, permanent exile once the British Empire is defeated. This interpretation is consistent with what Celticist Michael Newton has written about how, during the American Revolution, \"slavery\" and \"oppression\" were routinely used as Patriot code words for continued \"British rule\" over the United States.\nAlso according to Clague, Francis Scott Key freed four of the seven slaves he inherited and was involved in his later years with the American Colonization Society's practice of buying slaves and setting them free in what is now Liberia. Key's poem, according to Clague, \"in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.\" However, Clague's interpretation of the song has been criticised for going against mainstream academic historical consensus, as the majority of recent scholars who have written about slavery during the War of 1812, such as Gene A. Smith, Marc Leepson and David Roediger have alleged that Key was referencing only American runaway slaves rather than late stage American Loyalists in the passage. In 2016, \"The New Yorker\" argued that \"[is] 'The Star-Spangled Banner' racist? The short answer is yes, insofar as almost every older piece of American iconography cannot be rid of the stain of slavery.\"\nJohn Stafford Smith's music.\nKey gave the poem to his brother-in-law Joseph H. Nicholson who saw that the words fit the popular melody \"The Anacreontic Song\", by English composer John Stafford Smith. This was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously made the first known broadside printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.\nOn September 20, both the \"Baltimore Patriot\" and \"The American\" printed the song, with the note \"Tune: Anacreon in Heaven\". The song quickly became popular; it was ultimately printed in 17 newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire. Soon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title \"The Star Spangled Banner\", although it was originally called \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". Thomas Carr's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from \"The Anacreontic Song\". The song's popularity increased and its first public performance took place in October when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley's tavern. Washington Irving, then editor of the \"Analectic Magazine\" in Philadelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.\nBy the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow Wilson tasked the U.S. Bureau of Education with providing that official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were Walter Damrosch, Will Earhart, Arnold J. Gantvoort, Oscar Sonneck and John Philip Sousa. The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5, 1917, in a program that included Edward Elgar's \"Carillon\" and Gabriel Piern\u00e9's \"The Children's Crusade\". The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch. An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men's votes tallied, measure by measure.\nNational anthem.\nThe song gained popularity throughout the 19th century, and bands played it during public events such as Independence Day celebrations.\nA plaque displayed at Fort Meade, South Dakota, claims that the idea of making \"The Star Spangled Banner\" the national anthem began on their parade ground in 1892. Colonel Caleb Carlton, post commander, established the tradition that the song be played \"at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts.\" Carlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who \"promised me that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia.\" Carlton wrote that after a similar discussion, Secretary of War Daniel S. Lamont issued an order that it \"be played at every Army post every evening at retreat.\"\nIn 1889, the U.S. Navy officially adopted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be played at military and other appropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the seventh-inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series, and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game, though evidence shows that the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" was performed as early as 1897 at Opening Day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898. The tradition of performing the national anthem before every baseball game began in World War II.\nBetween 1918 and 1929, John Charles Linthicum, the U.S. congressman from Maryland at the time, introduced a series of six unsuccessful bills to officially recognize \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem.\nIn 1927, with the thought that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was unsuited for a national anthem, the National Federation of Music Clubs sponsored a composition contest to nominate a national anthem. They selected the text of \"America The Beautiful\"; 901 compositions were submitted for the $1,500 prize (). Frank Damrosch, Frederick Converse, Felix Borowski, and Peter Lutkin judged the compositions but nominated no winner.\nOn November 3, 1929, Robert Ripley drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon, \"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\", saying \"Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem\".\nIn 1930, Veterans of Foreign Wars started a petition for the United States to officially recognize \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem. Five million people signed the petition. The petition was presented to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 31, 1930. On the same day, Elsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the committee to refute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to sing. The committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor for a vote. The House of Representatives passed the bill later that year. The Senate passed the bill on March 3, 1931. President Herbert Hoover signed the bill on March 4, 1931, officially adopting \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem of the United States of America. As currently codified, the United States Code states that \"[t]he composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem.\" Although all four stanzas of the poem officially compose the National Anthem, only the first stanza is generally sung, the other three being much less well known.\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. \"Hail, Columbia\" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", whose melody is identical to \"God Save the King\", the United Kingdom's national anthem, also served as a \"de facto\" national anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S. wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them \"America the Beautiful\", which itself was being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States.\nIn the fourth verse, Key's 1814 published version of the poem is written as, \"And this be our motto-\"In God is our trust!\"\" In 1956 when 'In God We Trust' was under consideration to be adopted as the national motto of the United States by the US Congress, the words of the fourth verse of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" were brought up in arguments supporting adoption of the motto.\nModern history.\nPerformances.\nThe song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide range\u00a0\u2013 a twelfth. Humorist Richard Armour referred to the song's difficulty in his book \"It All Started With Columbus\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProfessional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words, which is one reason the song is sometimes pre-recorded and lip-synced. Pop singer Christina Aguilera performed wrong lyrics to the song prior to Super Bowl XLV, replacing the song's fourth line, \"o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming\", with an alteration of the second line, \"what so proudly we watched at the twilight's last gleaming\". Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer(s) play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it. The pre-recording of the anthem has become standard practice at some ballparks, such as Boston's Fenway Park, according to the SABR publication \"The Fenway Project\".\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has been performed regularly at the beginning of NFL games since the end of WWII by order of NFL commissioner Elmer Layden. The song has also been intermittently performed at baseball games since after WWI. The National Hockey League and Major League Soccer both require venues in both the U.S. and Canada to perform both the Canadian and U.S. national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (with the \"away\" anthem being performed first). It is also usual for both U.S. and Canadian anthems (done in the same way as the NHL and MLS) to be played at Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Raptors respectively, the only Canadian teams in those two major U.S. sports leagues, and in All Star Games in MLB, the NBA, and the NHL. The Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League, which play in a city on the Canada\u2013US border and have a substantial Canadian fan base, play both anthems before all home games regardless of where the visiting team is based. Recently with the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB playing international games outside of the United States and Canada, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has been performed alongside the host country's national anthem.\nTwo especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. On September 12, 2001, Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom, broke with tradition and allowed the Band of the Coldstream Guards to perform the anthem at Buckingham Palace, London, at the ceremonial Changing of the Guard, as a gesture of support for Britain's ally. The following day at a St. Paul's Cathedral memorial service, the Queen joined in the singing of the anthem, an unprecedented occurrence. The Star Spangled Banner was played by the Coldstream Guards again at Windsor Castle on the 20th anniversary of the attacks.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, the anthem was sung by protesters demonstrating outside the U.S. consulate-general in an appeal to the U.S. government to help them with their cause.\n200th anniversary celebrations.\nThe 200th anniversary of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States. A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10\u201316 in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the anthem arranged by John Williams and participation of President Barack Obama on Defenders Day, September 12, 2014, at Fort McHenry. In addition, the anthem bicentennial included a youth music celebration including the presentation of the National Anthem Bicentennial Youth Challenge winning composition written by Noah Altshuler.\nAdaptations.\nThe first popular music performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist Jos\u00e9 Feliciano. He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow, blues-style rendition of the song at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series, between Detroit and St. Louis. This rendition started contemporary \"Star-Spangled Banner\" controversies. The response from many in the Vietnam War-era U.S. was generally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano's performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" heard in the years since. One week after Feliciano's performance, the anthem was in the news again when U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" played at a medal ceremony.\nRock guitarist Jimi Hendrix often included a solo instrumental performance at concerts from 1968 to his death in 1970. Using high gain and distortion amplification effects and the vibrato arm on his guitar, Hendrix was able to simulate the sounds of rockets and bombs at the points when the lyrics are normally heard. One such performance at the Woodstock music festival in 1969 was a highlight of the event's 1970 documentary film, becoming \"part of the sixties Zeitgeist\". When asked about negative reactions to his \"unorthodox\" treatment of the anthem, Hendrix, who served briefly in the U.S. Army, responded \"I'm American so I played it... Unorthodox? I thought it was beautiful, but there you go.\" The Woodstock version by Jimi Hendrix was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2009.\nMarvin Gaye gave a soul-influenced performance at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game and Whitney Houston gave a soulful rendition before Super Bowl XXV in 1991, which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001 (along with Jos\u00e9 Feliciano, the only times the national anthem has been on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100). Roseanne Barr gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. The comedian belted out a screechy rendition of the song, and afterward, she mocked ballplayers by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. The performance offended some, including the sitting U.S. president, George H. W. Bush. Steven Tyler also caused some controversy in 2001 (at the Indianapolis 500, to which he later issued a public apology) and again in 2012 (at the AFC Championship Game) with a cappella renditions of the song with changed lyrics.\nAt Super Bowl XLVIII's pre-game ceremonies in 2014, soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the National Anthem at a football game, and her emotional, groundbreaking performance (one of the most critically acclaimed renditions of all time) led the Fox network to the highest ratings of any program in the company's history and remains so today. In 2016, Aretha Franklin performed a rendition before the nationally-televised Minnesota Vikings-Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Day game lasting more than four minutes and featuring a host of improvisations. It was one of Franklin's last public appearances before her 2018 death. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie gave a controversial performance of the anthem during the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. Critics likened her rendition to a jazzy \"sexed-up\" version of the anthem, which was considered highly inappropriate, with her performance compared to that of Marilyn Monroe's 1962 performance of \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\". Fergie later apologized for her performance of the song, stating that \"I'm a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn't strike the intended tone\".\nIn March 2005, a government-sponsored program, the National Anthem Project, was launched after a Harris Interactive poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem.\nLyrics.\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has four verses, although the second through fourth verses are not commonly performed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlternative lyrics\nIn a version hand-written by Francis Scott Key in 1840, the third line reads: \"Whose bright stars and broad stripes, through the clouds of the fight\".\nFifth stanza\nIn 1861, poet Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. penned an unofficial fifth verse during the beginning of the American Civil War, looking hopefully at the emancipation of slaves.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences in film, television, literature.\nSeveral films, television episodes, and other forms of media have their titles taken from the song's lyrics. These include the \"G.I. Joe\" episode \"\"; the \"Columbo\" episode \"By Dawn's Early Light\"; two films titled \"Dawn's Early Light\" (2000 and 2005); two made-for-TV features titled \"By Dawn's Early Light\" (1990 and 2000); two films titled \"So Proudly We Hail\" (1943 and 1990); a feature film (1977), a short film (2005), and a novel titled \"Twilight's Last Gleaming\"; a film titled \"Rocket's Red Glare\"; and four films titled \"Home of the Brave\" (1949, 1986, 2004, and 2006). A 1936 short film titled \"The Song of a Nation\" from Warner Bros. Pictures shows a version of the origin of the song. The title of Isaac Asimov's 1980 short story \"No Refuge Could Save\" is a reference to the song's third verse; the obscurity of this verse is a major plot point.\nCustoms and federal law.\nWhen the U.S. national anthem was first recognized by law in 1931, there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing. On June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing, while others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem, but not if the flag was not present. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between \"those in uniform\" and \"members of the Armed Forces and veterans\" who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the national anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart.\nSince 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code \u00a0https://) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.\nThe text of \u00a0https:// is suggestive and not regulatory in nature. Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of the law. This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses do not sing the national anthem, though they are taught that standing is an \"ethical decision\" that individual believers must make based on their conscience.\nTranslations.\nAs a result of immigration to the United States by many non-English-speaking peoples, the lyrics of America's national anthem have seen multiple literary translations into immigrant languages. In 1861, very likely to help encourage German-American military service in the Union Army and the United States Navy during the American Civil War, the lyrics were translated into the German language in the United States and widely circulated. The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish-language version from 1919. It has since been translated into Hebrew and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants, Latin American Spanish (with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006), Louisiana French by the Cajun people, Irish, and Scottish Gaelic. The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin.\nWith regard to the indigenous languages of North America and U.S. possessions in Polynesia, there are further translations into Navajo Cherokee, and Samoan.\nProtests.\n1968 Olympics Black Power salute.\nThe 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. After having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200-meter running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Each athlete raised a black-gloved fist, and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, \"Silent Gesture\", Smith stated that the gesture was not a \"Black Power\" salute, but a \"human rights salute\". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games.\nProtests against racism and police brutality (2016\u2013present).\nProtests against police brutality and racism by kneeling on one knee during the national anthem began in the National Football League after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, in response to police brutality in the United States, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed. In particular, protests focus on the discussion of slavery (and mercenaries) in the third verse of the anthem, in which some have interpreted the lyrics as condemning slaves that had joined the British in an effort to earn their freedom. Since Kaepernick's protest, other athletes have joined in the protests. In the 2017 season, after President Donald Trump's condemnation of the kneeling, which included calling for players (whom he reportedly also referred to by various profanities) to be fired, many NFL players responded by protesting during the national anthem that week.\nAfter the murder of George Floyd and killing of Breonna Taylor by police officers, when the 2019-2020 NBA season resumed play in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of players and coaches kneeled during the national anthem through the end of the season. In San Francisco, the statue of Francis Scott Key\u2014the nation's first memorial to the anthem's lyricist Key, a slaveowner\u2014was toppled by protestors on June 19, 2020 and in June 2021 was replaced by 350 black steel sculptures that honor the first 350 Africans kidnapped and forced onto a slave ship headed across the Atlantic from Angola in 1619.\nCalifornia chapter of the NAACP call to remove the national anthem.\nIn November 2017, the California Chapter of the NAACP called on Congress to remove \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem. Alice Huffman, California NAACP president, said: \"It's racist; it doesn't represent our community, it's anti-black.\" The rarely-sung third stanza of the anthem contains the words \"No refuge could save the hireling and slave, from the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave\", which some interpret as racist. The organization was still seeking a representative to sponsor the legislation in Congress at the time of its announcement.\n2025 Canada protests.\nFollowing Donald Trump's tariff announcements on Canada and Mexico as well as his pro-annexation rhetoric in 2025, Canadian crowds booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" when it was played at National Hockey League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and Major League Soccer games or sporting events featuring the U.S. across Canada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Catholic Church regards it as the eleventh ecumenical council.\nBy agreement reached at the Peace of Venice in 1177 the bitter conflict between Alexander III and Emperor Frederick I was brought to an end. When Pope Adrian IV died in 1159, the divided cardinals elected two popes: Roland of Siena, who took the name of Alexander III, and Octavian of Rome who, though nominated by fewer cardinals, was supported by Frederick and assumed the name of Pope Victor IV. Frederick, wishing to remove all that stood in the way of his authority in Italy, declared war upon the Italian states and especially the Church which was enjoying great authority. A serious schism arose out of this conflict, and after Victor IV's death in 1164, two further antipopes were nominated in opposition to Alexander III: Paschal III (1164\u20131168) and Callistus III (1168\u20131178). Eventually, at the Peace of Venice, when Alexander gained victory, he promised Frederick that he would summon an ecumenical council. \nBesides removing the remains of the recent schism, the Council condemned the Cathar heresies and pushed for the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline. It also became the first general Council of the Church to legislate against sodomy. Three sessions were held, on 5, 14, and 19 March, in which 27 canons were promulgated. \nThe most important of these were:\nAmong the many attendees at the Council was William of Tyre, the historian and, at the time, archbishop of Tyre. William was sent by Baldwin IV as the representative of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and wrote about the journey to the Council in his history. The Kingdom of Hungary was represented by Andrew, Archbishop of Kalocsa.\nArchbishop-elect Berthold of Bremen attended, expecting to have his election confirmed although he had not taken major orders. His presence was resented by the other archbishops and the lobbying of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony succeeded in getting his election quashed. His former teacher, Girard la Pucelle, spoke unavailingly in his defence.\nEffects.\nDue to the 26th canon forbidding Christians from dwelling among Jews and Muslims, segregation laws were occasionally enforced by European governments against Jews, creating Jewish quarters. Later in Venice, the term ghetto was born from a segregated Jewish quarter.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the Edge Foundation, where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.\nThe title of the book refers to C. P. Snow's 1959 work \"The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\", which described the conflict between the cultures of the humanities and science.\nContents.\nContributions by twenty-three authors were included in the 1995 book:\nThe book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their \"Feuilleton\" or \"culture\" sections (such as the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\"). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that \"third culture thinking\" is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the English-speaking cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists Heisenberg and Schr\u00f6dinger and the psychologist Piaget, who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for \"third culture.\" The German author Gabor Paal suggested that the idea of the \"third culture\" is a rather modern version of what Hegel called Realphilosophie (\"philosophy of the real\").\nAlso, already during the interwar period, Otto Neurath and other members of the Vienna Circle strongly propagated the need for both the unity of science and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s\u20131940s."}
{"id": "31067", "revid": "47587808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31067", "title": "The Importance of Being Earnest", "text": "Farcical comedy play by Oscar Wilde\nThe Importance of Being Earnest, a Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde, the last of his four drawing-room plays, following \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" (1892), \"A Woman of No Importance\" (1893) and \"An Ideal Husband\" (1895). First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy depicting the tangled affairs of two young men about town who lead double lives to evade unwanted social obligations, both assuming the name Ernest while wooing the two young women of their affections.\nThe play, celebrated for its wit and repartee, parodies contemporary dramatic norms, gently satirises late Victorian manners, and introduces \u2013 in addition to the two pairs of young lovers \u2013 the formidable Lady Bracknell, the fussy governess Miss Prism and the benign and scholarly Canon Chasuble. Contemporary reviews in Britain and overseas praised the play's humour, although some critics had reservations about its lack of social messages.\nThe successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but was followed within weeks by his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, unsuccessfully schemed to throw a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright at the end of the performance. This feud led to a series of legal trials from March to May 1895 which resulted in Wilde's conviction and imprisonment for homosexual acts. Despite the play's early success, Wilde's disgrace caused it to be closed in May after 86\u00a0performances. After his release from prison in 1897 he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no more comic or dramatic works.\nFrom the early 20th century onwards the play has been revived frequently in English-speaking countries and elsewhere. After the first production, which featured George Alexander, Allan Aynesworth and Irene Vanbrugh among others, many actors have been associated with the play, including Mabel Terry-Lewis, John Gielgud, Edith Evans, Margaret Rutherford, Martin Jarvis, Nigel Havers and Judi Dench. The role of the redoubtable Lady Bracknell has sometimes been played by men. \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" has been adapted for radio from the 1920s onwards and for television since the 1930s, filmed for the cinema on three occasions (directed by Anthony Asquith in 1952, Kurt Baker in 1992 and Oliver Parker in 2002) and turned into operas and musicals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSynopsis.\nThe play is set in \"The Present\" (1895 at the time of the premiere).\nAct I.\nAlgernon Moncrieff's flat in Half Moon Street\nAlgernon Moncrieff, a young man about town, is visited by a friend whom he knows by the name of Ernest Worthing. The latter has come from the country to propose to Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax. Algernon refuses to consent until Ernest explains why his cigarette case bears the inscription, \"From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack\". Worthing is forced to admit to living a double life. In the country, he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward, the heiress Cecily Cardew, and goes by the name of John or Jack, while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother in London, named Ernest. Meanwhile, he assumes the identity of the profligate Ernest when in town. Algernon confesses a similar deception: he pretends to have a sickly friend named Bunbury in the country, whom he can \"visit\" whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation. Jack refuses to tell Algernon the location of his country estate.\nGwendolen and her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, now call on Algernon, who distracts Lady Bracknell in another room while Jack proposes to Gwendolen. She accepts but says she could not love him if his name were not Ernest. He resolves secretly to be rechristened. Discovering the two in this intimate exchange, Lady Bracknell interviews Jack as a prospective suitor for her daughter. Horrified to learn that he was adopted \u2013 having been found as a baby in a handbag deposited at Victoria Station in London \u2013 she refuses him and forbids further contact with her daughter. Gwendolen manages to covertly promise to him her undying love. As Jack gives her his address in the country, Algernon surreptitiously notes it on the cuff of his sleeve: Jack's revelation of his pretty young ward has motivated his friend to meet her.\nAct II.\nThe Garden of the Manor House, Woolton\nCecily is studying with her governess, Miss Prism, in the (fictitious) village of Woolton, Hertfordshire. Algernon arrives, pretending to be Ernest Worthing, and soon charms Cecily. Long fascinated by her uncle Jack's hitherto-absent dissolute brother, she is predisposed to fall for Algernon in his role of Ernest. Algernon plans for the rector, Dr\u00a0Chasuble, to rechristen him \"Ernest\". Jack has decided to abandon his double life. He arrives in full mourning and announces his brother's death in Paris, from a severe chill, a story undermined by Algernon's presence in the guise of Ernest. Gwendolen now enters, having left the Bracknells' London house without her mother's knowledge. During the temporary absence of the two men she meets Cecily. They get along well at first, but when they learn of the other's engagement each indignantly declares that she is the one engaged to Ernest. When Jack and Algernon reappear together, Gwendolen and Cecily realise they have been deceived; they leave the men in the garden and withdraw to the house.\nAct III.\nMorning-room at the Manor House, Woolton\nGwendolen and Cecily forgive the men's trickery. Arriving in pursuit of her daughter, Lady Bracknell is astonished to be told that Algernon and Cecily are engaged. The revelation of Cecily's wealth soon dispels Lady Bracknell's initial doubts over the young lady's suitability, but any engagement is forbidden by her guardian, Jack: he will consent only if Lady Bracknell agrees to his own union with Gwendolen \u2013 something she declines to do.\nThe impasse is resolved by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell recognises as the person who, 28 years earlier as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy out in a perambulator from Lord Bracknell's house and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absent-mindedly put into the perambulator the manuscript of a novel she was writing, and put the baby in a handbag, which she later left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the eldest son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, Mrs Moncrieff, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as Gwendolen's suitor.\nGwendolen continues to insist that she can love only a man named Ernest. Lady Bracknell tells Jack that, as the firstborn, he would have been named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack examines the Army Lists and discovers that his father's name \u2013 and hence his own original christening name \u2013 was, in fact, Ernest. As the happy couples embrace \u2013 Ernest and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism \u2013 Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: \"My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality\". He replies, \"On the contrary, Aunt Augusta: I've now realized for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest\".\nComposition.\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" followed the success of Wilde's earlier drawing room plays, \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" (1892), \"A Woman of No Importance\" (1893) and \"An Ideal Husband\" (1895). He spent the summer of 1894 with his family at Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where he began work on the new play.\nWilde scholars generally agree that the most important influence on the play was W. S. Gilbert's 1877 farce \"Engaged\", from which Wilde borrowed not only several incidents but also, in the words of Russell Jackson in his 1980 introduction to Wilde's play, \"the gravity of tone demanded by Gilbert of his actors\". Wilde's first draft was so long that it filled four exercise books, and over the summer he continually revised and refined it, as he had done with his earlier plays. Among his many changes he altered the subtitle from \"a Serious Comedy for Trivial People\" to \"a Trivial Comedy for Serious People\", and renamed the characters Lady Brancaster and Algernon Montford as Lady Bracknell and Algernon Moncrieff.\nWilde wrote the part of John Worthing with the actor-manager Charles Wyndham in mind. Wilde shared Bernard Shaw's view that Wyndham was the ideal comedy actor and based the character on his stage persona. Wyndham accepted the play for production at his theatre, but before rehearsals began, he changed his plans in order to help a beleaguered colleague, the actor-manager George Alexander of the St James's Theatre. In early 1895 Alexander's production of Henry James's \"Guy Domville\" failed, and closed after 31 performances, leaving Alexander in urgent need of a new play to follow it. Wyndham waived his contractual rights and allowed Alexander to stage Wilde's play.\nAfter working with Wilde on stage movements, using a model theatre, Alexander asked the author to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde complied and combined elements of the second and third acts. The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr\u00a0Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to serve a writ on the profligate \"Ernest\" Worthing for unpaid dining bills at the Savoy Hotel. Wilde was not entirely happy with alterations made at Alexander's behest. He said, \"Yes, it is quite a good play. I remember I wrote one very like it myself, but it was even more brilliant than this\", but the three-act version usually performed is widely considered more effective than Wilde's four-act original.\nFirst productions.\nThe play was first produced at the St James's Theatre, London, on 14 February \u2013 Valentine's Day \u2013 1895, preceded by a curtain-raiser, a short comedy called \"In the Season\", by Langdon E. Mitchell. During most of the month-long rehearsal period Wilde was on holiday in Algeria with his gay partner, Lord Alfred Douglas, but he returned in time for the dress rehearsal on 12 February. Douglas remained in Algiers; his father, the Marquess of Queensberry, planned to disrupt the premiere by throwing a bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end. Wilde learned of the plan and Alexander cancelled Queensberry's ticket and arranged for the police to bar his entrance. Wilde wrote to Douglas, \"He arrived with a prize fighter!! I had all Scotland Yard to guard the theatre. He prowled around for three hours, then left chattering like a monstrous ape\". Queensberry left the bouquet at the theatre entrance.\nWilde arrived for the premiere dressed in \"florid sobriety\", wearing a green carnation in his lapel. Allan Aynesworth, who played Algernon Moncrieff, recalled to Hesketh Pearson:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than the first night of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" ... The audience rose in their seats and cheered and cheered again.\nThe theatrical newspaper \"The Era\" reported that the play \"met with enthusiastic and unanimous approval\" and confidently predicted \"a long and prosperous run\". Aynesworth was \"debonair and stylish\", and Alexander, who played Jack Worthing, \"demure\"; according to \"The Era\", \"Mr George Alexander played Worthing just as a part of this sort should be played, i.e., with entire seriousness and no indication of purposed irony\". \"The Morning Post\" said that Irene Vanbrugh and Evelyn Millard could not be bettered and caught the required Gilbertian tone. \"The Observer\" remarked on the \"rapturous amusement\" of the audience, and echoed \"The Era\"'s prediction of a long run.\nAccording to the published text, the characters, descriptions and cast comprised:\nQueensberry continued harassing Wilde, who within weeks launched a private prosecution against him for criminal libel, triggering a series of trials that revealed Wilde's homosexual private life and ended in his imprisonment for gross indecency in May 1895. The Victorian public turned against him after his arrest, and box-office receipts dwindled rapidly; Alexander tried to save the production by removing the author's name from the playbills, but it closed on 8 May after only 83 performances.\nThe play's original Broadway production opened at the Empire Theatre on 22 April 1895 but closed after sixteen performances. Its cast included William Faversham as Algernon, Henry Miller as Jack, Viola Allen as Gwendolen and Ida Vernon as Lady Bracknell. The Australian premiere was in Melbourne on 10 August 1895, presented by Robert Brough and Dion Boucicault Jr., with Cecil Ward as Jack, Boucicault as Algernon and Jenny Watt-Tanner as Lady Bracknell. The production was an immediate success. Wilde's downfall in England did not affect the popularity of his plays in Australia. The same company presented the New Zealand premiere in October 1895, when the play was enthusiastically received. Reviewers said, \"in subtlety of thought, brilliancy of wit and sparkling humour, it has scarcely been excelled\"; and \"its fun is irresistible ... increasing in intensity until in the third and last act it becomes uproarious\".\nCritical opinion.\nIn contrast with much theatre of the time, the light plot of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" does not address serious social and political issues, and this troubled some contemporary reviewers. Though unsure of Wilde's seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play's cleverness, humour and popularity. Shaw found the play \"extremely funny\" but \"heartless\", a view he maintained all his life. His review in the \"Saturday Review\" argued that comedy should touch as well as amuse: \"I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter, not to be tickled or bustled into it\".\nIn \"The World\", William Archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning: \"What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?\" In \"The Speaker\", A.\u00a0B.\u00a0Walkley admired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied that the term \"farce\" was derogatory or even lacking in seriousness and said, \"It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen\".\nH.\u00a0G.\u00a0Wells, in an unsigned review for \"The Pall Mall Gazette\", called the play one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying, \"More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine\". He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, \"... how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously\". The play was so light-hearted that some reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. W. H. Auden later (1963) called it \"a pure verbal opera\", and \"The Times\" commented, \"The story is almost too preposterous to go without music\". Mary McCarthy, in \"Sights and Spectacles\" (1959), despite thinking the play extremely funny, called it \"a ferocious idyll\"; \"depravity is the hero and the only character\".\nAs Wilde's works came to be read and performed again in the early 20th century, it was \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" that received the most productions. The critic and author Max Beerbohm called the play Wilde's \"finest, most undeniably his own\", saying that the plots of his other comedies \u2013 \"Lady Windermere's Fan\", \"A Woman of No Importance\" and \"An Ideal Husband\" \u2013 follow the manner of Victorien Sardou, and are similarly unrelated to the theme of the work, while in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" the story is \"dissolved\" into the form of the play. By the time of its centenary in 1995 the journalist Mark Lawson described the piece as \"the second most known and quoted play in English after \"Hamlet\"\".\nRevivals.\n1895\u20131929.\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" and Wilde's three other drawing room plays were performed in Britain during the author's imprisonment and exile by small touring groups. A. B. Tapping's company toured \"The Importance\" between October 1895 and March 1896, and Elsie Lanham's touring company presented it along with \"Lady Windermere's Fan\", beginning in November 1899. The play was well received; one local critic described it as \"sparkling with wit and epigrams\", and another called it \"a most entertaining comedy [with] some sparkling dialogue\".\nThe play was not seen again in London until after Wilde's death in 1900. Alexander revived it in the small Coronet theatre in Notting Hill, outside the West End, in December the following year, after taking it on tour, starring as John Worthing, with a cast that included the young Lilian Braithwaite as Cecily. \"The Manchester Guardian\" called the piece \"a brilliant play\". \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" returned to the West End when Alexander presented a revival at the St James's in 1902. It was billed as \"By the author of \"Lady Windermere's Fan\"\", and few reviews mentioned Wilde's name, but his work was praised. \"The Sporting Times\" said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The trivial comedy revived at the St James's is as witty an evening's entertainment as any worldling could desire. It is all as light as a good souffl\u00e9. The ladies talk like Mr W. S. Gilbert's fairies do, and are supernaturally clever; the men emit sparkles of wit even when their mouths are full of cucumber sandwiches or crumpets ... I can guarantee that the most blas\u00e9 young man of twenty-two will have one chuckle a minute at the St James's. You are tickled throughout with a feather, and it is a very pleasant and comforting sensation.\nThe revival ran for 52 performances. For the first Broadway revival, by Charles Frohman's Empire Stock Company later in 1902, the playbills and the reviews restored the author's name.\nAlexander presented the work again at the St James's in 1909, when he and Aynesworth reprised their original roles; that revival ran for 316 performances. Max Beerbohm said that the play was sure to become a classic of the English repertory and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written, adding that the actors had \"worn as well as the play\".\nThe play was revived on Broadway in 1910 with a cast that included Hamilton Revelle, A. E. Matthews and Jane Oaker. \"The New York Times\" commented that the play \"has lost nothing of its humor ... no one with a sense of humor can afford to miss it\". For a 1913 revival at the St James's, the young actors Gerald Ames and A. E. Matthews succeeded the creators as Jack and Algernon.\nLeslie Faber as Jack, John Deverell as Algernon and Margaret Scudamore as Lady Bracknell headed the cast in a 1923 production at the Haymarket Theatre. Revivals in the first decades of the 20th century treated \"the present\" as the current year. It was not until the 1920s that the case for 1890s costumes was established; as a critic in \"The Manchester Guardian\" put it, \"Thirty years on, one begins to feel that Wilde should be done in the costume of his period \u2013 that his wit today needs the backing of the atmosphere that gave it life and truth. ... Wilde's glittering and complex verbal felicities go ill with the shingle and the short skirt\".\n1930\u20132000.\nIn Nigel Playfair's 1930 production at the Lyric, Hammersmith, John Gielgud played Jack to the Lady Bracknell of his aunt, Mabel Terry-Lewis. An Old Vic production in 1934 featured the husband-and-wife team of Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester as Chasuble and Miss Prism; others in the cast were Roger Livesey (Jack), George Curzon (Algernon), Athene Seyler (Lady Bracknell), Flora Robson (Gwendolen) and Ursula Jeans (Cecily). On Broadway, Estelle Winwood co-starred with Clifton Webb and Hope Williams in a 1939 revival.\nGielgud produced and starred in a production at the Globe (now the Gielgud) Theatre in 1939, in a cast that included Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell, Joyce Carey as Gwendolen, Angela Baddeley as Cecily and Margaret Rutherford as Miss Prism. \"The Times\" considered the production the best since the original and praised it for its fidelity to Wilde's conception and its \"airy, responsive ball-playing quality\". Later in the same year, Gielgud presented the work again, with Jack Hawkins as Algernon, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Gwendolen and Peggy Ashcroft as Cecily, with Evans and Rutherford in their previous roles. The production was presented in several seasons during and after the Second World War, with mostly the same principal players. During a 1946 season at the Haymarket, the King and Queen attended a performance, which, as the journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft put it, gave the play \"a final accolade of respectability\". Gielgud's London production toured North America and was successfully staged on Broadway in 1947.\nIn 1975 Jonathan Miller, who had been prevented for financial reasons the previous year from staging the play at the National Theatre with an all-male cast, directed a production in which Lady Bracknell, played by Irene Handl, was given a German accent. For Peter Hall's 1982 production at the National Theatre the cast included Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, Martin Jarvis as Jack, Nigel Havers as Algernon, Zo\u00eb Wanamaker as Gwendolen and Anna Massey as Miss Prism. In 1987 a version of the play was given at the Whitehall Theatre starring Hinge and Bracket as Miss Prism and Lady Bracknell respectively. Nicholas Hytner's 1993 production at the Aldwych Theatre, starring Maggie Smith, had occasional references to a conjectural gay subtext.\n21st century.\nThe play was presented in Singapore in 2004 by the British Theatre Playhouse, and the same company took the production to Greenwich Theatre, London, in 2005. In 2007 Peter Gill directed the play at the Theatre Royal, Bath. The production went on a short UK tour before playing in the West End in 2008.\nSince the 1987 Whitehall version, some other productions have cast a male actor in the role of Lady Bracknell. In 2005 the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, presented the play with an all-male cast; it also featured Wilde as a character \u2013 the play opened with him drinking in a Parisian caf\u00e9, dreaming of his play. The Melbourne Theatre Company staged a production in 2011 with Geoffrey Rush as Lady Bracknell. In the same year the Roundabout Theatre Company presented a Broadway revival based on the 2009 Stratford Shakespeare Festival production featuring its director, Brian Bedford, as Lady Bracknell. At the Vaudeville Theatre, London, in 2015, David Suchet took the role in a production directed by Adrian Noble.\nIn 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre, London, Lucy Bailey directed a production that followed a trend to \"age-blind\" casting: the average age of the cast was nearly seventy, and Jarvis and Havers reprised the roles they had played at the National in 1982. In 2024 the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester presented an updated version, described by \"The Guardian\" as \"a convincing stab at a 21st-century makeover\". In November 2024 the National Theatre again revived the play, in a new production by Max Webster. The production was recast for a transfer to the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre in September 2025. The two casts included Hugh Skinner/Nathan Stewart-Jarrett (John Worthing), Ncuti Gatwa/Olly Alexander (Algernon), Richard Cant/Hugh Dennis (Canon Chasuble), Sharon D. Clarke/Stephen Fry (Lady Bracknell), Ronk\u1eb9 Ad\u00e9k\u1ecdlu\u1eb9\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301/Kitty Hawthorne (Gwendolen), Eliza Scanlen/Jessica Whitehurst (Cecily) and Amanda Lawrence/Shobna Gulati (Miss Prism).\nPublication.\nFirst edition.\nWilde's two final comedies, \"An Ideal Husband\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", were still on stage in London at the time of his prosecution in 1895, and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public. After two years in prison with hard labour, Wilde went into exile in Paris, sick and depressed, his reputation destroyed in England. In 1898 Leonard Smithers agreed with Wilde to publish the two final plays.\nWilde proved to be a diligent reviser, sending detailed instructions on stage directions, character listings and the book's presentation and insisting that a playbill from the first performance be reproduced inside. Ellmann argues that the proofs show a man \"very much in command of himself and of the play\". Wilde's name did not appear on the cover, which stated: \"By the Author of \"Lady Windermere's Fan\"\". His return to work was brief, as he refused to write anything else: \"I can write, but have lost the joy of writing\".\nIn translation.\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\"'s popularity has meant it has been translated into many languages, but the pun in the title (\"Ernest\", a masculine proper name, and \"earnest\", steadfast and serious) poses a special problem for translators. The simplest instance of a suitable translation of the pun is in German, where (serious) and (given name) are the same.\nAs wordplay is usually unique to the language in question, translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original or creating a similar pun in their own language. Some translators leave all characters' names unchanged and in their original spelling: readers are reminded of the original cultural setting, but the liveliness of the pun is lost. Others, favouring comprehensibility over fidelity to the original, have replaced \"Ernest\" with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language. For instance, Italian versions variously call the play , the given names being respectively the values of honesty, propriety and fidelity. Translators differ in their approach to the original English honorific titles; some change them all or none, but most leave a mix, partly as a compensation for the loss of Englishness.\nFrench offers a closer pun. According to Les Archives du spectacle in its listing of productions in French since 1954, the title of the play is most often given as , but has also been rendered as , , and .\nAnalysis.\nStructure and genre.\nThe novelist and critic Arthur Ransome argued that Wilde freed himself by abandoning the melodrama of his earlier drawing room plays and basing the story entirely on the Earnest/Ernest verbal conceit. Freed from \"living up to any drama more serious than conversation\", Wilde could now amuse himself to a fuller extent with \"quips, , epigrams and repartee that had really nothing to do with the business at hand\". The academic Sos Eltis comments that although Wilde's earliest and longest handwritten drafts of the play are full of \"farcical accidents, broad puns and a number of familiar comic devices\", in his revisions \"Wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systematic and disconcerting illogicality which characterizes \"Earnest's\" dialogue\".\nThe genre of the \"Importance of Being Earnest\" has been debated by scholars and critics, who have variously categorised it as high comedy, farce, parody and satire. In a 1956 critique Richard Foster argues that the play creates \"an 'as if' world in which 'real' values are inverted, reason and unreason are interchanged and the probable defined by improbability\". Contributors to \"The Cambridge Companion to Oscar Wilde\" (1997) variously refer to the play as \"high farce\", \"an ostensible farce\", \"farce with aggressive pranks, quick-paced action and evasion of moral responsibility\", and \"high comedy\".\nTriviality.\nRansome described \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" as the most trivial of Wilde's society plays, and the only one that produces \"that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful ... It is precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly\". \"Salome\", \"An Ideal Husband\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing, but vice in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is represented by Algernon's greedy consumption of cucumber sandwiches. Wilde told his friend Robbie Ross that the play's theme was \"That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality\". The theme is glanced at in the play's title, and earnestness is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue; Algernon says in Act II, \"one must be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in life\", but goes on to reproach Jack for being serious about everything and thus revealing a trivial nature. Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern (in \"An Ideal Husband\"), but in \"Earnest\" the protagonists' duplicity (Algernon's \"Bunburying\" and Worthing's double life as Jack and Ernest) is for more innocent purposes \u2013 largely to evade unwelcome social obligations. While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues, Wilde's writing in this play is the antithesis of that of didactic writers like Shaw who used their characters to present audiences with grand ideals and appeals for social justice.\nSatire and parody.\nThe play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs \u2013 marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered by some to be the overriding societal value; originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the middle and upper classes during the mid-19th century. The play's subtitle introduces the theme, which continues in the discussion between Jack and Algernon in Act I: \"Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them\".\nWilde's inversion of values continues: when Algernon arrives in Woolton masquerading as Ernest he tells Cecily that he is not really wicked at all.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;CECILY: If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.\nIn the final scene Jack asks Gwendolen if she can forgive him for not having been deceitful after all:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;JACK: Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me?&lt;br&gt;\nGWENDOLEN: I can, for I feel that you are sure to change.\nIn turn, Gwendolen and Cecily wish to marry a man named Ernest. Gwendolen ignores her mother's methodical analysis of Jack Worthing's suitability as a husband and places her entire faith in a forename, declaring in Act I, \"The only really safe name is Ernest\". This is an opinion shared by Cecily in Act II: \"I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest\".\nWilde portrayed society's rules and rituals in the figure of Lady Bracknell: according to the Wilde scholar Peter Raby, minute attention to the details of her style created a comic effect of assertion by restraint. She dismisses Jack's London address as on the unfashionable side of Belgrave Square and is unmoved by Jack's explanation that the handbag in which he was found as a baby was deposited in the cloakroom of the socially superior half of Victoria Station.\nWilde parodies 19th-century melodrama, introducing exaggeratedly incongruous situations such as Jack's arrival in full mourning for the brother who has just walked into his house, and the sudden switch from fulsome affection between Cecily and Gwendolen to deep hostility on discovering that they are supposedly both engaged to the same man.\nConjectural homosexual subtext.\nIn queer theory the play's themes of duplicity and ambivalence are inextricably bound up with Wilde's homosexuality, so that the play exhibits what one critic terms a \"flickering presence-absence of ... homosexual desire\". After his release from prison, Wilde wrote to Reginald Turner, \"It was extraordinary reading the play over. How I used to toy with that tiger Life!\" In a 2014 study, William Eaton writes, \"\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is what it obviously is, a play about dissimulation, and that dissimulation \u2013 not seeming to be who one was \u2013 was extremely important for homosexuals of Wilde's time and place, and thus was an extremely non-trivial matter for Wilde\".\nEve Kosofsky Sedgwick, a proponent of queer theory, interprets linguistic aspects of the play as allusions to gay culture and stereotypes, such as references to the German language and the composer Richard Wagner, both of which were associated with male homosexuality in Wilde's day. In 1990 Noel Annan suggested that the use of the name Ernest may have been a homosexual in-joke. In 1892, two years before Wilde began writing the play, John Gambril Nicholson had published a book of pederastic poetry, \"Love in Earnest\". The sonnet \"Of Boys' Names\" included the verse:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnnan speculated that \"earnest\" may also have been a private code-word among gay men, as in: \"Is he earnest?\" in the same way that \"Is he musical?\" is thought to have been used. Eaton finds this theory unconvincing, and in 2001 Sir Donald Sinden, an actor who had met Lord Alfred Douglas and two of the play's original cast (Irene Vanbrugh and Allan Aynesworth), wrote to \"The Times\" to rebut suggestions that \"earnest\" held any sexual connotations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBunbury.\nBunbury is a village in Cheshire. Several theories have been advanced to explain Wilde's use of the name to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde's youth. Another theory is that Wilde spotted the names of a Captain Bunbury and a magistrate, Mr Bunbury, in \"The Worthing Gazette\" in August and September 1894, found the surname pleasing and borrowed it.\nA suggestion put forward by Aleister Crowley \u2013 who knew Wilde \u2013 was that Bunbury was a portmanteau word, coined after Wilde had taken a train to Banbury, met a boy there and arranged a second meeting at Sunbury. Carolyn Williams, in a 2010 study, writes that for the word \"Bunburying\", Wilde \"braids the 'Belvawneying' evil eye from Gilbert's \"Engaged\"\" with Bunthorne from Gilbert (and Sullivan)'s 1881 comic opera \"Patience\".\nUse of language.\nAlthough Wilde had for several years been famous for dialogue and his use of language, Raby has argued that in this play the author achieved unity and mastery unmatched in his other plays, with the possible exception of \"Salome\". Raby comments that although the earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" achieves \"a pitch-perfect style\" that allows these clashes to dissolve. Raby identifies three different registers in the play: Algernon's exchange with his manservant conveying an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes. The imperious pronouncements of Lady Bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions. In contrast, the discourse of Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism is distinguished by \"pedantic precept\" and \"idiosyncratic diversion\". The play is full of epigrams and paradoxes. Max Beerbohm described it as abounding in \"chiselled apothegms \u2013 witticisms unrelated to action or character but so good in themselves as to have the quality of dramatic surprise\".\nCharacterisation.\nThough Wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar \u2013 the upper-class dandy, the overbearing matriarch, the woman with a past, the puritanical young lady \u2013 his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies. Lady Bracknell, for instance, embodies respectable, upper-class society, but Eltis notes how her development \"from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character\" can be traced through Wilde's revisions of the play. For the two young men, Wilde presents not stereotypical stage \"dudes\" but intelligent beings who, as Russell Jackson puts it, \"speak like their creator in well-formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue-words\". Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism are, in Jackson's view, characterised by \"a few light touches of detail\", their old-fashioned enthusiasms and the Canon's fastidious pedantry pared down by Wilde during his many redrafts of the text.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\n\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" has been adapted for the English-language cinema at least three times, first in 1952 by Anthony Asquith who adapted the screenplay and directed it. The cast included Michael Denison (Algernon), Michael Redgrave (Jack), Edith Evans (Lady Bracknell), Dorothy Tutin (Cecily), Joan Greenwood (Gwendolen), Margaret Rutherford (Miss Prism), and Miles Malleson (Dr Chasuble).\nIn 1992 Kurt Baker directed a version using an all-black cast with Daryl Keith Roach as Jack, Wren T. Brown as Algernon, Ann Weldon as Lady Bracknell, Lanei Chapman as Cecily, Chris Calloway as Gwendolen, CCH Pounder as Miss Prism and Brock Peters as Dr Chasuble, set in the United States.\nIn 2002 Oliver Parker, a director who had previously adapted \"An Ideal Husband\", made another film. It stars Colin Firth (Jack), Rupert Everett (Algernon), Judi Dench (Lady Bracknell), Reese Witherspoon (Cecily), Frances O'Connor (Gwendolen), Anna Massey (Miss Prism) and Tom Wilkinson (Canon Chasuble). Parker interpolated about twenty lines of his own into the script and restored the episode cut by Wilde before the premiere of the play, in which a solicitor attempts to serve a writ on the supposed Ernest.\nA 2008 Telugu language romantic comedy film, titled \"Ashta Chamma\", is an adaptation of the play.\nOperas and musicals.\nIn 1963 Erik Chisholm composed an opera from the play, basing the libretto on Wilde's text. Gerald Barry created the 2011 opera \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Barbican Centre in London. It premiered in Los Angeles in 2011. The role of Lady Bracknell is sung by a bass. The stage premiere was given by the Op\u00e9ra national de Lorraine in Nancy in 2013. A 2012 concert performance was recorded live at the Barbican by the BBC and released commercially in 2014. In 2017 Odyssey Opera of Boston presented Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco's opera \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" as part of a \"Wilde Opera Nights\" series, a season-long exploration of operatic works inspired by Wilde's writings and world.\nIn 1964 Gerd Natschinski composed a musical, , based on the play. According to a study by Robert Tanitch, by 2002, there had been at least eight adaptations of the play as a musical, though \"never with conspicuous success\". The earliest such version was a 1927 American show entitled \"Oh Earnest\". The journalist Mark Bostridge comments, \"The libretto of a 1957 musical adaptation, \"Half in Earnest\", deposited in the British Library, is scarcely more encouraging. The curtain rises on Algernon, strumming away at the piano, singing, 'I can play \"Chopsticks\", Lane'. Other songs include 'A Bunburying I Must Go'\". Since Bostridge wrote his article, at least one further musical version of the play has been staged: a show with a book by Douglas Livingstone and score by Adam McGuinness and Zia Moranne was staged in December 2011 at the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith; the cast included Susie Blake, Gyles Brandreth and Edward Petherbridge.\nStage derivatives.\nTom Stoppard's 1974 stage comedy \"Travesties\" draws extensively on Wilde's play. Stoppard's central character, Henry Carr, was a real-life figure who played Algernon in a production of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" produced by James Joyce in Zurich in 1917. Stoppard reimagines him as an old man, reminiscing about the production and his days as a young man. The other characters include Carr's sister Gwendolen and the local librarian, Cecily; the action of the play, under the erratic control of the old Carr's fallible memory, continually mirrors that of Wilde's original. Carr has an exchange with Tristan Tzara reminiscent of John Worthing's exchanges with Algernon, Tzara has a scene with Joyce that draws on Jack's interview with Lady Bracknell, and Gwendolen and Cecily have a falling out on the lines of that of their namesakes in Wilde's play (though to the tune of \"Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean\" rather than in prose).\nIn 2016 the Irish actor/writers Helen Norton and Jonathan White wrote the comic play \"To Hell in a Handbag\" which retells the story of \"The Importance\" from the point of view of the characters Canon Chasuble and Miss Prism, giving them their own back story and showing what happens to them when they are not on stage in Wilde's play.\nRadio and television.\nThere have been many radio versions of the play. In 1925 the BBC broadcast an adaptation with Hesketh Pearson as Jack Worthing. Further broadcasts of the play followed during the 1920s and 1930s, and in November 1937 the BBC broadcast the first television adaptation of the play, in an abridged version directed by Royston Morley. In 1942 BBC radio broadcast scenes from the play, featuring two members of the original cast: the programme was introduced by Allan Aynesworth and starred Irene Vanbrugh as Lady Bracknell. A 1951 broadcast of the complete three-act play starred Gielgud, Evans and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies.\nIn March 1958 British commercial television broadcast a production of the play starring Michael Denison (Jack), Tony Britton (Algernon), Dulcie Gray (Gwendolen) and Martita Hunt (Lady Bracknell). A 1964 commercial television adaptation starred Ian Carmichael, Patrick Macnee, Susannah York, Fenella Fielding, Pamela Brown and Irene Handl. A BBC television version in 1974 starred Coral Browne as Lady Bracknell. In 1977 BBC Radio 4 broadcast the four-act version of the play for the first time, with Fabia Drake as Lady Bracknell, Richard Pasco as Jack, Jeremy Clyde as Algy, Maurice Denham as Canon Chasuble, Sylvia Coleridge as Miss Prism, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Gwendolen and Prunella Scales as Cecily. In 1988 a production of the four-act version was broadcast on BBC television, starring Joan Plowright, Paul McGann, Gemma Jones and Alec McCowen.\nIn 1995, to mark the centenary of the first performance of the play, Radio 4 broadcast a new adaptation on 13 February; directed by Glyn Dearman, it featured Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, Michael Sheen as Jack, Martin Clunes as Algernon, John Moffatt as Dr Chasuble, Miriam Margolyes as Miss Prism, Samantha Bond as Gwendolen and Amanda Root as Cecily. In December 2000 BBC Radio 3 broadcast an adaptation directed by Howard Davies starring Geraldine McEwan as Lady Bracknell, Simon Russell Beale as Jack Worthing, Julian Wadham as Algernon Moncrieff, Geoffrey Palmer as Canon Chasuble, Celia Imrie as Miss Prism, Victoria Hamilton as Gwendolen and Emma Fielding as Cecily.\nCommercial recordings.\nGielgud's performance is preserved on an EMI audio recording dating from 1952, which also captures Edith Evans's Lady Bracknell. The cast also includes Roland Culver (Algernon), Jean Cadell (Miss Prism), Pamela Brown (Gwendolen) and Celia Johnson (Cecily).\nOther audio recordings include a \"Theatre Masterworks\" version from 1953, directed and narrated by Margaret Webster, with a cast including Maurice Evans and Lucile Watson; a 1968 recording on the Caedmon label with Gladys Cooper as Lady Bracknell and Joan Greenwood, Richard Johnson, Alec McCowen, Lynn Redgrave, Irene Handl and Robertson Hare; a 1989 version by California Artists Radio Theatre, featuring Dan O'Herlihy, Jeanette Nolan, Les Tremayne and Richard Erdman; and one by L.A. Theatre Works issued in 2009, featuring Charles Busch, James Marsters and Andrea Bowen.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is written as a dialogue between Glaucon and Socrates, in which the latter further elaborates upon the immediately preceding analogy of the Sun at the former's request. Socrates asks Glaucon not only to envision this unequally bisected line but to imagine further bisecting each of the two segments. Socrates explains that the four resulting segments represent four separate 'affections' (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1) of the psyche. The lower two sections are said to represent the visible while the higher two are said to represent the intelligible. These affections are described in succession as corresponding to increasing levels of reality and truth from conjecture (\u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) to belief () to thought (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) and finally to understanding (). Furthermore, this analogy not only elaborates a theory of the psyche but also presents metaphysical and epistemological views.\nDescription.\nIn \"The Republic\" (509d\u2013510a), Plato describes the divided line to Glaucon this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe visible world.\nThus AB represents shadows and reflections of physical things, and BC the physical things themselves. These correspond to two kinds of knowledge, the illusion (\"eikas\u00eda\") of our ordinary, everyday experience, and belief (\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \"pistis\") about discrete physical objects which cast their shadows. In the \"Timaeus\", the category of illusion includes all the \"opinions of which the minds of ordinary people are full,\" while the natural sciences are included in the category of belief.\nThe term eikas\u00eda (), meaning \"conjecture\" in Greek, was used by Plato to refer to a human way of dealing with appearances. Particularly, it is identified as the lower subsection of the visible segment and represents images, which Plato described as \"first shadows, then reflections in water and in all compacted, smooth, and shiny materials\". According to the philosopher, \"eikasia\" and \"pistis\" add up to \"doxa\", which is concerned with genesis (becoming).\n\"Eikasia\" has several interpretations. For instance, it is the inability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else. It therefore prevents us from perceiving that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. Another variation posited by scholars such Yancey Dominick, explains that it is a way of understanding the originals that generate the objects that are considered as \"eikasia\". This allows one to distinguish the image from reality such as the way one can avoid mistaking a reflection of a tree in a puddle for a tree.\nThe intelligible world.\nAccording to some translations, the segment CE, representing the intelligible world, is divided into the same ratio as AC, giving the subdivisions CD and DE (it can be readily verified that CD must have the same length as BC):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlato describes CD, the \"lower\" of these, as involving mathematical reasoning (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \"dianoia\"), where abstract mathematical objects such as geometric lines are discussed. Such objects are outside the physical world (and are not to be confused with the \"drawings\" of those lines, which fall within the physical world BC). However, they are less important to Plato than the subjects of philosophical understanding (\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \"noesis\"), the \"higher\" of these two subdivisions (DE):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlato here is using the familiar relationship between ordinary objects and their shadows or reflections in order to illustrate the relationship between the physical world as a whole and the world of Ideas (Forms) as a whole. The former is made up of a series of passing reflections of the latter, which is eternal, more real and \"true.\" Moreover, the knowledge that we have of the Ideas \u2013 when indeed we do have it \u2013 is of a higher order than knowledge of the mere physical world. In particular, knowledge of the forms leads to a knowledge of the Idea (Form) of the Good.\nMetaphysical importance.\nThe analogy of the divided line is the cornerstone of Plato's metaphysical framework. This structure illustrates the grand picture of Plato's metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, all in one. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all. In the \"Republic\", the philosopher must understand the Idea of Justice to live a just life or to organize and govern a just state.\nThe lowest level, which represents \"the world of becoming and passing away\" (\"Republic\", 508d), is the metaphysical model for a Heraclitean philosophy of constant flux and for Protagorean philosophy of appearance and opinion. The second level, a world of fixed physical objects, also became Aristotle's metaphysical model. The third level might be a Pythagorean level of mathematics. The fourth level is Plato's ideal Parmenidean reality, the world of highest level Ideas.\nEpistemological meaning.\nPlato holds a very strict notion of knowledge. For example, he does not accept expertise about a subject, nor direct perception (see \"Theaetetus\"), nor true belief about the physical world (the \"Meno\") as knowledge. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all. For this reason, in most of the earlier Socratic dialogues, Socrates denies knowledge both to himself and others.\nFor the first level, \"the world of becoming and passing away,\" Plato expressly denies the possibility of knowledge. Constant change never stays the same, therefore, properties of objects must refer to different Ideas at different times. Note that for knowledge to be possible, which Plato believed, the other three levels must be unchanging. The third and fourth level, mathematics and Ideas, are already eternal and unchanging. However, to ensure that the second level, the objective, physical world, is also unchanging, Plato, in the \"Republic\", Book 4 introduces empirically derived axiomatic restrictions that prohibit both motion and shifting perspectives.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31069", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31069", "title": "Themistocles", "text": "Athenian politician and general (c. 524\u2013459 BC)\nThemistocles (; ; c.\u2009524\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009459\u00a0BC) was an Athenian politician and general. He was one of a new breed of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the Athenian democracy. As a politician, Themistocles was a populist, having the support of lower-class Athenians, and generally being at odds with the Athenian nobility. Elected archon in 493\u00a0BC, he convinced the polis to increase the naval power of Athens, a recurring theme in his political career. During the first Persian invasion of Greece, he fought at the Battle of Marathon (490\u00a0BC), and may have been one of the ten Athenian \"strategoi\" (generals) in that battle.\nIn the years after Marathon, and in the run-up to the second Persian invasion of 480\u2013479\u00a0BC, Themistocles became the most prominent politician in Athens. He continued to advocate for a strong Athenian navy, and in 483\u00a0BC he persuaded the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes; these proved crucial in the forthcoming conflict with Persia. During the second invasion, he commanded the Athenian navy at the battles of Artemisium and Salamis in 480\u00a0BC. Due to his subterfuge, the Allies successfully lured the Persian fleet into the Straits of Salamis, and the decisive Greek victory there was the turning point of the war. The invasion was conclusively repulsed the following year after the Persian defeat at the land Battle of Plataea.\nAfter the conflict ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate him from the Athenians. In 472 or 471\u00a0BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478\u00a0BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from southern Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (r. 498\u2013454\u00a0BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered the service of the Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465\u2013424\u00a0BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there for the rest of his life.\nThemistocles died in 459\u00a0BC, probably of natural causes. His reputation was posthumously rehabilitated, and he was re-established as a hero of the Athenian, and indeed Greek, cause. Themistocles can still reasonably be thought of as \"the man most instrumental in achieving the salvation of Greece\" from the Persian threat, as Plutarch describes him. His naval policies would have a lasting impact on Athens as well, since maritime power became the cornerstone of the Athenian Empire and golden age. Thucydides assessed Themistocles as \"a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled\".\nFamily.\nThemistocles was born in the Attic deme of Phrearrhii around 524\u00a0BC, the son of Neocles, a Leontian also of Phrearrhii, who was, in the words of Plutarch \"no very conspicuous man at Athens\". His mother is more obscure; her name was either Euterpe or Abrotonum, and her place of origin has been given variously as Halicarnassus, Thrace, or Acarnania. Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father. Plutarch considers this to be false. Plutarch indicates that, on account of his mother's background, Themistocles was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of Athens, Cynosarges, outside the city walls. However, in an early example of his cunning, Themistocles persuaded \"well-born\" children to exercise with him in Cynosarges, thus breaking down the distinction between \"alien and legitimate\". Plutarch further reports that Themistocles was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life. His teacher is said to have told him: \"My boy, you will be nothing insignificant, but definitely something great, either for good or evil.\"\nThemistocles left three sons born of Archippe, the daughter of Lysander of Alopece: Archeptolis, Polyeuctus, and Cleophantus. He also had two sons older than these three, Neocles and Diocles. Neocles died when he was young, bitten by a horse, and Diocles was adopted by his grandfather, Lysander. Plato's \"Meno\" mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but no equal to his father in deeds or virtue. Themistocles also had many daughters: Mnesiptolema, the product of his second marriage, married her step-brother Archeptolis and became priestess of Cybele; Italia was married to Panthoides of Chios; and Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After Themistocles died, his nephew Phrasicles went to Magnesia and married another daughter, Nicomache (with her brothers' consent). Phrasicles then took charge of her sister Asia, the youngest of all ten children.\nPolitical and military career.\nBackground.\nThemistocles grew up in a period of upheaval in Athens. The tyrant Peisistratos had died in 527\u00a0BC, passing power to his sons, Hipparchus and Hippias. Hipparchus was murdered in 514\u00a0BC, and in response to this, Hippias became paranoid and started to rely increasingly on foreign mercenaries to keep a hold on power. The head of the powerful but exiled Alcmaeonid family, Cleisthenes, began to scheme to overthrow Hippias and return to Athens. In 510\u00a0BC, he persuaded the Spartan king Cleomenes I to launch a full-scale attack on Athens, which succeeded in overthrowing Hippias. However, in the aftermath, the other noble (\"eupatrid\") families of Athens rejected Cleisthenes, electing Isagoras as archon, with the support of Cleomenes. On a personal level, Cleisthenes wanted to return to Athens; however, he also probably wanted to prevent Athens becoming a Spartan client state. Outmaneuvering the other nobles, he proposed to the Athenian people a radical program in which political power would be invested in the people\u2014a \"democracy\". The Athenian people thus overthrew Isagoras, repelled a Spartan attack under Cleomenes, and invited Cleisthenes to return to Athens and put his plan into action. The establishment of the democracy was to radically change Athens: \"And so it was that the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power... they gave vivid proof of what equality and freedom of speech might achieve\"\nEarly years of the democracy.\nThe new system of government in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously would have had no access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; \"he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible.\" Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens:\n[H]e wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency...\nHowever, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used in the service of the common people, gained him further popularity.\nArchonship.\nThemistocles probably turned 30 in 494\u00a0BC, which qualified him to become an archon, the highest of the magistracies in Athens. On the back of his popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected Archon Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493\u00a0BC). Themistocles's archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of Athenian sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at Piraeus, to replace the existing facilities at Phalerum. Although further away from Athens, Piraeus offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified. Since Athens was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th century\u00a0BC, Themistocles's policies were to have huge significance for the future of Athens, and indeed Greece. In advancing naval power, Themistocles was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects of Athens. However, as Plutarch implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (\"thetes\") as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Athenians\u2014and thus into Themistocles's own hands.\nRivalry with Aristides.\nAfter Marathon, probably in 489, Miltiades, the hero of the battle, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted. The Athenian aristocracy, and indeed Greek aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace. Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the Athenian people', but died weeks later as a result of his wound. In the wake of this prosecution, the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy, which had been part of Cleisthenes' reforms, but remained so far unused. This was 'ostracism'\u2014each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery (\"ostrakon\") the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years. This may have been triggered by Miltiades' prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try to stop such power-games among the noble families. Certainly, in the years (487\u00a0BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the Alcmaeonids, were exiled. The career of a politician in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile.\nThemistocles, with his power-base firmly established among the poor, moved naturally to fill the vacuum left by Miltiades' death, and in that decade became the most influential politician in Athens. However, the support of the nobility began to coalesce around the man who would become Themistocles's great rival\u2014Aristides. Aristides cast himself as Themistocles's opposite\u2014virtuous, honest and incorruptible\u2014and his followers called him \"the just\". Plutarch suggests that the rivalry between the two had begun when they competed over the love of a boy: \"... they were rivals for the affection of the beautiful Stesilaus of Ceos, and were passionate beyond all moderation.\"\nDuring the decade, Themistocles continued to advocate the expansion of Athenian naval power. The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended; Darius' son and successor, Xerxes I, had continued the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Themistocles seems to have realised that for the Greeks to survive the coming onslaught required a Greek navy that could hope to face up to the Persian navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet. Aristides, as champion of the \"zeugites\" (the upper, 'hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.\nIn 483\u00a0BC, a massive new seam of silver was found in the Athenian mines of Laurion. Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the Athenian citizens. Themistocles avoided mentioning Persia, deeming that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused their attention on Aegina. At the time, Athens was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea. As a result, Themistocles's motion was carried easily, although only 100 triremes were to be built. Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely Themistocles was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built. Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the ostracism of 482\u00a0BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides. In what has been characterized as the first referendum, Aristides was ostracised, and Themistocles's policies were endorsed. Indeed, becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than Themistocles had initially asked for. In the run-up to the Persian invasion, Themistocles had thus become the foremost politician in Athens.\nSecond Persian invasion of Greece.\nIn 481\u00a0BC a congress of Greek city-states was held, during which 30 or so states agreed to ally themselves against the forthcoming invasion. The Spartans and Athenians were foremost in this alliance, being sworn enemies of the Persians.\nThe Spartans claimed the command of land forces, and since the Greek (hereafter referred to as \"Allied\") fleet would be dominated by Athens, Themistocles tried to claim command of the naval forces. However, the other naval powers, including Corinth and Aegina, refused to give command to the Athenians, and Themistocles pragmatically backed down. Instead, as a compromise, the Spartans (an insignificant naval power), in the person of Eurybiades, were to command the naval forces. Herodotus is clear, however, that Themistocles commanded the fleet in all but name.\nThe congress met again in the spring of 480\u00a0BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes' advance. A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched under the command of the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles to the Vale of Tempe, which they believed the Persian army would have to pass through. However, once there, Alexander I of Macedon warned them that the vale could be bypassed in several ways and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, and the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.\nThemistocles now developed a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans would be willing to march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.\nTo do this, every able-bodied Athenian male would be required to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon Athens. Persuading the Athenians to take this course was one of the highlights of Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality\u2014for Themistocles's audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded.\nHis proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.\nBattle of Artemisium.\nThus, in August 480\u00a0BC, when the Persian army was approaching Thessaly, the Allied fleet sailed to Artemisium, and the Allied army marched to Thermopylae. Themistocles himself took command of the Athenian contingent of the fleet and went to Artemisium. When the Persian fleet finally arrived at Artemisium after a significant delay, Eurybiades, who both Herodotus and Plutarch suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting. At this point Themistocles accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at Artemisium, and he used some of it to bribe Eurybiades to remain, while pocketing the rest. From this point on, Themistocles appears to have been more or less in charge of the Allied effort at Artemisium. not Over three days of battle, the Allies held their own against the much larger Persian fleet, but sustained significant losses. However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of Thermopylae to the Persians made their continued presence at Artemisium irrelevant, and the Allies thus evacuated. According to Herodotus, Themistocles left messages at every place where the Persian fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the Ionians in the Persian fleet to defect, or at least fight badly. Even if this did not work, Themistocles apparently intended that Xerxes would at least begin to suspect the Ionians, thereby sowing dissension in the Persian ranks.\nBattle of Salamis.\nIn the aftermath of Thermopylae, Boeotia fell to the Persians, who then began to advance on Athens. The Peloponnesian Allies prepared to now defend the Isthmus of Corinth, thus abandoning Athens to the Persians. From Artemisium, the Allied fleet sailed to the island of Salamis, where the Athenian ships helped with the final evacuation of Athens. The Peloponnesian contingents wanted to sail to the coast of the Isthmus to concentrate forces with the army. However, Themistocles tried to convince them to remain in the Straits of Salamis, invoking the lessons of Artemisium; \"battle in close conditions works to our advantage\". After threatening to sail with the whole Athenian people into exile in Sicily, he eventually persuaded the other Allies, whose security after all relied on the Athenian navy, to accept his plan. Therefore, even after Athens had fallen to the Persians, and the Persian navy had arrived off the coast of Salamis, the Allied navy remained in the Straits. Themistocles appears to have been aiming to fight a battle that would cripple the Persian navy, and thus guarantee the security of the Peloponnesus.\nTo bring about this battle, Themistocles used a cunning mix of subterfuge and misinformation, psychologically exploiting Xerxes' desire to finish the invasion. Xerxes' actions indicate that he was keen to finish the conquest of Greece in 480\u00a0BC, and to do this, he needed a decisive victory over the Allied fleet. Themistocles sent a servant, Sicinnus, to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was \"on the king's side, and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes'.\" Themistocles claimed that the Allied commanders were infighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians needed to do was to block the straits. In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits. The message also had a secondary purpose: In the event of an Allied defeat, the Athenians might receive some degree of mercy from Xerxes (having indicated their readiness to submit). At any rate, this was exactly the kind of news that Xerxes wanted to hear. Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out to effect the block. Perhaps overconfident and expecting no resistance, the Persian navy sailed into the Straits, only to find that, far from disintegrating, the Allied navy was ready for battle.\nAccording to Herodotus, after the Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides arrived at the Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been recalled from exile along with the other ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled the Allies, which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians had walked into his trap. The Allied commanders seem to have taken this news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles's ruse all along. Either way, the Allies prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and the Allies took advantage to win a famous victory.\nSalamis was the turning point in the second Persian invasion, and indeed the Greco-Persian Wars in general. While the battle did not end the Persian invasion, it effectively ensured that all Greece would not be conquered, and allowed the Allies to go on the offensive in 479\u00a0BC. A number of historians believe that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history. Since Themistocles's long-standing advocacy of Athenian naval power enabled the Allied fleet to fight, and his stratagem brought about the Battle of Salamis, it is probably not an exaggeration to say, as Plutarch does, that Themistocles, \"...is thought to have been the man most instrumental in achieving the salvation of Hellas.\"\nAutumn 480 \u2013 Winter 479 BC.\nThe Allied victory at Salamis ended the immediate threat to Greece, and Xerxes now returned to Asia with part of the army, leaving his general Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest. Mardonius wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly, and the Athenians were thus able to return to their city, which had been burnt and razed by the Persians, for the winter. For the Athenians, and Themistocles personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the Persian army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with no success.\nDuring the winter, the Allies held a meeting at Corinth to celebrate their success, and award prizes for achievement. However, perhaps tired of the Athenians pointing out their role at Salamis, and of their demands for the Allies to march north, the Allies awarded the prize for civic achievement to Aegina. Furthermore, although the admirals all voted for Themistocles in second place, they all voted for themselves in first place, so that no-one won the prize for individual achievement. In response, realising the importance of the Athenian fleet to their security, and probably seeking to massage Themistocles's ego, the Spartans brought Themistocles to Sparta. There, he was awarded a special prize \"for his wisdom and cleverness\", and won high praise from all. Furthermore, Plutarch reports that at the next Olympic Games:\n[When] Themistocles entered the stadium, the audience neglected the contestants all day long to gaze on him, and pointed him out with admiring applause to visiting strangers, so that he too was delighted, and confessed to his friends that he was now reaping in full measure the harvest of his toils in behalf of Hellas.\nAfter returning to Athens in the winter, Plutarch reports that Themistocles made a proposal to the city while the Greek fleet was wintering at Pagasae:\nThemistocles once declared to the people [of Athens] that he had devised a certain measure which could not be revealed to them, though it would be helpful and salutary for the city, and they ordered that Aristides alone should hear what it was and pass judgment on it. So Themistocles told Aristides that his purpose was to burn the naval station of the confederate Hellenes, for that in this way the Athenians would be greatest, and lords of all. Then Aristides came before the people and said of the deed which Themistocles purposed to do, that none other could be more advantageous, and none more unjust. On hearing this, the Athenians ordained that Themistocles cease from his purpose.\nSpring\u2013Summer 479 BC.\nHowever, as happened to many prominent individuals in the Athenian democracy, Themistocles's fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting. It is probable that in early 479\u00a0BC, Themistocles was stripped of his command; instead, Xanthippus was to command the Athenian fleet, and Aristides the land forces. Though Themistocles was no doubt politically and militarily active for the rest of the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479\u00a0BC is made in the ancient sources. In the summer of that year, after receiving an Athenian ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront Mardonius, who had reoccupied Athens in June. At the decisive Battle of Plataea, the Allies destroyed the Persian army, while apparently on the same day, the Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale. These twin victories completed the Allied triumph, and ended the Persian threat to Greece.\nRebuilding of Athens after the Persian invasion.\nWhatever the cause of Themistocles's unpopularity in 479\u00a0BC, it obviously did not last long. Both Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians. Indeed, after 479\u00a0BC, he seems to have enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.\nIn the aftermath of the invasion and the Destruction of Athens by the Achaemenids, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles in the autumn of 479\u00a0BC. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.\nThemistocles also now returned to his naval policy, and more ambitious undertakings that would increase the dominant position of his native state. He further extended and fortified the port complex at Piraeus, and \"fastened the city [Athens] to the Piraeus, and the land to the sea\". Themistocles probably aimed to make Athens the dominant naval power in the Aegean. Indeed, Athens would create the Delian League in 478\u00a0BC, uniting the naval power of the Aegean Islands and Ionia under Athenian leadership. Themistocles introduced tax breaks for merchants and artisans, to attract both people and trade to the city to make Athens a great mercantile centre. He also instructed the Athenians to build 20 triremes per year, to ensure that their dominance in naval matters continued. Plutarch reports that Themistocles also secretly proposed to destroy the beached ships of the other Allied navies to ensure complete naval dominance\u2014but was overruled by Aristides and the council of Athens.\nFall and exile.\nIt seems clear that, towards the end of the decade, Themistocles had begun to accrue enemies, and had become arrogant; moreover his fellow citizens had become jealous of his prestige and power. The Rhodian poet Timocreon was among his most eloquent enemies, composing slanderous drinking songs. Meanwhile, the Spartans actively worked against him, trying to promote Cimon (son of Miltiades) as a rival to Themistocles. Furthermore, after the treason and disgrace of the Spartan general Pausanias, the Spartans tried to implicate Themistocles in the plot; he was, however, acquitted of these charges. In Athens itself, he lost favour by building a sanctuary of Artemis, with the epithet \"Aristoboul\u1ebd\" (\"of good counsel\") near his home, a blatant reference to his own role in delivering Greece from the Persian invasion. Eventually, in either 472 or 471\u00a0BC, he was ostracised. In itself, this did not mean that Themistocles had done anything wrong; ostracism, in the words of Plutarch, \"was not a penalty, but a way of pacifying and alleviating that jealousy which delights to humble the eminent, breathing out its malice into this disfranchisement.\"\nThemistocles first went to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime opportunity to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles's complicity in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems that in the end he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. Both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way. Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.\nLater life in the Achaemenid Empire, death, and descendants.\nFrom Molossia, Themistocles apparently fled to Pydna, from where he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet was in the process of besieging. Desperate to avoid the legal authorities, Themistocles, who had been traveling under an assumed identity, revealed himself to the captain and said that if he did not reach safety he would tell the Athenians that he'd bribed the ship to take him. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles's head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King's concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles's next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service:\nI, Themistocles, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion\u2014harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him. (Thucydides)\nThucydides and Plutarch say that Themistocles asked for a year's grace to learn the Persian language and customs, after which he would serve the king, and Artaxerxes granted this. Plutarch reports that, as might be imagined, Artaxerxes was elated that such a dangerous and illustrious foe had come to serve him.\nAt some point in his travels, Themistocles's wife and children were extricated from Athens by a friend, and joined him in exile. His friends also managed to send him many of his belongings, although up to 100 talents worth of his goods were confiscated by the Athenians. When, after a year, Themistocles returned to the king's court, he appears to have made an immediate impact, and \"he attained\u00a0... very high consideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or since\". Plutarch recounts that \"honors he enjoyed were far beyond those paid to other foreigners; nay, he actually took part in the King's hunts and in his household diversions\". Themistocles advised the king on his dealings with the Greeks, although it seems that for a long period, the king was distracted by events elsewhere in the empire, and thus Themistocles \"lived on for a long time without concern\". He was made governor of the district of Magnesia on the Maeander River in Asia Minor, and assigned the revenues of three cities: Magnesia (about 50 talents per year\u2014\"for bread\"); Myus (\"for opson\"); and Lampsacus (\"for wine\"). According to Plutarch, Neanthes of Cyzicus and Phanias reported two more, the city of Palaescepsis (\"for clothes\") and the city of Percote (\"for bedding and furniture for his house\"), both near Lampsacus.\nGreek exiles in the Achaemenid Empire.\nThemistocles was one of the several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Hippias, Demaratos, Gongylos or later Alcibiades. In general, those were generously welcomed by the Achaemenid kings, received land grants to support them, and ruled over cities throughout Asia Minor. Conversely, some Achaemenid satraps were welcomed as exiles in western courts, such as Artabazos II.\nFirst portraiture of a ruler on coinage.\nCoins are the only contemporary documents remaining from the time of Themistocles. Although many coins in antiquity illustrated the images of various gods or symbols, the first portraiture of actual rulers only appears in the 5th century\u00a0BC. Themistocles was probably the first ruler ever to issue coinage with his personal portrait, as he became Achaemenid Governor of Magnesia in 465\u2013459 BC. Themistocles may have been in a unique position in which he could transfer the notion of individual portraiture, already current in the Greek world, and at the same time wield the dynastic power of an Achaemenid dynast who could issue his own coins and illustrate them as he wished. Still, there is some doubt that his coins may have represented Zeus rather than himself.\nDuring his lifetime, Themistocles is known to have erected two statues to himself, one in Athens, and the other in Magnesia, which would lend credence to the possibility that he also illustrated himself on his coins. The Themistocles statue in Magnesia was illustrated on the reverse of some of the Magnesian coins of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius in the 2nd century.\nThe rulers of Lycia followed towards the end of the 5th century as the most prolific and unambiguous producers of coins displaying the portrait of their rulers. From the time of Alexander the Great, portraiture of the issuing ruler would then become a standard, generalized, feature of coinage.\nDeath.\nThemistocles died at Magnesia in 459\u00a0BC aged 65, according to Thucydides, from natural causes. However, perhaps inevitably, there were also rumours surrounding his death, saying that unwilling to follow the Great King's order to make war on Athens, he committed suicide by taking poison, or drinking bull's blood. Plutarch provides the most evocative version of this story:\nBut when Egypt revolted with Athenian aid...and Cimon's mastery of the sea forced the King to resist the efforts of the Hellenes and to hinder their hostile growth...messages came down to Themistocles saying that the King commanded him to make good his promises by applying himself to the Hellenic problem; then, neither embittered by anything like anger against his former fellow-citizens, nor lifted up by the great honor and power he was to have in the war, but possibly thinking his task not even approachable, both because Hellas had other great generals at the time, and especially because Cimon was so marvelously successful in his campaigns; yet most of all out of regard for the reputation of his own achievements and the trophies of those early days; having decided that his best course was to put a fitting end to his life, he made a sacrifice to the gods, then called his friends together, gave them a farewell clasp of his hand, and, as the current story goes, drank bull's blood, or as some say, took a quick poison, and so died in Magnesia, in the sixty-fifth year of his life...They say that the King, on learning the cause and the manner of his death, admired the man yet more, and continued to treat his friends and kindred with kindness.\nIt was rumored that after his death, Themistocles's bones were transported to Attica in accordance with his wishes, and buried in his native soil in secret, it being illegal to bury an Athenian traitor in Attica. The Magnesians built a \"splendid tomb\" in their marketplace for Themistocles, which still stood during the time of Plutarch, and continued to dedicate part of their revenues to the family of Themistocles. Nepos in the 1st century\u00a0BC wrote about a statue of Themistocles visible in the forum of Magnesia. The statue also appears on a coin type of Roman emperor Antoninus Pius minted in Magnesia in the 2nd century CE.\nSuccession and descendants.\nArcheptolis, son of Themistocles, became a Governor of Magnesia after his father's death c.\u2009459\u00a0BCE. Archeptolis also minted his own silver coinage as he ruled Magnesia, and it is probable that part of his revenues continued to be handed over to the Achaemenids in exchange for the maintenance of their territorial grant. Themistocles and his son formed what some authors have called \"a Greek dynasty in the Persian Empire\".\nFrom a second wife, Themistocles also had a daughter named Mnesiptolema, whom he appointed as priestess of the Temple of Dindymene in Magnesia, with the title of \"Mother of the Gods\". Mnesiptolema would eventually marry her half-brother Archeptolis, homopatric (but not homometric) marriages being permitted in Athens.\nThemistocles also had several other daughters, named Nicomache, Asia, Italia, Sybaris, and probably Hellas, who married the Greek exile in Persia Gongylos and still had a fief in Persian Anatolia in 400/399\u00a0BC as his widow.\nThemistocles also had three other sons, Diocles, Polyeucteus and Cleophantus, the latter possibly a ruler of Lampsacus. One of the descendants of Cleophantus still issued a decree in Lampsacus around 200 BC mentioning a feast for his own father, also named Themistocles, who had greatly benefited the city. Later, Pausanias wrote that the sons of Themistocles \"appear to have returned to Athens\", and that they dedicated a painting of Themistocles in the Parthenon and erected a bronze statue to Artemis Leucophryene, the goddess of Magnesia, on the Acropolis. They may have returned from Asia Minor in old age, after 412\u00a0BC, when the Achaemenids took again firm control of the Greek cities of Asia, and they may have been expelled by the Achaemenid satrap Tissaphernes sometime between 412 and 399 BC. In effect, from 414\u00a0BC, Darius II had started to resent increasing Athenian power in the Aegean and had Tissaphernes enter into an alliance with Sparta against Athens, which in 412 BC led to the Persian conquest of the greater part of Ionia.\nPlutarch, in the 1st century\u00a0AD, indicates that he met in Athens a lineal descendant of Themistocles (also called Themistocles) who was still being paid revenues from Asia Minor, 600\u00a0years after the events in question.\nAssessments.\nCharacter.\nIt is possible to draw some conclusions about Themistocles's character. Perhaps his most evident trait was his massive ambition; \"In his ambition he surpassed all men\"; \"he hankered after public office rather as a man in delirium might crave a cure\". He was proud and vain, and anxious for recognition of his deeds. His relationship with power was of a particularly personal nature; while he undoubtedly desired the best for Athens, many of his actions also seem to have been made in self-interest. He also appears to have been corrupt (at least by modern standards), and was known for his fondness of bribes.\nYet, set against these negative traits, was an apparently natural brilliance and talent for leadership:\nThemistocles was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration quite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own native capacity, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his practice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine, whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness of his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency.\nBoth Herodotus and Plato record variations of an anecdote in which Themistocles responded with subtle sarcasm to an undistinguished man who complained that the great politician owed his fame merely to the fact that he came from Athens. As Herodotus tells it:\nTimodemus of Aphidnae, who was one of Themistocles's enemies but not a man of note, was crazed with envy and spoke bitterly to Themistocles of his visit to Lacedaemon, saying that the honors he had from the Lacedaemonians were paid him for Athens' sake and not for his own. This he kept saying until Themistocles replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the Spartans, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of Athens.' Such was the end of that business.\nAs Plato tells it, the heckler hails from the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that it is true that he would not have been famous if he had come from that small island, but that the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in Athens.\nThemistocles was undoubtedly intelligent, but also possessed natural cunning; \"the workings of his mind [were] infinitely mobile and serpentine\". Themistocles was evidently sociable and appears to have enjoyed strong personal loyalty from his friends. At any rate, it seems to have been Themistocles's particular mix of virtues and vices that made him such an effective politician.\nHistorical reputation.\nThemistocles died with his reputation in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the \"saviour of Greece\" had turned into the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450s\u00a0BC, and by the time Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: \"Now on the subject of the high merits of Themistocles, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded.\" Indeed, Diodorus, whose history includes Alexander the Great and Hannibal, goes so far as to say that\nBut if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore, one may well be amazed that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles's character. He does not detract from Themistocles's achievements, but also highlights his failings.\nNapoleon compared himself to Themistocles after the Battle of Waterloo, in his surrender letter;\nRoyal Highness, \u2013 Exposed to the factions which divide my country, and to the enmity of the great Powers of Europe, I have terminated my political career; and I come, like Themistocles, to throw myself upon the hospitality () of the British people. I claim from your Royal Highness the protections of the laws, and throw myself upon the most powerful, the most constant, and the most generous of my enemies.|Napoleon. (letter of surrender to the Prince Regent; translation).\nPolitical and military legacy.\nUndoubtedly the greatest achievement of Themistocles's career was his role in the defeat of Xerxes' invasion of Greece. Against overwhelming odds, Greece survived, and classical Greek culture, so influential in Western civilization, was able to develop unabated. Moreover, Themistocles's doctrine of Athenian naval power, and the establishment of Athens as a major power in the Greek world, were of enormous consequence during the 5th century BC. In 478\u00a0BC, the Hellenic alliance was reconstituted without the Peloponnesian states into the Delian League, in which Athens was the dominant power. This was essentially a maritime alliance of Athens and her colonies, the Aegean islands, and the Ionian cities. The Delian league took the war to Persia, eventually invading Persian territory and dominating the Aegean. Under Pericles' guidance, the Delian league evolved into the Athenian Empire, the zenith of Athenian power and influence. Themistocles seems to have deliberately set Athens up as a rival to Sparta in the aftermath of Xerxes' invasion, basing this strategy on Athenian naval power (contrasted with the power of the Spartan army). Tension grew throughout the century between Athens and Sparta, as they competed to be the leading state in Greece. Finally, in 431\u00a0BC, this tension erupted into the Peloponnesian War, the first of a series of conflicts that tore Greece apart for the next century.\nDiodorus provides a rhetorical summary that reflects on Themistocles's achievements:\nWhat other man, while Sparta still had the superior strength and the Spartan Eurybiades held the supreme command of the fleet, could by his single-handed efforts have deprived Sparta of that glory? Of what other man have we learned from history that by a single act he caused himself to surpass all the commanders, his city all the other Greek states, and the Greeks the barbarians? In whose term as general have the resources been more inferior and the dangers they faced greater? Who, facing the united might of all Asia, has found himself at the side of his city when its inhabitants had been driven from their homes, and still won the victory?Modern scholars have endorsed this view, seeing Themistocles as a quintessential leader and strategist able to transform his city in pursuit of his naval doctrine.\nThe South American plant genus \"Themistoclesia\" (named by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch, 1851) is named in honour of Themistocles.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Quotations related to at Wikiquote"}

As of 2025,[ [update]] it possesses the highest monetary value of any circulating Canadian coin. The toonie is a bi-metallic coin which on the reverse side features an image of a polar bear by artist Brent Townsend. The obverse, since 2023, bears a portrait of King Charles III. It has the words \"Charles III / \"; . \nThe coin is manufactured using a patented distinctive bi-metallic coin-locking mechanism. The coins are estimated to last 20 years. The discontinued two-dollar bill was less expensive to manufacture but lasted only one year on average.\nOn April 10, 2012, the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) announced design changes to the loonie and toonie, which include new security features.\nCoins minted prior to 2012 consist of an aluminum bronze inner core with a pure nickel outer ring; but in March\u2013May 2012, the composition of the inner core switched to aluminum bronze coated with multi-ply plated brass, and the outer ring switched to steel coated with multi-ply plated nickel. The weight dropped from 7.30 to 6.92g, and the thickness changed from 1.8 to 1.75\u00a0mm. The Mint said that multi-ply plated steel technology, already used in Canada's smaller coinage, produces an electromagnetic signature that is harder to counterfeit than that of regular alloy coins; also, using steel provides cost savings and avoids fluctuations in the price or supply of nickel.\nNaming.\n\"Toonie\" is a portmanteau word combining the number \"two\" with the name of the loonie, Canada's one-dollar coin. It is occasionally spelled \"twonie\" or \"twoonie\", but Canadian newspapers and the Royal Canadian Mint use the \"toonie\" spelling.\nJack Iyerak Anawak, member of Parliament from Nunatsiaq (the electoral district representing what is now the territory of Nunavut), suggested the name \"Nanuq\" [nanook, polar bear] in honour of the Inuit and their northern culture; however, this proposal went largely unnoticed beside the popular \"toonie\".\nThe name \"toonie\" became so widely accepted that in 2006, the RCM secured the rights to it. A competition to name the bear resulted in the name \"Churchill\", a reference both to Winston Churchill and to the common polar bear sightings in Churchill, Manitoba.\nLaunch.\nFinance Minister Paul Martin announced the replacement of the $2 banknote with a coin in the 1995 Canadian federal budget speech. The RCM spent to canvass 2,000 Canadian households regarding which of the 10 theme options they preferred.\nUnder the direction of Hieu C. Truong, the RCM engineering division designed the two-dollar coin to be made from two different metals. The metals for the bimetallic coin would be lighter and thinner than those produced anywhere in the world. To join the two parts, the engineering division selected a bimechanical locking mechanism. By the end of 1996, the Winnipeg facility had struck 375 million of these coins. The coin was officially launched at Ben's Deli in Montreal on February 19, 1996.\nThe weight of the coin was originally specified as .\nThe community of Campbellford, Ontario, home to the coin's designer, constructed an toonie monument, similar to the \"Big Loonie\" in Echo Bay and the Big Nickel in Sudbury.\nUnlike the loonie before it, the toonie and the $2 bill were not produced concurrently with each other, as the $2 bill was withdrawn from circulation on February 16, 1996, three days prior to the toonie's introduction.\nSpecimen set editions.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, the Royal Canadian Mint issued a two-dollar coin that depicts a different and unique image of a young animal on the coin's reverse. These special toonies have limited mintages and are available only in the six-coin specimen sets.\nSeparation of metals.\nA failure in the bimetallic locking mechanism in the first batch of toonies caused some coins to separate if struck hard or frozen. Despite media reports of defective toonies, the RCM responded that the odds of a toonie falling apart were about one in 60 million. Deliberately attempting to separate a toonie is considered to be \"defacing coin currency\", a summary offence under section 456 of the Canadian \"Criminal Code\"."}

It is located in the centre of the country, enclosed by mountains and hills, with Dajti rising to the east and a slight valley to the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe, with 2,544 hours of sun per year.\nTirana was founded in 1614 by Ottoman Albanian general Sylejman Pasha Bargjini, centered on the Old Mosque and \"t\u00fcrbe\". The site of present-day Tirana has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age and was likely the core of the Illyrian kingdom of the Taulantii, which in classical antiquity was centred in the hinterland of Epidamnus. Following the Illyrian Wars, it was annexed by the Roman Empire. With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fourth century, most of Albania came under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire. The city was fairly unimportant until the 20th century, when the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed it as Albania's capital after the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912.\nClassified as a gamma-world-city, Tirana is the most important economic, financial, political, and trade centre in Albania due to its significant location in the centre of the country. As the seat of power of the Government of Albania, it hosts the official residences of the President and Prime Minister of Albania and the Parliament of Albania. The city was announced as the European Youth Capital for 2022.\nHistory.\nEarly development.\nThe area of Tirana has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times with the earliest recognised reference found at the Cave of P\u00ebllumbas belonging to the Palaeolithic period. Illyrians were the first population of the area and formed most likely the core of the Illyrian kingdom of the Taulantii, which in classical antiquity was centered in the hinterland of Epidamnus. When the Romans arrived in Illyria after their victory of the Illyrian Wars, they populated and integrated the area into their empire under the political control of the city of Rome. The oldest surviving discovery from this period is a Roman house dating to the 3rd century, which was transformed into an aisleless church with a mosaic floor. A castle, possibly known as \"Tirkan\", was built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I between the 4th and 6th century and later restored by Ahmed Pasha Toptani in the 18th century.\nTirana is mentioned in Venetian documents in the 1350s as well as in 1418: \"...the resident Pjeter, son of late Domenik from the village of Tirana...\". Records of the first land registrations under the Ottomans in 1431\u201332 show that Tirana consisted of 60 inhabited areas, with nearly 2,028 houses and 7,300 inhabitants. In 1510, Marin Barleti, an Albanian Catholic priest and scholar, in the biography of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg, \"Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis\" (\"The story of life and deeds of Skanderbeg, the prince of Epirotes\"), referred to this area as a small village, distinguishing between \"Little Tirana\" and \"Great Tirana\". It is later mentioned in 1572 as \"Borgo di Tirana\".\nAccording to Hahn, the settlement had already started to develop as a bazaar and included several watermills, even before 1614, when Sulejman Bargjini, a local ruler, built the Old Mosque, a small commercial centre, and a \"hammam\" (Turkish bath). This is confirmed by oral sources, which state that there were two earlier mosques 300\u2013400 m from the Old Mosque, towards today's Ali Demi Street. The Mosque of Re\u00e7 and the Mosque of Mujo were positioned on the left side of the Lana River and were older than the Old Mosque. Later, the Et'hem Bey Mosque, built by Molla Bey of Petrela, was constructed. It employed the best artisans in the country and was completed in 1821 by Molla's son Et\u00ebhem, who was also Sulejman Bargjini's great-nephew.\nIn 1800, the first newcomers arrived in the settlement, the so-called \"ortodoksit\". They were Aromanians from villages near Kor\u00e7\u00eb and Pogradec, who settled around modern day Tirana Park on the Artificial Lake. They started to be known as the \"llacifac\" and were the first Christians to arrive after the creation of the town. In 1807, Tirana became the centre of the Subprefecture of Kruj\u00eb-Tirana. After 1816, Tirana languished under the control of the \"Toptani\" family of Kruj\u00eb. Later, Tirana became a sub-prefecture of the newly created Vilayet of Shkod\u00ebr and the Sanjak of Durr\u00ebs. In 1889, the Albanian language started to be taught in Tirana's schools, and the patriotic club Bashkimi was founded in 1908.\nModern development.\nOn 28 November 1912, the national flag was raised in Vlor\u00eb by President Ismail Qemali, marking the symbolic birth of Albania as a sovereign country. The next years, however, were marked by turmoil. During the Balkan Wars, Tirana was temporarily occupied by the Serbian army and it took part in uprising of the villages led by Haxhi Qamili. In August 1916, the first city map was compiled by the specialists of the Austro-Hungarian army. Following the capture of the town of Debar by Serbia, many of its Albanian inhabitants fled to Turkey, the rest went to Tirana. Of those that ended up in Istanbul, some of their number migrated to Albania, mainly to Tirana where the Dibran community (people from Dib\u00ebr County) formed an important segment of the city's population from 1920 onward and for some years thereafter. On 8 February 1920, the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed Tirana as the temporary capital of Albania, which had gained independence in 1912. The city acquired that status permanently on 31 December 1925. In 1923, the first regulatory city plan was compiled by Austrian architects. The centre of Tirana was the project of Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy.\nBrasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.\nThe plan underwent revisions by Albanian architect Eshref Frash\u00ebri, Italian architect Castellani and Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler.\nThe modern Albanian parliament building served as an officers' club. It was there that, in September 1928, Zog of Albania was crowned King Zog I, King of the Albanians.\nTirana was the venue for the signing of the Pact of Tirana between Fascist Italy and Albania.\nDuring the rule of King Zog, many Muhaxhirs migrated towards Tirana, which led to a growing population in the capital city in the early 20th century.\nIn 1939, Tirana was captured by Fascist forces, who appointed a puppet government. In the meantime, Italian architect Gherardo Bosio was asked to elaborate on previous plans and introduce a new project in the area of present-day Mother Teresa Square. A failed assassination attempt was made on Victor Emmanuel III of Italy by a local resistance activist during a visit to Tirana. In November 1941, two emissaries of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ), Miladin Popovi\u0107 and Du\u0161an Mugo\u0161a, called a meeting of three Albanian communist groups and founded the Communist Party of Albania, and Enver Hoxha soon emerged as its leader.\nThe town soon became the centre of the Albanian communists, who mobilised locals against Italian fascists and later Nazi Germans, while spreading ideological propaganda. On 4 February 1944, the Gestapo, supported by the forces of Xhafer Deva, executed 86 anti-fascists in Tirana. On 17 November 1944, the town was liberated after a fierce battle between the Communists and German forces. The Nazis eventually withdrew and the communists seized power.\nFrom 1944 to 1991, massive socialist-style apartment complexes and factories were built, while Skanderbeg Square was redesigned, with a number of buildings demolished. For instance, Tirana's former Old Bazaar and the Orthodox Cathedral were razed to the ground in order to build the Soviet-styled Palace of Culture. The northern portion of the main boulevard was renamed Stalin Boulevard and his statue was erected in the city square. Because private car ownership was banned, mass transportation consisted mainly of bicycles, trucks and buses. After Hoxha's death, a pyramidal museum was constructed in his memory by the government.\nBefore and after the proclamation of Albania's policy of self-imposed isolationism, a number of high-profile figures paid visits to the city, such as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer. In 1985, Enver Hoxha's funeral was held in Tirana. A few years later, Mother Teresa became the first religious figure to visit the country after the end of Albania's long anti-religious atheist stance. She paid respects to her mother and sister resting at a local cemetery.\nStarting at the campus and ending at Skanderbeg Square with the toppling of Enver Hoxha's statue, the city saw significant demonstrations by University of Tirana students demanding political freedoms in the early 1990s. On the political aspect, the city witnessed a number of events. Personalities visited the capital, such as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Pope John Paul II.\nThe former visit came amidst the historical setting after the fall of communism, as hundreds of thousands were chanting in Skanderbeg Square Baker's famous saying of \"Freedom works!\".\nPope John Paul II became the first major religious leader to visit Tirana, though Mother Teresa had visited few years prior.\nDuring the Balkans turmoil in the mid-1990s, the city experienced dramatic events such as the unfolding of the 1997 unrest in Albania and a failed coup d'\u00e9tat on 14 September 1998.\nIn 1999, following the Kosovo War, Tirana Airport became a NATO airbase, serving its mission in the former Yugoslavia.\nContemporary.\nDuring his term from 2000 to 2011, the former mayor of Tirana, Edi Rama, undertook a campaign to demolish illegal constructed buildings across Tirana as well as along the river banks of Lan\u00eb to bring the area to its pre-1990 state. In an attempt to widen roads, Rama authorized the bulldozing of private properties so that they could be paved over, thus widening streets. Most main roads underwent reconstruction, including the Unaza, Rruga e Kavaj\u00ebs and the main boulevard. Rama also led the initiative to paint the fa\u00e7ades of Tirana's buildings in bright colours, although much of their interiors continued to degrade. Rama's critics claimed that he focused too much attention on cosmetic changes without fixing any of the major problems such as shortages of drinking water and electricity.\nIn June 2007, George W. Bush traveled to Tirana on an official state visit, becoming the first U.S. President to visit the former communist country. In 2008, the G\u00ebrdec explosions were felt in the capital as windows were shattered and citizens shaken. In January 2011, the Albanian opposition demonstrations were triggered in front of the governmental buildings in Tirana protesting against political corruption and state capture, particularly associated with the former prime minister Sali Berisha's government. In September 2014, Pope Francis made an official state visit to Tirana simultaneously becoming the second pontiff to visit Albania, after Pope John Paul II in 1992.\nFollowing the municipal elections of 2015, power was transferred from the Democratic Party representative Lulzim Basha to the Socialist Party candidate Erion Veliaj. Albania then underwent a territorial reform, in which defunct communes were merged with municipalities. Thirteen of Tirana's former communes were integrated as administrative units joining the existing eleven.\nSince then, Tirana is undergoing significant changes in infrastructure, law enforcement and new projects, as well as continuing the ones started by Veliaj's predecessor. In their first few council meetings, 242 social houses got allocated to families in need. Construction permits were suspended until the capital's development plan is revised and synthesized.\nBetween December 2018 and February 2019, a series of demonstrations erupted in the central areas of Tirana and other cities of the country in response to a controversial law on higher education, poor quality of teaching, high tuition rates and corruption. In September 2019, Tirana was ravaged by a 5.6 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter located near Durr\u00ebs. Two months after, in November 2019, another strong earthquake with the magnitude of 6.4 hit the region again resulting in comparatively few damages in Tirana. The same month, Tirana was announced as the European Youth Capital for 2022 with a planned program including events of cultural and social importance.\nIn December 2022, Tirana hosted the EU-Western Balkans summit, marking the inaugural summit to be held outside the European Union's borders. On 21 September 2024, it was reported that Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama was planning to create the Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order, a sovereign microstate for the Order within Tirana.\nGeography.\nTirana extends at the Plain of Tirana in the centre of Albania between the mount of Dajti in the east, the hills of K\u00ebrrabe, Sauk and Vaqarr in the south, and a valley to the north overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The average altitude is about above sea level, with a maximum of at Maja Mincekut of Mali me Gropa in Shenmeri.\nThe city is surrounded by two important protected areas: the Dajti National Park and Mali me Gropa-Biz\u00eb-Martanesh Protected Landscape. In winter, the mountains are often covered with snow and are a popular retreat for the population of Tirana, which rarely receives snowfalls. In terms of biodiversity, the forests are mainly composed of pine, oak and beech, while its interior relief is dotted with canyons, waterfalls, caves, lakes and other landforms. Thanks to its natural heritage, it is considered the \"Natural Balcony of Tirana\". The mountain can be reached by a narrow asphalt mountain road onto an area known as Fusha e Dajtit. From this small area there is a view of Tirana and its plain.\nTiran\u00eb river flows through the city, as does the Lan\u00eb river. Tirana is home to several artificial lakes, including Tirana, Farka, Tufina, and Kashar. The present municipality was formed in the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities of Baldushk, B\u00ebrzhit\u00eb, Dajt, Fark\u00eb, Kashar, Krrab\u00eb, Ndroq, Petrel\u00eb, Pez\u00eb, Sh\u00ebngjergj, Tirana, Vaqarr, Zall-Bastar and Zall-Herr, which became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the city of Tirana.\nClimate.\nTirana has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification and receives enough precipitation during summer to avoid the Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\") classification.\nThe average precipitation in Tirana is about per year. The city receives the majority of precipitation in winter months, which occurs from November to March, and less in summer months, from June to September. In terms of precipitation, both rain and snow, the city is ranked among the wettest cities in Europe.\nTemperatures vary throughout the year from an average of in January to in July. Springs and summers are very warm to hot often reaching over from May to September. During autumn and winter, from November to March, the average temperature drops and is not lower than . The city receives approximately 2500 hours of sun.\nUrbanism.\nIn September 2015, Tirana organized its first vehicle-free day, joining forces with numerous cities across the globe to fight against the existing problem of urban air pollution. This initiative resulted in a considerable drop in both air and noise pollution, encouraging the Municipality to organise a vehicle-free day every month.\nThe city suffers from problems such as waste management, high levels of air pollution and significant noise pollution.\nOver the last decades, air pollution has become a pressing concern as the number of cars has increased. These are mostly 1990s and early 2000s diesel cars, while it is widely believed that the fuel used in Albania contains larger amounts of sulfur and lead than in the European Union. Effective 1 January 2019, the government has imposed an import ban of used vehicles made prior to 2005 in an effort to curb pollution, encourage the buying of new cars from certified domestic dealerships, and to improve overall road safety. Another source of pollution are PM10 and PM2.5 inhaled particulate matter and NO2 gases resulting from rapid growth in the construction of new buildings and expanding road infrastructure.\nUntreated solid waste is present in the city and outskirts. Additionally, there have been complaints of excessive noise pollution. Despite the problems, the Grand Park at the Artificial Lake has some effect on absorbing CO2 emissions, while over 2.000 trees have been planted around sidewalks.\nWorks for four new large parks have started in the summer of 2015 located in Kashar, Fark\u00eb, Vaqarr, and Dajt. These parks are part of the new urban plan striving to increase the concentration of green spaces in the capital. The government has included designated green areas around Tirana as part of the Tirana Greenbelt where construction is not permitted or limited.\nPolitics.\nAdministration.\n \n11 \n10 \n9 \n8 \n7 \n6 \n4 \n3 \n1 \n2 \n5 \nThe municipality of Tirana is encompassed in the County of Tirana within the Central Region of Albania and consists of the rural administrative units of Baldushk, B\u00ebrzhit\u00eb, Dajt, Fark\u00eb, Kashar, Krrab\u00eb, Ndroq, Petrel\u00eb, Pez\u00eb, Sh\u00ebngjergj, Vaqarr, Zall-Bastar, Zall-Herr and Tirana. The administrative unit of Tirana is further partitioned into eleven urban administrative units, namely Tirana 1, Tirana 2, Tirana 3, Tirana 4, Tirana 5, Tirana 6, Tirana 7, Tirana 8, Tirana 9, Tirana 10 and Tirana 11.\nThe Mayor of Tirana along with the Cabinet of Tirana exercises executive power. The Assembly of Tirana functions as the city parliament and consists of 55 members, serving four-year terms. It primarily deals with budget, global orientations and relations between the city and the Government of Albania. It has 14 committees and its chairman is Aldrin Dalipi from the Socialist Party. Each of the members have a specific portfolio such as economy, finance, juridical, education, health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.\nIn 2000, the centre of Tirana from the central campus of University of Tirana in the Mother Teresa Square up to the Skanderbeg Square, was declared the place of Cultural Assembly, and given state protection. The historical core of the capital lies around pedestrian only Murat Toptani Street, while the most prominent city district is Blloku. In 2010, the municipality undertook the installing of street name signs and entrance numbers while every apartment entrance was physically stamped.\nNational capital.\nTirana is the capital city of the Republic of Albania thus playing an essential role in shaping the political and economic life of the country. It is the home to government functions and institutions for which the government of Albania is responsible, as for instance the executive, juridical and legislative branches of Albania.\nThe President and Prime Minister of Albania officially reside and work in Tirana specifically at the Presidenca and Kryeministria, respectively, nevertheless the Parliament of Albania is headquartered at the D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard. Tirana is also the home to the national Constitutional Court and Supreme Court. Important national institutions housed in Tirana include the Appeal Court and Administrative Court.\nThe Bank of Albania is located at the Skanderbeg Square while other institutions such as the ministries of Culture, Defence, Education, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Health, Infrastructure, Internal Affairs, Justice and Tourism are spread over Tirana. The city is also the home to all the consulates and embassies in Albania, thereby making it an important centre for international diplomacy in the country.\nInternational relations.\nTirana is a founding member of the Union of Albanian Municipalities in the Region. Tirana is twinned with Ankara, Beijing, Bursa, Doha, Florence, Kharkiv, Sarajevo and has signed partnership agreements with Verona and Zagreb. It has also signed special bilateral agreements with Zaragoza.\nEconomy.\nTirana is the heart of the economy of Albania and the most industrialised and economically fastest growing region in Albania. Of the main sectors, the tertiary sector is the most important for the economy of Tirana and employs more than 68% of work force of Tirana. 26% of the working population makes up the secondary sector followed by the primary sector with only 5%.\nThe city began to develop at the beginning of the 16th century as it was part of the Ottoman Empire, when a bazaar was established, and its craftsmen manufactured silk and cotton fabrics, leather, ceramics and iron, silver and gold artefacts. In the 20th century, the city and its surrounding areas expanded rapidly and became the most heavily industrialised region of the country.\nThe most significant contribution is made by the tertiary sector which has developed considerably since the fall of communism in Albania. Forming the financial centre of the country, the financial industry is a major component of the city's tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to privatization and the commendable monetary policy. All of the most important financial institutions, such as the Bank of Albania and the Albanian Stock Exchange are centred in Tirana as well as most of the banking companies such as the Banka Komb\u00ebtare Tregtare, Raiffeisen Bank, Credins Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank and Tirana Bank.\nThe telecommunication industry represents another major and growing contributor to the sector. A rapid development occurred as well as after the end of communism and decades of isolationism mainly due to the new national policy of reform and opening up sped up the industry's development. Vodafone, Telekom Albania and Eagle are the leading telecommunication providers in Tirana, as in all the country.\nThe tourism industry of the city has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the economy. Tirana has been officially dubbed as 'The Place Beyond Belief' by local authorities. The increasing number of international arrivals at the Tirana International Airport and Port of Durr\u00ebs from across Europe, Australia and Asia has rapidly grown the number of foreign visitors in the city.\nThe largest hotels of the city are the Tirana International Hotel, Maritim Plaza Tirana both situated in the heart of the city near Skanderbeg Square, and the Hyatt-owned luxury Mak Hotel Tirana located next to the Air Albania Stadium, where Mariott Tirana Hotel is also planned to open. Other major hotels present in central Tirana include the Rogner Hotel, Hilton Garden Inn Tirana, Xheko Imperial Hotel, Best Western Premier Ark Hotel, and Mondial Hotel.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nAir.\nTirana is served by N\u00ebn\u00eb Tereza International Airport, which is simultaneously the premier air gateway to the country. The airport was officially named in honour of the Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary, Mother Teresa. It connects Tirana with many destinations in different countries across Europe, Africa, and Asia. The airport carried more than 3.3 million passengers in 2019 and is also the principal hub for the country's flag carrier, Air Albania.\nRoad.\nThe city's geographical location in the centre of Albania has long established the city as an integral terminus for the national road transportation, thus connecting the city to all parts of Albania and the neighbouring countries. The Rruga Shtet\u00ebrore 1 (SH1) connects Tirana with Shkod\u00ebr and Montenegro in the north, and constitutes an essential section of the proposed Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway. The Rruga Shtet\u00ebrore 2 (SH2) continues in the west and provides direct connection to Durr\u00ebs on the Adriatic Sea. The Rruga Shtet\u00ebrore 3 (SH3) is being transformed to the Autostrada 3 (A3) and follows the ancient Via Egnatia. It significantly constitutes a major section of the Pan-European Corridor VIII and links the city with Elbasan, Kor\u00e7\u00eb and Greece in the south. Tirana is further connected, through the Milot interchange in the northwest, with Kosovo following as part of the Autostrada 1 (A1).\nDuring the communist regime in Albania, a plan for the construction of a ring road around Tirana arose in 1989 with no implementation until the 2010s. It is of major importance, especially concerning the demographic growth of the metropolitan region of Tirana as well as the importance of the economy. Although, constructions for the nowadays completed southern section of the ring road started in 2011, however, the northern and eastern sections are still in the planning process.\nRail.\nRail lines of Hekurudha Shqiptare (HSH) connected Tirana with all of the major cities of Albania, including Durr\u00ebs, Shkod\u00ebr and Vlor\u00eb. In 2013, the Tirana Railway Station was closed and moved to Kashar by the city government in order to create space for the New Boulevard () project. The new Tirana Station will be constructed in Laprak\u00eb, which is projected to be a multifunctional terminal for rail, tram and bus transportation. City officials have also talked about a light rail extension all the way to the location of the former rail station.\nThe new rail line from Tirana through N\u00ebn\u00eb Tereza International Airport to Durr\u00ebs has started construction.\nIn 2012, the Tirana municipality published a report according to which a project on the construction of two tram lines was under evaluation. The tram lines would have a total length of . The plan was never implemented. Under the plan, the two tram lines would have intersected in Skanderbeg Square. The public transport in Tirana is, for now, focused only in the city centre, so that the people living in the suburbs have fewer or no public transport connections.\nBus.\nTirana's bus network is its primary and only system of public transport. The system has 16 lines serving the urban core, with another 14 suburban lines serving its outer regions. The urban network is made up of 8 radial lines, 5 diagonal lines, and 3 circular or semi-circular lines.\nBusses often get stuck in traffic. There were only of dedicated bus lines in 2020.\nThere were 451 bus stops on the entire urban network in 2020, extending to over . Services operate every day, regardless of holidays and weekends, from 06:00 to 24:00. The entire network had an average headway of 9 minutes on a daily basis in 2018 and in the first half of 2019.\nNearly 257,000 residents lived within a walking area from a bus stop when surveyed in Tirana\u2019s strategic transport study in 2019. That was approximately 35% of the population living inside the Municipal unit of Tirana.\nA single-ride ticket costs 40 Lek, and no hourly or daily options are available. Disabled people and veterans may ride for free. An electronic ticketing system is under implementation.\nCycling.\nDuring the administration of mayor Erion Veliaj, the government of Tirana has significantly increased the creation and expansion of a cycling infrastructure in the city in order to reduce traffic congestion as well as to improve the sustainable transportation. Ecovolis was launched in 2011 offering rental services for bicycles at different centrally located stations for a small fee. The international bicycle sharing system, Mobike, launched its operations on 8 June 2018 by deploying 4000 bicycles in the city. Both services were discontinued.\nSafe cycling paths are still relatively rare, despite improvements in recent years. Paths are often blocked by parked cars or construction. Other obstructions which decrease ride quality, such as drain holes, are also prevalent. There were only around of cycling routes in 2020.\nEducation.\nTirana has the highest concentration of institutions of tertiary education in Albania, consisting of numerous academies, colleges and universities. Most prominent among these is the University of Tirana with campuses around the city and more than 28,000 students from all backgrounds. The Polytechnic University of Tirana is another distinguished institution and also the most renowned engineering and technical university in the country. The four other public institutions in Tirana are the University of Arts, University of Agriculture, University of Medicine and University of Sports.\nThe educational system of Tirana has expanded substantially over the past years with the renovations of existing school facilities and the construction of new schools. For primary and secondary education, a variety of schools are available, tagged with the public, private and international labels. Some of the international schools are the Tirana International School, Albanian International School, British School, Montessori School, Memorial School and World Academy. The public primary and secondary Servete Ma\u00e7i School won an award at the 2020 International Architecture Awards.\nHealth.\nThere are numerous public and private hospitals as well as smaller public and private health care facilities in the territory of Tirana. The Mother Teresa University Hospital is one of the largest medical tertiary institutions of the country. Other medical institutions include the Shefqet Ndroqi University Hospital, Ko\u00e7o Gliozheni Hospital, Mbret\u00ebresha Gjeraldin\u00eb Hospital and the Military Hospital.\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2023 census, the municipality of Tirana had 598,176 residents, of whom 583,963 were born in Albania and 14,213 abroad. With a population density of 502 people per square kilometre, Tirana is the most densely populated municipality in the country. The encompassing metropolitan area, consisting of the regions of Durr\u00ebs and Tirana, has a combined population of approximately 1 million, amounting to nearly one third of the country's total population.\nHistorically, Tirana has experienced a steady population increase, especially after the fall of communism in the late twentieth century as well as the beginning of the twenty-first century. The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fuelled by migrants from all over the country, often in search of employment and improved living conditions. Between 1820 and 1955, the population of Tirana tenfolded, while during the period from 1989 to 2011 the city's population grew annually by approximately 2.7%. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city had a rate of growth of less than 1% annually until the 1970s, then down to less than 8% per year until the middle 20th century figures.\nAmong residents born in Albania, the majority were born in Tirana itself (310,084), but the municipality has long been the principal internal migration destination in the country. Large communities trace their birthplace to Dib\u00ebr (38,612), Kor\u00e7\u00eb (35,667), Fier (30,290), Berat (30,254), Kuk\u00ebs (27,246), Elbasan (26,258) and Gjirokast\u00ebr (25,885), with additional groups from Shkod\u00ebr (18,226), Vlor\u00eb (15,599), Durr\u00ebs (14,371) and Lezh\u00eb (11,471). The inflows from north-eastern mountainous prefectures such as Dib\u00ebr and Kuk\u00ebs, from the south-eastern and southern interior around Kor\u00e7\u00eb, Berat, Gjirokast\u00ebr and Elbasan, and from coastal areas including Durr\u00ebs, Vlor\u00eb and Lezh\u00eb illustrate a predominantly rural-to-urban and intra-regional migration pattern oriented toward the capital. These movements intensified after the early 1990s, when internal mobility restrictions were lifted, and include both long-distance migration from remote highland municipalities and short-distance relocation within central Albania. The resulting settlement pattern combines older urban neighbourhoods with rapidly urbanised former rural areas on the city\u2019s outskirts and along main transport corridors. This wide geographic spread reflects the city\u2019s dominant role as Albania\u2019s administrative, educational and economic centre and has contributed to its rapid demographic expansion and increasing social diversity since the early 1990s.\nAccording to the 2023 Population and Housing Census profile for Tirana County, the population is predominantly of Albanian ethnicity (91.0%), followed by small minorities of Greeks (0.26%), Aromanians (Vlachs) (0.10%), Macedonians (0.06%), Montenegrins (0.03%), Roma (0.22%), Egyptians (0.13%), Bosniaks, Serbs, Bulgarians and Italians (each below 0.05%). About 8% of residents did not declare or provided no ethnic affiliation. The majority of inhabitants reported Albanian as their mother tongue (94.7%), with smaller proportions declaring Greek (0.4%), Aromanian (0.2%), or other and multiple languages (1.1%).\nThe life expectancy at birth in Tirana is 82.8 years, 84.5 years for women and 81 years for men, exceeding that of wealthier capital cities in Western Europe such as Vienna and Berlin.\nReligion in Tirana.\nIn Albania, a secular state with no state religion, the freedom of belief, conscience and religion is explicitly guaranteed in the constitution of Albania. Tirana is religiously diverse and has many places of worship catering to its religious population whom are adherents of Islam, Christianity and Judaism but also of Atheism and Agnosticism. They all maintain their Albanian headquarters spread across the territory of Tirana. Nevertheless, the Bektashi Order leadership established their world centre also in the city.\nNotes\nIn the 2011 census, 55.7% of the population of the municipality of Tirana was counted as Muslim, 3.4% as Bektashis and 11.8% as Christian including 5.4% as Roman Catholic and 6.4% as Eastern Orthodox. The remaining 29.1% of the population reported having no religion or did not provide an adequate answer. The 2023 census did not publish municipality level religious statistics for Tirana. County level results for Tirana County, where the municipality accounts for the clear majority of residents (598,176 out of 758,513, 78.86%), reported the following composition: 48.67% Islam (Sunni or non denominational), 4.94% Bektashi, 5.01% Orthodox, 4.66% Catholic, 0.75% Evangelical or other Christians, 3.65% atheists, 15.54% believers without a religion/denomination, and 16.70% not stated or other.\nThe Roman Catholic Church is represented in Tirana by the Archdiocese of Tiran\u00eb and Durr\u00ebs, with the St Paul's Cathedral as the seat of the prelacy. The Albanian Orthodox community is served by the Archbishop of Tirana in the Resurrection Cathedral.\nCulture.\nTirana offers a blend of traditional and modern lifestyle with a variety of arts, food, entertainment, music and night life. Its population celebrates a wide range of religious and other festivals including Christmas, Eid, Hanukkah and Nowruz. Another festival is Dita e Ver\u00ebs taking place every year on 14 March, during which the Albanians celebrate the end of winter and the arrival of spring.\nAmong the local institutions are the National Library, that keeps more than a million books, periodicals, maps, atlases, microfilms and other library materials. The city has five well-preserved traditional houses (museum-houses), 56 cultural monuments, eight public libraries.\nThere are many domestic and foreign cultural institutions in Tirana, amongst them the British Council, Canadian Institute of Technology as well as the German Goethe-Institut and Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Other cultural institutions include the Chinese Confucius Institute, Greek Hellenic Foundation for Culture, Italian Istituto Italiano di Cultura and the French Alliance Fran\u00e7aise.\nArchitecture.\nTirana is home to a mixture of architectural styles reflecting the influential periods in its history. Its current appearance was considerably shaped by two totalitarian regimes, once by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini during the Second World War and the regime of Enver Hoxha in the aftermath. The Palace of Brigades, the ministries buildings, the government building and the municipality hall are designed by Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, both well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy. The D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard was built in 1930 and given the name King Zog I Boulevard.\nIn the 20th century, the part from Skanderbeg Square up to the train station was named Stalin Boulevard. The Royal Palace or Palace of Brigades previously served as the official residence of King Zog I. It has been used by different Albanian governments for various purposes. Because of the outbreak of World War II, and the 1939 Italian invasion of Albania, Zog I fled Albania and never had a chance to see the Palace fully constructed. The Italians finished it and used it as the Army Headquarters. The Palace took its nickname Palace of Brigades because it was taken from the Italians by a people's army brigade.\nIn the 21st century, Tirana turned into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces. In June 2016, the Mayor of Tirana Erion Veliaj and the Italian architect Stefano Boeri announced the start of the works for the redaction of the Master Plan \"Tirana 2030\".\nTirana is a densely-built area and still offers several public parks throughout its districts, graced with green gardens. The Grand Park is the most important green space in Tirana. It is one of the most visited areas by local citizens. The park includes many children's playgrounds, sport facilities and landmarks such as the Saint Procopius Church, the Presidential Palace, the Botanical Gardens, the Tirana Zoo, the Amphitheatre, the Monument of the Frash\u00ebri Brothers and many others.\nThe Rinia Park was built during the Communist era. It bordered by D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard to the east, Gjergi Fishta Boulevard and Bajram Curri Boulevard to the south, Rruga Ibrahim Rugova to the west and Rruga Myslym Shyri to the north. The Taivani Centre is the main landmark in the park and houses caf\u00e9s, restaurants, fountains, and a bowling lane in the basement. The Summer Festival takes place every year in the park, to celebrate the end of winter and the rebirth of nature and a rejuvenation of spirit amongst the Albanians.\nAs of 2020, it was announced that the Municipality of Tirana will build more green spaces and will plant more trees.\nMuseums.\nTirana is the home to a number of museums dedicated to a wide array of arts. The National Museum of History is located at the Skanderbeg Square and the most representative museum of Tirana. The mosaic above the entrance is the most dominant feature of the museum displaying the story of how the Albanian people have fought against invasion and occupation throughout history.\nFounded in 1948, the National Museum of Archaeology at the Mother Teresa Square displays a wide collection of research and discoveries belonging to the archaeological locations around Albania. It exhibits span from prehistory through antiquity and the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, offering an overview of the country's historical diversity.\nThe National Art Gallery is considered the most important gallery in Albania housing one of the greatest collections of paintings in the region. Located at the D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard, it holds approximately 4.500 works of art including the most important collection of Albanian art of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nThe Bunk'art Museum consists of two underground bunkers built under the orders and direction of Hoxha during the communist era. Located at the Fadil Deliu Street and Abdi Toptani Street respectively, the bunkers have been transformed into a history museum and contemporary art gallery with exhibits from the Second World War and Cold War.\nThe Museum of Secret Surveillance was founded in 2017 and is housed within a twentieth century mansion, the building known as the \"House of Leaves\", near the D\u00ebshmor\u00ebt e Kombit Boulevard. It commemorates and honours the victims who fell to the communist terrorism and violence during the communist period in Albania. Other museums include the Natural Sciences Museum, which has branches in zoology, botany and geology, the former Enver Hoxha Museum and the Bunk'art Museum.\nThe Bektashi Museum was opened at the World Headquarters of the Bektashi on 7 September 2015. The museum contains exhibits relating to Bektashi history and leadership.\nCuisine.\nAs in other parts of Albania, agricultural traditions are of great significance to the Albanians in Tirana, substantially appreciated for the production of food such as cheese, olives and wine. In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffee houses per capita in the world with 654 coffee houses per 100,000 inhabitants. This is due to coffee houses closing down in Spain due to the economic crisis, and the fact that as many cafes open as they close in Albania. In addition, the fact that it was one of the easiest ways to make a living after the fall of communism in Albania, together with the country's Ottoman legacy further reinforce its strong dominance in Albania.\nThe Tirana region is known for the Fergesa traditional dish made with either peppers or liver, and is found at a number of traditional restaurants in the city and agri-tourism sites on the outskirts of Tirana.\nSports.\nBeing the capital, Tirana is the centre of sport in Albania, where activity is organised across amateur and professional levels. It is home to many major sporting facilities. Starting from 2007, the Tirana Municipality has built up to 80 sport gardens in most of Tirana's neighborhoods. One of the latest projects is the reconstruction of the existing Olympic Park, that will provide infrastructure for most intramural sports.\nTirana hosted in the past three major events, the 2006 European Promotion Cup for Men, 2011 World Mountain Running Championships and the 2013 European Weightlifting Championships.\nThere are two major stadiums, the former Qemal Stafa Stadium and the Selman St\u00ebrmasi stadium. The former was demolished in 2016 to make way for the new national stadium. The new stadium called the \"Air Albania Stadium\" was constructed on the same site of the former Qemal Stafa Stadium and opened in November 2019. It will have an underground parking, Marriott Tirana Hotel, shops and bars and will be used for entertainment events. Tirana's sports infrastructure is developing fast because of the investments from the municipality and the government.\nFootball is the most widely followed sport in Tirana as well as in the country, having numerous club teams including the KF Tirana, Partizani Tirana, and Dinamo Tirana. It is popular at every level of society, from children to wealthy professionals. In football, as of April 2012, the Tirana-based teams have won a combined 57 championships out of 72 championships organised by the FSHF, i.e. 79% of them. Another popular sport in Albania is basketball, represented in particular by the teams KB Tirana, BC Partizani, BC Dinamo, Ardhm\u00ebria and also the women's PBC Tirana.\nRecently two rugby teams were created: Tirana Rugby Club, founded in 2013 and Ilir\u00ebt Rugby Club founded in 2016.\nMedia.\nAs the capital, Tirana is the most significant location for the Albanian media industry whose content is distributed throughout Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-speaking territories. Tirana is the home to most of the national and international television stations, including the national broadcaster, Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH), along with all its television and radio networks. The three largest Albanian commercial broadcasters, such as Televizioni Klan, Top Channel and Vizion Plus, also maintains their headquarters in the city. The European broadcaster, Euronews, operates a franchise in the city as well as the American broadcaster CNN.\nTirana is also a principal location for the largest Albanian newspapers, magazines and publications. The newspapers with the largest circulations in Albania are published in Tirana, including Gazeta Shqip, Gazeta Tema, Koha Jon\u00eb and Panorama. Gazeta Shqiptare, one of the oldest Albanian-language newspapers in Albania, operates and has its headquarters in the city. Tirana also has a well-established English-language newspaper, notably the daily of Tirana Times.\nNotable people.\nKey of Tirana.\nThe \"Key of Tirana\" () is a symbolic recognition given by the Mayor of Tirana to an esteemed personality.

Hoping to persuade her boss, Geri, to make her a partner at their company, Mary is hired to plan catering heiress Fran Donolly's society wedding to long-term boyfriend \"Eddie\". While reporting her success to her colleague Penny on the phone, Mary's shoe heel gets stuck in a manhole cover. As she struggles to free herself, a taxicab collides with a dumpster that comes hurtling towards her. A nearby man pulls her out of the way of the speeding dumpster just in time, and she thanks him before fainting.\nWaking up in the hospital, Mary meets her rescuer, pediatrician Steve Edison. Penny invites Steve to attend an outdoor movie with them, but makes an excuse to leave the pair alone together. Mary and Steve dance to an alfresco screening of \"Two Tickets to Broadway\" but are interrupted by a heavy downpour before they can kiss.\nAt a dance lesson with a client, Mary encounters Fran, who introduces her to her fianc\u00e9 \"Eddie\", none other than Steve. Fran leaves them to dance together, and Mary angrily rebukes Steve for leading her on behind Fran's back. Penny reminds Mary that her career is more important than her feelings and persuades her to continue planning Fran and Steve's wedding.\nOn a visit to a potential wedding venue in Napa Valley, Massimo appears and, to Mary's horror, introduces himself as her fianc\u00e9. While riding through the estate with Fran's parents, Mrs. Donolly's singing frightens Mary's horse. Steve rescues Mary again and admonishes her for condemning his actions when she was also engaged.\nAt home, Mary scolds her father for trying to set her up with Massimo. Salvatore reveals that his marriage to her mother, which Mary has viewed as the perfect relationship, was arranged and only became a loving relationship months later, leaving Mary conflicted.\nWhile visiting another potential venue, Fran reveals she is going on a week-long business trip and leaves Mary and Steve to continue preparations. They apologize for their angry words and soon become friends. They run into Wendy and Keith, whom Mary reveals was once her fianc\u00e9 until she caught him cheating with Wendy on the night of their rehearsal dinner.\nIntoxicated and struggling to get into her apartment, Mary breaks down, lamenting that Keith is married and expecting a baby while she is alone and miserable. Steve gets Mary inside and comforts her as she sobers up, insisting that Keith was a fool to pick Wendy over her. Steve leaves but quickly returns and confesses his feelings for Mary. She replies that she respects Fran too much to let anything happen between them and sends Steve away.\nFran confesses to Mary that she is unsure if she is still in love with Steve. Ignoring her own heart, Mary convinces Fran to continue with the wedding. At a birthday party, Massimo offers Mary a heartfelt proposal, and she reluctantly accepts; the two couples prepare for their respective weddings. Leaving Penny to coordinate the Donolly wedding, Mary goes to marry Massimo at the town hall. Steve asks Fran if they are doing the right thing, and she admits that she does not want to get married. They part amicably, Fran leaving to enjoy their honeymoon alone. Penny reveals Mary's marriage plans to Steve, and he rushes to stop her.\nAt the town hall, Massimo and Mary prepare to marry, but her father stops the ceremony, realizing the wedding is not what Mary wants. Mary, having given up on true love, insists that life is not a fairy tale and that marrying Massimo is the right thing to do but realizes he is not the one for her and leaves.\nSteve arrives to find Salvatore and Massimo, who reveals that he could not proceed with the wedding knowing Mary was actually in love with Steve. Steve reveals his feelings to Salvatore, who encourages him to go after her. Steve and Massimo ride off on Massimo's scooter to the park, where another outdoor movie is starting. Steve finds Mary, asks her to dance, and they kiss.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jennifer Lopez as Mary Fiore\nProduction.\nCasting.\nThe original actors set to play Mary and Steve were Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brendan Fraser, respectively. They were replaced with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Both couples eventually dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" for Gellar, leaving Lopez and McConaughey to be the eventual stars.\nFilming.\nMany of the scenes were shot in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, specifically at the Music Concourse (between the old De Young Museum and the old California Academy of Sciences), the Japanese Tea Garden and The Huntington Library and Gardens. The first wedding ceremony is filmed inside the chapel at Stanford University.\nReception.\n\"The Wedding Planner\" was released in the United States on January 26, 2001, by Sony Pictures Releasing.\nBox office.\n\"The Wedding Planner\" grossed $60.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $34.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $94.7 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, the film grossed $13.5 million from 2,785 theaters on its opening weekend (the Super Bowl weekend), opening at number one at the box office. Lopez's second album \"J.Lo\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 the same week, making Lopez the first entertainer to achieve a number-one album and film simultaneously in the same week.\nCritical response.\n\"The Wedding Planner\" received generally negative reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The consensus reads, \"Instead of being light and charming, this romantic comedy is heavy-handed and contrived in its execution. Also, it's too unoriginal.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Lisa Schwarzbaum compared the film unfavorably to \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", writing, \"Where Julia Roberts turned the world on with her huggability, Lopez's vibe is that of someone afraid to get mussed. And where Rupert Everett was divine as a sidekick, McConaughey is mortally ordinary as a main dish who spends most of his time smiling like a party guest.\" Kimberly Jones of \"The Austin Chronicle\" noted that the two leading characters being mistreated was the biggest disappointment from \"The Wedding Planner\", feeling that while Lopez and McConaughey have \"enormous charisma\" (referencing Lopez's work on 1998's \"Out of Sight\" as an example), the \"blandness of \"The Wedding Planner\" burlap-sacks their appeal in an altogether dowdy outing for two stars who deserve much snazzier threads.\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the \"undeniable charisma\" of the film's stars along with their \"goofiness\" makes \"\"The Wedding Planner\" more painless than it has a right to be.\" \"Variety\"'s Robert Koehler described \"The Wedding Planner\" as \"an attractive bridesmaid but hardly a gorgeous bride among romantic comedies.\" Michael Thomson from the BBC wrote, \"Unfortunately, after the two leads become less wired in each other's presence, and the sexual tension begins to droop, everyone seems to be reading an autocue.\" For her role in the film, Lopez was nominated for Worst Actress at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31080", "revid": "990344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31080", "title": "The Problem of Pain", "text": "1940 book by C. S. Lewis on the problem of evil and the existence of God\nThe Problem of Pain is a 1940 book on the problem of evil by C. S. Lewis, in which Lewis argues that human pain, animal pain, and hell are not sufficient reasons to reject belief in a good and powerful God.\nLewis states that his writing is \"not \"primarily\" arguing the truth of Christianity but describing its origin \u2013 a task ... necessary if we are to put the problem of pain in its right setting\". He begins by addressing the flaws in common arguments against the belief in a just, loving, and all-powerful God such as: \"If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\" Topics include human suffering and sinfulness, animal suffering, and the problem of hell, and seeks to reconcile these with an omnipotent force beyond ourselves.\nSummary.\nIntroduction.\nLewis starts with his former atheistic stance and paints in broad strokes the \"problem of pain\". He asks how, if the world is so bad, did humans ever attribute it to a benevolent deity? He then describes three attributes that all developed religions have and a fourth attribute peculiar to Christianity.\nDivine Omnipotence.\nLewis states the problem of pain again in a simpler way: \"If God were good, He would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty, He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore, God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\"\nLewis says that if the popular meanings attached to the words are the best or only possible then the problem is unanswerable. The possibility of answering it depends on understanding the words 'good,' 'almighty,' and 'happy' in a bigger sense.\nHe discusses the nature of \"impossible\" with the conclusion that anything self-contradictory is not under the auspice of God\u2019s omnipotence because it would be a non-entity; anything is possible with God.\nLewis then talks about the nature of nature/matter. Because there are things outside an individual and God, things cannot be configured to suit the individual perfectly. He also introduces the concept of Free Will and how that further inhibits everyone being pain-free all the time, although he does allow and say miracles do exist. Lewis postulates that maybe this world is not the 'best of all possible' universes but the only possible one. \nHe acknowledges the objection that if God is good and he saw how much suffering it would produce why would he do it. Lewis doesn\u2019t know how to answer that type of question and says that that is not his objective, but only to conceive how goodness (assured on other grounds) and suffering are without contradiction.\nDivine Goodness.\nLewis draws an analogy to compare our understanding of goodness to that of God\u2019s. He says it differs like that of a child\u2019s attempt at drawing a circle for the first time to that of a perfect circle. He goes on to say that people don\u2019t want a good God or a Father but a \"senile benevolence who likes to see the young people enjoying themselves.\" Love and kindness are not one and the same thing. Lewis then summarizes all the different kinds of loves and analogies in scripture that describe God\u2019s relation to humans. Lewis says that the problem of pain is insoluble if we attach a \"trivial meaning to the word \u2018love\u2019.\" God loves His goodness into us and our highest activity is response and not initiation; the love may cause us pain but only because the object needs alteration to become fully lovable.\nHuman Wickedness.\nLewis starts off by asking why humans need so much alteration. Immediately he shares the Christian answer that humans have used free will to become very bad. He then talks about when Jesus and the apostles preached people understood a real consciousness deserving a divine anger, but in the 20th century people don\u2019t believe they are \"mortally ill\". He blames misattributing kindness to ourselves and the effect of psychoanalysis on the public mind for driving out a healthy sense of shame from our collective minds.\nLewis acknowledges the critique of what specific, individual harm have we done to God for God to be always angry. Lewis says that when a person feels real guilt, this critique falls away. \"When we merely say that we are bad, the \u2018wrath\u2019 of God seems a barbarous doctrine; as soon as we perceive our badness, it appears inevitable, a mere corollary from God\u2019s goodness.\" \nHe then goes on to add a few considerations \"to make the reality less incredible\".\nLewis then says that he doesn\u2019t believe in the doctrine of Total Depravity on logical and experiential grounds. Also, shame is of value, not as an emotion but for the insight that it provides. He shares how he notices that the holier a man is the more fully aware he is of his vileness.\nThe Fall of Man.\nLewis explains how the Christian answer to human wickedness is the doctrine of the Fall: \"Man is now a horror to God and to himself and a creature ill-adapted to the universe not because God made him so but because he has made himself so by the abuse of his free will.\"\nHe details two \"sub-Christian\" theories which the doctrine of the Fall guards against: Monism and Dualism. The first saying God, being above good and evil, produces impartially the effects to which we call good and evil. The second saying there\u2019s an equal and independent power that produces evil.\nLewis says that he doesn\u2019t think the doctrine of the Fall answers whether it was better for God to create or not to create. Or if it is \u2018just\u2019 to punish individuals for the faults of their remote ancestors.\nHe then reviews the story from Genesis 3 and follows it with an argument saying that we cannot call our early ancestors more \u2018savage\u2019 than we are today. He gives a defense of civilizations past and says they were probably just as civilized like us but in different ways.\nHe concludes that science has nothing to say against the doctrine of the Fall, but acknowledges a more philosophical problem. That the idea of sin presupposes a law to sin against and the first man could not commit the first sin. Lewis points out though that the doctrine doesn\u2019t say the sin was a social sin but a sin against God, an act of disobedience. Lewis says, \"We must look for the great sin on a deeper and more timeless level than that of social morality.\" \nLewis shares how Saint Augustine called this sin Pride and all humans face it when they become aware of God as God and itself as self. He gives a few illustrations of this choice then paints a picture of what he guesses actually happened when Man fell.\nAfter his illustration, Lewis says, \"the act of self-will on the part of the creature, which constitutes an utter falseness to its creaturely position, is the only sin that can be conceived as the Fall\". God then began \"ruling\" Man not by the laws of the spirit but by the laws of nature. Therefore, the human spirit moved from being the master of human nature to become a mere lodger or prisoner in its own house. Lewis then says this condition was passed down biologically. He says that our present condition is because we are a part of a spoiled species, not that we\u2019re suffering for the rebellion of remote ancestors.\nLewis says that his explanation is shallow for he has said nothing about the trees of life and knowledge of good and evil, and nothing about what the apostle Paul has said on the subject. He also uses an analogy to quantum physics in that when we try to draw illustrations we are moving further away from reality. He does use an example from the Old Testament to show how original sin might have been passed down if we take a more communal/societal view of things. He sums up the chapter by saying \"man, as a species, spoiled himself, and that good, to us in our present state, must therefore mean primarily remedial or corrective good\".\nHuman Pain.\nHe says that pain is inherent in a world where souls meet and souls acting wickedly towards each other probably accounts for four-fifths of the World\u2019s pain. And he says it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask why humans are given permission to torture each other. He refines his previous statement that the people can only experience remedial good and says it\u2019s an incomplete answer. He classifies pain into two senses: 1) a physical sensation and 2) any experience, physical or mental, that person dislikes.\nHe says that the proper aim of any creature is to self-surrender \u2013 to offer back the will which we claim as our own, and this necessity is a daily occurrence which is inherently painful. He says this process is made easier through pain itself because 1) people would not surrender if all was well, so pain is recognizable and unmasked evil; \"every man knows something is wrong when he is being hurt\". 2) Pain shatters the illusion that we have enough for ourselves. 3) We know we\u2019re acting for God\u2019s sake if the material action of our choice is painful or at least contrary to our inclinations.\nFor the first, Lewis says sadists and masochists are no different, they just isolate and exaggerate an aspect of normal pleasure. The sadists exaggerates the moment of union by saying \"I am such a master that I even torment you\" and the masochist exaggerates the complementary side by saying \"I am so enthralled that I welcome even pain at your hands.\" If these people recognized pain for what it was, their habits would cease to provide a pleasurable stimulus.\nTo underline his point he says probably the most famous line from this book: \"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\"\nHe says that a recognition of this truth underlies the universal feeling that bad men ought to suffer \u2013 a sense of retribution. While some people want to do away with retribution, Lewis says that to do so would make all punishment unjust and any act to correct behavior would contradict itself. On another level, Lewis says that we experience a thirst for revenge. This passion though loses sight of the end in the means.\nHe notes how biblical ancestors probably meant retribution when they spoke of God\u2019s \u2018vengeance\u2019. Pain gives the only opportunity for bad men to amend.\nHuman Pain, Continued.\nIn this chapter Lewis discusses six propositions that are not connected but need saying for a complete view of human pain:\nHell.\nLewis restates that allowing free will means that some people will choose rebellion and not all will be saved. He says that there was no other doctrine that he wished he could remove more, that it has the support of scripture, Jesus Christ himself, and reason. While some overdo it and tragedies have come from espousing the doctrine, Christians preach it because it is a terrible possibility and its horrors are worse.\nLewis then states the real problem: \"so much mercy, yet still there is Hell\". He first says that the doctrine is not tolerable but it is moral. Then lays out the ordinary objections and his responses to them.\n1) Many people, Lewis says, object to retributive punishment. He reminds readers of a previous chapter of how he showed a core of righteousness in punishment/pain and how it could lead to repentance. But what if the punishment didn\u2019t lead there? He asks the reader if they could really allow a wicked person to go forever into eternity happy and thinking they had the last laugh? If a person wouldn\u2019t allow that, then is that feeling their own wickedness or spite? Or does it reveal the conflict between Justice and Mercy? He quotes Aquinas and Aristotle who says that suffering and shame, respectively, are not good in and of themselves but as a means to an end. He finishes his response to this objection by saying \"to condone an evil is simply to ignore it, to treat it as if it were good\".\nBefore going to the next objection Lewis references Christ\u2019s words about Hell. In addition to Hell being like a sentence given at a tribunal, Christ says that men prefer darkness to light and that men choose Hell as a final act of cutting themselves off from all things that are not themselves.\n2) The second objection Lewis responds to is the disproportion between eternal damnation and transitory sin: if hell is for eternity then it as a punishment far outweighs anything we could do on earth. Lewis responds by first saying that the idea of eternity as a mere prolongation of time is uncertain and offers his metaphor for what eternity might really look like. He also says that a finality of judgment must come some time and omniscience would know when.\n3) A third objection is the \"fruitful intensity of the pains of hell\" as depicted famously in medieval art and passages of scripture. Lewis says destruction implies the creation of something else, like ashes, gases, and heat after burning a log, so what if Hell is the \u2018remains\u2019 of souls? Then Lewis says, \"What is cast (or casts itself) into hell is not a man: it is \u2018remains\u2019. To be a complete man means to have the passions obedient to the will and the will offered to God: to have been a man \u2013 to be an ex-man or \u2018damned ghost\u2019 \u2013 would presumably mean to consist of a will utterly centered in its self and passions utterly uncontrolled by the will.\" He then finishes off suggesting \"hell is hell, not from its own point of view, but from the heavenly point of view\".\n4) The fourth objection he states is that no \"charitable man\" blessed in heaven could stay there while even one human soul was in hell, and if so would he be more merciful than God? Lewis says that this objection assumes that heaven and hell \"co-exist in unilinear time\" like the histories of two countries. Lewis points to Christ who emphasizes not the point of duration but that of finality. He says that we know more about heaven than we do of hell \"for heaven is the home of humanity\u2026 It is in no sense parallel to heaven: it is \u2018the darkness outside\u2019, the outer rim where being fades away into nonentity\".\n5) The final objection says that the ultimate loss of a single soul means the defeat of omnipotence. Lewis agrees that it does. He says that by creating beings with free will God submits to the possibility of such a defeat. Lewis calls this defeat a miracle, \"for to make things which are not Itself and thus to become, in a sense, capable of being resisted by its own handiwork, is the most astonishing and unimaginable of all feats we attribute to a deity\".\nLewis concludes the chapter by saying that all answers to objections of hell are themselves a question: \"What are you asking God to do?\" Whatever it is you would like God has already done. To forgive them? It is already done. To leave them alone? That is what He does. Also, Lewis reminds the reader that in discussing Hell we should not keep our friends and enemies before our eyes since both obscure reason, but to think of ourselves.\nAnimal Pain.\nLewis turns his attention to another facet of the problem of pain, that of animal pain. He says the Christian explanation for human pain doesn\u2019t work because so far as we can see animals are incapable of sin or virtue so they neither deserve pain nor are improved by it. It is not an unimportant question, though, since all \"plausible grounds for questioning the goodness of God is very important indeed\".\nLewis admits that whatever we say about animal pain is purely speculative. He says that we can deduce from the doctrine that God is good that the appearance of cruelty in the animal kingdom is an illusion. But everything after that is guesswork he says.\nHe continues though by ruling out another speculation. He says that the ruthless biological competition has no moral importance: good and evil only appear with sentience. \nLewis raises three questions: 1) why do animals suffer? 2) how did disease and pain enter the animal world? 3) how can animal suffering be reconciled with the justice of God?\nAlthough admitting that we don\u2019t know the answer to the first question he still offers his guesses. He begins by distinguishing between types of animals then distinguishing between sentience and consciousness. He says that sentience is experiencing a \"succession of perceptions\" where consciousness sees the experiences a part of a larger whole. For example, a sentient being would have the experience of thing A then thing B then thing C where consciousness sees it as having the experience of ABC. He says humans are sentient but unconscious when they are sleepwalking.\nLewis allows that some higher form animals (like apes and elephants) might have a rudimentary individual self but says that their suffering might not be suffering in any real sense and humans might be projecting themselves onto the beasts.\nAnswering the second question, Lewis says that the Fall of Man could have brought about animal suffering. Animal nature could have also been corrupted prior to Adam by Satan because the \"intrinsic evil of the animal world lies in the fact that some animals live by destroying each other\". Lewis pontificates that Man might have been brought into the World to perform a redemptive function.\nLastly, Lewis responds to the question of justice and animal suffering by making somewhat of a joke. He says that if one wants to make room for animal immortality, although the scriptures are silent, then \"a heaven for mosquitoes and a hell for men could very conveniently be combined\". He goes on though to say that the objection of scripture\u2019s silence would be fatal only if Christian revelation intended to be a system to answer all questions. Lewis says that \"the curtain has been rent at one point, and at one point only, to reveal our immediate practical necessities and not to satisfy our intellectual curiosity\".\nHe says though, assuming that their selfhood is not an illusion, animals cannot be considered in and of themselves. \"Man is to be understood only in his relation to God. The beasts are to be understood only in their relation to man and, through man, to God.\" Lewis then tries to correct the notion that many people have that the \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018natural\u2019 animal is the wild one while the tame animal is unnatural. Lewis says that Christians must believe that since they were given dominion over beasts that everything they do concerning them is either a lawful exercise or a sacrilegious abuse. So the tame animal is the only natural one and any real self it has is owed entirely to its master, and if the animal does have immortality it is through their master. Lewis admits that he\u2019s only talking about a privileged case and not about wild animals or those ill-treated domestic ones.\nLewis says that Christians hesitate to suppose animal immorality for two reasons: 1) it would obscure the spiritual difference between beast and man and 2) it would be a clumsy assertion of Divine goodness.\nHe continues with further speculations before concluding the chapter saying, \"I think the lion, when he has ceased to be dangerous, will still be awful: indeed, what we shall then first see that of which the present fangs and claws are a clumsy, and satanically perverted, imitation. There will still be something like the shaking of a golden mane: and often the good Duke will say, \u2018Let him roar again.\u2019\"\nHeaven.\nLewis starts off the last chapter of the book by stating that not mentioning heaven is \"leaving out almost the whole of one side of the account\" and would not be a Christian one. \nHe says that we don\u2019t need to be afraid that heaven is a bribe because heaven offers us nothing that \"a mercenary soul can desire\", that the pure in heart will see God because they are the only ones who want to. \"Love, by definition, seeks to enjoy its object\" like a man wanting to marry the woman he loves.\nLewis paints the picture that there\u2019s a signature on each soul that we\u2019re aware of but don\u2019t have all the details about and that we can never really possess. He says heredity and environment might produce this signature but those are only the instruments by which God creates a soul. \"The mold in which a key is made would be a strange thing, if you had never seen a key: and the key itself a strange thing if you had never seen a lock.\" \nHe continues to paint a beautiful illustration of heaven and how it would fit every real, human desire we ever had. How you, listener, will behold Him and not another. \"God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love.\" He goes on \"The world is like a picture with a golden background, and we the figures in that picture. Until you step off the plane of the picture into the large dimensions of death you cannot see the gold.\"\nIf this opinion is false, he says, then something better than his opinion is waiting. That heaven is \"doubtless the continually successful, yet never complete, attempt by each soul to communicate its unique vision to all others (and that by means whereof earthly art and philosophy are but clumsy imitations) is also among the ends for which the individual was created. For union exists only between distincts.\" Lewis shows how this is even demonstrated in the Trinity: \"The Father eternally begets the Son and the Holy Ghost proceeds: deity introduces distinction within itself so that the union of reciprocal loves may transcend mere arithmetical unity or self-identity.\"\nLewis furthers the illustration saying that the soul is a hollow that God continually fills in eternity followed by a constant emptying, self-dying, self-giving by the soul so as to become more truly itself. This self-sacrifice, Lewis says, is not something we can escape by remaining earthly or being saved. \"What is outside this self-giving is simply and solely Hell\". This \"holy game\" is a party led by God himself where he gives Himself eternally and receives Himself back in sacrifice.\nHe finishes by saying that \"all pains and pleasures we have known on earth are early initiations in the movements of that dance\u2026 it does not exist for us, but we for it\".\nAppendix.\nLewis takes this opportunity to color in some lines using some clinical experiences from a fellow Inkling \u2013 Dr. R. Havard. He talks about the effects of physical and mental pain, the latter of which Lewis says is the hardest to bear and less visible. He points out the phenomenon that many recognize and answer the challenge of pain and preserve their serenity and selflessness and sometimes produce brilliant work and sharpen their characters into tempered steel.\nHe concludes the book by saying \"Pain provides an opportunity for heroism; the opportunity is seized with surprising frequency.\"\nRelation to other works.\nLewis' philosophical approach in \"Problem of Pain\" bears some similarity to his later, more personal, approach to the problem of evil in \"A Grief Observed,\" a reflection on his own experiences of grief and anguish after the death of his wife.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The size of teaspoons ranges from about . For dosing of medicine and, in places where metric units are used, for cooking purposes, a teaspoonful is defined as , and standard measuring spoons are used.\nCutlery.\nA teaspoon is a small spoon suitable for stirring and sipping the contents of a cup of tea or coffee, or adding a portion of loose sugar to it. These spoons have heads more or less oval in shape. Teaspoons are a common part of a place setting.\nTeaspoons with longer handles, such as iced tea spoons, are commonly used also for ice cream desserts or floats. Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon, the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals. Much less common is the coffee spoon, which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for use with the small type of coffee cup.\nAnother teaspoon, called an \"orange spoon\" (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes. A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks.\nA container designed to hold extra teaspoons, called a \"spooner\", usually in a set with a covered sugar container, formed a part of Victorian table service.\nHistory.\nThe teaspoon is a European invention. Small spoons were common in Europe since at least the 13th century. These special spoons were introduced almost simultaneously with tea and coffee in the mid-17th century. Originally teaspoons were exotic items, precious and small, resembling the demitasse spoons of the later times. \nAlso used for coffee, these spoons were usually made of gilt silver, and were available with a variety of handle shapes: plain, twisted, decorated with knobs, also known as \"knops\", hence the \"knop-top\" name for such spoons. Widespread use and modern size date back to the Georgian era. \nThe teaspoon is first mentioned in an advertisement in a 1686 edition of the \"London Gazette\". Teaspoons, probably of English origin, are present on the 1700 Dutch painting by Nicholas Verkolje, \"A Tea Party\".\nA special dish for resting the teaspoons, a \"spoon boat\", was a part of the tea set in the 18th century. At that time, the spoons were playing important role in the tea drinking etiquette: a spoon laid \"across\" the teacup indicated that the guest did not need any more tea, otherwise, the hostess was obligated to offer a fresh cup of tea, and it was considered impolite to refuse the offering. Sometimes the spoons were numbered to make it easier to match the cups with the guests after a refill.\nUnit of measure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nIn some countries, a teaspoon (occasionally teaspoonful) is a cooking measure of volume, especially widely used in cooking recipes and pharmaceutic medical prescriptions. In English it is abbreviated as \"tsp.\" or, less often, as \"t.\", \"ts.\", or \"tspn.\". The abbreviation is never capitalized because a capital letter is customarily reserved for the larger tablespoon (\"Tbsp.\", \"T.\", \"Tbls.\", or \"Tb.\").\nA small scale study in Greece found that household teaspoons are a poor approximation of the standard tsp measure. The study investigated the accuracy of teaspoons as a measuring tool for liquid medicine. They surveyed 71 teaspoons from 25 houses and found that the volume varied between .\nMetric teaspoon.\nThe metric teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure is 5\u00a0mL, equal to , &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 international metric tablespoon, or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 Australian metric tablespoon.\nUnited States customary unit.\nAs a unit of culinary measure, one teaspoon in the United States is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 tablespoon, exactly \u00a0millilitres (mL), 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 US customary fluid drams, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20446 US customary fl. oz, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204448 US cup, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044768 US liquid gallon, or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;77\u2044256\u00a0(0.30078125)\u00a0cubic inches.\nFor nutritional labeling and medicine in the US, the teaspoon is defined the same as a metric teaspoon\u2014precisely 5\u00a0millilitres (mL).\nBritish culinary measurement unit.\nTraditionally, in the United Kingdom, 1 teaspoon is 1 British imperial fluid drachm (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448 British imperial fluid ounce). 1 UK teaspoon is the equivalence of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 UK tablespoon, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 UK dessert spoon, or 2 UK salt spoons.\nDry ingredients.\nFor dry granular or powdered ingredients (e.g., salt, flour, spices, and especially beverages involving tea and sugar), a recipe may call for the spoon to be filled in a certain way that changes the volume of the ingredient. As with much of cooking, these measures are by their nature inexact. This can be exacerbated here by failing to use a real teaspoon: a teaspoon's greater area supports considerably more to be heaped above it than a deeper hemispherical measuring spoon, so if using a measuring spoon, one will typically use less than called for by the recipe. \nThe definitions of \"spoonful\" vary. In American recipes, a \"spoon\" without clarification stands for a \"level\" spoon, with no ingredient showing above the rim of the spoon bowl. A British cookbook would mean a \"round\" or \"heaped\" spoon, with the ingredient peaking above the rim: \nLincoln used the spoon measure without adjectives to define either a rounded one (for flour and sugar) or a level one (for salt and spices).\nApothecary.\nAs an unofficial but once widely used unit of apothecaries' measure, the teaspoon is equal to 1\u00a0fluid dram (or drachm) and thus &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 of a tablespoon or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448 of a fluid ounce. The apothecaries' teaspoon was formally known by the Latin \"cochleare minus\" (\"cochl. min.\") to distinguish it from the tablespoon or \"cochleare majus\" (\"cochl. maj.\").\nWhen tea-drinking was first introduced to England circa 1660, tea was rare and expensive, as a consequence of which teacups and teaspoons were smaller than today. This situation persisted until 1784, when the Commutation Act reduced the tax on tea from 119% to 12.5%. As the price of tea declined, the size of teacups and teaspoons increased. By the 1850s, the teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure had increased to of a tablespoon, but the apothecary unit of measure remained the same. Nevertheless, the teaspoon, usually under its Latin name, continued to be used in apothecaries' measures for several more decades, with the original definition of one fluid dram.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In many English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving. In some regions, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating.\nBy extension, the term is also used as a cooking measure of volume. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \"tbsp.\" or \"Tbsp.\" and occasionally referred to as a tablespoonful to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States liquid tablespoon is approximately 14.8\u00a0mL, exactly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 US fluid ounce; about 0.52 imperial fluid ounce. A British tablespoon is approximately 14.2\u00a0mL, exactly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 imperial fluid ounce; about 0.48 US fluid ounce.\nAn international metric tablespoon is exactly 15\u00a0mL, about 0.53 imperial fluid ounce or 0.51 US fluid ounce. An Australian metric tablespoon is 20\u00a0mL, about 0.7 imperial fluid ounce or 0.68 US fluid ounce. The capacity of the utensil, as opposed to the measurement, is defined by neither law nor custom but only by preferences, and may or may not significantly approximate the measurement.\nDining.\nBefore about 1700, it was customary for Europeans to bring their own spoons to the table. Spoons were carried as personal property in much the same way as people today carry wallets, key rings, etc. From about 1700 the place setting became popular, and with it the \"table-spoon\" (hyphenated), \"table-fork\" and \"table-knife\". Around the same time the tea-spoon and dessert-spoon first appeared. The table-spoon was reserved for eating soup. The 18th century witnessed a proliferation of different sorts of spoons, including the mustard-spoon, salt-spoon, coffee-spoon, and soup-spoon.\nIn the late 19th century UK, the dessert-spoon and soup-spoon began to displace the table-spoon as the primary implement for eating from a bowl, at which point the name \"table-spoon\" took on a secondary meaning as a much larger serving spoon. In 1928, when the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was published, \"tablespoon\", which by then was no longer hyphenated, still had two definitions in the UK: the original definition (eating spoon) and the new definition (serving spoon).\nVictorian and Edwardian era tablespoons used in the UK are often 25\u00a0mL, about 0.88 imperial fluid ounce or 0.85 US fluid ounce, or sometimes larger. They are used only for preparing and serving food, not as part of a place-setting. Common tablespoons intended for use as cutlery, called dessert spoons in the UK, where a tablespoon is always a serving spoon, usually hold 7\u201314\u00a0mL, about 0.25\u20130.49 imperial fluid ounce or 0.24\u20130.47 US fluid ounce, considerably less than some tablespoons used for serving.\nCulinary measure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nNaming.\nIn recipes, an abbreviation like \"tbsp.\" is usually used to refer to a tablespoon, to differentiate it from the smaller teaspoon (\"tsp.\"). Some authors capitalize the abbreviation, as \"Tbsp.\", while leaving \"tsp.\" in lower case, to emphasize that the larger tablespoon, rather than the smaller teaspoon, is wanted. The tablespoon abbreviation is sometimes abbreviated to \"Tb.\" or \"T\".\nTraditional definitions.\nIn most places, one tablespoon equals three teaspoons. In Australia and the UK, one tablespoon equals four teaspoons.\nInternational metric.\nAn international metric tablespoon is exactly equal to 15\u00a0mL. It is the equivalence of 1 metric dessert spoons or 3 metric teaspoons.\nAustralian metric.\nThe Australian metric tablespoon is different from that of the rest of the world. The Australian official definition of the tablespoon as a unit of volume is:\nThis definition was promulgated by the Metric Conversion Board in the 1970s, as part of the country\u2019s metrication process. There is not a distinct Australian metric dessert spoon or metric teaspoon.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, 1 tablespoon is traditionally 4 British imperial fluid drachms [newer source needed]( British imperial fluid ounce).\nUnited States.\nThe traditional U.S. interpretation of the tablespoon as a unit of volume is:\nIn nutrition labeling in the U.S., a tablespoon is defined as 15\u00a0mL, about 4.22 British imperial fluid drachms (0.53 British imperial fluid ounce) or 4.06 US customary fluid drams, 0.51 US customary fluid ounce.\nDry measure.\nFor dry ingredients, if a recipe calls for a \"level tablespoon\", the usual meaning without further qualification, is measured by filling the spoon and scraping it level. In contrast, a \"heaped\", \"heaping\", or \"rounded\" spoonful is not leveled off, and includes a heap above the spoon. The exact volume of a heaped tablespoon depends somewhat on the shape and curvature of the measuring spoon being used and largely upon the physical properties of the substance being measured, and so is not a precise unit of measurement. If neither a rounded nor a level tablespoon is specified, a level tablespoon is used, just as a cup of flour is a level cup unless otherwise specified.\nApothecary measure.\nIn the 18th century, the table-spoon became an unofficial unit of the apothecaries' system of measures, equal to 4\u00a0drams (\u00a0fl\u00a0oz, 14.8\u00a0\u00a0mL). It was more commonly known by the Latin name \"cochleare majus\" (abbreviated \"cochl. maj.\") or, in apothecaries' notation, \"f\u2125ss\" or \"f\u2125\u00df\" (fluid \u2125, i.e. ounce, semis, one-half).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were especially popular during the 1960s, with their best-known configuration of Judith Durham on vocals, piano and tambourine; Athol Guy on double bass and vocals; Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar, banjo and vocals; and Bruce Woodley on guitar, mandolin, banjo and vocals.\nThe group had Top 10 hits in the 1960s with \"I'll Never Find Another You\", \"A World of Our Own\", \"Morningtown Ride\", \"Someday, One Day\", \"Georgy Girl\" and \"The Carnival Is Over\". Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as \"concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock\". In 1967, they were named as joint \"Australians of the Year\" \u2013 the only group thus honoured. In July 1968, Durham left to pursue a solo career, and the group disbanded. Keith Potger formed a new group in the UK, the New Seekers; they had their first hit single in 1971 with \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\".\nIn 1995, the Seekers were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011. Woodley's and Dobe Newton's song \"I Am Australian\", which was recorded by the Seekers as well as Durham with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu, has become an unofficial Australian anthem. With \"I'll Never Find Another You\" and \"Georgy Girl\", the group also achieved success in the United States, but not nearly at the same level as in the rest of the world. The Seekers have sold over 50 million records worldwide and were individually honoured as Officers of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 2014.\nEarly years.\nThe Seekers were formed in 1962 in Melbourne by Athol Guy on double bass, Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar, and Bruce Woodley on guitar. Guy, Potger, and Woodley had all attended Melbourne Boys High School in Victoria. In the late 1950s, Potger led the Trinamics, a rock 'n' roll group, Guy led the Ramblers and, joining with Woodley, they decided to form a doo-wop music group, the Escorts. The Escorts had Ken Ray as the lead singer, and in 1962 they became \"The Seekers\". Ray left the group to get married. His place was taken by Judith Durham, an established traditional jazz singer who added a distinctive female lead voice. She had earlier recorded an extended play disc on W&amp;G Records with the Melbourne group Frank Traynor's Jazz Preachers.\nDurham and Guy had met when they both worked in an advertising agency \u2013 initially Durham only sang periodically with the Seekers, when not performing at local jazz clubs. She was replaced in Traynor's jazz ensemble by Margret RoadKnight. The Seekers performed folk-influenced pop music and soon gathered a strong following in Melbourne. Durham's connections with W&amp;G Records led to the group's later signing a recording contract with the label. Their debut album, \"Introducing the Seekers\", was released in 1963. Their debut single, released in mid-1963, was the African American spiritual song \"Kumbaya\". Their second single was the traditional historic Australian bush ballad from 1894, \"Waltzing Matilda\", which appeared in November and which reached the Melbourne \"Top\u00a040\" singles chart. and peaked at number 74 on the national chart. When being photographed for the album's cover, Potger was replaced by Ray \u2013 his day job with the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) as a radio producer barred him from involvement in a commercial enterprise.\nDiscovery in the United Kingdom.\nThe Seekers were offered a twelve-month position as on-board entertainment on the Sitmar Line passenger cruise ship \"Fairsky\" in March 1964. In May, they travelled to the UK and had intended to return to Australia after staying ten weeks, but upon arrival they were offered work by a London booking agency, the Grade Organisation. They signed there with World Record Club and issued a single, \"Myra\", co-written by the group. The group regularly appeared on a British TV show series, \"Call in on Carroll\", hosted by Ronnie Carroll.\nAfter filling in on a bill headlined by singer Dusty Springfield, they met her brother, songwriter and producer Tom Springfield, who had experience with writing folk-pop material and lyrics/tunes with the siblings' earlier group The Springfields. He penned \"I'll Never Find Another You\", which they recorded in November 1964. It was released by EMI Records, on their Columbia Graphophone Company (Columbia)\nlabel, in December and was championed by the offshore radio station \"Radio Caroline\" which frequently played and promoted their music. Despite the fact that the group had not signed a contract with EMI, the single reached the UK \"Top\u00a050\" and began selling well. In February 1965, it reached No.1 in the UK and Australia, and No.4 in the United States where it was released on EMI's Capitol Records label. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" was the seventh biggest-selling single in Britain for 1965 though their own \"The Carnival Is Over\", released later in the year, would eventually eclipse it \u2013 and went on to sell 1.75 million copies worldwide.\nThe Seekers were the first Australian pop group to have a Top\u00a05 hit in Australia, the UK and the US. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as \"concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop oriented to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock\". The distinctive soprano voice of Durham, the group's vocal harmonies, and memorable songs encouraged the British media, including the national broadcasting agency on radio and television, the BBC, to give them exposure, allowing them to appeal to a broad cross-section of the young British folk, pop, and rock music audience.\nString of hits.\nThe Seekers achieved their first success in the United States in 1965 with their gospel hit \"I'll Never Find Another You\" reaching peaks of No. 4 for pop and No. 2 for easy listening on \"Billboard\" magazine charts. They followed \"I'll Never Find Another You\" with the protest song, \"What Have They Done to the Rain?\" in February 1965, which did not chart in the Top\u00a040.\nThe group were named \"Best New Group of 1964\" at the April 1965 \"New Musical Express\" Poll Winners Awards. They appeared at the annual celebratory Wembley Empire Pool concert, on a bill which included the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Dusty Springfield and the Animals. In May, another Tom Springfield composition was issued, \"A World of Our Own\", which reached Top\u00a03 in Australia and the UK and Top\u00a020 in the US. Malvina Reynolds' lullaby \"Morningtown Ride\" was issued in Australia in July and peaked in the Top\u00a010. That same month, Durham had to temporarily leave the group due to emergency nasal surgery; she was replaced on live dates from July to early September by Scottish-born singer Ellen Wade.\nDurham quickly returned to the group, and their next single, \"The Carnival Is Over\", appeared in November 1965. The melody is based on a Russian folk song, while the lyrics were written by Tom Springfield; it reached No. 1 on both the Australian and the UK charts and, at its peak, the single was selling around 93,000 copies a day in the UK alone. However, although \"The Carnival Is Over\" became a signature song for the group, it was not a great success in North America, peaking at No. 105 in the US and missing the Canadian charts completely.\nOn 16 November 1965, they appeared at a Royal Command Performance at the London Palladium before Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\nAlso in 1965, the group met Paul Simon, of the American duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, before the success of The Sound of Silence, who was pursuing a solo career in the UK following the initial poor chart success of the duo's debut LP, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\". Being an itinerant folk singer in London, he met Bruce Woodley (Of the Seekers), and they co-wrote the million-selling Red Rubber Ball. It became an American No. 2 single for an American group, the Cyrkle. \nThe Seekers' version was provided on their 1966 album \"Come the Day\" (released on the album titled \"Georgy Girl\" in the US). Later, in 1966, the Seekers released the Simon-penned \"Someday One Day\", which reached No. 4 in Australia and No. 11 in the UK. Their version was Simon's first UK success as a songwriter and his first major hit as a composer separately from his work with Art Garfunkel. He and Woodley co-wrote two more songs together. Afterwards, however, Woodley's relationship with Simon deteriorated and Woodley later struggled to get his share of the royalties\u2014 for example, his songwriting credit on another song, \"Cloudy\" was omitted from the release of \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\"., and his royalties stolen. Woodley and Simon stopped working together due to the mentioned royalty problems and creative differences, and the collaborations ended after that.\nEarly in 1966, after returning to Australia, the Seekers filmed their first TV special, \"At Home with the Seekers\". In November, a re-recorded version of \"Morningtown Ride\" was released in the UK which reached No. 2. The song had been recorded earlier as an Australian single on the 1964 album \"Hide and Seekers\" and appeared on the 1965 American debut, \"The New Seekers\".\nIn December 1966 they issued \"Georgy Girl\", which became their highest charting American hit when it reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot\u00a0100 and No. 1 on the \"Cashbox\" Top\u00a0100 in February 1967. It was the title song and theme for the British film of the same name starring Lynn Redgrave and James Mason and sold 3.5\u00a0million copies worldwide. They were awarded a gold record certificate by the Recording Industry Association of America. Meanwhile, it was No. 3 in the UK and No. 1 in Australia. Its writers, Jim Dale and Tom Springfield, were nominated for the 1967 Academy Award for Best Original Song of 1966, but the Oscar was won by the title song of the film \"Born Free\".\nIn February 1967, \"Morningtown Ride\" reached the Top\u00a050 in the US.\nReturn to Australia and breakup.\nIn March 1967, the Seekers returned to Australia for a homecoming tour, which included a performance for Music for the People at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, attended by an estimated audience of 200,000. The \"Guinness Book of World Records\" (1968) listed it as the greatest attendance at a concert in the Southern Hemisphere. Melburnians were celebrating the annual Moomba festival, a free community festival, and many thousands were enjoying other attractions but are included in the crowd estimate. The Seekers were accompanied during their 20-minute set by the Australian Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hector Crawford. Film of their appearance was incorporated into their 1967 Australian television special, \"The Seekers Down Under\", which was screened on Channel 7 and drew a then record audience of over 6\u00a0million. It was also screened in the UK on BBC1 on 24 June 1968, and repeated on 27 December 1968. \nIn January 1968, on Australia Day, in recognition of its achievements, the group was named joint Australians of the Year \u2013 the only group of people to have this honour bestowed upon them. They personally accepted their awards from John Gorton, the Prime Minister of Australia, during their tour. During this visit, the group filmed another TV special, \"The World of the Seekers\", which was screened in cinemas before being screened nationally on Channel 9 to high ratings and is in the Top\u00a010 most watched TV shows of the 20th century in Australia.\nOn 14 February 1968, during the New Zealand tour, Durham approached the other group members to announce that she was leaving the Seekers to pursue a solo career and the group subsequently disbanded.Their final performance was on 7 July 1968, and was shown on BBC One as a television special called \"Farewell the Seekers\", with an audience of more than 10\u00a0million viewers. The special had been preceded by a month-long season at London's Talk of the Town nightclub and a live recording of one of their shows was released as a live album, \"Live at the Talk of the Town\". It reached No.\u00a02 on the UK charts. Also in July, the compilation album \"The Seekers' Greatest Hits\" was released and spent 17 weeks at No.\u00a01 in Australia. It was released as \"The Best of The Seekers\" in the UK and spent six weeks at No.\u00a01 in 1969, managing to knock \"The Beatles (White Album)\" off the top of the charts and preventing the Rolling Stones' \"Beggars Banquet\" from reaching the top spot. The album spent 125 weeks in the charts in the UK.\nReunions in the 1970s and 1980s.\nFollowing the Seekers' split, Durham pursued a solo career. She released a Christmas album called \"For Christmas with Love\" (recorded in Hollywood, California) and later signed with A&amp;M Records, releasing more albums including \"Gift of Song\" and \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\". Guy hosted his own TV show in Australia, \"A Guy Called Athol\", before entering politics in 1973, as a member of the Liberal Party. In 1969, Potger formed and managed a new group, the New Seekers, in the UK who also charted highly with their successful song \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)\". Woodley released several solo albums and focused on songwriting, including co-writing the patriotic song \"I Am Australian\" with Dobe Newton (of the Bushwackers) in 1987.\nFrom 1972, Guy, Potger and Woodley planned on reforming the Seekers without Durham. By 1975 they had recruited Louisa Wisseling, a semi-professional folk singer formerly with Melbourne group the Settlers. They had a top\u00a010 Australian hit with the Woodley-penned \"The Sparrow Song\". Woodley left the group in June 1977 and was replaced by Buddy England, a former 1960s pop singer and member of the Mixtures. In 1978, Guy was replaced by Peter Robinson (ex-the Strangers) and Cheryl Webb replaced Wisseling as lead vocalist, leaving only Keith Potger from the original Seekers line-up. In 1980 the group released an album, \"A little bit of Country\", and toured periodically until the mid '80s. In 1988, Guy, Potger and Woodley reformed the Seekers with Julie Anthony, a cabaret singer. In May, the group sang \"The Carnival Is Over\" at the World Expo 88 in Brisbane. In March 1989, the group released the album \"Live On\", which peaked in the top\u00a030 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. In June 1990, Anthony left and was replaced by Karen Knowles, a former teen pop singer on \"Young Talent Time\". However the distinctive timbre and strength of Durham's voice was missing from their sound and the group split again.\n1990s, 2000s and 2010s.\nThe Seekers reunited late in 1992, with the classic line-up of Durham, Guy, Potger and Woodley. In March 1992, all four met together for the first time in 20 years at a restaurant in Toorak, an inner suburb of Melbourne. Before then they had never talked about reforming; they just wanted to get to know each other again. It was two months later that they decided to do a reunion concert, which led to a 102-date tour. The 25-Year Silver Jubilee Reunion Celebration tour in 1993 was sufficiently successful that the group continued to perform and record together, on and off, until shortly before Judith Durham's death in August 2022. From 1993 until 2022 they staged several sell-out tours of Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The group issued several new albums, including the studio albums \"Future Road\" in October 1997 (which peaked at No.\u00a04 on the ARIA Albums Chart) and \"Morningtown Ride to Christmas\" (which reached the top\u00a020 in 2001). Both albums were certified platinum.\nIn 1995, the group were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. In the build up to the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics, an ABC TV satire, \"The Games\", parodied the Seekers in the final episode, \"The End\". Durham had suffered a broken hip and sang \"The Carnival Is Over\" in a wheelchair at the closing ceremony of the related Paralympic Games on 29 October. \"Long Way to the Top\" was a 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation six-part documentary on the history of Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. The Seekers featured on the second episode, \"Ten Pound Rocker 1963\u20131968\", broadcast on 22 August, in which Durham and Woodley discussed their early work on a cruise ship, meeting Tom Springfield and their success in Britain. Four of their songs were played during the episode: \"I'll Never Find Another You\", \"The Carnival Is Over\", \"A World of Our Own\" and \"Georgy Girl\".\nIn October 2002, on the 40th anniversary of their formation, they were the subjects of a special issue of Australian postage stamps. On 1 September 2006, they were presented with the Key to the City by Melbourne's Lord Mayor, John So. In February 2009, the SBS TV program \"RocKwiz\" hosted a 50th anniversary concert at the Myer Music Bowl, \"RocKwiz Salutes the Bowl\", which included \"World of Our Own\" performed by Rebecca Barnard and Billy Miller and \"The Carnival Is Over\" by Durham.\nIn 2004 a DVD, \"The Seekers at Home and Down Under\", was released. It consists of a 1966 television documentary on the Seekers and a 1967 special. The cover includes a photo from the 1966 documentary.\nIn October 2010, \"The Best of the Seekers\" (1968) was listed in the book \"100 Best Australian Albums\". Also in October, they were scheduled to tour various Australian cities in support of violinist Andr\u00e9 Rieu and his orchestra. However, the tour was postponed when Rieu was taken ill. They released another \"Greatest Hits\" compilation in May 2011 which peaked in the top\u00a040. That month they supported Rieu on the rescheduled Australian tour. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of the Sounds of Australia registry in 2011. \"The Seekers' Golden Jubilee Tour\" kicked off 2013 in May, celebrating fifty years since the group had formed in December 1962. Performing in Sydney, Brisbane, Newcastle and Melbourne, they received rave reviews to sold-out audiences. However, Judith Durham suffered a brain haemorrhage after their first concert in Melbourne. The rest of the Australian tour and later-to-be-staged UK tour were postponed; the former continued in November, while the UK tour took place in May and June 2014, ending with two performances at the Royal Albert Hall, London.\nIn November 2015, during a tour of Guy's new group, Athol Guy and Friends, featuring Jenny Blake on vocals, the group were joined by Potger and Woodley for a one-performance fundraiser hosted by the school. The performance featured many of the Seekers' hits as well as other songs that had influenced them over the years. The performance closed with a performance of \"I Am Australian\", which Guy introduced as a song that was pertinent given \"what was happening around the world\" at the time.\nIn 2015, they were inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.\nIn April 2019, the Seekers released \"Farewell\", a live recording from their 2013 50th anniversary tour. Following Durham's retirement from live performance, the group continued as \"The Original Seekers\" with the addition of long-time producer and guitarist and singer Michael Cristiano as the group's \"fourth voice\". In June 2019, they released a new studio album titled \"Back to Our Roots\" also produced by Michael Cristiano. The album features Guy, Potger and Woodley joining with Cristiano on songs they had sung prior to Durham's tenure with the group. The album was released with \"The Original Seekers\" as the group's name.\n2020s.\nOn 28 April 2020, Universal Music Australia announced that a trilogy of Seekers' compilation albums would be released over the following twelve months under the title \"Hidden Treasures\", featuring rarities and lost classics. \"Hidden Treasures \u2013 Volume 1\" was released on 22 May 2020 and peaked at number 21 on the ARIA Charts. \"Volume 2\" was released October the same year.\nIn a 2021 interview, Keith Potger said the group members were considering ways to commemorate their 60th anniversary, in 2022.\nOn 5 August 2022, Judith Durham died from bronchiectasis, a chronic lung disease, at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, aged 79. She was cremated.\nThe Seekers' final recording together, \"Carry Me\", was unveiled by Athol Guy at Durham's state memorial service. Written by Bruce Woodley, the song was completed by Woodley, Potger and Guy adding their vocals and instrumentation to Durham's vocals.\nMillion sellers.\nThe following recordings by the Seekers were each certified as having sold over one million copies: \"I'll Never Find Another You\", \"A World of Our Own\", \"The Carnival Is Over\" and \"Georgy Girl\"; all were written or co-written by Tom Springfield and were each awarded a gold disc. The Seekers have sold over 50 million records worldwide.\nReferences.\nGeneral.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSpecific.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31086", "revid": "1319196480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31086", "title": "Masaccio", "text": "15th-century Italian Renaissance painter\nMasaccio (, ; ; December 21, 1401\u00a0\u2013 summer 1428), born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was a Florentine artist who is regarded as the first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento period of the Italian Renaissance. According to Vasari, Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality. He employed nudes and foreshortenings in his figures. This had seldom been done before him.\nThe name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning \"clumsy\" or \"messy\" Tom. The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as Masolino (\"little/delicate Tom\").\nDespite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists and is considered to have started the Early Italian Renaissance in painting with his works in the mid- and late-1420s. He was one of the first to use linear perspective in his painting, employing techniques such as vanishing point in art for the first time. He moved away from the International Gothic style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like Gentile da Fabriano to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and chiaroscuro for greater realism.\nMasaccio died at the age of twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death. Upon hearing of Masaccio's death, Filippo Brunelleschi said: \"We have suffered a great loss.\"\nEarly life.\nMasaccio was born to Giovanni di Simone Cassai and Jacopa di Martinozzo in Castel San Giovanni di Altura, now San Giovanni Valdarno (today part of the province of Arezzo, Tuscany). His father was a notary and his mother the daughter of an innkeeper of Barberino di Mugello, a town a few miles north of Florence. His family name, Cassai, comes from the trade of his paternal grandfather Simone and granduncle Lorenzo, who were carpenters/cabinet makers (\"casse\", hence \"cassai\"). Masaccio's father died in 1406, when he was only five; later that same year a brother was born, named Giovanni (1406\u20131486) after his father. He also was to become a painter, with the nickname of Lo Scheggia meaning \"the splinter\". In 1412 Monna Jacopa married an elderly apothecary, Tedesco di maestro Feo, who already had several daughters, one of whom grew up to marry the only other documented painter from Castel San Giovanni, Mariotto di Cristofano (1393\u20131457).\nThere is no evidence for Masaccio's artistic education; however, Renaissance painters traditionally began an apprenticeship with an established master around the age of 12. Masaccio would likely have had to move to Florence to receive his training, but he was not documented in the city until he joined the painters guild (the Arte de' Medici e Speziali) as an independent master on January 7, 1422, signing as \"Masus S. Johannis Simonis pictor populi S. Nicholae de Florentia.\"\nFirst works.\nThe first works attributed to Masaccio are the San Giovenale Triptych (1422), now in the Masaccio Museum of Sacred Art in Cascia di Reggello near Florence, and the \"Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\" (Sant'Anna Metterza) (c. 1424) at the Uffizi. The San Giovenale altarpiece was discovered in 1961 in the church of San Giovenale at Cascia di Reggello, very close to Masaccio's hometown. It depicts the Virgin and Child with angels in the central panel, Sts. Bartholomew and Blaise on the left panel, and Sts. Juvenal (i.e. San Giovenale) and Anthony Abbot in the right panel. The painting has lost much of its original framing, and its surface is badly abraded. Nevertheless, Masaccio's concern to suggest three-dimensionality through volumetric figures and foreshortened forms is apparent, and stands as a revival of Giotto's approach, rather than a continuation of contemporary trends. \n The second work was perhaps Masaccio's first collaboration with the older and already-renowned artist, Masolino da Panicale (1383/4\u2013c. 1436). The circumstances of the two artists' collaboration are unclear; since Masolino was considerably older, it seems likely that he brought Masaccio under his wing, but the division of hands in the \"Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\" is so marked that it is hard to see the older artist as the controlling figure in this commission. Masolino is believed to have painted the figure of St. Anne and the angels that hold the cloth of honor behind her, while Masaccio painted the more important Virgin and Child on their throne. Masolino's figures are delicate, graceful and somewhat flat, while Masaccio's are solid and hefty.\nMaturity.\nIn Florence, Masaccio could study the works of Giotto and become friends with Brunelleschi and Donatello. According to Vasari, at their prompting in 1423 Masaccio travelled to Rome with Masolino: from that point he was freed of all Gothic and Byzantine influence, as seen in his altarpiece for the Carmelite Church in Pisa. The traces of influences from ancient Roman and Greek art that are present in some of Masaccio's works presumably originated from this trip: they should also have been present in a lost \"Sagra\", (today known through some drawings, including one by Michelangelo), a fresco commissioned for the consecration ceremony of the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence (April 19, 1422). It was destroyed when the church's cloister was rebuilt at the end of the 16th century.\nBrancacci Chapel.\nIn 1424, the \"duo preciso e noto\" (\"well and known duo\") of Masaccio and Masolino was commissioned by the powerful and wealthy Felice Brancacci to execute a cycle of frescoes for the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. With the two artists probably working simultaneously, the painting began around 1425, but for unknown reasons the chapel was left unfinished, and was completed by Filippino Lippi in the 1480s. The iconography of the fresco decoration is somewhat unusual; while the majority of the frescoes represent the life of St. Peter, two scenes, on either side of the threshold of the chapel space, depict the temptation and expulsion of Adam and Eve. As a whole, the frescoes recount the life of St Peter as if it were the story of salvation. The style of Masaccio's scenes shows the influence of Giotto especially. Figures are large, heavy, and solid; emotions are expressed through faces and gestures; and there is a strong impression of naturalism throughout the paintings. Unlike Giotto, however, Masaccio uses linear and atmospheric perspective, directional light, and \"chiaroscuro\", which is the representation of form through light and color without outlines. As a result, his frescoes are even more convincingly lifelike than those of his trecento predecessor.\nWorks of the chapel.\n\"The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden\", depicts a distressed Adam and Eve, chased from the garden by a threatening angel. Adam covers his entire face to express his shame, while Eve covers her breasts and groin. The fresco had a huge influence on Michelangelo and his work. Another major work is \"The Tribute Money\" in which Jesus and the Apostles are depicted as neo-classical archetypes. Scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window, as if the figures are lit by it; this is an added stroke of verisimilitude and further tribute to Masaccio's innovative genius. In the \"Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus\", he painted a pavement in perspective, framed by large buildings to obtain a three-dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportionate to their surroundings. In this he was a pioneer in applying the newly discovered rules of perspective.\nIn September 1425 Masolino left the work and went to Hungary. It is not known if this was because of money quarrels with Felice or an artistic divergence with Masaccio. It has also been supposed that Masolino planned this trip from the very beginning, and needed a close collaborator who could continue the work after his departure. But Masaccio left the frescoes unfinished in 1426 in order to respond to other commissions, probably coming from the same patron. However, it has also been suggested that the declining finances of Felice Brancacci were insufficient to pay for any further work, so the painter sought work elsewhere.\nMasaccio returned in 1427 to work again in the Carmine, beginning the \"Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus\", but apparently left it, too, unfinished, although it has been suggested that the painting was severely damaged later in the century because it had contained portraits of the Brancacci family, at that time excoriated as enemies of the Medici. This painting was either restored or completed more than fifty years later by Filippino Lippi.\nSome of the scenes completed by Masaccio and Masolino were lost in a fire in 1771; we know about them only through Vasari's biography. The surviving parts were extensively blackened by smoke. In the twentieth century, the removal of marble slabs covering two areas of the paintings revealed the original appearance of the work.\n\"Pisa Altarpiece\".\nOn February 19, 1426, Masaccio was commissioned by Giuliano di Colino degli Scarsi da San Giusto, for the sum of 80 florins, to paint a major altarpiece, the \"Pisa Altarpiece\", for his chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Pisa. The work was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century, and only eleven of about twenty original panels have been rediscovered in various collections around the world. The central panel of the altarpiece (\"The Madonna and Child\") is now in the National Gallery, London. Although it is very damaged, the work features a sculptural and human Madonna as well as a convincing perspectival depiction of her throne. Masaccio probably worked on it entirely in Pisa, shuttling back and forth to Florence, where he was still working on the Brancacci Chapel. In these years, Donatello was also working in Pisa at a monument for Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci, to be sent to Naples. It is suggested that Masaccio's first ventures in plasticity and perspective were based on Donatello's sculpture, before he could study Brunelleschi's more scientific approach to perspective.\n\"Holy Trinity\".\nAround 1427 Masaccio won a prestigious commission to produce a \"Holy Trinity\" for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. No contemporary documents record the patron of the fresco, but recently references to ownership of a tomb at the foot of the fresco have been found in the records of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella Quarter of Florence; this working-class family expressed a long-standing devotion to the Trinity, and may well have commissioned Masaccio's painting. Probably it is the male patron who is represented to the left of the Virgin in the painting, while his wife is right of St. John the Evangelist. The fresco, considered by many to be Masaccio's masterwork, is the earliest surviving painting to use systematic linear perspective, possibly devised by Masaccio with the assistance of Brunelleschi.\nAccording to the reconstruction Masaccio started by producing a rough drawing of the composition and perspective lines on the wall. The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco. To ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the vanishing point under the base of the cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster. The marks of the preparatory works are still visible.\nThe sacred figures and the donors are represented above an image of a skeleton lying on a sarcophagus. An inscription seemingly carved into the wall above the skeleton reads: \"Io fui gia quel che voi siete e quel ch'io sono voi anco sarete\" (I once was what now you are and what I am, you shall yet be). This skeleton is both a reference to Adam, whose sin brought humans to death, and a reminder to viewers that their time on earth is transitory. It is only through faith in the Trinity, the fresco suggests, that one overcomes this death. The Holy Spirit is seen in the form of a dove, above Jesus. The combination of trinity, death and decay \"can be interpreted as a transposition of the Golgotha chapel\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\nOther paintings.\nMasaccio produced two other works, a \"Nativity\" and an \"Annunciation\", now lost, before leaving for Rome, where his companion Masolino was frescoing a chapel with scenes from the life of St. Catherine in the Basilica di San Clemente. It has never been confirmed that Masaccio collaborated on that work, even though it is possible that he contributed to Masolino's polyptych for the altar of Santa Maria Maggiore with his panel portraying \"St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist\", now in the National Gallery, London. Masaccio died at the end of 1428. According to a legend, he was poisoned by a jealous rival painter.\nOnly four frescoes undoubtedly from Masaccio's hand still exist today, although many other works have been at least partially attributed to him. Others are believed to have been destroyed.\nLegacy.\nMasaccio profoundly influenced the art of painting and is considered to have begun the Early Italian Renaissance in painting. He transformed the direction of Italian painting, moving it away from the idealizations of Gothic art, and, for the first time, presenting it as part of a more profound, natural, and humanist world. Moreover, Masaccio influenced a great many artists both while he was alive and posthumously. His influence is particularly notable in the works of Florentine minor masters, such as Andrea di Giusto, Giovanni dal Ponte, and others who attempted to replicate his glowing, lifelike forms, whilst in 1817 Auguste Couder produced \"The Death of Masaccio\".\nVasari wrote in his \"Vite,\" emphasizing especially the importance of the Brancacci chapel: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All the most celebrated sculptors and painters from his time until now have studied his works in the Brancacci chapel, as Lionardo da Vinci, Perugino, the divine Michael Angelo, Raffaello da Urbino, Andrea del Sarto, and many more, and if I have not mentioned many Florentines and strangers who have gone to that chapel to study there, it is because where the heads of the art go, there the members are sure to follow. Yet although his works have always been held in such reputation, it is the firm belief of many that he would have brought forth much greater fruit if death - had not carried him off, at the age of twentysix, so suddenly...\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31088", "revid": "51061992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31088", "title": "Timothy Leary", "text": "American psychologist (1920\u20131996)\nTimothy Francis Leary (October 22, 1920 \u2013 May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and author known for his strong advocacy of psychedelic drugs. Evaluations of Leary are polarized, ranging from \"bold oracle\" to \"publicity hound\". According to poet Allen Ginsberg, he was \"a hero of American consciousness\", while writer Tom Robbins called him a \"brave neuronaut\". President Richard Nixon disagreed, calling Leary \"the most dangerous man in America\". During the 1960s and 1970s, at the height of the counterculture movement, Leary was arrested 36 times.\nAs a clinical psychologist at Harvard University, Leary founded the Harvard Psilocybin Project after an experience with magic mushrooms he had in Mexico in 1960. For two years, he tested psilocybin's therapeutic effects, in the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment. He also experimented with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which was also legal in the US at the time. Other Harvard faculty questioned his research's scientific legitimacy and ethics because he took psychedelics himself along with his subjects and allegedly pressured students to join in. Harvard fired Leary and his colleague Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) in May 1963. Many people learned of psychedelics after the Harvard scandal. Leary continued to publicly promote psychedelic drugs and became a well-known figure of the counterculture of the 1960s; he popularized catchphrases that promoted his philosophy, such as \"turn on, tune in, drop out\", \"set and setting\", and \"think for yourself and question authority\".\nLeary believed that LSD showed potential for therapeutic use in psychiatry. He developed an eight-circuit model of consciousness in his 1977 book \"Exo-Psychology\" and gave lectures, occasionally calling himself a \"performing philosopher\". He also developed a philosophy of mind expansion and personal truth through LSD. He also wrote and spoke frequently about transhumanism, human space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension (SMI\u00b2LE).\nEarly life and education.\nLeary was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, an only child in an Irish Catholic household. His father, Timothy \"Tote\" Leary, was a dentist who left his wife Abigail Ferris when Timothy was 14. He graduated from Classical High School in Springfield.\nLeary attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1938 to 1940. He received a Jesuit education there, and was required to learn Latin, rhetoric, and Greek. Under pressure from his father, he left to become a cadet in the United States Military Academy. In his first months at West Point, he received numerous demerits for rule infractions and then got into serious trouble for failing to report rule breaking by cadets he supervised. He was also accused of going on a drinking binge and failing to admit it, and was asked by the Honor Committee to resign. He refused and was shunned by fellow cadets. He was acquitted by a court-martial, but the silencing continued, as well as the onslaught of demerits for small rule infractions. In his second year, his mother appealed to a family friend, United States Senator David I. Walsh, head of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, who investigated personally. The Honor Committee quietly revised its position and announced that it would abide by the court-martial verdict. Leary then resigned and was honorably discharged by the Army. About 50 years later he said that it was \"the only fair trial I've had in a court of law\".\nTo his family's chagrin, Leary transferred to the University of Alabama in late 1941 because it admitted him expeditiously. He enrolled in the university's ROTC program, maintained top grades, and began to cultivate academic interests in psychology (under the aegis of the Middlebury and Harvard-educated Donald Ramsdell) and biology. Leary was expelled a year later for spending a night in the female dormitory and lost his student deferment in the midst of World War II.\nLeary was drafted into the United States Army and received basic training at Fort Eustis in 1943. He remained in the non-commissioned officer track while enrolled in the psychology subsection of the Army Specialized Training Program, including three months of study at Georgetown University and six months at Ohio State University. With limited need for officers late in the war, Leary was briefly assigned as a private first class to the Pacific War-bound 2d Combat Cargo Group (which he later characterized as \"a suicide command ... whose main mission, as far as I could see, was to eliminate the entire civilian branch of American aviation from post-war rivalry\") at Syracuse Army Air Base in Mattydale, New York. After a fateful reunion with Ramsdell (who was assigned to Deshon General Hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania, as chief psychologist) in Buffalo, New York, he was promoted to corporal and reassigned to his mentor's command as a staff psychometrician. He remained in Deshon's deaf rehabilitation clinic for the remainder of the war.\nWhile stationed in Butler, Leary courted Marianne Busch; they married in April 1945. Leary was discharged at the rank of sergeant in January 1946, having earned such standard decorations as the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.\nAs the war concluded, Leary was reinstated at UA and received credit for his Ohio State psychology coursework. He completed his degree via correspondence courses and graduated in August 1945. After receiving his undergraduate degree, Leary pursued an academic career. In 1946, he received a M.S. in psychology at the Washington State College in Pullman, where he studied under educational psychologist Lee Cronbach. His M.S. thesis was on clinical applications of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.\nIn 1947, Marianne gave birth to their first child, Susan. Their son, Jack, arrived two years later. In 1950, Leary received a PhD in clinical psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. In the postwar era, Leary was galvanized by the objectivity of modern physics; his doctoral dissertation (\"The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure\") approached group therapy as a \"psychlotron\" from which behavioral characteristics could be derived and quantified in a manner analogous to the periodic table, foreshadowing his later development of the interpersonal circumplex.\nProfessorship.\nLeary stayed on in the Bay Area as an assistant clinical professor of medical psychology at the University of California, San Francisco; concurrently, he co-founded Kaiser Hospital's psychology department in Oakland, California, and maintained a private consultancy. In 1952, the Leary family spent a year in Spain, living on a research grant. According to Berkeley colleague Marv Freedman, \"Something had been stirred in him in terms of breaking out of being another cog in society.\"\nLeary's marriage was strained by infidelity and mutual alcohol abuse. Marianne eventually died by suicide in 1955, leaving him to raise their son and daughter alone. He described himself during this period as \"an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank martinis ... like several million middle-class, liberal, intellectual robots\".\nFrom 1954 or 1955 to 1958, Leary directed psychiatric research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 1957, he published \"The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality\", which the \"Annual Review of Psychology\" called the \"most important book on psychotherapy of the year\".\nIn 1958, the National Institute of Mental Health terminated Leary's research grant after he failed to meet with a NIMH investigator. Leary and his children relocated to Europe, where he attempted to write his next book while subsisting on small grants and insurance policies. His stay in Florence was unproductive and indigent, prompting a return to academia.\nIn late 1959, Leary started as a lecturer in clinical psychology at Harvard University at the behest of Frank Barron (a colleague from Berkeley) and David McClelland. Leary and his children lived in Newton, Massachusetts. In addition to teaching, Leary was affiliated with the Harvard Center for Research in Personality under McClelland. He oversaw the Harvard Psilocybin Project and conducted experiments in conjunction with assistant professor Richard Alpert. In 1963, Leary was terminated for failing to attend scheduled class lectures, though he maintained that he had met his teaching obligations. The decision to dismiss him may have been influenced by his promotion of psychedelic drug use among Harvard students and faculty. The drugs were legal at the time.\nLeary's work in academic psychology expanded on the research of Harry Stack Sullivan and Karen Horney, which sought to better understand interpersonal processes to help diagnose disorders. Leary's dissertation developed the interpersonal circumplex model, later published in \"The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality\". The book demonstrated how psychologists could use Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores to predict how respondents might react to various interpersonal situations. Leary's research was an important harbinger of transactional analysis, directly prefiguring the popular work of Eric Berne.\nPsychedelic experiments and experiences.\nMexico and Harvard research (1957\u20131963).\nIntroduction to psychedelic mushrooms.\nOn May 13, 1957, \"Life\" magazine published \"Seeking the Magic Mushroom\", an article by R. Gordon Wasson about the use of psilocybin mushrooms in religious rites of the indigenous Mazatec people of Mexico. Anthony Russo, a colleague of Leary's, had experimented with psychedelic \"Psilocybe mexicana\" mushrooms on a trip to Mexico and told Leary about it. In August 1960, Leary traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico, with Russo and consumed psilocybin mushrooms for the first time, an experience that drastically altered the course of his life. In 1965, Leary said that he had \"learned more about ... [his] brain and its possibilities ... [and] more about psychology in the five hours after taking these mushrooms than ... in the preceding 15 years of studying and doing research\".\nBack at Harvard, Leary and his associates (notably Alpert) began a research program known as the Harvard Psilocybin Project. The goal was to analyze psilocybin's effects on human subjects (first prisoners, and later Andover Newton Theological Seminary students) from a synthesized version of the drug, one of two active compounds found in a wide variety of hallucinogenic mushrooms, including \"Psilocybe mexicana\". Psilocybin was produced in a process developed by Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, who was famous for synthesizing LSD.\nBeat poet Allen Ginsberg heard about the Harvard research project and asked to join. Leary was inspired by Ginsberg's enthusiasm, and the two shared an optimism that psychedelics could help people discover a higher level of consciousness. They began introducing psychedelics to intellectuals and artists including Jack Kerouac, Maynard Ferguson, Charles Mingus and Charles Olson.\nConcord Prison Experiment.\nLeary argued that psychedelic substances\u2014in proper doses, a stable setting, and under the guidance of psychologists\u2014could benefit behavior in ways not easily obtained by regular therapy. He experimented in treating alcoholism and reforming criminals, and many of his subjects said they had profound mystical and spiritual experiences that permanently improved their lives.\nThe Concord Prison Experiment evaluated the use of psilocybin and psychotherapy in the rehabilitation of released prisoners. Thirty-six prisoners were reported to have repented and sworn off criminality after Leary and his associates guided them through the psychedelic experience. The overall recidivism rate for American prisoners was 60%, whereas the rate for those in Leary's project reportedly dropped to 20%. The experimenters concluded that long-term reduction in criminal recidivism could be effected with a combination of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy (inside the prison) along with a comprehensive post-release follow-up support program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous.\nDissension over studies.\nThe Concord conclusions were contested in a follow-up study on the basis of time differences monitoring the study group vs. the control group and differences between subjects re-incarcerated for parole violations and those imprisoned for new crimes. The researchers concluded that statistically only a slight improvement could be attributed to psilocybin, in contrast to the significant improvement reported by Leary and his colleagues. Rick Doblin suggested that Leary had fallen prey to the halo effect, skewing the results and clinical conclusions. Doblin further accused Leary of lacking \"a higher standard\" or \"highest ethical standards in order to regain the trust of regulators\". Ralph Metzner rebuked Doblin for these assertions: \"In my opinion, the existing accepted standards of honesty and truthfulness are perfectly adequate. We have those standards, not to curry favor with regulators, but because it is the agreement within the scientific community that observations should be reported accurately and completely. There is no proof in any of this re-analysis that Leary unethically manipulated his data.\"\nLeary and Alpert founded the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF) in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs. This was run by Lisa Bieberman (now known as Licia Kuenning), a friend of Leary. \"The Harvard Crimson\" called her a \"disciple\" who ran a Psychedelic Information Center out of her home and published a national LSD newspaper. That publication was actually Leary and Alpert's journal \"Psychedelic Review\" and Bieberman (a graduate of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard, who had volunteered for Leary as a student) was its circulation manager. Leary's and Alpert's research attracted so much attention that many who wanted to participate in the experiments had to be turned away. To satisfy the curiosity of those who were turned away, a black market for psychedelics sprang up near the Harvard campus.\nFiring by Harvard.\nOther professors in the Harvard Center for Research in Personality raised concerns about the experiments' legitimacy and safety. Leary and Alpert taught a class that was required for graduation and colleagues felt they were abusing their power by pressuring graduate students to take hallucinogens in the experiments. Leary and Alpert also went against policy by giving psychedelics to undergraduate students and did not select participants through random sampling. It was also ethically questionable that the researchers sometimes took hallucinogens along with the subjects they were studying. These concerns were printed in \"The Harvard Crimson\", leading the university to halt the experiments. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health launched an investigation that was later dropped but the university eventually fired Leary and Alpert.\nAccording to Andrew Weil, Leary (who held an untenured teaching appointment) was fired for missing his scheduled lectures, while Alpert (a tenure-track assistant professor) was dismissed for allegedly giving an undergraduate psilocybin in an off-campus apartment. Harvard President Nathan Pusey released a statement on May 27, 1963, reporting that Leary had left campus without authorization and \"failed to keep his classroom appointments\". His salary was terminated on April 30, 1963.\nMillbrook and psychedelic counterculture (1963\u20131967).\nLeary's psychedelic experimentation attracted the attention of three heirs to the Mellon fortune, siblings Peggy, Billy, and Tommy Hitchcock. In 1963, they gave Leary and his associates access to a sprawling 64-room mansion on an estate in Millbrook, New York, where they continued their psychedelic sessions. Peggy directed the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF)'s New York branch, and Billy rented the estate to IFIF. Peggy persuaded her brothers to let Leary rent a room at the mansion. Leary and Alpert set up a communal group with former Psilocybin Project members at the Hitchcock Estate (commonly known as \"Millbrook\"). One of the IFIF's founding board members, Paul Lee, a Harvard theologian, a participant at Marsh Chapel and a member of the Leary circle, said of the group's formation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There was a big discussion about whether to go underground with it and make it a kind of secret initiation issue, or go public. But Leary was an Irish revolutionary and he wanted to shout it from the rooftops. So it went that way. It simply became a tsunami.\nThe IFIF was reconstituted as the Castalia Foundation after the intellectual colony in Hermann Hesse's 1943 novel \"The Glass Bead Game\". The Castalia group's journal was the \"Psychedelic Review\". The core group at Millbrook wanted to cultivate the divinity within each person and regularly joined LSD sessions facilitated by Leary. The Castalia Foundation also hosted non-drug weekend retreats for meditation, yoga, and group therapy. Leary later wrote:\nWe saw ourselves as anthropologists from the 21st century inhabiting a time module set somewhere in the dark ages of the 1960s. On this space colony we were attempting to create a new paganism and a new dedication to life as art.\nLucy Sante of \"The New York Times\" later described the Millbrook estate as:\nthe headquarters of Leary and gang for the better part of five years, a period filled with endless parties, epiphanies and breakdowns, emotional dramas of all sizes, and numerous raids and arrests, many of them on flimsy charges concocted by the local assistant district attorney, G. Gordon Liddy.\nOthers contest the characterization of Millbrook as a party house. In \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\", Tom Wolfe portrays Leary as using psychedelics only for research, not recreation. When Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters visited the estate, they received a frosty reception. Leary had the flu and did not play host. After a private meeting with Kesey and Ken Babbs in his room, he promised to remain an ally in the years ahead.\nIn 1964, Leary, Alpert, and Ralph Metzner coauthored \"The Psychedelic Experience\", based on the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\". In it, they wrote:\nA psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions, and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. Of course, the drug does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key\u2014it opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures.\nLeary married model Birgitte Caroline \"Nena\" von Schlebr\u00fcgge in 1964 at Millbrook. Both Nena and her brother Bjorn were friends of the Hitchcocks. D.\u00a0A.\u00a0Pennebaker, also a Hitchcock friend, and cinematographer Nicholas Proferes documented the event in the short film \"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\". Charles Mingus played piano. The marriage lasted a year before von Schlebr\u00fcgge divorced Leary in 1965. She married Indo-Tibetan Buddhist scholar and ex-monk Robert Thurman in 1967 and gave birth to Ganden Thurman that same year. Actress Uma Thurman, her second child, was born in 1970.\nLeary met Rosemary Woodruff in 1965 at a New York City art exhibit, and invited her to Millbrook. After moving in, she co-edited the manuscript for Leary's 1966 book \"Psychedelic Prayers: And Other Meditations\" with Ralph Metzner and Michael Horowitz. The poems in the book were inspired by the \"Tao Te Ching\", and meant to be used as an aid to LSD trips. Woodruff helped Leary prepare weekend multimedia workshops simulating the psychedelic experience, which were presented around the East Coast.\nIn September 1966, Leary said in a \"Playboy\" magazine interview that LSD could cure homosexuality. According to him, a lesbian became heterosexual after using the drug. Like most of the psychiatric field, he later decided that homosexuality was not an illness.\nBy 1966, use of psychedelics by America's youth had reached such proportions that serious concern about the drugs and their effect on American culture was expressed in the national press and halls of government. In response to this concern, Senator Thomas Dodd convened Senate subcommittee hearings to try to better understand the drug-use phenomenon, eventually with the intention of \"stamping out\" such usage by criminalizing it. Leary was one of several expert witnesses called to testify at these hearings. In his testimony, Leary said, \"the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them.\" He implored the subcommittee not to criminalize psychedelic drug use, which he felt would only serve to exponentially increase its usage among America's youth while removing the safeguards that controlled \"set and setting\" provided. When subcommittee member Ted Kennedy asked Leary whether LSD usage was \"extremely dangerous\", Leary replied, \"Sir, the motorcar is dangerous if used improperly...Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.\" To conclude his testimony, Leary suggested that legislation be enacted that would require LSD users to be adults who were competently trained and licensed, so that such individuals could use LSD \"for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.\" He argued that without such licensing, the US would face \"another era of prohibition.\" Leary's testimony proved ineffective; on October 6, 1966, just months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California, and by October 1968, it was banned nationwide by the Staggers-Dodd Bill.\nIn 1966, Folkways Records recorded Leary reading from his book \"The Psychedelic Experience\", and released the album \"The Psychedelic Experience: Readings from the Book \"The Psychedelic Experience. A Manual Based on the Tibetan...\".\"\nOn September 19, 1966, Leary reorganized the IFIF/Castalia Foundation under the name the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religion with LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents, based on a \"freedom of religion\" argument. Leary incorporated the League for Spiritual Discovery as a religious organization in New York State, and its dogma was based on Leary's mantra: \"drop out, turn on, tune in\". (The Brotherhood of Eternal Love later considered Leary its spiritual leader, but it did not develop out of the IFIF.) Nicholas Sand, the clandestine chemist for the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, followed Leary to Millbrook and joined the League for Spiritual Discovery. Sand was designated the \"alchemist\" of the new religion. At the end of 1966, Nina Graboi, a friend and colleague of Leary's who had spent time with him at Millbrook, became the director of the Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery in Greenwich Village. The Center opened in March 1967. Leary and Alpert gave free weekly talks there; other guest speakers included Ralph Metzner and Allen Ginsberg. Leary's papers at the New York Public Library include complete records of the IFIF, the Castalia Foundation, and the League for Spiritual Discovery.\nIn late 1966 and early 1967, Leary toured college campuses presenting a multimedia performance called \"The Death of the Mind\", attempting an artistic replication of the LSD experience. He said that the League for Spiritual Discovery was limited to 360 members and was already at its membership limit, but encouraged others to form their own psychedelic religions. He published a pamphlet in 1967 called \"Start Your Own Religion\" to encourage people to do so.\nLeary was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 Human Be-In by Michael Bowen, the primary organizer of the event, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In speaking to the group, Leary coined the famous phrase \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, he said the slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan when the two had lunch in New York City, adding, \"Marshall was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of [the well-known Pepsi 1950s singing commercial]. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'\" Though the more popular \"turn on, tune in, drop out\" became synonymous with Leary, his actual definition with the League for Spiritual Discovery was: \"\"Drop Out\"\u2014detach yourself from the external social drama which is as dehydrated and ersatz as TV. \"Turn On\"\u2014find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body. Go out of your mind. Get high. \"Tune In\"\u2014be reborn. Drop back in to express it. Start a new sequence of behavior that reflects your vision.\"\nRepeated FBI raids ended the Millbrook era. Leary told author and Prankster Paul Krassner of a 1966 raid by Liddy, \"He was a government agent entering our bedroom at midnight. We had every right to shoot him. But I've never owned a weapon in my life. I have never had and never will have a gun around.\"\nIn November 1967, Leary engaged in a televised debate on drug use with MIT professor Jerry Lettvin.\nPost-Millbrook.\nAt the end of 1967, Leary moved to Laguna Beach, California, and made many friends in Hollywood. \"When he married his third wife, Rosemary Woodruff, in 1967, the event was directed by Ted Markland of \"Bonanza\". All the guests were on acid.\"\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Leary formulated what became his eight-circuit model of consciousness in collaboration with writer Brian Barritt. The essay \"The Seven Tongues of God\" claimed that human brains have seven circuits producing seven levels of consciousness. This later became seven circuits in Leary's 1973 monograph \"Neurologic\", which he wrote while he was in prison. The eight-circuit idea was not exhaustively formulated until the publication of \"Exo-Psychology\" by Leary and Robert Anton Wilson's \"Cosmic Trigger\" in 1977. Wilson contributed to the model after befriending Leary in the early 1970s, and used it as a framework for further exposition in his book \"Prometheus Rising\", among other works.\nLeary believed that the first four of these circuits (\"the Larval Circuits\" or \"Terrestrial Circuits\") are naturally accessed by most people at transition points in life such as puberty. The second four circuits (\"the Stellar Circuits\" or \"Extra-Terrestrial Circuits\"), Leary wrote, were \"evolutionary offshoots\" of the first four that would be triggered at transition points as humans evolve further. These circuits, according to Leary, would equip humans to live in space and expand consciousness for further scientific and social progress. Leary suggested that some people might trigger these circuits sooner through meditation, yoga, or psychedelic drugs specific to each circuit. He suggested that the feelings of floating and uninhibited motion sometimes experienced with marijuana demonstrated the purpose of the higher four circuits. The function of the fifth circuit was to accustom humans to life at a zero gravity environment. Leary did not specify the location of the eight circuits in any brain structures, neural organization, or chemical pathways. He wrote that a higher intelligence \"located in interstellar nuclear-gravitational-quantum structures\" gave humans the eight circuits. A \"U.F.O. message\" was encoded in human DNA.\nMany researchers believed that Leary provided little scientific evidence for his claims. Even before he began working on psychedelics, he was known as a theoretician rather than a data collector. His most ambitious pre-psychedelic work was \"Interpersonal Diagnosis Of Personality\". The reviewer for \"The British Medical Journal\", H. J. Eysenck, wrote that Leary created a confusing and overly broad rubric for testing psychiatric conditions. \"Perhaps the worst failing of the book is the omission of any kind of proof for the validity and reliability of the diagnostic system,\" Eysenck wrote. \"It is simply not enough to say\" that the accuracy of the system \"can be checked by the reader\" in clinical practice. In 1965, Leary co-edited \"The Psychedelic Reader\". Penn State psychology researcher Jerome E. Singer reviewed the book and singled out Leary as the worst offender in a work containing \"melanges of hucksterism\". In place of scientific data about the effects of LSD, Leary used metaphors about \"galaxies spinning\" faster than the speed of light and a cerebral cortex \"turned on to a much higher voltage\".\nLegal troubles.\nLeary's first run-in with the law came on December 23, 1965, when he was arrested for marijuana possession. On December 20, 1965, Leary took his two children, Jack and Susan, and his girlfriend Rosemary Woodruff to Mexico for a month-long vacation to rest and write an autobiography. Two days later they had crossed into Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in the late afternoon and discovered that they would have to wait until morning for the appropriate visa for an extended stay. They decided to cross back into Texas to spend the night, and were on the US\u2013Mexico bridge when Rosemary remembered that she had a small amount of marijuana in her possession. It was impossible to throw it out on the bridge, so Susan put it in her clothes. On their return from Mexico to the United States, a US Customs Service woman officer searched Susan and found a silver snuffbox with marijuana. After taking responsibility for the controlled substance, Leary was convicted of possession under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 on March 11, 1966, sentenced to 30 years in prison, fined $30,000, and ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment. He appealed the case on the basis that the Marihuana Tax Act was unconstitutional, as it required a degree of self-incrimination in blatant violation of the Fifth Amendment.\nOn December 26, 1968, Leary was arrested again in Laguna Beach, California, this time for the possession of two marijuana \"roaches\". Leary alleged that they were planted by the arresting officer, but was convicted of the crime. On May 19, 1969, the Supreme Court concurred with Leary in \"Leary v. United States\", declared the Marihuana Tax Act unconstitutional, and overturned his 1966 conviction.\nOn that same day, Leary announced his candidacy for governor of California against the Republican incumbent, Ronald Reagan. His campaign slogan was \"Come together, join the party.\" On June 1, 1969, Leary joined John Lennon and Yoko Ono at their Montreal bed-in, and Lennon subsequently wrote Leary a campaign song called \"Come Together\".\nOn January 21, 1970, Leary received a ten-year sentence for his 1968 offense, with a further ten added later while in custody for a prior arrest in 1965, for a total of 20 years to be served consecutively. On his arrival in prison, he was given psychological tests used to assign inmates to appropriate work details. Having designed some of these tests himself (including the \"Leary Interpersonal Behavior Inventory\"), Leary answered them in such a way that he seemed to be a very conforming, conventional person with a great interest in forestry and gardening. As a result, he was assigned to work as a gardener in a lower-security prison from which he escaped in September 1970, saying that his nonviolent escape was a humorous prank and leaving a challenging note for the authorities to find after he was gone.\nFor a fee of $25,000, paid by The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Weathermen smuggled Leary out of prison in a pickup truck driven by Clayton Van Lydegraf. The truck met Leary after he had escaped over the prison wall by climbing along a telephone wire. The Weathermen then helped both Leary and Rosemary out of the US (and eventually into Algeria). He sought the patronage of Eldridge Cleaver for $10,000 and the remnants of the Black Panther Party's \"government in exile\" in Algeria, but after a short stay with them said that Cleaver had attempted to hold him and his wife hostage. Cleaver had put Leary and his wife under \"house arrest\" due to exasperation with their socialite lifestyle.\nIn 1971, the couple fled to Switzerland, where they were sheltered and effectively imprisoned by a high-living arms dealer, Michel Hauchard, who claimed he had an \"obligation as a gentleman to protect philosophers\"; Hauchard intended to broker a surreptitious film deal, and forced Leary to assign his future earnings (which Leary eventually won back). In 1972, Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, persuaded the Swiss government to imprison Leary, which it did for a month, but refused to extradite him to the US\nLeary and Rosemary separated later that year; she traveled widely, then moved back to the US, where she lived as a fugitive until the 1990s. Shortly after his separation from Rosemary in 1972, Leary became involved with Swiss-born British socialite Joanna Harcourt-Smith, a stepdaughter of financier \u00c1rp\u00e1d Plesch and ex-girlfriend of Hauchard. The couple married in a hotel under the influence of cocaine and LSD two weeks after they were introduced, and Harcourt-Smith used his surname until their breakup in 1977. They traveled to Vienna, then Beirut, and finally ended up in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1972; according to Lucy Sante, \"Afghanistan had no extradition treaty with the United States, but this stricture did not apply to American airliners.\" American authorities used that interpretation of the law to interdict Leary. \"Before Leary could deplane, he was arrested by an agent of the federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.\" Leary asserted a different story on appeal before the California Court of Appeal for the Second District, namely:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He testified further that he had a valid passport in Kabul and that it was confiscated while he was in a line at the American Embassy in Kabul a few days prior to the day when he boarded the airplane; after his passport was confiscated, he was taken to \"Central Police Headquarters\"; he did not attempt to contact the American Embassy; the Kabul police held him in custody and took him to a \"police hotel\". The cousin of the King of Afghanistan came to see him and told him that it was a national holiday, that the King and the officials were out of Kabul, and that he (the cousin) would get a lawyer and see that Leary \"had a hearing\". On the morning the airplane left Kabul, officials of Afghanistan told him he was to leave Afghanistan. Leary replied he would not leave without a hearing and until he got his passport back; they said the Americans had his passport, and he was taken to the airplane.\nLeary's bail was set at $5\u00a0million. The judge at his remand hearing said, \"If he is allowed to travel freely, he will speak publicly and spread his ideas\". Facing 95 years in prison, Leary hired criminal defense attorney Bruce Margolin. Leary mostly directed his own defense strategy, which proved unsuccessful: the jury convicted him after deliberating for less than two hours. Leary received five years for his prison escape, added to his original 10-year sentence. In 1973, he was sent to Folsom Prison in California, and put in solitary confinement. While in Folsom, he was placed in a cell next to Charles Manson's. They could not see each other, but they could talk together. In their discussions, Manson found it difficult to understand why Leary had given people LSD without trying to control them. At one point, Manson said to Leary, \"They took you off the streets so that I could continue with your work.\"\nLeary became an FBI informant to shorten his prison sentence and entered the witness protection program upon his release in 1976. He claimed that he feigned cooperation with the FBI investigation of Weathermen by providing information that they already had or that was of little consequence. The FBI gave him the code name \"Charlie Thrush\". In a 1974 news conference, Allen Ginsberg, Ram Dass, and Leary's 25-year-old son Jack denounced Leary, calling him a \"cop informant\", \"liar\", and \"paranoid schizophrenic\". No prosecutions stemmed from his FBI reporting. In 1999, a letter from 22 \"Friends of Timothy Leary\" sought to soften impressions of the FBI episode. It was signed by authors such as Douglas Rushkoff, Ken Kesey, and Robert Anton Wilson. Susan Sarandon, Genesis P-Orridge and Leary's goddaughter Winona Ryder also signed. The letter said that Leary had smuggled a message to the Weather Underground informing it \"that he was considering making a deal with the FBI\" and he then \"waited for their approval\". The reported reply was, \"We understand.\" The letter writers did not provide confirmation that the Weather Underground okayed his cooperation with the FBI.\nWhile in prison, Leary was sued by the parents of Vernon Powell Cox, who had jumped from a third-story window of a Berkeley apartment while under the influence of LSD. Cox had taken the drug after attending a lecture by Leary promoting LSD use. Leary was unable to be present due to his incarceration, and unable to arrange for legal representation; a default judgment was entered against him in the amount of $100,000.\nPost-prison.\nOn April 21, 1976, Governor Jerry Brown released Leary from prison. After briefly relocating to Santa Fe, New Mexico, with Harcourt-Smith under the auspices of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program, the couple separated in early 1977.\nPersonal life.\nLeary then moved to the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he resided for the rest of his life. In 1978, he married filmmaker Barbara Blum, also known as Barbara Chase, sister of actress Tanya Roberts. He adopted Blum's young son and raised him as his own. He also took on several godchildren, including Winona Ryder (the daughter of his archivist Michael Horowitz) and technologist Joi Ito.\nIn January 1989, Leary's daughter Susan, then 41, was arrested in Los Angeles for non-fatally shooting her boyfriend in the head as he slept in December 1988. She was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial for attempted murder on two occasions. After years of mental instability, she died by suicide in jail in September 1990.\nAlthough he considered her the \"great love of his life\", Leary and Barbara divorced in 1992; according to friend and collaborator John Perry Barlow, \"Tim basically gave me permission to be her lover. He couldn't be for her what she needed sexually, so it made more sense for him to anoint someone to do that for him.\" Thereafter, he ensconced himself in a diverse circle of prominent figures, including Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon, Dan Aykroyd, author Douglas Rushkoff, and \"Spin\" magazine publisher Bob Guccione, Jr. Despite declining health, he maintained a regular schedule of public appearances through 1994. Reflecting a modicum of political rehabilitation after several failed attempts to adapt \"Flashbacks\" as a film or television miniseries, he was the subject of a symposium of the American Psychological Association that year.\nCareer.\nUnable to secure a conventional academic, research, or clinical appointment due to his reputation, he continued to publish books through the independent press while maintaining an upper middle class lifestyle by making paid appearances at colleges and nightclubs as a self-described \"stand-up philosopher\". \nLeary developed a partnership with former Millbrook-era foe G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate burglar and conservative radio talk-show host. They toured the lecture circuit in 1982 as ex-cons debating a range of issues, including gay rights, abortion, welfare and the environment. Leary generally espoused left-wing views and Liddy generally espoused right-wing perspectives. The tour generated massive publicity and considerable funds for both. The 1983 documentary \"Return Engagement\" chronicled the tour and the release of \"Flashbacks\", Leary's long-germinating memoir; biographer Robert Greenfield has since asserted that much of what Leary \"reported as fact in \"Flashbacks\" is pure fantasy\".\nLeary's extensive touring on the lecture circuit continued to ensure his family a comfortable lifestyle in the mid-1980s. He associated with a variety of cultural figures, including longtime interlocutors Robert Anton Wilson and Allen Ginsberg; science fiction writers William Gibson and Norman Spinrad; and rock musicians David Byrne and John Frusciante. In addition, he appeared in Johnny Depp's and Gibby Haynes's 1994 film \"Stuff\", which chronicled Frusciante's squalid living conditions at that time.\nPolitical activism.\nOn September 25, 1988, Leary held a fundraiser for Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ron Paul. Journalist Debra Saunders attended and wrote about her experience.\nDrug use.\nLeary continued to take a wide array of drugs (ranging from serotonergic psychedelics to the nascent empathogen MDMA and alcohol and heroin) in private, but consciously eschewed proselytizing substances in media appearances amid the escalation of the war on drugs during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Instead, he served as a prominent advocate for space colonization and life extension. He expounded on the eight-circuit model of consciousness in books such as \"Info-Psychology: A Re-Vision of Exo-Psychology\". He invented the acronym \"SMI\u00b2LE\" as a succinct summary of his pre-transhumanist agenda: SM (space migration) + I\u00b2 (intelligence increase) + LE (life extension).\nCultural influence.\nLeary's space colonization plan evolved over the years. Initially, 5,000 of Earth's most virile and intelligent individuals would be launched on a vessel (Starseed 1) equipped with luxurious amenities. This idea was inspired by musician Paul Kantner's 1970 concept album \"Blows Against The Empire\", which was derived from Robert A. Heinlein's Lazarus Long series. While incarcerated in Folsom State Prison during the winter of 1975\u201376, he became enamored of Princeton University physicist Gerard K. O'Neill's plans to construct giant Eden-like High Orbital Mini-Earths, as documented in the Robert Anton Wilson lecture \"H.O.M.E.s on LaGrange\", using raw materials from the Moon, orbital rock, and obsolete satellites.\nIn the 1980s, Leary became fascinated by computers, the internet, and virtual reality. He proclaimed that \"the PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" and enjoined historically technophobic bohemians to \"turn on, boot up, jack in.\" He became a promoter of virtual reality systems, and sometimes demonstrated a prototype of the Mattel Power Glove as part of his lectures (as in \"From Psychedelics to Cybernetics\"). He befriended a number of notable people in the field, such as Jaron Lanier and Brenda Laurel, a pioneer in virtual environments and human\u2013computer interaction. During the evanescent heyday of the cyberdelic subculture, he served as a consultant to Billy Idol in the production of the 1993 album \"Cyberpunk\".\nFrom 1989 on, Leary began to reestablish his connection to unconventional religious movements with an interest in altered states of consciousness. In 1989, he appeared with Robert Anton Wilson in a dialog called \"The Inner Frontier\" for the Association for Consciousness Exploration, a Cleveland-based group that had been responsible for his first Cleveland appearance in 1979. After that, he appeared at the Starwood Festival, a major Neo-Pagan event run by ACE in 1992 and 1993. His planned 1994 WinterStar Symposium appearance was canceled due to his declining health. In 1992, in front of hundreds of Neo-Pagans, Leary declared, \"I've always considered myself a Pagan.\" He also collaborated with Eric Gullichsen on \"Load and Run High-tech Paganism: Digital Polytheism\". Shortly before his death on May 31, 1996, he recorded the album \"Right to Fly\" with Simon Stokes, which was released in July 1996.\nDeath.\nIn January 1995, Leary was diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer. He then notified Ram Dass and other old friends and began the process of directed dying, which he termed \"designer dying\". Leary did not reveal the condition to the press at that time, but did so after Jerry Garcia's death in August. Leary and Ram Dass reunited before Leary's death in May 1996, as seen in the documentary film \"\".\nLeary's last book was \"Chaos &amp; Cyber Culture\", published in 1994. In it he wrote: \"The time has come to talk cheerfully and joke sassily about personal responsibility for managing the dying process.\" His book \"Design for Dying\", which tried to give a new perspective on death and dying, was published posthumously. Leary wrote about his belief that death is \"a merging with the entire life process\".\nHis website team, led by Chris Graves, updated his website on a daily basis as a proto-blog. The website noted his daily intake of various illicit and legal chemical substances, with a predilection for nitrous oxide, LSD and other psychedelic drugs. He was also noted for his trademark \"Leary Biscuit\", a cannabis edible consisting of a snack cracker with cheese and a small marijuana bud, briefly microwaved. At his request, his sterile house was redecorated by the staff with an array of surreal ornamentation. In his final months, thousands of visitors, well-wishers and old friends visited him in his California home. Until his last weeks, he gave many interviews discussing his new philosophy of embracing death.\nLeary was reportedly excited for a number of years by the possibility of freezing his body in cryonic suspension, and he announced in September 1988 that he had signed up with Alcor for such treatment after having appeared at Alcor's grand opening the year before. He did not believe he would be resurrected in the future, but did believe that cryonics had important possibilities, even though he thought it had only \"one chance in a thousand\". He called it his \"duty as a futurist\", helped publicize the process and hoped that it would work for his children and grandchildren if not for him, although he said that he was \"lighthearted\" about it. He was connected with two cryonic organizations\u2014first Alcor and then CryoCare\u2014one of which delivered a cryonic tank to his house in the months before his death. Leary initially announced that he would freeze his entire body, but due to lack of funds decided to freeze his head only. Three weeks before his death, Leary changed his mind again and generally refused cryopreservation from both Alcor and CryoCare. He requested that his body be cremated, with his ashes scattered in space.\nLeary died aged 75 on May 31, 1996. His death was videotaped for posterity at his request by Denis Berry and Joey Cavella, capturing his final words. Berry was the trustee of Leary's archives, and Cavella had filmed Leary during his later years. According to his son Zachary, during his final moments, he clenched his fist and said: \"Why?\", then, unclenching his fist, said: \"Why not?\". He uttered the phrase repeatedly, in different intonations, and died soon after. His last word, according to Zach, was \"beautiful\".\nThe film \"Timothy Leary's Dead\" (1996) contains a simulated sequence in which he allows his bodily functions to be suspended for the purposes of cryonic preservation. His head is removed and placed on ice. The film ends with a sequence showing the creation of the artificial head used in the film.\nSeven grams (\u00bc oz) of Leary's ashes were arranged by his friend at Celestis to be buried in space aboard a rocket carrying the remains of 23 others, including \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry, space colonization advocate Gerard O'Neill and German-American rocket engineer Krafft Ehricke. A Pegasus rocket containing their remains was launched on April 21, 1997, and remained in orbit for six years until it burned up in the atmosphere.\nLeary's ashes were given to close friends and family. In 2015, Susan Sarandon brought some of his ashes to the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City, Nevada, and put them into an art installation there. The ashes were burned along with the installation on September 6, 2015.\nPersonal life.\nLeary was legally married five times, sired three biological children and adopted a fourth child. He also regarded Joanna Harcourt-Smith (his domestic partner from 1972 to 1977) as his common-law wife for the duration of their relationship. His first wife, Marianne Busch, died by suicide (as did their daughter).\nInfluence.\nLeary was an early influence on applying game theory to psychology, having introduced the concept to the International Association of Applied Psychology in 1961 at its annual conference in Copenhagen. He was also an early influence on transactional analysis. His concept of the four life scripts, dating to 1951, became an influence on transactional analysis by the late 1960s, popularized by Thomas Harris in his book, \"I'm OK, You're OK\".\nMany consider Leary one of the most prominent figures of the counterculture of the 1960s, and since those times he has remained influential on pop culture, literature, television, film and, especially, music.\nLeary coined the influential term reality tunnel, a kind of representative realism. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, everyone interprets the same world differently, hence \"Truth is in the eye of the beholder.\"\nHis ideas influenced the work of his friend Robert Anton Wilson. This influence went both ways, with Leary taking just as much from Wilson. Wilson's 1983 book \"Prometheus Rising\" was an in-depth, highly detailed and inclusive work documenting Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. Although the theory originated in discussions between Leary and a Hindu holy man at Millbrook, Wilson was one of its most ardent proponents and introduced it to a mainstream audience in 1977's bestselling \"Cosmic Trigger\". In 1989, they appeared together on stage in a dialog called \"The Inner Frontier\" hosted by the Association for Consciousness Exploration, the same group that had hosted Leary's first Cleveland appearance in 1979.\nWorld religion scholar Huston Smith was \"turned on\" by Leary after being introduced to him by Aldous Huxley in the early 1960s. Smith interpreted the experience as deeply religious, and described it in detailed religious terms in his book \"Cleansing of the Doors of Perception\". Smith asked Leary whether he knew the power and danger of what he was conducting research with. In \"Mother Jones Magazine\", 1997, Smith commented:\nFirst, I have to say that during the three years I was involved with that Harvard study, LSD was not only legal but respectable. Before Tim went on his unfortunate careening course, it was a legitimate research project. Though I did find evidence that, when recounted, the experiences of the Harvard group and those of mystics were impossible to tell apart\u2014descriptively indistinguishable\u2014that's not the last word. There is still a question about the truth of the disclosure. Was the drug-induced mystical experience just an emotional jag that messed up some neural connections? Or was it a genuine disclosure, an epiphany?\nIn popular culture.\nOn screen.\nIn the 1968 \"Dragnet\" episode \"The Big Prophet\", Liam Sullivan played Brother William Bentley, leader of the Temple of the Expanded Mind, a thinly fictionalized Leary. Bentley held forth for the entire half-hour on the rights of the individual and the benefits of LSD and marijuana, while Joe Friday argued the contrary.\nThe 1979 musical \"Hair\" and the 1967 stage performance it is based on make multiple references to Leary.\nLeary appears in Cheech &amp; Chong's 1981 film \"Nice Dreams\", featured in a scene in which he gives Cheech \"the key to the universe\".\nIn 1994, Leary appeared as himself in the \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" episode \"Elevator\", and also appeared in an episode of \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\" as the character Dr. Milo.\nIn 1996, months before his death, Leary appeared in the feminist science fiction feature film \"Conceiving Ada\".\nThe 1998 movie \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", adapted from Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 novel, portrays heavy psychedelic drug use and mentions Leary when the protagonist ponders the meaning of the acid wave of the 1960s.\nA 2017 episode of \"Urban Myths\" depicts a meeting between Leary and Cary Grant, whom he introduces to LSD.\nIn music.\n\"The Psychedelic Experience\" (1964) was the inspiration for John Lennon's song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", on The Beatles' album \"Revolver\" (1966).\nThe Moody Blues recorded two songs about Leary. \"Legend of a Mind\", written and sung by Ray Thomas on their album \"In Search of the Lost Chord\" (1968), begins: \"Timothy Leary's dead. No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in\". The second was \"When You're a Free Man\" on the \"Seventh Sojourn\" album (1972).\nLeary recruited Lennon to write a theme song for his California gubernatorial campaign against Ronald Reagan (which was interrupted by Leary's prison sentence for cannabis possession), inspiring Lennon to come up with \"Come Together\" (1969), based on Leary's campaign theme and catchphrase.\nLeary was present and sang back-up vocals when Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\" (1969) during their bed-in in Montreal and is mentioned in the lyrics of the song.\nThe Who's 1970 single \"The Seeker\" mentions Leary in a sequence where the song's protagonist claims that Leary (among other high-profile people) was unable to help them with their search for answers.\nWhile in exile in Switzerland, Leary and British writer Brian Barritt collaborated with the German band Ash Ra Tempel and recorded the album \"Seven Up\" (1973). He is credited as a songwriter, and his lyrics and vocals can be heard throughout the album. Commenting on the work of his friend H. R. Giger, a surrealist artist from Switzerland who won an Academy Award for his work on the film \"Alien\", Leary noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Giger's work disturbs us, spooks us, because of its enormous evolutionary time span. It shows us, all too clearly, where we come from and where we are going.\u2014\u200a\nDuring the height of rave culture from the 1980s to mid-2000s, recordings of Leary and other psychedelic thinkers speaking were often mixed into electronic music. The Shamen honored him in the song \"Ebenezer Goode\" on their album \"Boss Drum\". \nIn 1995, Leary had a cameo at the end of the video for alternative rock group Blind Melon's song \"Galaxie\".\nThe Marcy Playground song \"It's Saturday\", from its 1999 album \"Shapeshifter\", mentions joining Leary \"in a cryogenic freeze\".\nIn comic books.\nIn 1973, \"El Perfecto Comics\" was organized by Aline Kominsky and published by The Print Mint to raise funds for the Timothy Leary Defense Fund. The comic features 31 underground artists contributing mostly one-pagers about drug experiences (primarily LSD). The front cover and a contributed one-page story are by Robert Crumb.\nIn 1979, Last Gasp published the one-shot edition \"Neurocomics: Timothy Leary\". \"Evolved from transmissions of Dr. Timothy Leary as filtered through Pete Von Sholly &amp; George DiCaprio\", it is based on Leary's writings related to life, the brain, and intelligence. DiCaprio collaborated with Leary on the script.\nWorks.\nLeary authored or coauthored more than 20 books and was featured on more than a dozen audio recordings. His acting career included over a dozen appearances in movies and television shows in various roles and over 30 appearances as himself. He also produced and/or collaborated with others in the creation of multimedia presentations and computer games.\nIn 2011, \"The New York Times\" reported that the New York Public Library had acquired Leary's personal archives, including papers, videotapes, photographs and other archival material from the Leary estate, including correspondence and documents relating to Allen Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Ken Kesey, Arthur Koestler, G. Gordon Liddy and other prominent cultural figures. The collection became available in September 2013.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31089", "revid": "49291118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31089", "title": "They Might Be Giants", "text": "American alternative rock band\nThey Might Be Giants, often abbreviated as TMBG, is an American alternative rock and children's band formed in 1982 by John Flansburgh and John Linnell. During TMBG's early years, Flansburgh and Linnell frequently performed as a musical duo, often accompanied by a drum machine. In the early 1990s, TMBG expanded to include a backing band. The duo's current backing band consists of Marty Beller, Dan Miller and Danny Weinkauf. They have been credited as vital in the creation and growth of the prolific DIY music scene in Brooklyn in the mid-1980s.\nOver their career, they have found success on the modern rock and college radio charts. They have also found success in children's music with several educational albums and in theme music for television programs and films.\nTMBG have released 23 studio albums. \"Flood\" has been certified platinum, while their children's music albums \"Here Come the ABCs\", \"Here Come the 123s\", and \"Here Comes Science\" have all been certified gold. The duo has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, winning two. Flansburgh and Linnell won for writing \"Boss of Me\", the theme to \"Malcolm in the Middle\" (Best Film or Television Theme) and They Might Be Giants won for \"Here Come the 123s\" (Best Children's Album). Flansburgh and Linnell were also nominated for a Tony Award for Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre along with other composers of the show for \"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical\". In total, the group has sold over 4 million records.\nHistory.\nEarlier years (1981\u20131989).\nJohn Flansburgh and John Linnell first met as teenagers growing up in Lincoln, Massachusetts. They began writing songs together while attending Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School but did not form a band at that time. The two attended separate colleges after high school and Linnell joined The Mundanes, a new wave group from Rhode Island. The two reunited in 1981 after moving to Brooklyn (to the same apartment building on the same day) to continue their career.\nAt their first concert, They Might Be Giants were introduced as and performed under the name El Grupo De Rock and Roll (Spanish for \"the Rock and Roll Band\"), because the show was a Sandinista rally in Central Park and a majority of the audience members spoke Spanish. They had previously chosen a name that, according to John Flansburgh, was \"so bad that John [Linnell] and I have made a vow that we will never tell anyone, even our children.\" Soon discarding this name, the band assumed the name of the 1971 film \"They Might Be Giants\" (starring George C. Scott and Joanne Woodward), which is in turn taken from a \"Don Quixote\" passage about how Quixote mistook windmills for evil giants. According to Dave Wilson, in his book \"Rock Formations\", the name They Might Be Giants had been used and subsequently discarded by a friend of the band who had a ventriloquism act. The name was then adopted by the band, who had been searching for a more suitable name.\nA common misconception is that the name of the band is a reference to themselves and an allusion to future success. In an interview, John Flansburgh said that the words \"they might be giants\" are just a very outward-looking forward thing which they liked. He clarified this in the documentary movie \"Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)\" by explaining that the name refers to the outside world of possibilities that they saw as a fledgling band. In an earlier radio interview, John Linnell described the phrase as \"something very paranoid sounding\".\nThe duo began performing their own music in and around New York City at the East Village Pyramid Club \u2013 Flansburgh on guitar, Linnell on accordion and saxophone and accompanied by a drum machine or prerecorded backing track on audio cassette. Their atypical instrumentation, along with their songs which featured unusual subject matter and clever wordplay, soon attracted a strong local following. Their performances also featured absurdly comical stage props such as oversized fezzes and large cardboard cutout heads of newspaper editor William Allen White. Many of these props would later turn up in their first music videos. From 1984 to 1987, They Might Be Giants were the house band at the Pyramid Club and Darinka, a Lower East Side performance art club run by Gary Ray. They played on the stage there one weekend a month and by the end of their three-year stint, their performances were selling out. On March 30, 1985, TMBG released their 7\" flexi-disc, dubbed \"Wiggle Diskette\" at Darinka. The disc included demos of the songs \"Everything Right Is Wrong Again\" and \"You'll Miss Me\".\nIn 1983 within the same timeframe, Linnell broke his wrist in a biking accident, and Flansburgh's apartment was burgled, stopping them from performing for a time. During this hiatus, they began recording their songs onto an answering machine and then advertising the phone number in local newspapers such as \"The Village Voice\", using the moniker \"Dial-A-Song\". They also released a demo cassette, which earned them a review in \"People\" magazine. Authored by Michael Small, the review caught the attention of Bar/None Records, who signed them to a recording deal.\nFrom the 1980s until 1998, Dial-A-Song consisted of an answering machine with a tape of the band playing various songs. The machine played one track at a time, ranging from demos and uncompleted work to mock advertisements the band had created. It was often difficult to access due to the popularity of the service and the dubious quality of the machines used. About this, one of Dial-A-Song's many slogans over the years was the tongue-in-cheek \"Always Busy, Often Broken\". The number, (718) 387\u20136962, was a local Brooklyn number and was charged accordingly, but the band advertised it with the line: \"Free when you call from work\".\nThe duo released their self-titled debut album in 1986, which became a college radio hit, selling 10,000 copies in its first year. The music video for \"Don't Let's Start\", filmed in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park and directed by Adam Bernstein, became a MTV hit in 1987.\nIn 1988, they released their second album, \"Lincoln.\" It featured the song \"Ana Ng\" which reached No.\u00a011 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart.\nMove to Elektra (1989\u20131992).\nIn 1990, They Might Be Giants released their third album \"Flood\", through Elektra Records. \"Flood\" earned them a platinum album, largely from the success of \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" which reached number three on the U.S. Modern Rock chart, as well as \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\", a cover of a song originally recorded by the Four Lads.\nIn 1990, \"Throttle\" magazine interviewed They Might Be Giants and clarified the meaning of the song \"Ana Ng\": John Flansburgh said, \"Ng is a Vietnamese name. The song is about someone who's thinking about a person on the exact opposite side of the world. John looked at a globe and figured out that if Ana Ng is in Vietnam and the person is on the other side of the world, then it must be written by someone in Peru\".\nFurther interest in the band was generated when two cartoon music videos were created by Warner Bros. Animation for \"Tiny Toon Adventures\": \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" and \"Particle Man\". The videos reflected TMBG's high \"kid appeal\", resulting from their often absurd songs and pop melodies.\nIn 1991, Bar/None Records released the B-sides compilation \"Miscellaneous T\". Though consisting of previously released material (save for the \"Purple Toupee\" B-sides, which were not available publicly), it gave new fans a chance to hear the Johns' earlier non-album work without having to hunt down the individual EPs.\nIn early 1992, They Might Be Giants released \"Apollo 18\". The heavy space theme coincided with TMBG being named Musical Ambassadors for International Space Year. Singles from the album included \"The Statue Got Me High\", \"I Palindrome I\", and \"The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)\".\n\"Apollo 18\" was also notable for being one of the first albums to take advantage of the CD player's shuffle feature. The song \"Fingertips\" actually comprised 21 separate tracks that add up to 4:35 in total with the longest one being 61 seconds.\nRecruiting a band (1992\u20131998).\nFollowing \"Apollo 18\", for live shows, Flansburgh and Linnell decided to move away from recorded backing tracks and recruited a supporting band (Kurt Hoffman of The Ordinaires on reeds and keyboards, longtime Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone, and drummer Jonathan Feinberg).\n\"John Henry\" was released in 1994. Influenced by their more conventional lineup, this album marked a departure from their previous releases with more of a guitar-heavy sound not dissimilar to the grunge music of the time. It was released to mixed reviews amongst fans and critics alike.\nFollowing \"John Henry\", TMBG's next album, \"Factory Showroom\", was released in 1996. It also is the last album they released through Elektra and their first album produced by Pat Dillett who has co-produced every album with them since then.\nIn 1998, they released a mostly live album \"Severe Tire Damage\" from which came the single \"Doctor Worm,\" a studio recording.\nIn 1998, Danny Weinkauf (bass) and Dan Miller (guitar) were recruited for their recording and touring band. Both had been members of the bands Lincoln and Candy Butchers which were previous opening acts for TMBG. Weinkauf and Miller continue to work with the band to the present day.\nBeyond Elektra and move to Restless Records (1999\u20132003).\nFor most of their career, TMBG has made innovative use of the Internet. As early as 1992, the band was sending news updates to their fans via Usenet newsgroups. In 1999, They Might Be Giants became the first major-label recording artist to release an entire album exclusively in MP3 format. The album, \"Long Tall Weekend\", is sold through eMusic.\nAlso, in 1999, the band contributed the song \"Dr. Evil\" to the motion picture \"\". Over their career, the band has performed on numerous movie and television soundtracks, including \"The Oblongs\", the ABC News miniseries \"Brave New World\" and \"Ed and His Dead Mother\". They also performed the theme music \"Dog on Fire\", composed by Bob Mould, for \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". They composed and performed the music for the TLC series \"Resident Life\", the theme song for the Disney Channel programs \"Higglytown Heroes\" and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\", and songs about the cartoons \"Dexter's Laboratory\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\".\nContributing the single \"Boss of Me\" as the theme song to the hit television series \"Malcolm in the Middle\", as well as to the show's compilation CD, brought a new audience to the band. Not only did the band contribute the theme, but songs from all of the Giants' previous albums were used on the show: for example, the infamous punching-the-kid-in-the-wheelchair scene from the first episode was done to the strains of \"Pencil Rain\" from \"Lincoln\". Another song to feature in the series was \"Spiraling Shape\". \"Boss of Me\" became the band's second top-40 hit in the UK which they performed on long-running UK television programme Top of the Pops and, in 2002, won the duo a Grammy Award.\nOn September 11, 2001, they released the album \"Mink Car\" on Restless Records. It was their first full album release of new studio material since 1996 and their first since parting ways with Elektra. The making of that album, including a record signing event at a Manhattan Tower Records, was included in a documentary directed by A. J. Schnack titled \"Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns)\". The film was released on DVD in 2003.\nIn 2002, they released \"No!\", their first album \"for the entire family\". Using the enhanced CD format, it included an interactive animation for most of the songs. They followed it up in 2003 with their first book, an illustrated children's book with an included EP, \"Bed, Bed, Bed\".\nPodcasting, independent releases, and children's music (2004\u20132015).\nIn 2004, the band released its first new \"adult\" rock work since the release of \"No!\", the EP \"Indestructible Object\". This was followed by a new album, \"The Spine\", and an associated EP, \"The Spine Surfs Alone\". It was at this time that Dan Hickey was replaced by Marty Beller, who had previously collaborated with TMBG. For the album's first single, \"Experimental Film\", TMBG teamed up with Homestar Runner creators Matt and Mike Chapman to create an animated music video. The band's collaboration with the Brothers Chaps also included several Puppet Jam segments with puppet Homestar and the music for a Strong Bad email titled \"Different Town\". In 2008 they recorded a track for the 200th Strong Bad e-mail, where Linnell provided the voice of The Poopsmith.\nTMBG also contributed a track to the 2004 \"Future Soundtrack for America\" compilation, a project compiled by John Flansburgh with the help of Spike Jonze and Barsuk Records. The band contributed \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\", a political campaign song from the presidential election of 1840. The compilation was released by Barsuk and featured indie, alternative, and high-profile acts such as Death Cab for Cutie, The Flaming Lips, and Bright Eyes. All proceeds went to progressive organizations such as Music for America and MoveOn.org.\nFlansburgh and Linnell made a guest appearance in \"\", the January 11, 2004, episode of the animated sitcom \"Home Movies\". They voice both a pair of camp counselors and members of a strange hooded male bonding cult. On May 10, 2004, they made a guest appearance on the final episode of \"Blue's Clues\" called \"Bluestock\" alongside Toni Braxton, Macy Gray, and India.Arie. They Might Be Giants were in a letter for Joe and Blue.\nFollowing the \"Spine on the Hiway Tour\" of 2004, the band announced that they would take an extended hiatus from touring to focus on other projects, such as a musical produced by Flansburgh and written by his wife, Robin \"Goldie\" Goldwasser, titled \"People Are Wrong!\".\n2005 saw the release of \"Here Come the ABCs\", TMBG's follow-up to the successful children's album \"No!\". The Disney Sound label released the CD and DVD separately on February 15, 2005. To promote the album, Flansburgh and Linnell along with drummer Marty Beller embarked on a short tour, performing for free at many Borders locations. In November 2005, \"Venue Songs\" was released as a two-disc CD/DVD set narrated by John Hodgman. It is a concept album based on all of the \"venue songs\" from their 2004 tour.\nTMBG covered the Devo song \"Through Being Cool\" in the 2005 Disney film \"Sky High\". In 2008, they rerecorded the song \"Take Out The Trash\" (from \"The Else\") in Simlish for inclusion in \"The Sims 2: Freetime\".\nThe band contributed 14 original songs for the 2006 Dunkin' Donuts ad campaign, \"America Runs on Dunkin'\", including \"Things I Like to Do\", \"Pleather\", and \"Fritalian\".\nThe band has produced and performed the song two songs \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\" which \"Fatherly\" said were catchy and one for \"Higglytown Heroes\" series.\nThey also recorded a cover of the Disney song \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\" for the film \"Meet the Robinsons\" and wrote and performed the theme song for \"The Drinky Crow Show\". The band was recruited to provide original songs for the Henry Selick-directed film adaptation of Neil Gaiman's children's book \"Coraline\" but were dropped because their music was not \"creepy\" enough. Only one song, titled \"Other Father Song\", was kept for the film with Linnell singing as the titular \"Other Father\".\nTheir twelfth album, \"The Else\", was released July 10, 2007, on Idlewild Recordings (and distributed by Zo\u00eb Records for the CD version), with an earlier digital release on May 15 at the iTunes Store. Advance copies were made available to stations by mid-June 2007. The album was produced by Pat Dillett (David Byrne) and the Dust Brothers (Beck, Beastie Boys). On February 12, 2009, They Might Be Giants performed the song \"The Mesopotamians\" from the album on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\nThe band's 13th album, \"Here Come the 123s\", a DVD/CD follow-up to 2005's critically acclaimed \"Here Come the ABCs\" children's project, was released on February 5, 2008. On April 10, 2008, They Might Be Giants performed the song \"Seven\" from the album on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". In 2009, the album won the Grammy Award for \"Best Musical Album For Children\" during the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe band's fourteenth album, \"Here Comes Science\", a science-themed children's album. This album introduced listeners to natural, formal, social, and applied sciences. It was released on September 1, 2009, and nominated for a Grammy Award on December 1, 2010.\nOn November 3, They Might Be Giants sent out a newsletter stating, \"The Avatars of They\", a set of sock puppets the Johns manipulate for shows, would have an album in 2012, suggesting another children's album. However, a new adult album titled \"Join Us\" was released on July 19, 2011.\nOn October 3, 2011, Artix Entertainment announced that the band would be performing in-game for a special musical event to commemorate the 3rd birthday of their popular MMORPG AdventureQuest Worlds. They were featured in AdventureQuest World's special third birthday event as John and John.\nOn March 5, 2013, the band released their sixteenth adult studio album, \"Nanobots\", on their Idlewild Recordings label in the US and on British indie label Lojinx in Europe. After \"Nanobots\" they released their studio album \"Glean\" on April 21, 2015.\nNew albums and Dial-A-Song revival (2015\u2013present).\nDial-A-Song was revived in 2015, with a new phone number ((844) 387\u20136962)), the website, and a radio network. In late 2017, the band announced via Twitter that Dial-A-Song would return again, in a modified format, starting in January 2018.\nThe band released their newest children's album, \"Why?\", on November 27, 2015. It was their fifth children's album and the first children's album to be released under their own label, Idlewild Recordings.\nOn March 8, 2016, the band released \"Phone Power\", their nineteenth studio album and the third containing songs from the 2015 revival of their Dial-a-Song service. This was the first TMBG album to be sold as a \"pay what you want\" download, available ahead of the physical release on June 10. In 2016, They Might Be Giants were involved in the SpongeBob SquarePants musical; they contributed the song \"I'm Not a Loser\".\nThe band's twentieth album, \"I Like Fun\" was released on January 19, 2018. Their twenty-first and twenty-second studio albums, \"My Murdered Remains\" and \"The Escape Team\", were both released on December 10, 2018. \"My Murdered Remains\" contains songs from Dial-A-Song.\nIn October 2019, the band recorded a new version of their song \"Hot Dog\" for the third season of the Disney Channel preschool series \"Mickey and the Roadster Racers\", re-titled as \"Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures\" for that season. It premiered on Disney Junior on October 14, 2019.\nOn November 12, 2021, They Might Be Giants released the album \"Book\". Some lyrical themes in the album seem to have been inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn August 2020, the band recorded a song for a CNN documentary about the electoral college called \"Who Are the Electors?\".\nThe band announced a 30th anniversary Flood tour for 2020; however, it was postponed, and dates were rescheduled several times due to the COVID pandemic. Shortly after resuming live tours again in June 2022, John Flansburgh was involved in a car accident while on his way home from the June 8 concert. He suffered several broken ribs but had a positive prognosis from doctors. Several tour dates were again postponed while he recovered; however, the tour was later resumed.\nIn November 2022, \"Book\" was nominated for a 65th Annual Grammy Awards in the category of \"Best Boxed or Special Limited-Edition Package\".\nSolo projects.\nJohn Flansburgh made a solo band Mono Puff. The band's bassist was Hal Cragin and drummer was Steve Calhoon. Mono Puff has released two albums, Unsupervised (1996) and It's Fun to Steal (1998) in addition to four EPs and one single.\nJohn Linnell made a solo five-song EP in 1994. The EP was later expanded into the \"State Songs\" album solo project in 1999 which peaked #18 on the CMJ 200 chart and was on the chart for four weeks. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, John Linnell also released another solo EP, \"Roman Songs\", which has four songs sung in full Latin. Linnell stated that a Latinist and friend of his who he calls \"Schoolmaster Smith\" helped him translate English lyrics into Latin with him for the project.\nMusic style.\nThe group has been noted for its unique style of alternative music, typically using surreal, humorous lyrics, experimental styles, and unconventional instruments. Their music is often described as \"quirky\" by listeners. Shervin Lainez in a IMDb news article about the band said, \"... They Might Be Giants ... have been releasing music that's both snarky and sweet, morbid and whimsical, a little pop and a little avant garde.\"\nMembers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nThroughout their career, They Might Be Giants have released 23 studio albums, 13 compilations, 12 live albums, 15 EPs, and 31 singles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31091", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31091", "title": "Titanite", "text": "Nesosilicate mineral\nTitanite, or sphene (from grc \" \"\" ()\"\u00a0'wedge'), is a calcium titanium nesosilicate mineral, CaTiSiO5. Trace impurities of iron and aluminium are typically present. Also commonly present are rare earth metals including cerium and yttrium; calcium may be partly replaced by thorium.\nNomenclature.\nThe International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (CNMMN) adopted the name titanite and \"discredited\" the name sphene as of 1982, although commonly papers and books initially identify the mineral using both names. Sphene was the most commonly used name until the IMA decision, although both were well known. Some authorities think it is less confusing as the word is used to describe any chemical or crystal with oxidized titanium such as the rare earth titanate pyrochlores series and many of the minerals with the perovskite structure. The name sphene continues to be publishable in peer-reviewed scientific literature, e.g. a paper by Hayden et al. was published in early 2008 in the journal Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology. Sphene persists as the informal name for titanite gemstones.\nPhysical properties.\nTitanite, which is named for its titanium content, occurs as translucent to transparent, reddish brown, gray, yellow, green, or red monoclinic crystals. These crystals are typically sphenoid in habit and are often twinned. Possessing a subadamantine tending to slightly resinous luster, titanite has a hardness of 5.5 and a weak cleavage. Its specific gravity varies between 3.52 and 3.54. Titanite's refractive index is 1.885\u20131.990 to 1.915\u20132.050 with a strong birefringence of 0.105 to 0.135 (biaxial positive); under the microscope this leads to a distinctive high relief which combined with the common yellow-brown colour and lozenge-shape cross-section makes the mineral easy to identify. Transparent specimens are noted for their strong trichroism, the three colours presented being dependent on body colour. Owing to the quenching effect of iron, sphene exhibits no fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some titanite has been found to be metamict, in consequence of structural damage due to radioactive decomposition of the often significant thorium content. When viewed in thin section with a petrographic microscope, pleochroic halos can be observed in minerals surrounding a titanite crystal.\nOccurrence.\nTitanite occurs as a common accessory mineral in intermediate and felsic igneous rocks and associated pegmatites. It also occurs in metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schists and skarns. Source localities include: Pakistan; Italy; Russia; China; Brazil; Tujetsch, St. Gothard, Switzerland; Madagascar; Tyrol, Austria; Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada; Sanford, Maine, Gouverneur, Diana, Rossie, Fine, Pitcairn, Brewster, New York and California in the US.\nUses.\nTitanite is a source of titanium dioxide, TiO2, used in pigments.\nAs a gemstone, titanite is usually some shade of chartreuse, but can be brown or black. Hue depends on iron (Fe) content, with low Fe content causing green and yellow colours, and high Fe content causing brown or black hues. Zoning is typical in titanite. It is prized for its exceptional dispersive power (0.051, B to G interval) which exceeds that of diamond. Jewelry use of titanite is limited, both because the stone is uncommon in gem quality and is relatively soft.\nTitanite can also be used as a U-Pb geochronometer, specifically in metamorphic terranes.\nIn popular culture.\nTitanite is commonly mentioned in the Dark Souls video game series as a material used to upgrade weapons and various other items.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31092", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31092", "title": "Time management", "text": "Planning time spent on specific activities\nTime management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities\u2014especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency and productivity.\nTime management involves demands relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests and commitments. Using time effectively gives people more choices in managing activities. Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools and techniques, especially when accomplishing specific tasks, projects and goals complying with a due date.\nCultural views.\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a linear time view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America and most Northern European countries, such as Germany, Switzerland and England. People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time. This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more \"monochronic\", or preferring to do only one thing at a time. As a result, this focus on efficiency often leads to a culture of punctuality and a strong emphasis on meeting deadlines.\nAnother cultural time view is the multi-active time view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the better. This creates a sense of happiness. Multi-active cultures are \"polychronic\" or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy. In these cultures, people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations. In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last and instead focus on having high-quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.\nA final cultural time view is a cyclical time view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence there is an unlimited amount of it. This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia, including Japan and China. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to focus on completing tasks correctly, thus most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have, before acting on their plans. Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage. Consequently, this awareness often leads to a greater emphasis on relationships and the quality of interactions over strict adherence to schedules.\nNeuropsychology.\nExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.\nMethods.\nTask list organization.\nTask lists are often prioritized in the following ways:\nVarious writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following.\nGTD (Getting Things Done).\nThe Getting Things Done method, created by David Allen, is to finish small tasks immediately and for large tasks to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they are easy to see and manage. \"The truth is, it takes more energy to keep something inside your head than outside,\" says Allen.\nPomodoro.\nFrancesco Cirillo's \"Pomodoro Technique\" was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a tomato-shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The \"Pomodoro\" is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros.\nFranklin Planner.\nThe Franklin Planner is a paper-based time management system created by Hyrum W. Smith and named after Benjamin Franklin, which gained widespread popularity during the 1980s and 1990s. The methodology emphasizes connecting daily tasks to long-term goals and personal values, promoting the concept of \"beginning with the end in mind\" to ensure that daily activities align with larger life purposes. The system utilizes a ring-binder format planner containing specialized pages for daily planning, monthly and weekly calendars, goal-setting worksheets, and values clarification exercises. Its distinctive feature is the ABC priority system combined with numerical rankings (A1, A2, B1, etc.) for task prioritization, where A represents vital tasks, B important ones, and C nice-to-do items.\nEisenhower method.\nThe Eisenhower method or Eisenhower principle is a method that utilizes the principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: \"I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.\" Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to an unnamed \"former college president.\"\nUsing the Eisenhower decision principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower matrix. Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows.\nRelated concepts.\nTime management is related to the following concepts.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were the first punk band from the United Kingdom to release a single, \"New Rose\" (1976), release a studio album, \"Damned Damned Damned\" (1977) and tour the United States. Nine of the band's singles charted within the top 40 on the UK singles chart.\nThe band briefly dissolved after \"Music for Pleasure\" (1977), the follow-up to their debut studio album, was critically dismissed. They quickly re-formed without Brian James and released \"Machine Gun Etiquette\" (1979). In the 1980s, they released four studio albums: \"The Black Album\" (1980), \"Strawberries\" (1982), \"Phantasmagoria\" (1985) and \"Anything\" (1986), which saw the band moving toward a gothic rock style. The latter two albums did not feature Sensible, who had left the band in 1984. In 1988, James and Sensible rejoined to play a series of reunion gigs, one of which was released the next year as the live album \"Final Damnation\" (1989). Their fast-driven punk rock has been cited for influencing and shaping the emergence of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nThe Damned again re-formed for a tour in 1991. In 1995, they released a new studio album, \"Not of This Earth\", which was Scabies's last with the band (until the release of their 2026 album, \"Not Like Everybody Else)\". This was followed by \"Grave Disorder\" (2001), \"So, Who's Paranoid?\" (2008) and \"Evil Spirits\" (2018), their first studio album in the Official Charts top-10 list, landing at No. 7. Their most recent album, \"Darkadelic\", was released in 2023 and also made it into the Official Charts top-10 list, landing at No. 9. Despite experiencing numerous lineup changes, the formation of Vanian, Sensible, keyboardist Monty Oxymoron, drummer Pinch and bassist Stu West had been together from 2004 until 2017, when West left the band and former bassist Paul Gray rejoined. In 2019, drummer Pinch left the band, and in February 2022 he was replaced by Will Taylor, who left in November 2023, when Scabies rejoined.\nAs one of the first gothic rock bands, the Damned, featuring lead singer Vanian's baritone singing, dark lyrics and vampire-themed costume, were a major influence on the goth subculture.\nHistory.\nFormation and Stiff years (1976\u20131978).\nPrior to The Damned, Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns) and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) had been members of the band Masters of the Backside, which also included future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde. Brian James (Brian Robertson) had been a member of London SS, a band that never played live but also included musicians who later found fame in the Clash and Generation X. Scabies knew James through a failed audition as the drummer for London SS. When they decided to start their own band, with James on guitar and Scabies on drums, they invited Sid Vicious, later of the Sex Pistols, and Dave Vanian to audition to be the singer. However, only Vanian appeared, and he was added to the band. Sensible became the band's bassist, and the four called themselves the Damned. Chrissie Hynde would later write: \"Without me, they were probably the most musically accomplished punk outfit in town.\"\nThe Damned played their first show on 6 July 1976, supporting the Sex Pistols at the 100 Club. A lo-fi recording of the show was later released as \"Live at the 100 Club\" (2007). As part of London's burgeoning punk scene, the Damned again played the club on 20 September for the 100 Club Punk Festival.\nOn 22 October, five weeks before the release of the Sex Pistols' \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", Stiff Records released the Damned's first single \"New Rose\", thus making them the first UK punk band to release a single. The single's B-side was a fast-paced cover of the Beatles' \"Help!\". \"New Rose\" was described by critic Ned Raggett as a \"deathless anthem of nuclear-strength romantic angst.\"\nWhen the Sex Pistols released their single, they took the Damned, along with the Clash and Johnny Thunders' Heartbreakers, as openers for their December \"Anarchy Tour of the UK\". Many of the tour dates were cancelled by organizers or local authorities, with only seven of approximately 20 scheduled shows taking place. The Damned were expelled from the tour before its end by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren.\nThe Damned released their debut studio album, \"Damned Damned Damned\", on 18 February 1977. Produced by Nick Lowe, it was the first studio album released by a British punk band and included a new single, \"Neat Neat Neat\". The band toured to promote the album, in March opening for T. Rex on their final tour before Marc Bolan's death that September. Later that spring, they became the first British punk band to tour the United States. According to Brendan Mullen, founder of the Los Angeles club the Masque, their first tour of the U.S. found them favouring very fast tempos, helping to inspire the first wave of West Coast hardcore punk. Author Ian Winwood wrote, \"In terms of placing boots on the ground, it is The Damned who can be credited as having had the most influence on American punk rock.\"\nThat August, Lu Edmonds was added as a second guitarist. Although not yet obvious in their music, the band were heavily inspired by psychedelic rock. They unsuccessfully tried to recruit the reclusive Syd Barrett to produce their second studio album. They settled for his former Pink Floyd bandmate Nick Mason. In November 1977, the album was released as \"Music for Pleasure\" and was quickly dismissed by critics. Its failure precipitated the band's exit from Stiff Records. Scabies was also displeased with the album and quit the band after the recording. He was replaced by future Culture Club drummer Jon Moss, who played with the Damned until they dissolved in February 1978.\nRe-formation and \"Machine Gun Etiquette\" (1978\u20131979).\nThe former members of the band worked on a series of brief side projects and solo recordings, all making little commercial impact. Scabies formed a one-off band called \"Les Punks\" for a late 1978 gig. Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of the Damned (without Brian James or Edmonds) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist Lemmy of Hawkwind and Mot\u00f6rhead. The Damned tentatively re-formed with the \"Les Punks\" lineup in early 1979, but originally performed as \"The Doomed\" to avoid potential trademark problems. Sensible switched to guitar and keyboards, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances and a slightly longer period with Henry Badowski on bass, the bassist position was filled by Algy Ward, formerly of the Saints. During a December 1978 tour of Scotland, Gary Holton substituted for Vanian.\nThe band officially went by the Damned again, playing their first gig under that name in April 1979 and signing a recording contract with Chiswick Records. They returned to the studio and released the charting singles \"Love Song\" and \"Smash It Up\", followed by 1979's \"Machine Gun Etiquette\" and then a cover version of Jefferson Airplane's \"White Rabbit\". Vanian's vocals had by now expanded from the high baritone of the early records to a smoother crooning style.\n\"Machine Gun Etiquette\" (1979) featured a strong 1960s garage-rock influence with a Farfisa organ on several songs. Recording at London's Wessex Studios at the same time as the Clash were there to record \"London Calling\" (1979), Joe Strummer and Mick Jones made an uncredited vocal appearance on the title track. \"Machine Gun Etiquette\" (1979) received largely positive reviews; Ira Robbins and Jay Pattyn of \"Trouser Press\" described it as \"a great record by a band many had already counted out.\"\nShift towards gothic rock (1980\u20131987).\nWard left the band in 1980, to be replaced by Paul Gray, formerly of Eddie and the Hot Rods. \"The Black Album\" was released later that year, produced by the band themselves apart from one track produced by Hans Zimmer, with three sides of the double album consisting of studio tracks, including the theatrical 17-minute song \"Curtain Call\". Side 4 featured a selection of live tracks recorded at Shepperton Studios. It was their last album for Chiswick.\nIn 1981, the Damned released \"Friday 13th\", a four-song EP that featured the original tracks \"Disco Man\", \"Billy Bad Breaks\", \"Limit Club\" and a cover version of the Rolling Stones song \"Citadel\".\nIn 1982, the Damned released their only studio album for Bronze Records, \"Strawberries\". The band had now expanded to a quintet with the addition of full-time keyboardist Roman Jugg. At the time, Sensible was splitting his time between the Damned and his own solo career, having reached chart success in the UK with the 1982 number-one hit \"Happy Talk\". The band's next album, a one-off side project recorded without Sensible, was the soundtrack to an imaginary 1960s movie called \"Give Daddy the Knife, Cindy\". For this limited-run album of 1960s cover songs, the band was billed as Naz Nomad and the Nightmares.\nIn 1984, the Damned performed on the BBC Two sitcom \"The Young Ones\" with their song \"Nasty\", featuring new bassist Bryn Merrick (replacing Gray) and both Jugg and Sensible on guitar. Sensible played his last concert with the band at Brockwell Park before leaving to pursue his solo career.\nFrom the earliest days of the band, Vanian had adopted a vampire-like appearance onstage, with chalk-white makeup and formal dress. With Sensible gone, Vanian's image became more characteristic of the band as a whole. The Damned signed a recording contract with major label MCA Records, and the \"Phantasmagoria\" album followed in July 1985, preceded by the UK No.\u00a021 single \"Grimly Fiendish\". Other hits from the same album were \"The Shadow of Love\" with a gloomy gothic sound, and the lighter \"Is It a Dream?\".\nIn January 1986, the non-album single \"Eloise\", a cover version of the 1968 hit by Barry Ryan, became a No.\u00a03 chart success in the UK, the band's highest chart placing to date.\n\"Phantasmagoria\"'s December 1986 followup \"Anything\" was a commercial disappointment, although MCA included one of its tracks (\"In Dulce Decorum\") on the \"Miami Vice II\" soundtrack release. The cover of Love's \"Alone Again Or\" was also released as a single.\nLate in 1987, the Damned began to work on a new studio album for MCA, but the output of these sessions remains unreleased as the record contract was dissolved. Two of the new songs (\"Gunning for Love\" and \"The Loveless and the Damned\") were later rerecorded by the Dave Vanian and the Phantom Chords side project.\nReunion and farewell tours (1988\u201389).\nIn June 1988, James and Sensible rejoined the group temporarily for three live appearances, including a concert at the London Town and Country Club that was released the following year as the album \"Final Damnation\". \nIn June 1989, James and Sensible rejoined the group for two UK appearances billed as \"The Final Curtain\". In July this lineup performed a farewell tour of the U.S. and in December they performed a further five UK gigs advertised as the \"We Really Must Be Going Now\" tour. \nSecond and third re-formations (1990\u20131995).\nAlthough officially on hiatus, the Damned released \"Fun Factory\", a song which was recorded in 1982 with the Sensible/Vanian/Scabies/Gray lineup and intended to be released as a single at that time. However, the bankruptcy of their record company prevented the release of the song for nine years. The year's second single, \"Prokofiev\", was recorded by Scabies, Vanian and Brian James, and was sold on a 1991 reunion tour of the U.S.\nIn 1993, the band re-formed with a new lineup featuring Scabies, Vanian, guitarists Kris Dollimore (formerly of the Godfathers), Alan Lee Shaw and bassist Moose Harris (formerly of New Model Army). Around this time, two prominent rock groups each covered a Damned song: Guns N' Roses recorded \"New Rose\" for their \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" 1993 album, while the Offspring covered \"Smash It Up\" for the \"Batman Forever\" soundtrack (1995). Both cover versions enjoyed major-label distribution and created more exposure to the Damned's sound, sometimes to a younger audience unfamiliar with the group.\nThe re-formed Damned toured regularly for about two years and released a new studio album, \"Not of This Earth\", in November 1995, which was promoted with a series of long tours prior to its release. However, by the time the album was released, the Damned had yet again split, partly as the result of legal battles; Vanian and Sensible accused Scabies of releasing \"Not of This Earth\" (1995) without proper authorization.\nReturn of Captain Sensible and new lineup (1996\u20132003).\nSensible rejoined Vanian in 1996 and yet another formation of the Damned appeared. This initially featured bassist Paul Gray, who was later replaced by Patricia Morrison, previously of Bags, the Gun Club and The Sisters of Mercy.\nBy February 1999, the Damned consisted of Vanian, Sensible, Morrison and new recruits Monty Oxymoron on keyboards and Spike T. Smith on drums. Smith later joined Morrissey's live band and recommended that the Damned recruit Andy (Pinch) Pinching, a founding member of English Dogs, to replace him on drums. Garrie Dreadful, a recruit from Sensible's solo band, had played drums from 1997 to 1999 before Smith's arrival. In 2001, the band released the album \"Grave Disorder\" on Dexter Holland's Nitro Records label and promoted it with continual touring. A spring tour of the U.S. was planned in 2002 supporting Rob Zombie. However, the band withdrew after a few shows. Sensible said that \"gothic punk was completely lost on the predominantly metal crowds.\" In the summer, the band played the Vans Warped Tour in the U.S.\nLineup change, 40th anniversary, and new album (2004\u20132019).\nMorrison and Vanian married and had a daughter, Emily, born on 9 February 2004. Around this time, Morrison retired from performing with the band, although she remained involved with the Damned as their manager. Her replacement on bass was Stu West.\nIn 2006, the Damned released the single \"Little Miss Disaster\" and a live DVD \"MGE25\" documenting a 2004 Manchester concert celebrating the 25th anniversary of \"Machine Gun Etiquette\" (1979). On 21 October 2006, BBC Radio 2 broadcast an hour-long documentary titled \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\" concerning the recording of the Damned's first single \"New Rose\" and the group's place in the 1976 London punk scene. Featuring interviews with James, Sensible, Scabies, Glen Matlock, Don Letts and Chrissie Hynde, the programme discussed the bands and personalities around the scene, particularly the Anarchy in the U.K. tour.\nOn 28 October 2008, the Damned released their tenth studio album, \"So, Who's Paranoid?\", a digital release, followed by a physical release on the English Channel label on 10 November (UK) and 9 December (U.S.). To promote the album, the band appeared twice on American television, including a visit to \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". The band undertook a 23-date UK tour to promote their new studio album, supported by Devilish Presley and Slicks Kitchen.\nIn November 2009, the band supported Mot\u00f6rhead on the UK leg of their world tour.\nContinual touring occurred throughout the UK and Europe over the next few years. In 2012, the Damned played South America for the first time, with dates in S\u00e3o Paulo and Buenos Aires. They returned to the Rhythm Festival, one of only four headline acts to return over the festival's seven-year history. In 2012, the Damned announced that they would return for 2013's Rebellion Festival alongside the Exploited, the Casualties and others.\nOn 7 November 2014, Sensible and Vanian appeared on Ken Reid's \"TV Guidance Counselor\" podcast.\nIn 2015, the Damned were featured in a documentary by director Wes Orshoski titled \"\". The documentary charts the history of the band against a backdrop of archival footage, new interviews and tour footage from 2011 to 2014.\nAfter the release of the film on 12 September 2015, former bassist Bryn Merrick, who had played on \"Phantasmagoria\" (1985) and \"Anything\" (1986), died of throat cancer. At the time of his death, he had been playing in a Ramones tribute band called Shamones.\nIn May 2016, the band played a 40th anniversary show at the Royal Albert Hall.\nIn the summer of 2017, \"Neat Neat Neat\" was prominently featured in the action film \"Baby Driver\" and its soundtrack. On 11 September 2017, the band announced that Stu West was leaving the band and that former bassist Paul Gray would be returning for the new studio album. \"Evil Spirits\", the band's eleventh album and first in ten years, was released on 13 April 2018. It peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart, their highest-ever chart position, topping their previous high of No. 11 in 1985 (\"Phantasmagoria\"). The album, which was largely crowdfunded through PledgeMusic, was recorded in November 2017 in New York City and was produced by Tony Visconti. The album was preceded by the first single, \"Standing on the Edge of Tomorrow\", in January 2018 along with the singles \"Devil in Disguise\" and \"Look Left\" in March 2018 and \"Procrastination\" in April 2018.\nOn 23 May 2019, the Damned started a tour performing their third studio album, \"Machine Gun Etiquette\" (1979), which they had not played in full since its release. The tour included venues such as the House of Blues, Punk Rock Bowling and Music Festival and Rebellion Festival.\nDeparture of Pinch, final original lineup shows, Darkadelic, and Scabies' return (2019\u2013present).\nOn 25 October 2019, Pinch announced his departure after 20 years with the band. His last gig was the Damned's show at the London Palladium on 27 October 2019.\nOn 21 October 2020, the Damned announced that in 2021 the original lineup of Vanian, Sensible, James and Scabies would play a series of shows. This would mark the first time in more than two decades that James and Scabies had played with Vanian and Sensible. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the tour until 2022.\nIn February 2022, Pinch was replaced by drummer Will Taylor. In February 2023, the band's next studio album, \"Darkadelic\", was announced and it was released on 28 April 2023. The album was preceded by the singles and music videos for \"The Invisible Man\" on 3 February 2023, \"Beware of the Clown\" on 10 March 2023 and \"You're Gonna Realise\" on 21 April 2023. All three music videos were directed by Martin Gooch.\nFormer bassist Algy Ward, who had played on \"Machine Gun Etiquette\", died on 17 May 2023. After leaving the Damned, Ward had formed the NWOBHM band Tank in 1980.\nWill Taylor announced his departure as the Damned's drummer in November 2023. Later that month, it was announced that original drummer Scabies had rejoined the band on a permanent basis.\nFounding member and original guitarist Brian James died on 6 March 2025. After his time with The Damned he co-founded The Lords of the New Church, a supergroup with ex-members of Dead Boys, Sham 69 and The Barracudas, before focusing on a solo career in later years.\nMembers.\nCurrent members\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Tu-144 conducted 102 commercial flights, of which only 55 carried passengers, at an average service altitude of and cruised at a speed of around (Mach 2). The Tu-144 first went supersonic on 5 June 1969, four months before Concorde, and on 26 May 1970 became the world's first commercial transport to exceed Mach 2.\nReliability and developmental issues restricted the viability of the Tu-144 for regular use; these factors, together with repercussions of the 1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash, projections of high operating costs, and rising fuel prices and environmental concerns outside the Soviet Union, caused foreign customer interest to wane. The Tu-144 was introduced into commercial service with Aeroflot between Moscow and Alma-Ata on 26 December 1975 and starting 1 November 1977 passenger flights began; it was withdrawn less than seven months later after a new Tu-144 variant crash-landed during a test flight on 23 May 1978. The Tu-144 remained in commercial service as a cargo aircraft until the cancellation of the Tu-144 programme in 1983. The Tu-144 was later used by the Soviet space programme to train pilots of the Buran spacecraft, and by NASA for a supersonic research programme from June 1996 to April 1999. The Tu-144 made its final flight on 26 June 1999 and surviving aircraft were put on display in Russia, the former Soviet Union and Germany, or into storage.\nBackground.\nGiven the vast size of the Soviet Union, supersonic travel was seen as economically feasible, especially for government employees travelling between Moscow and Siberian cities. Flying was the only practical alternative to week-long rail journeys, and supersonic transport could significantly cut travel times. While the idea of SSTs was controversial in the West due to noise and environmental pollution concerns, the Soviet Union planned to continue with their development, largely for its long Siberian and Central Asian routes. With ample airspace, flight corridors were likely to avoid built-up areas. Even if international landing rights were not granted, the Tu-144 could still be used for domestic and regional flights.\nAeroflot, the flag carrier of the Soviet Union, had an extensive network of interconnected airfields and increasing international reach, with hopes of extending flights to Sydney, Australia. Initial estimates suggested that 20 Tu-144s would suffice for Aeroflot's domestic and international needs.\nGiven the geopolitical climate during the Cold War period, the Soviet Union was intent on not just matching, but surpassing Western advancements, particularly in aerospace technology. The idea of the West getting ahead and leaving the Soviet Union behind was unthinkable. The directive from Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union at that time, was clear: not only prevent the West from getting ahead, but also compete fiercely, even to the extent of leapfrogging their technological advancements, if necessary.\nThe aircraft was seen as a formidable challenge to the United States' dominance in the field of civil aviation.\nDevelopment.\nThe Soviet government published the concept of the Tu-144 in an article in the January 1962 issue of the magazine \"Technology of Air Transport\". The air ministry started development of the Tu-144 on 26 July 1963, 10 days after the design was approved by the Council of Ministers. The plan called for five flying prototypes to be built in four years, with the first aircraft to be ready in 1966.\nDespite the similarity in appearance of the Tu-144 to the Anglo-French supersonic aircraft (which earned it the nickname \"Concordski\"), there were significant differences between the two aircraft. The Tu-144 is bigger and faster than the Concorde (M2.15 vs. M2.04). Concorde used an electronic engine control package from Lucas, which Tupolev was not permitted to purchase for the Tu-144 as it could also be used on military aircraft. Concorde's designers used fuel as coolant for the cabin air conditioning and for the hydraulic system (see Concorde for details). Tupolev also used fuel/hydraulic heat exchangers, but used cooling turbines for the cabin air.\nThe Tu-144 prototype was a full-scale demonstrator aircraft with the very different production aircraft being developed in parallel. The MiG-21I (1968; Izdeliye 21\u201311; \"Analog\") I = Imitator (\"Simulator\") was a testbed for the wing design of the Tu-144 but came too late to provide inputs for the first prototype. The findings of the MiG-21I led to the completely redesigned wing of the following aircraft. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and chordwise camber.187\nThey also added two small retractable surfaces called a moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted leading-edge slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.\nMoving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift, but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to .\nDesign.\nAlong with early Tu-134s, the Tu-144 was one of the last commercial aircraft with a braking parachute. The Tu-144 was not fitted with any reverse thrust capabilities, and so the parachute was used as the sole alternative. A prototype without passenger seats was fitted with ejection seats for pilots.\nThe aircraft was designed for a 30,000-hour service life over 15 years. Airframe heating and the high temperature properties of the primary structural materials, which were aluminium alloys, set the maximum speed at Mach 2.2.49 15% by weight was titanium and 23% non-metallic materials. Titanium or stainless steel were used for the leading edges, elevons, rudder and the rear fuselage engine-exhaust heat shield.\nEngines.\nSSTs for M2.2 had been designed in the Soviet Union before Tupolev was tasked with developing one. Design studies for the Myasishchev SST had shown that a cruise specific fuel consumption (SFC) of not more than 1.2\u00a0kg/kgp hr would be required. The only engine available in time with the required thrust and suitable for testing and perfecting the aircraft was the afterburning Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan with a cruise SFC of 1.58\u00a0kg/kgp hr. Development of an alternative engine to meet the SFC requirement, a non-afterburning turbojet, the Kolesov RD-36-51A, began in 1964. It took a long time for this engine to achieve acceptable SFC and reliability.42 In the meantime the NK-144 high SFC gave a limited range of about , far less than Concorde. A maximum speed of (Mach 2.35) was reached with afterburning. Afterburners were added to Concorde to meet its take-off thrust requirement and were not necessary for supersonic cruise; the Tu-144 used maximum afterburner for take-off and minimum for cruise.110\nThe Tu-144S, of which nine were produced, was fitted with the Kuznetsov NK-144A turbofan to address lack of take-off thrust and surge margin. SFC at M2.0 was 1.81\u00a0kg/kgp hr. A further improvement, the NK-144V, achieved the required SFC, but too late to influence the decision to use the Kolesov RD-36-51.135\nThe Tu-144D, of which five were produced (plus one uncompleted), was powered by the Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet with an SFC of 1.22\u00a0kg/kgp hr. The range with full payload increased to 5,330\u00a0km compared to 6,470\u00a0km for Concorde.248 Plans for an aircraft with a range in excess of range were never implemented.\nThe engine intakes had variable intake ramps and bypass flaps with positions controlled automatically to suit the engine airflow. They were very long to help prevent surging;131 twice as long as those on Concorde. Jean Rech (Sud Aviation) states the need for excessive length was based on the misconception that length was required to attenuate intake distortion. The intakes were to be shortened by 10 feet on the projected Tu-144M.178\nThe Kolesov RD-36-51 had an unusual translating plug nozzle as an alternative to a variable con-di nozzle, either of which give the variable area ratio required for the range of nozzle pressures which come from low inlet ram at low speeds to high at Mach 2. A plug nozzle was studied for Concorde but rejected as it was not certain that it could be cooled adequately during afterburner operation. The RD-36-51 had no afterburner.\nAirframe.\nThe aircraft was assembled from parts machined from large slabs, many over long and wide. While at the time, this approach was heralded as an advanced feature of the design, it turned out that finished parts contained defects which had not been detected in the raw material. Cracks formed at the defects at load levels below that which the part was expected to withstand. Once a crack started to grow, it spread quickly over many metres, with no crack-arresting design feature to stop it. In 1976, during repeat-load and static testing at TsAGI (Russia's \"Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute\"), a Tu-144S airframe cracked at 70% of the design flight load with cracks running many metres in both directions from their origin.\nTwo Tu-144S airframes suffered structural failures during laboratory testing just prior to the Tu-144 entering passenger service. The problem, discovered in 1976, may have been known prior to this testing; a large crack was discovered in the airframe of the prototype Tu-144 (aircraft 68001) during a stopover in Warsaw following its appearance at the 1971 Paris Air Show. Polish sources say the crack was discovered after the aircraft made an emergency landing due to the failure of both left-hand engines; however, an Aeroflot spokesperson denied the damage and disputed the circumstances of the landing.\nLater the same year, a test airframe was subjected to a test simulating the temperatures and pressures occurring during a flight. High skin temperatures of were caused by kinetic heating when the boundary layer air reached during cruise. The Tu-144 was placed in an environmental chamber and heated to simulate the skin getting hot quickly, during acceleration to cruising speed, while the underlying structure took a while to reach its equilibrium temperature. This thermal effect caused internal stresses and the situation was reversed while slowing down and descending. The pressure in the cabin, which caused additional stresses, was changed at the same time as the skin heating to simulate climbing to cruise altitude and then descending. Repeatedly cycling the temperature and pressure, as happened with the aircraft in service, caused fatigue damage and the airframe failed in a similar way to that of the TsAGI load testing.\nAccording to Iosif Fridlyander, an aerospace aluminium and beryllium alloys expert,88 the Tu-144 design allowed a higher incidence of defects in the alloy structure, leading to the fatal in-air breakup of the aircraft in the 1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash.91 This conclusion was supported by some of the designers involved in the aircraft's development. Vadim Razumikhin wrote that the load factor experienced by the plane at the moment of the break-up was less than the design limit. If the stress tests had been conducted earlier, the disaster may have been averted. Eventually, the airframe was strengthened and the control system was modified to prevent overstressing the aircraft.Ch. 3.14.\nFlight testing.\nTu-144 suffered from a rush in the design process to the detriment of thoroughness and quality.\"55 flights\" According to Concorde technical flight manager Brian Calvert, \"the rush to get [Tu-144] airborne exacted a heavy penalty later\". Concorde's first flight was originally scheduled for February 1968, but was pushed back several times until March 1969 in order to iron out problems and test components more thoroughly.127 The rush is apparent even in outward timing: the 1963 government decree launching the Tu-144 programme defined that the Tu-144 should fly in 1968; it first flew on the last day of 1968 (31 December) to fulfill government goals set five years earlier.\nProduction.\nSixteen airworthy Tu-144 airplanes were built:\nAlthough its last commercial passenger flight was in 1978, production of the Tu-144 did not cease until 1983, when construction of the final airframe was stopped and left partially complete. The last production aircraft, Tu-144D number 77116, was not completed and was left derelict for many years on Voronezh East airfield. There was at least one ground test airframe for static testing in parallel with the development of prototype 68001.\nOperational history.\nEntry into service.\nThe introduction of the Tu-144 into passenger service was timed to the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution, as was duly noted in Soviet officials' speeches delivered at the airport before the inaugural flight \u2013 whether the aircraft was actually ready for passenger service was deemed of secondary importance. Even the outward details of the inaugural Tu-144 flight betrayed the haste of its introduction into service: several ceiling panels were ajar, service trays stuck, window shades dropped without being pulled, reading lights did not work, not all toilets worked and a broken ramp delayed departure half an hour. On arrival to Alma-Ata, the Tu-144 was towed back and forth for 25 minutes to align it correctly with the exit ramp. Flight testing time logged on the prototype (68001) was 180 hours;44 flight testing time until the completion of state acceptance tests was 1509 hours, followed with 835 hours of flight time of service tests until the commencement of passenger service.\nThe Tu-144S went into service on 26 December 1975, flying mail and freight between Moscow and Alma-Ata in preparation for passenger services, which commenced on 1 November 1977. The type certificate was issued by the USSR Gosaviaregister on 29 October 1977.\nThe passenger service ran a semi-scheduled service until the first Tu-144D experienced an in-flight failure during a pre-delivery test flight, crash-landing on 23 May 1978 with two crew fatalities. The Tu-144's 55th and last scheduled passenger flight occurred on 1 June 1978.\nAn Aeroflot freight-only service recommenced using the new production variant \"Tu-144D\" (\"D\" for \"Dal'nyaya\" \u2013 \"long range\") aircraft on 23 June 1979, including longer routes from Moscow to Khabarovsk made possible by the more efficient Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet engines, which also increased the maximum cruising speed to Mach 2.15.\nThere were only 103 scheduled flights before the Tu-144 was removed from commercial service.\nEarly flights.\nDuring 102 flights and 181 hours of freight and passenger flight time, the Tu-144S suffered more than 226 failures; 80 of them occurred in flight and 80 of them were severe enough to affect the flight schedule. The most frequent sources of trouble were the flight instruments, navigation gear, radios, and autopilot.\nAfter the inaugural flight, two subsequent flights during the next two weeks were cancelled and the third flight rescheduled. The official reason given by Aeroflot for cancellation was bad weather at Alma-Ata; however when the journalist called the Aeroflot office in Alma-Ata about local weather, the office said that the weather there was perfect and one aircraft had already arrived that morning. Subsequent and significant documented Tu-144 failures included insufficient cabin pressurisation in flight on 27 December 1977, a landing gear switch fault on 29 January 1978 that indicated that the gear was lowered when it was in fact retracted, and engine-exhaust duct overheating causing the flight to be aborted and returned to the takeoff airport on 14 March 1978. Additionally, a metal fatigue problem was discovered in the tip of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer; this was mitigated by adding a titanium doubler plate.\nAleksey Tupolev, Tu-144 chief designer, and two USSR vice-ministers (of aviation industry and of civil aviation) had to be personally present at Domodedovo airport before each scheduled Tu-144 departure to review the condition of the aircraft and make a joint decision on whether it could be released into flight. Subsequently, flight cancellations became less common, as several Tu-144s were docked at Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport.\nIncident on 25 January 1978.\nTu-144 pilot Aleksandr Larin remembers a troublesome flight around 25 January 1978. The flight with passengers suffered the failure of 22 to 24 onboard systems. Seven to eight systems failed before takeoff, but given the large number of foreign TV and radio journalists and also other foreign notables aboard the flight, it was decided to proceed with the flight to avoid the embarrassment of cancellation. After takeoff, failures continued to multiply. While the aircraft was supersonic en route to the destination airport, Tupolev bureau's crisis centre predicted that the front and left landing gear would not extend and that the aircraft would have to land on the right gear alone, at a landing speed of over . Due to expected political fallout, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was personally notified of what was going on in the air. With the accumulated failures, an alarm siren went off immediately after takeoff, with sound and volume similar to that of a civil defence warning. The crew could not figure a way to switch it off so the siren stayed on throughout the remaining 75 minutes of the flight. Eventually, the captain ordered the navigator to borrow a pillow from the passengers and stuff it inside the siren's horn. After all the suspense, all landing gear extended and the aircraft landed.\nA subsequent flight of Tu-144 on around 30 May 1978, not long before the type was withdrawn from passenger service, involved valve failure on one of the fuel tanks.\nCabin noise.\nA problem for passengers was the very high noise level inside the cabin, measuring at least 90\u201395\u00a0dB on average. The noise came from the engines; unlike Concorde, it could only sustain supersonic speeds using afterburners continuously. In addition, the active heat insulation system used for the air conditioning, which used the flow of spent cabin air, was described as excessively noisy. Passengers seated next to each other could have a conversation only with difficulty, and those seated two seats apart could not hear each other even when screaming and had to pass hand-written notes instead. Noise in the rear of the cabin was described as unbearable.\nLater use.\nThe Tu-144 programme was cancelled by a Soviet government decree on 1 July 1983 that also provided for future use of the remaining Tu-144 aircraft as airborne laboratories. In 1985, Tu-144D were used to train pilots for the Soviet Buran space shuttle. In 1986\u20131988 Tu-144D No. 77114, built in 1981, was used for medical and biological research of high-altitude atmosphere radiological conditions. Further research was planned but not completed, due to lack of funding.\nUse by NASA.\nIn the early 1990s, Judith de Paul, and her company IBP Aerospace brokered an agreement with Tupolev, NASA, Rockwell and later Boeing. They offered a Tu-144 as a testbed for NASA's High Speed Commercial Research programme, which was intended to design a second-generation supersonic jetliner called the High Speed Civil Transport. In 1995, Tu-144D No. 77114 (with only 82.5 hours of flight time) was taken out of storage and after extensive modification at a cost of US$350million, designated the \"Tu-144LL\" (where LL is a Russian abbreviation for Flying Laboratory, , \"Letayushchaya Laboratoriya\"). The aircraft made 27 flights in Russia during 1996 and 1997. Though regarded as a technical success, the project was cancelled for lack of funding in 1999.\nThis aircraft was reportedly sold in 2001 online, but the aircraft sale did not proceed. Tejavia Systems, the company handling the transaction, reported that the deal was not signed as the replacement Kuznetsov NK-321 engines also used in a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber were military hardware and the Russian government would not allow them to be exported.\nIn 2003, after the retirement of Concorde, there was renewed interest from several wealthy individuals who wanted to use the Tu-144LL for a transatlantic record attempt, despite the high cost of a flight readiness overhaul even if military authorities would authorize the use of NK-321 engines outside Russian Federation airspace.\nReasons for failure and cancellation.\nLimited routes.\nOnly one commercial route, Moscow to Alma-Ata (now Almaty), was ever used and flights were limited to one a week, despite there being eight Tu-144S certified aircraft available and a number of other routes suitable for supersonic flights, suggesting that the Aeroflot decision-makers had little confidence in the Tu-144 commercial viability when passenger service began in 1977.\nCompressor disc and other failures.\nOn 31 August 1980, Tu-144D (77113) suffered an uncontained compressor disc failure in supersonic flight which damaged part of the airframe structure and systems. The crew was able to perform an emergency landing at Engels-2 strategic bomber base.60\nOn 12 November 1981, a Tu-144D's RD-36-51 engine was destroyed during bench tests, leading to a temporary suspension of all Tu-144D flights. It became the final blow, which resulted in the cancellation of the project by the Ministry of Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.91\nOne of the Tu-144Ds (77114, a.k.a. aircraft 101) suffered a crack across the bottom panel of its wing.13\nEconomic inefficiency.\nGlobal trends facilitated the transition of jet transportation from a luxury available only to the elite, to a widespread form of mass transportation. Although the 1973 oil crisis did not directly impact decision-making processes within the Soviet Union, the expansion of Soviet air travel in the late 1970s made the supply of aviation fuel a growth constraint, and it was obvious that potential Western buyers were heavily dissuaded by high fuel prices. By the late 1970s, Soviet promotional efforts shifted to the Ilyushin Il-86, a more economically efficient jumbo jet that went on to become the country's flagship airliner. Moon notes that in 1976, Aeroflot was promoting the Il-86 over the Tu-144, despite the latter's incipient and long-awaited entry into service.\nG.A. Cheryomukhin, an aerodynamics engineer who took part in the design and certification of Tu-144,88 wrote that the Ministry of Civil Aviation was concerned that the continuation and expansion of the SST's operation would have forced the Ministry to make significant long-term investments.91\nMoon concluded that economic efficiency alone would not have doomed the Tu-144 altogether; continuation of token flights for reasons of political prestige would have been possible, if only the aircraft itself would have allowed for it, but it did not. The Tu-144 was to a large extent intended to be, and trumpeted as, a symbol of Soviet technological prestige and superiority.\nTupolev design bureau and rivalry with Ilyushin.\nFridlyander and Moon point out that by the early 1970s, Tupolev's bureau had to work on other projects, including the Tu-154 and Tu-204 passenger aircraft, and the Tu-22M and Tu-160 bombers. Despite large and high-priority resource investment in the Tu-144 development programme and the fact that a large part of the whole Soviet R&amp;D infrastructure was subordinated to the Tu-144 project, parallel project development overwhelmed the bureau causing it to lose focus and make design errors.90\nAlexander Poukhov, one of the Tu-144 design engineers who subsequently rose to be one of the bureau's senior designers, estimated in 1998 that the Tu-144 project was 10\u201315 years beyond the USSR's capabilities at that time.\nMoon suggests that Tupolev's difficulties in developing the Tu-144, together with a need to prioritize bomber development, prompted Soviet leaders to shift airliner development to the rival Ilyushin design bureau, which had recently introduced the successful Il-76 military transport and was developing the Il-86 to move much larger numbers of passengers at a much lower per-seat cost than the Tu-144. Moon contrasts the Ilyushin bureau's careful advance research into operating costs and its marketing surveys of Aeroflot customers with the \"technocratic futurism\" embodied by the Tu-144, suggesting that Soviet leaders recognized that the Il-86 better addressed real-world transportation needs in the Soviet Union and elsewhere.\nCessation of Tu-144D production.\nThe decision to cease Tu-144D production was issued on 7 January 1982, followed by a USSR government decree dated 1 July 1983 to cease the whole Tu-144 programme and to use produced Tu-144 aircraft as flying laboratories.\nSoviet leadership failure.\nHoward Moon, who authored \"Soviet SST\" in 1989, attributed the downfall of the ostensibly promising Tu-144 programme to the Soviet leadership's decision to leverage it as a political weapon against the West. He regarded the programme as both an \"astounding achievement\" and a \"magnificent failure\".\nThe rushed introduction to service of poorly tested aircraft happened previously with another Tupolev project that had high political visibility and prestige: the Tu-104 passenger jet-liner was the first successful Soviet passenger jet in service. In a decision-making similar to the Tu-144-story, the Soviet government introduced the Tu-104 into passenger service before satisfactory stability and controllability had been achieved. During high-altitude and high-speed flight the aircraft was prone to longitudinal instability, and also at high altitudes, it had a narrow range of angle of attack separating the aircraft from stalls known as coffin corner. These problems created the preconditions for spin dives, that happened twice before the Tu-104 was eventually properly tested and the problem was resolved.\nPersonal factors.\nLeonid Selyakov, a notable Soviet aircraft designer,88 considered the primary reason for ending the Soviet Supersonic Transport project to be the personal factor\u2014the role of the Chief Designer, who failed to show due courage and defend his Bureau's brainchild following the tragic event near Yegoryevsk. \"Cowardice and progress are incompatible,\" Selyakov sternly summarized.91\nG.A. Cheryomukhin identified several major \"blows\" to the Tu-144 project. The first three were the death of Andrei Tupolev in 1972, the disaster at the Air Show in 1973, and the death of the active and authoritative Minister of the USSR's Aviation Industry Pyotr Vasilievich Dementyev (1907\u20131977). Dementyev had been at the helm of the domestic aviation industry for many years and was one of the champions of the SST program. The fourth blow came with Aleksey Tupolev's direction on 30 May 1978, to cancel the SST flight and temporarily halt aircraft operations. Cheryomukhin bitterly noted, \"...our own leader \u2013 A.A. Tupolev \u2013 personally stopped the operation of the Tu-144, depriving the world of a source of evidence of the rationality of supersonic flight over land...\"91\nAfter project cancellation.\nAfter ceasing the Tu-144 programme, Tu-144D No. 77114 (aircraft 101 or 08-2) carried out test flights between the 13\u201320 July 1983 to establish 13 world records registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale (FAI).\n These records established an altitude of with a range of loads up to 30 tonnes, and a sustained speed of over a closed circuit of up to with similar loads.\nTo put the numbers in perspective, Concorde's service ceiling under a typical Transatlantic flight payload of 10 tonnes was , and this is higher than the record set by the Tu-144D. According to unverified sources, during a 26 March 1974 test flight a Concorde reached its maximum speed ever of (Mach 2.23) at an altitude of , and during subsequent test flights reached maximum altitude of .\nConcorde was originally designed for cruising speeds up to Mach 2.2, but its regular service speed was limited to Mach 2.02 to extend airframe life. One of Tupolev's web site pages states that \"TU-144 and TU-160 aircraft operation has demonstrated expediency of limitation of cruise supersonic speed of M=2.0 to provide structure service life and to limit cruising altitude\".\nVariants.\nProposed military versions.\nEarly configurations of the Tu-144 were based on the unbuilt Tupolev Tu-135 bomber, retaining the latter aircraft's canard layout, wings and nacelles. Deriving from the Tu-135 bomber, Tupolev's early design for supersonic passenger airplane was code-named Tu-135P before acquiring the Tu-144 project code.\nOver the course of the Tu-144 project, the Tupolev bureau created designs of a number of military versions of Tu-144 but none were ever built. In the early 1970s, Tupolev was developing the Tu-144R intended to carry and air-launch up to three solid-fueled ICBMs. The launch was to be performed from within Soviet air space, with the aircraft accelerating to its maximum speed before releasing the missiles. The original design was based on the Tu-144S, but later changed to be derived from the Tu-144D. Another version of the design was to carry air-launched long-range cruise missiles similar to the Kh-55. The study of this version envisioned the use of liquid hydrogen for the afterburners.\nIn the late 1970s, Tupolev contemplated the development of a long-range heavy interceptor (DP-2) based on the Tu-144D also able to escort bombers on long-range missions. Later this project evolved into an aircraft for electronic countermeasures (ECM) to suppress enemy radars and facilitate bomber's penetration through enemy air defenses (Tu-144PP). In the early 1980s this functionality was supplanted with theatre and strategic reconnaissance (Tu-144PR).\nThe dimmer civil prospects for Tu-144 were becoming apparent the more Tupolev tried to \"sell\" the aircraft to the military. One of the last attempts to sell a military version of the Tu-144 was the Tu-144MR, a project for a long-range reconnaissance aircraft for the Soviet Navy intended to provide targeting information to the Navy's ships and submarines on sea and oceanic theaters of operations. Another proposed navy version was to have a strike capability (two Kh-45 air-to-surface cruise missiles), along with a reconnaissance function. The Tu-144MR was also to have served as a carrier aircraft for the Tupolev Voron reconnaissance drone, designed to compete with the Lockheed D-21 and influenced by it, but the project never materialised.\nThe military was unreceptive to Tupolev's approaches. Vasily Reshetnikov, the commander of Soviet Long-Range Aviation and subsequently, a vice-commander of the Soviet Air Force, remembers how, in 1972, he was dismayed by Tupolev's attempts to offer for military use the aircraft that \"fell short of its performance target, was beset by reliability problems, fuel-thirsty and difficult to operate\".\nReshetnikov goes on to remember:\nThe development and construction of the supersonic airliner, the future Tu-144, was included in the five-year plan and was under the auspices of the influential D.F. Ustinov (then Soviet minister of defence and confidant of Brezhnev, who represented interests of defence industries lobby in opposition to the military) who regarded this mission as a personal responsibility \u2013 not so much to his country and people as to \"dear Leonid Il'ych\" (Brezhnev) whom he literally worshipped, sometimes to the point of shamelessness... Yet the supersonic passenger jet was apparently not making headway and, to the dismay of its curator, it looked as though Brezhnev might be disappointed. It was then that Dmitry Fedorovich (Ustinov) jumped at someone's idea to foist Aeroflot's \"bride in search of a wedding\" on the military. After it had been rejected in bomber guise, Ustinov used the Military Industrial Commission (one of the most influential Soviet government bodies) to promote the aircraft to the Strategic Aviation as a reconnaissance or ECM platform, or both. It was clear to me that these aircraft could not possibly work in concert with any bomber or missile carrier formation; likewise I could not imagine them operating solo as \"Flying Dutchmen\" in a war scenario, therefore I resolutely turned down the offer.\nNaval Aviation Commander Aleksandr Alekseyevich Mironenko, followed suit:\nUstinov could not be put off that easily. He managed to persuade the Navy C-in-C (admiral) S.G. Gorshkov who agreed to accept the Tu-144 for Naval Aviation service as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft without consulting anyone on the matter. Mironenko rebelled against this decision, but the commander-in-chief would not hear of heed \u2013 the issue is decided, period. On learning of this I was extremely alarmed: if Mironenko had been pressured into taking the Tu-144, this meant I was going to be next. I made a phone call to Aleksandr Alekseyevich, urging him to take radical measures; I needn't have called because even without my urging Mironenko was giving his C-in-C a hard time. Finally Ustinov got wind of the mutiny and summoned Mironenko to his office. They had a long and heated discussion but eventually Mironenko succeeded in proving that Ustinov's ideas were unfounded. That was the last time we heard of Tu-144.\nAircraft on display.\nWhile several Tu-144s were donated to museums in Moscow Monino, Samara and Ulyanovsk, at least two Tu-144D remained in open storage in Moscow Zhukovsky.\nAs of June 2010, two aircraft (tail numbers \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77114 and \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77115) are located outdoors at Gromov Flight Research Institute, Zhukovsky (at coordinates and ). Previously, they were displayed at MAKS Airshows. Tail number 77115 was bought in 2005 by the Heros Club of Zhukovsky and still on display at MAKS as of 2019. In 2019, tail number 77114 was repainted in Aeroflot livery and put on display in front of the Gromov Flight Research institute main gate.\nA Tu-144S, registration \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77106, is on display at Central Air Force Museum of Russia in Monino. Its maiden flight was on 4 March 1975, the final one on 29 February 1980. The aircraft was used to assess the effectiveness of the air-conditioning systems and to solve some problems on the fuel system. It can be considered the first production aircraft, being the first to be equipped for commercial use and delivered to Aeroflot. The first operational flight was on 26 December 1975 between Moscow and Alma-Ata carrying cargo and mail.\nAnother Tu-144, tail number \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77107, is on open display in Kazan and located at . The aircraft was constructed in 1975 and was a production model intended for passenger use. However, it was only used during test flights. On 29 March 1976 it made its last flight to Kazan. This aircraft was put on sale on eBay in 2017.\nTU-144S, tail number \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77108, is on display in the museum of Samara State Aerospace University (). It made its maiden flight on 12 December 1975, and its final flight on 27 August 1987. Development works on navigation system were made in this aircraft as well as flight-director approach.\nTU-144S, tail number \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77110, is on display at the Ulyanovsk Aircraft Museum in Ulyanovsk. Maiden flight occurred on 14 February 1977, the final Flight on 1 June 1984. This aircraft was the second of the two aircraft used for regular passengers' flights on Moscow \u2013 Alma-Ata route. In 1977 it flew to Paris to take part in the XXXII Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport. This was the last appearance of a Tu-144 in West Europe.\n\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77110 was the last aircraft produced of the model Tu-144S, powered with Kuznetsov NK-144A engines.\nIn the first half of 2008 the cabin was open for visits and between August and September was restored and painted in the original Aeroflot livery.\nThe only Tu-144 on display outside the former Soviet Union, tail number \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420-77112, was acquired by the Auto &amp; Technikmuseum Sinsheim in Germany, where it was shipped \u2013 not flown \u2013 in 2001 and where it now stands, in its original Aeroflot livery, on display next to an Air France Concorde. As of 2017, the Technikmuseum Sinsheim remains the only museum in the world where the Tu-144 and Concorde are on display together.\nAccidents.\nParis Air Show crash.\nAt the Paris Air Show on 3 June 1973, the development programme of the Tu-144 suffered severely when the first \"Tu-144S\" production airliner (reg 77102) crashed.\nAt the end of the officially approved demonstration flight, which was an exact repeat of the previous day's display, instead of landing as expected, the aircraft entered a very steep climb before making a violent downwards manoeuvre. As it tried to recover, the aircraft broke apart and crashed, destroying 15 houses and killing all six people on board the Tu-144 and eight more on the ground.\nGordon et al. state that the flight crew had departed from the approved flight profile for the display. They were under instructions to outperform the Concorde display by all means. During the unapproved, and therefore unrehearsed manoeuvres, the stability and control augmentation system was not operating. If it had been, it would have prevented the loads that caused the port wing to fail.\nA popular Soviet theory for the crash was that the Tu-144 tried to avoid a French Mirage chase-plane that was attempting to photograph its canards, which were very advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details. The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew was not told about the Mirage's flight), though not its role in the crash. The official press release did state: \"though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised\".\nMoon writes that the investigation was clouded by political considerations from the outset, and that an exoneration of the Tu-144 from a technical and design standpoint was in the interests of both countries, as France was seeking Concorde overflight rights from the Soviet Union. Moon characterized the final accident report as being \"remarkable more for what it omitted than what it included.\"\nYegoryevsk crash.\nOn 23 May 1978, the Tu-144 supersonic passenger jet was to make a test flight before delivery to Aeroflot. At an altitude of 3,000 m, a fire started at the APU located in the port wing. A turn was made to return to the airport and both engines located in the right wing (engines no. 3 and 4) were shut down and the aircraft began to lose altitude. Fire trailed the aircraft and the cockpit filled with smoke. Subsequently, the no. 1 (outer left) engine failed. Six minutes after the fire started, the crew managed to belly-land the aircraft in a field near Yegoryevsk. On impact, the nose cone collapsed under the fuselage, penetrating the compartment in which two flight engineers were seated, killing both.\nIt was later determined that, 27 minutes prior to the ignition, a fuel line had ruptured, causing eight tons of fuel to leak into several compartments on the right wing. The fuel readings were judged incorrect by the flight engineers and thus were not reported to the commander. In addition to the two flight engineers killed on impact, six other crewmembers were injured. The Tu-144 was withdrawn from passenger service soon afterward, though a 2019 post-mortem by CNN reported that it was already \"on its way out\" before then.\nSpecifications (Tu-144D).\n\"Data from\" General characteristics* Crew: 3* Capacity: 150 passengers (11 first class &amp; 139 tourist class)* Aspect ratio: * Airfoil: \nPerformance* Maximum speed: Mach 2.15* Endurance: * g limits: * Roll rate: * Thrust/weight: 0.44\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was designed to help students taking their first computer science course learn how to code. Turing is a descendant of Pascal, Euclid, and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics.\nTuring 4.1.0 is the latest stable version. Versions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 do not emit stand alone .exe files. Versions pre-4.1.0 have outdated syntax and functions.\nOverview.\nNamed after British computer scientist Alan Turing, Turing is used mainly as a teaching language at the high school and university level. Two other versions exist, Object-Oriented Turing and Turing+, a systems programming variant. In September 2001, \"Object Oriented Turing\" was renamed \"Turing\" and the original Turing was renamed \"Classic Turing\". Turing is now unsupported by Holt Software Associates in Toronto, Ontario. Turing was widely used in high schools in Ontario as an introduction to programming.\nOn November 28, 2007, Turing, which was previously a commercial programming language, became freeware, available to download from the developer's website free of charge for personal, commercial, and educational use.&lt;ref name=\"holtsoft/old_index\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe makers of Turing, Holt Software Associates, have since ceased operations, and Turing has seen no further development since November 25, 2007.\nSyntax.\nTuring is designed to have a very lightweight, readable, intuitive syntax.

It includes speed improvements, new features such as OpenGL 3D and a new code editor. It is fully backwards compatible with the closed-source implementation.\nTPlus.\nTPlus is an open-source implementation of original (non-Object-Oriented) Turing with systems programming extensions developed at the University of Toronto and ported to Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X at Queen's University in the late 1990s. TPlus implements Turing+ (Turing Plus), a concurrent systems programming language based on the original Turing programming language. Some, but not all, of the features of Turing Plus were eventually subsumed into the present Object-Oriented Turing language. Turing Plus extends original Turing with processes, monitors (as specified by C.A.R. Hoare), and language constructs needed for system programming such as binary input-output, separate compiling, variables at absolute addresses, type converters and other features.\nTuring+.\nTuring+ (Turing Plus) is a concurrent systems programming language based on the Turing programming language designed by James Cordy and Ric Holt, then at the University of Toronto, Canada, in 1987. Some, but not all, of the features of Turing+ were eventually subsumed into Object-Oriented Turing. Turing+ extended original Turing with processes and monitors (as specified by C.A.R. Hoare) as well as language constructs needed for systems programming such as binary input-output, separate compiling, variables at absolute addresses, type converters, and other features.\nTuring+ was explicitly designed to replace Concurrent Euclid in systems-programming applications. The TUNIS operating system, originally written in Concurrent Euclid, was recoded to Turing+ in its MiniTunis implementation. Turing+ has been used to implement several production software systems, including the language TXL.\nObject-Oriented Turing.\nObject-Oriented Turing is an extension of the Turing programming language and a replacement for Turing Plus created by Ric Holt of the University of Toronto, Canada, in 1991. It is imperative, object-oriented, and concurrent. It has modules, classes, single inheritance, processes, exception handling, and optional machine-dependent programming.\nThere is an integrated development environment under the X Window System and a demo version. Versions exist for Sun-4, MIPS, RS-6000, NeXTSTEP, Windows 95, and others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31106", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31106", "title": "Trackball", "text": "Pointing device\nA trackball is a pointing device consisting of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes\u2014like an upside-down ball mouse with an exposed protruding ball. Users roll the ball to position the on-screen pointer, using their thumb, fingers, or the palm of the hand, while using the fingertips to press the buttons.\nWith most trackballs, operators have to lift their finger, thumb or hand and reposition it on the ball to continue rolling, whereas a mouse would have to be lifted itself and re-positioned. Some trackballs have notably low friction, as well as being made of a dense material such as phenolic resin, so they can be spun to make them coast. The trackball's buttons may be in similar positions to those of a mouse, or configured to suit the user.\nLarge trackballs are common on CAD workstations for easy precision. Before the advent of the touchpad, small trackballs were common on portable computers and smartphones (such as a BlackBerry) where there may be no desk space on which to run a mouse. Some small \"thumballs\" are designed to clip onto the side of the keyboard and have integral buttons with the same function as mouse buttons.\nHistory.\nThe trackball was invented as part of a post-World War II-era radar plotting system named Comprehensive Display System (CDS) by Ralph Benjamin when working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service. Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick. Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented a \"ball tracker\" system called the \"roller ball\" for this purpose in 1946. The device was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built and the device was kept as a military secret. Production versions of the CDS used joysticks.\nThe CDS system had also been viewed by a number of engineers from Ferranti Canada, who returned to Canada and began development of the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR system in 1952. Principal designers Tom Cranston, Fred Longstaff and Kenyon Taylor chose the trackball as the primary input, using a standard five-pin bowling ball as the roller. DATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display, but used a digital computer to calculate tracks, and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals.\nDATAR's trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several additional rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined.\nSince 1966, the American company \"Orbit Instrument Corporation\" produced a device named \"X-Y Ball Tracker\", a trackball, which was embedded into radar flight control desks.\nA similar trackball device at the German ' was constructed by a team around Rainer Mallebrein of Telefunken as part of the development for the Telefunken computer infrastructure around the main frame TR 440, process computer TR\u00a086 and video terminal SIG\u00a0100-86, which began in 1965. This trackball was called ' (German for \"rolling ball\"). Somewhat later, the idea of \"reversing\" this device led to the introduction of the first computer ball mouse (still named \"\", model RKS 100-86), which was offered as an alternative input device to light pens and trackballs for Telefunken's computer systems since 1968.\nIn later trackball models the electrical contacts were replaced by an optical chopper wheel, which had small slots cut into it in rather than electrical contacts. With an LED for illumination from one side and an optical sensor on the other, rotation of the wheel periodically blocks and unblocks the light, so the sensor produces electrical pulses to indicate that rotation is occurring.\nMice used the same basic system for determining motion, but had the problem that the ball was in contact with the desk or mousepad. In order to provide smooth motion the balls were often covered with an anti-slip surface treatment, which was, by design, sticky. Rolling the mouse tended to pick up any dirt and drag it into the system where it would clog the chopper wheels, demanding cleanup. In contrast the trackball is in contact only with the user's hand, which tends to be cleaner. In the late 1990s both mice and trackballs began using direct optical tracking which follows dots on the ball, avoiding the need for anti-slip surface treatment.\nAs with modern mice, most trackballs now have an auxiliary device primarily intended for scrolling. Some have a scroll wheel like most mice, but the most common type is a \u201cscroll ring\u201d which is spun around the ball. Kensington's SlimBlade Trackball similarly tracks the ball itself in three dimensions for scrolling.\nAs of 1989[ [update]] and into the 2020s, two major companies developed and produce consumer trackballs, Logitech and Kensington, although Logitech has narrowed its product line to two models. Other smaller companies occasionally offer a trackball in their product line. Microsoft produced popular models including The Microsoft Trackball Explorer, but has since discontinued all of its products.\nIn September 2017 Logitech announced release of MX-Ergo Mouse, which was released after 6 years of its last trackball mouse.\nSpecial applications.\nLarge trackballs are sometimes seen on computerized special-purpose workstations, such as the radar consoles in an air-traffic control room or sonar equipment on a ship or submarine. Modern installations of such equipment may use mice instead, since most people now already know how to use one. However, military mobile anti-aircraft radars, commercial airliners (such as Airbus A380 and Airbus A350) and submarine sonars tend to continue using trackballs, since they can be made more durable and more fit for fast emergency use. Large and well made ones allow easier high precision work, for which reason they may still be used in these applications (where they are often called \"tracker balls\") and in computer-aided design.\nTrackballs have appeared in video games, particularly early arcade games (see a \"List of trackball arcade games\"). In March 1978, Sega released \"World Cup\", an association football game with trackball controls. In October 1978, Atari released \"Atari Football\", which popularized the use of a trackball, with the game's developers mentioning it was inspired by an earlier Japanese association football game. Other notable trackball games include Atari's \"Centipede\" and \"Missile Command\" \u2013 Atari trademarked it \"TRAK-BALL\".\nConsole trackballs, now fairly rare, were common in the early 1980s: the Atari 2600 and 5200 consoles, as well as the competing ColecoVision console, though using a joystick as their standard controller, each had one as an optional peripheral. The Apple Pippin, a console introduced in 1996, had a trackball built into its gamepad as standard. Trackballs were occasionally used in e-sports prior to the mainstreaming of optical mice in the early 2000s because they were more reliable than ball mice, but now they are extremely rare because optical mice offer superior speed and precision. Trackballs remain in use in pub golf machines (such as \"Golden Tee Golf\") to simulate swinging the club.\nTrackballs have also been regarded as excellent complements to analog joysticks, as pioneered by the Assassin 3D, a trackball released in 1996 with joystick pass-through capability. Later in 1996, Mad Catz released the Panther XL, which was based on the Assassin 3D. This combination provides for two-hand aiming and a high accuracy and consistency replacement for the traditional mouse and keyboard combo generally used on first-person shooter games. Many such games natively support joysticks and analog player movement, like Valve's \"Half-Life\" and id Software's \"Quake\" series. As of 2020[ [update]], one professional eSport player was known for using a trackball.\nTrackballs are provided as the pointing device in some public internet access terminals. Unlike a mouse, a trackball can easily be built into a console, and cannot be ripped away or easily vandalized. Two examples are the Internet browsing consoles provided in some UK McDonald's outlets, and the BT Broadband Internet public phone boxes. This simplicity and ruggedness also makes them ideal for use in industrial computers.\nBecause trackballs for personal computers are stationary, they may require less space for operation than a mouse, simplifying use in confined or cluttered areas such as a small desk or a rack-mounted terminal. They are generally preferred in laboratory setting for the same reason.\nTrackballs were often included in laptop computers, but since the late 1990s these have been replaced by touchpads and pointing sticks. Trackballs are still used as separate input devices with standard desktop computers, but this application is also moving to touchpads due to the prevalence of multi-touch gesture control in new desktop operating systems.\nErgonomics.\nPeople with a mobility impairment use trackballs as an assistive technology input device. Access to an alternative pointing device has become even more important for them with the dominance of graphically-oriented operating systems. There are many alternative systems to be considered. The control surface of a trackball is easier to manipulate and the buttons can be activated without affecting the pointer position.\nTrackball users also often state that they are not limited to using the device on a flat desk surface. Trackballs can be used whilst browsing a laptop in bed, or wirelessly from an armchair to a PC playing a movie. They are also useful for computing on boats or other unstable platforms where a rolling deck could produce undesirable input.\nTrackballs are generally either thumb-operated, with a ball operated by the thumb, or finger-operated, with a ball usually operated by some combination of the index, middle and ring fingers. Depending on the design of the trackball, the fingers not operating the ball may manipulate other input devices built into the trackball, such as buttons and scroll wheels. Users favor one format or another for reasons of comfort, mobility, precision, or because it reduces strain on one part of the hand/wrist.\nSome finger-operated trackballs are symmetrical in design, making them usable by both hands. However, installation of software and/or modification of firmware may be required to mirror the button inputs.\nThumb-operated trackballs and other finger-operated trackballs, are asymmetric, and usually available only in right-handed versions.\nSome computer users prefer a trackball over the more common mouse for ergonomic reasons. There seems to be no conclusive evidence from studies performed to determine which type of pointing device works best for most applications. Application users are encouraged to test different devices, and to maintain proper posture and scheduled breaks for comfort. Some disabled users find trackballs easier since they only have to move their thumb relative to their hand, instead of moving the whole hand, while others incur unacceptable fatigue of the thumb. Elderly people sometimes have difficulty holding a mouse still while double-clicking; the trackball allows them to let go of the ball while using the button.\nAt times when a user is browsing menus or websites rather than typing, it is also possible to hold a trackball in the right hand like a television remote control, operating the ball with the right thumb and pressing the buttons with the left thumb, thus giving the fingers a rest.\nMobile devices.\nSome mobile devices have trackballs, including those in the BlackBerry range, the T-Mobile Sidekick 3, and many early HTC smartphones. These miniature trackballs are made to fit within the thickness of a mobile device, and are controlled by the tip of a finger or thumb. These have mostly been replaced on smartphones by touch screens, although on the BlackBerry range they were replaced by an \"optical trackball\" or \"optical trackpad\" before later being replaced with touch screens.\nOn mice.\nIn lieu of a scroll wheel, some mice include a tiny trackball sometimes called a scroll ball. A popular example is Apple's Mighty Mouse. Mice with a larger trackball on a side may be designed to stay stationary, using the trackball to move the mouse cursor instead of moving the mouse.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Magnetic-tape data storage is typically used for offline, archival data storage. Tape media generally has a favorable unit cost and long archival stability.\nA tape drive provides sequential access storage, unlike a hard disk drive, which provides direct access storage. A disk drive can move to any position on the disk in a few milliseconds, but a tape drive must physically wind tape between reels to read any one particular piece of data. As a result, tape drives have very large average access times. However, tape drives can stream data very quickly off a tape when the required position has been reached. For example, as of 2017[ [update]] Linear Tape-Open (LTO) supports continuous data transfer rates of up to 360 MB/s, a rate comparable to hard disk drives.\nDesign.\nMagnetic-tape drives with capacities of less than one megabyte were first used for data storage on mainframe computers in the 1950s. As of 2018[ [update]], capacities of 20 terabytes or higher of uncompressed data per cartridge were available.\nIn early computer systems, magnetic tape served as the main storage medium because although the drives were expensive, the tapes were inexpensive. Some computer systems ran the operating system on tape drives such as DECtape. DECtape had fixed-size indexed blocks that could be rewritten without disturbing other blocks, so DECtape could be used like a slow disk drive.\nData tape drives may use advanced data integrity techniques such as multilevel forward error correction, shingling, and linear serpentine layout for writing data to tape.\nTape drives can be connected to a computer with SCSI, Fibre Channel, SATA, USB, FireWire, FICON, or other interfaces. Tape drives are used with autoloaders and tape libraries which automatically load, unload, and store multiple tapes, increasing the volume of data that can be stored without manual intervention.\nIn the early days of home computing, floppy and hard disk drives were very expensive. Many computers had an interface to store data via an audio tape recorder, typically on Compact Cassettes. Simple dedicated tape drives, such as the professional DECtape and the home ZX Microdrive and Rotronics Wafadrive, were also designed for inexpensive data storage. However, the drop in disk drive prices made such alternatives obsolete.\nData compression.\nAs some data can be compressed to a smaller size than the original files, it has become commonplace when marketing tape drives to state the capacity with the assumption of a 2:1 compression ratio; thus a tape with a capacity of 80\u00a0GB would be sold as \"80/160\". The true storage capacity is also known as the native capacity or the raw capacity. The compression ratio actually achievable depends on the data being compressed. Some data has little redundancy; large video files, for example, already use compression and cannot be compressed further. A database with repetitive entries, on the other hand, may allow compression ratios better than 10:1.\nTechnical limitations.\nA disadvantageous effect termed &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;shoe-shining occurs during read/write if the data transfer rate falls below the minimum threshold at which the tape drive heads were designed to transfer data to or from a continuously running tape. In this situation, the modern fast-running tape drive is unable to stop the tape instantly. Instead, the drive must decelerate and stop the tape, rewind it a short distance, restart it, position back to the point at which streaming stopped and then resume the operation. If the condition repeats, the resulting back-and-forth tape motion resembles that of shining shoes with a cloth. Shoe-shining decreases the attainable data transfer rate, drive and tape life, and tape capacity.\nIn early tape drives, non-continuous data transfer was normal and unavoidable. Computer processing power and available memory were usually insufficient to provide a constant stream, so tape drives were typically designed for \"start-stop\" operation. Early drives used very large spools, which necessarily had high inertia and did not start and stop moving easily. To provide high start, stop and seek performance, several feet of loose tape was played out and pulled by a suction fan down into two deep open channels on either side of the tape head and capstans. The long thin loops of tape hanging in these \"vacuum columns\" had far less inertia than the two reels and could be rapidly started, stopped and repositioned. The large reels would move as required to keep the slack tape in the vacuum columns.\nLater, most tape drives of the 1980s introduced the use of an internal data buffer to somewhat reduce start-stop situations. These drives are often referred to as \"tape streamers\". The tape was stopped only when the buffer contained no data to be written, or when it was full of data during reading. As faster tape drives became available, despite being buffered, the drives started to suffer from the shoe-shining sequence of stop, rewind, start.\nSome newer drives have several speeds and implement algorithms that dynamically match the tape speed level to the computer's data rate. Example speed levels could be 50 percent, 75 percent and 100 percent of full speed. A computer that streams data slower than the lowest speed level (e.g., at 49 percent) will still cause shoe-shining.\nMedia.\nMagnetic tape is commonly housed in a casing such as a cassette or cartridge\u2014for example, the 4-track cartridge and the Compact Cassette. The cassette contains magnetic tape to provide different audio content using the same player. The outer shell, made of plastic, sometimes with metal plates and parts, permits ease of handling of the fragile tape, making it far more convenient and robust than having spools of exposed tape. Simple analog cassette audio tape recorders were commonly used for data storage and distribution on home computers at a time when floppy disk drives were very expensive. The Commodore Datasette was a dedicated data version using the same media.\nCapacity.\nManufacturers often specify the capacity of tapes using data compression techniques; compressibility varies for different data (commonly 2:1 to 8:1), and the specified capacity may not be attained for some types of real data. As of 2014[ [update]], tape drives capable of higher capacity were still being developed.\nIn 2011, Fujifilm and IBM announced that they had been able to record 29.5 billion bits per square inch with magnetic-tape media developed using Barium Ferrite (BaFe) particles and nanotechnologies, allowing drives with true (uncompressed) tape capacity of 35\u00a0TB. The technology was not expected to be commercially available for at least a decade.\nIn 2014, Sony and IBM announced that they had been able to record 148 billion bits per square inch with magnetic tape media developed using a new vacuum thin-film forming technology able to form extremely fine crystal particles, allowing true tape capacity of 185\u00a0TB.\nOn December 15, 2020, Fujifilm and IBM announced a Strontium Ferrite (SrFe) technology able, in theory, to store 580 TB per tape cartridge.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31112", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31112", "title": "Tesseract", "text": "Four-dimensional analogue of the cube\nIn geometry, a tesseract or 4-cube is a four-dimensional hypercube, analogous to a two-dimensional square and a three-dimensional cube. Just as the perimeter of the square consists of four edges and the surface of the cube consists of six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells, meeting at right angles. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes.\nThe tesseract is also called an 8-cell, C8, (regular) octachoron, or cubic prism. It is the four-dimensional measure polytope, taken as a unit for hypervolume. Coxeter labels it the \"\u03b3\"4 polytope. The term \"hypercube\" without a dimension reference is frequently treated as a synonym for this specific polytope.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" traces the word \"tesseract\" to Charles Howard Hinton's 1888 book \"A New Era of Thought\". The term derives from the Greek ( 'four') and ( 'ray'), referring to the four edges from each vertex to other vertices. Hinton originally spelled the word as \"tessaract\".\nGeometry.\nAs a regular polytope with three cubes folded together around every edge, it has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4,3,3} with hyperoctahedral symmetry of order 384. Constructed as a 4D hyperprism made of two parallel cubes, it can be named as a composite Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4,3}\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0{\u00a0}, with symmetry order 96. As a 4-4 duoprism, a Cartesian product of two squares, it can be named by a composite Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4}\u00d7{4}, with symmetry order 64. As an orthotope it can be represented by composite Schl\u00e4fli symbol {\u00a0}\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0{\u00a0}\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0{\u00a0}\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0{\u00a0} or {\u00a0}4, with symmetry order 16.\nSince each vertex of a tesseract is adjacent to four edges, the vertex figure of the tesseract is a regular tetrahedron. The dual polytope of the tesseract is the 16-cell with Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3,3,4}, with which it can be combined to form the compound of tesseract and 16-cell.\nEach edge of a regular tesseract is of the same length. This is of interest when using tesseracts as the basis for a network topology to link multiple processors in parallel computing: the distance between two nodes is at most 4 and there are many different paths to allow weight balancing.\nA tesseract is bounded by eight three-dimensional hyperplanes. Each pair of non-parallel hyperplanes intersects to form 24 square faces. Three cubes and three squares intersect at each edge. There are four cubes, six squares, and four edges meeting at every vertex. All in all, a tesseract consists of 8 cubes, 24 squares, 32 edges, and 16 vertices.\nCoordinates.\nA \"unit tesseract\" has side length 1, and is typically taken as the basic unit for hypervolume in 4-dimensional space. \"The\" unit tesseract in a Cartesian coordinate system for 4-dimensional space has two opposite vertices at coordinates [0, 0, 0, 0] and [1, 1, 1, 1], and other vertices with coordinates at all possible combinations of 0s and 1s. It is the Cartesian product of the closed unit interval [0, 1] in each axis.\nSometimes a unit tesseract is centered at the origin, so that its coordinates are the more symmetrical formula_1 This is the Cartesian product of the closed interval formula_2 in each axis.\nAnother commonly convenient tesseract is the Cartesian product of the closed interval [\u22121, 1] in each axis, with vertices at coordinates (\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11). This tesseract has side length 2 and hypervolume 24 = 16.\nNet.\nAn unfolding of a polytope is called a net. There are 261 distinct nets of the tesseract. The unfoldings of the tesseract can be counted by mapping the nets to \"paired trees\" (a tree together with a perfect matching in its complement).\nEach of the 261 nets can tile 3-space.\nConstruction.\nThe construction of hypercubes can be imagined the following way:\nThe 8 cells of the tesseract may be regarded (three different ways) as two interlocked rings of four cubes.\nThe tesseract can be decomposed into smaller 4-polytopes. It is the convex hull of the compound of two demitesseracts (16-cells). It can also be triangulated into 4-dimensional simplices (irregular 5-cells) that share their vertices with the tesseract. It is known that there are such triangulations and that the fewest 4-dimensional simplices in any of them is 16. \nThe dissection of the tesseract into instances of its characteristic simplex (a particular orthoscheme with Coxeter diagram ) is the most basic direct construction of the tesseract possible. The characteristic 5-cell of the 4-cube is a fundamental region of the tesseract's defining symmetry group, the group which generates the B4 polytopes. The tesseract's characteristic simplex directly \"generates\" the tesseract through the actions of the group, by reflecting itself in its own bounding facets (its \"mirror walls\").\nRadial equilateral symmetry.\nThe radius of a hypersphere circumscribed about a regular polytope is the distance from the polytope's center to one of the vertices, and for the tesseract this radius is equal to its edge length; the diameter of the sphere, the length of the diagonal between opposite vertices of the tesseract, is twice the edge length. Only a few uniform polytopes have this property, including the four-dimensional tesseract and 24-cell, the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the two-dimensional hexagon. In particular, the tesseract is the only hypercube (other than a zero-dimensional point) that is \"radially equilateral\". The longest vertex-to-vertex diagonal of an formula_3-dimensional hypercube of unit edge length is formula_4 which for the square is formula_5 for the cube is formula_6 and only for the tesseract is formula_7 edge lengths.\nAn axis-aligned tesseract inscribed in a unit-radius 3-sphere has vertices with coordinates formula_8\nProperties.\nFor a tesseract with side length s:\nAs a configuration.\nThis configuration matrix represents the tesseract. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, and cells. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole tesseract. The diagonal reduces to the f-vector (16,32,24,8).\nThe nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column's element occur in or at the row's element. For example, the 2 in the first column of the second row indicates that there are 2 vertices in (i.e., at the extremes of) each edge; the 4 in the second column of the first row indicates that 4 edges meet at each vertex.\nThe bottom row defines they facets, here cubes, have f-vector (8,12,6). The next row left of diagonal is ridge elements (facet of cube), here a square, (4,4).\nThe upper row is the f-vector of the vertex figure, here tetrahedra, (4,6,4). The next row is vertex figure ridge, here a triangle, (3,3).\nformula_14\nProjections.\nIt is possible to project tesseracts into three- and two-dimensional spaces, similarly to projecting a cube into two-dimensional space.\nThe \"cell-first\" parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has a cubical envelope. The nearest and farthest cells are projected onto the cube, and the remaining six cells are projected onto the six square faces of the cube.\nThe \"face-first\" parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has a cuboidal envelope. Two pairs of cells project to the upper and lower halves of this envelope, and the four remaining cells project to the side faces.\nThe \"edge-first\" parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has an envelope in the shape of a hexagonal prism. Six cells project onto rhombic prisms, which are laid out in the hexagonal prism in a way analogous to how the faces of the 3D cube project onto six rhombs in a hexagonal envelope under vertex-first projection. The two remaining cells project onto the prism bases.\nThe \"vertex-first\" parallel projection of the tesseract into three-dimensional space has a rhombic dodecahedral envelope. Two vertices of the tesseract are projected to the origin. There are exactly two ways of dissecting a rhombic dodecahedron into four congruent rhombohedra, giving a total of eight possible rhombohedra, each a projected cube of the tesseract. This projection is also the one with maximal volume. One set of projection vectors are \"u\" = (1,1,\u22121,\u22121), \"v\" = (\u22121,1,\u22121,1), \"w\" = (1,\u22121,\u22121,1).\nTessellation.\nThe tesseract, like all hypercubes, tessellates Euclidean space. The self-dual tesseractic honeycomb consisting of 4 tesseracts around each face has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4,3,3,4}.

He and his best friend from high school, Tom Miller, founded the rock band the Neon Boys which became Television in 1973. The pair adopted stage names; Miller called himself Verlaine after Paul Verlaine, a French poet he admired, and Meyers became Richard Hell because, as he has said, it described his condition.\nThe group was the first rock band to play the club CBGB, which soon became a breeding ground for the early punk rock scene in New York. Hell had an energetic stage presence and wore torn clothing held together with safety pins and his hair spiked, which was to be influential in punk fashion. In 1975, after a failed management deal with the New York Dolls, impresario Malcolm McLaren claimed to have brought these ideas back with him to England and eventually incorporated them into the Sex Pistols' image, a claim which Sex Pistols' front man John Lydon/Johnny Rotten disputes, citing his own existing use of safety pins and spiked hair (dyed green) prior to joining the Pistols.\nDisputes with Verlaine led to Hell's departure from Television in April 1975, and he co-founded the Heartbreakers with New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders. Hell did not last long with this band, and he began recruiting members for a new band in early 1976. For guitarists, Hell found Robert Quine and Ivan Julian\u2014Quine had worked in a bookstore with Hell, and Julian responded to an advertisement in \"The Village Voice\". They lifted drummer Marc Bell, later Marky Ramone, from Wayne County. The band was named \"the Voidoids\" after a novel Hell had been writing.\nMusically, Hell drew inspiration from acts such as Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, protopunk band the Stooges and fellow New Yorker group the Velvet Underground, a group with a reputation for heroin-fueled rock and roll with poetic lyrics. Quine's admiration of the Velvet Underground led him to make hours' worth of bootleg recordings of the band in the late 1960s. Hell also drew from\u2014and covered\u2014garage rock bands such as the Seeds and the Count Five that were found on the \"\" compilation of 1972. The Voidoids' music was also characterized as art punk.\nHell had written the song \"Blank Generation\" while still in Television; he had played it regularly with the band since at least 1975, and later with the Heartbreakers. The Voidoids released a 7\" \"Blank Generation\" EP in 1976 on Ork Records including \"Blank Generation\", \"Another World\" and \"You Gotta Lose\". The cover featured a black-and-white cover photo taken by Hell's former girlfriend Roberta Bayley, depicting a bare-chested Hell with an open jeans zipper. It was an underground hit, and the band signed to Sire Records for its album debut.\nLegacy.\nThe Voidoids are considered to have pioneered the \"punk look\" and studded appearance which also became popular later on in the UK via the Sex Pistols. Lydon disputes the Voidoids influence on British punk appearance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last non-empty label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is .com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the ICANN, an Internet multi-stakeholder community, which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the top-level domain space was organized into three main groups: \"Countries\", \"Categories\", and \"Multiorganizations\". An additional \"temporary\" group consisted of only the initial DNS domain, .arpa, and was intended for transitional purposes toward the stabilization of the domain name system.\nTypes.\nAs of 2015,[ [update]] IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:\nCountries are designated in the Domain Name System by their two-letter ISO country code; there are exceptions, however (e.g., .uk). This group of domains is, therefore, commonly known as country-code top-level domains (ccTLD). Since 2009, countries with non\u2013Latin-based scripts may apply for internationalized country code top-level domain names, which are displayed in end-user applications in their language-native script or alphabet, but use a Punycode-translated ASCII domain name in the Domain Name System.\nGeneric top-level domains (formerly \"categories\") initially consisted of .gov, .edu, .com, .mil, .org, and .net. More generic TLDs have been added, such as .info.\nThe authoritative list of current TLDs in the root zone is published at the IANA website at https://.\nInternationalized country code TLDs.\nAn internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end-user application, such as a web browser, in its language-native script or alphabet (such as the Arabic alphabet), or a non-alphabetic writing system (such as Chinese characters). IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.\nICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 scripts.\nInfrastructure domain.\nThe domain .arpa was the first Internet top-level domain. It was intended to be used only temporarily, aiding in the transition of traditional ARPANET host names to the domain name system. However, after it had been used for reverse DNS lookup, it was found impractical to retire it, and is used today exclusively for Internet infrastructure purposes such as in-addr.arpa for IPv4 and ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse DNS resolution, uri.arpa and urn.arpa for the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System, and e164.arpa for telephone number mapping based on NAPTR DNS records. For historical reasons, .arpa is sometimes considered to be a generic top-level domain.\nReserved domains.\nA set of domain names is reserved by the Internet Engineering Task Force as special-use domain names. The practice originated in RFC 1597 for reserved address allocations in 1994 and reserved top-level domains in RFC 2606 of 1999, with additional reservations in later RFCs. These reserved names should not be used in production networks that utilize the global domain name system.\nHistorical domains.\nIn the late 1980s, InterNIC created the .nato domain for use by NATO. NATO considered none of the then-existing TLDs as adequately reflecting their status as an international organization. Soon after this addition, however, InterNIC also created the .int TLD for the use by international organizations in general, and persuaded NATO to use the second level domain \"nato.int\" instead. The \"nato\" TLD, no longer used, was finally removed in July 1996.\nOther historical TLDs are .cs for Czechoslovakia (now using .cz for Czech Republic and .sk for Slovakia), .dd for East Germany (using .de after reunification of Germany), .yu for SFR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro (now using .ba for Bosnia and Herzegovina, .hr for Croatia, .me for Montenegro, .mk for North Macedonia, .rs for Serbia and .si for Slovenia), .zr for Zaire (now .cd for the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and .an for Netherlands Antilles (now .aw for Aruba, .cw for Cura\u00e7ao and .sx for Sint Maarten). In contrast to these, the TLD .su has remained active despite the collapse of the Soviet Union that it represents. Under the chairmanship of Nigel Roberts, ICANN's ccNSO is working on a policy for the retirement of ccTLDs that have been removed from ISO 3166.\nProposed domains.\nAround late 2000, ICANN discussed and finally introduced .aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, and .pro TLDs. Site owners argued that a similar TLD should be made available for adult and pornographic websites to settle the dispute of obscene content on the Internet, to address the responsibility of US service providers under the US Communications Decency Act of 1996. Several options were proposed including \"xxx\", \"sex\" and \"adult\". The .xxx top-level domain eventually went live in 2011.\nAn older proposal consisted of seven new gTLDs: arts, firm, .info, nom, rec, .shop, and .web. Later .biz, .info, .museum, and .name covered most of these old proposals.\nDuring the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris in 2008, ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains\". This program envisioned the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well as a new application and implementation process. Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new gTLDs being registered.\nOn 13 June 2012, ICANN announced nearly 2,000 applications for top-level domains, which began installation throughout 2013. The first seven \u2013 \"bike\", \"clothing\", \"guru\", \"holdings\", \"plumbing\", \"singles\", and \"ventures\" \u2013 were released in 2014.\nRejected domains.\nICANN rejected several proposed domains to include .home and .corp due to conflicts regarding gTLDs that are in use in internal networks.\nInvestigation into the conflicts was conducted at ICANN's request by Interisle Consulting. The resulting report was to become known as the Name Collision issue, which was first reported at ICANN 47.\nDotless domains.\nDue to the structure of DNS, each node in the tree has its own collection of records, and since top-level domains are nodes in DNS, they have records of their own. For example, querying \"org\" itself (with a tool such as dig, host, or nslookup) returns information on its nameservers:\nQUESTION\norg. IN ANY\nANSWER\norg. 21599 IN NS a0.org.afilias-nst.info.\norg. 21599 IN NS a2.org.afilias-nst.info.\norg. 21599 IN NS b0.org.afilias-nst.org.\norg. 21599 IN NS b2.org.afilias-nst.org.\n\"Dotless domains\" are top-level domains that take advantage of that fact, and implement A, AAAA or MX DNS records to serve webpages or allow incoming email directly on a TLD \u2013 for example, a webpage hosted on \"http://example/\", or an email address \"user@example\".\nICANN and IAB have spoken out against the practice, classifying it as a security risk among other concerns. ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) additionally claims that SMTP \"requires at least two labels in the FQDN of a mail address\" and, as such, mail servers would reject emails to addresses with dotless domains.\nICANN has also published a resolution in 2013 that prohibits the creation of dotless domains on gTLDs. ccTLDs, however, fall largely under their respective country's jurisdiction, and not under ICANN's. Because of this, there have been many examples of dotless domains on ccTLDs in spite of ICANN's vocal opposition.\nAs of July 2025, that is the case of:\nIn 2023, it used to be the case of:\nOther ccTLDs with A or AAAA records, as of July 2025, include: .cm, .tk and .ws.\nA similar query to \"org\"'s presented above could be made for \"ai\", which showed A and MX records for the TLD:\nQUESTION\nai. IN ANY\nANSWER\nai. 21599 IN A 209.59.119.34\nai. 21599 IN MX 10 mail.offshore.ai.\nai. 21599 IN NS anycastdns1-cz.nic.ai.\nai. 21599 IN NS anycastdns2-cz.nic.ai.\nai. 21599 IN NS pch.whois.ai.\nHistorically, many other ccTLDs have had A or AAAA records. On 3 September 2013, as reported by the IETF, they were the following: .ac, .dk, .gg, .io, .je, .kh, .sh, .tm, .to, and .vi.\nNew TLDs.\nFollowing a 2014 resolution by ICANN, newly registered TLDs must implement the following A, MX, TXT, and SRV apex DNS records \u2013 where codice_1 stands for the registered TLD \u2013 for at least 90 days:\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN MX 10 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.&lt;TLD&gt;.\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN SRV 10 10 0 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.&lt;TLD&gt;.\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN TXT \"Your DNS configuration needs immediate attention see https://icann.org/namecollision\"\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN A 127.0.53.53\nThis requirement is meant to avoid domain name collisions when new TLDs are registered. For example, programmers may have used custom local domains such as \"foo.bar\" or \"test.dev\", which would both collide with the creation of gTLDs .bar in 2014 and .dev in 2019.\nWhile this does create apex DNS records of type A and MX, they do not qualify as a dotless domain, as the records should not point to real servers. For instance, the A record contains the IP 127.0.53.53, a loopback address (see IPv4 \u00a7 Addressing), picked as a mnemonic to indicate a DNS-related problem, as DNS uses port 53.\nPseudo-domains.\nSeveral networks, such as BITNET, CSNET, and UUCP, existed that were in widespread use among computer professionals and academic users, but were not interoperable directly with the Internet and exchanged mail with the Internet via special email gateways. For relaying purposes on the gateways, messages associated with these networks were labeled with suffixes such as .bitnet, .oz, .csnet, or .uucp, but these domains did not exist as top-level domains in the public Domain Name System of the Internet.\nMost of these networks have long since ceased to exist, and although UUCP still gets significant use in parts of the world where Internet infrastructure has not yet become well established, it subsequently transitioned to using Internet domain names, and pseudo-domains now largely survive as historical relics. One notable exception is the 2007 emergence of SWIFTNet Mail, which uses the swift pseudo-domain.\nThe anonymity network Tor formerly used the top-level pseudo-domain .onion for onion services, which can only be reached with a Tor client because it uses the Tor onion routing protocol to reach the hidden service to protect the anonymity of users. However, the pseudo-domain became officially reserved in October 2015. i2p provides a similar hidden pseudo-domain, .i2p, and Namecoin uses the .bit pseudo-domain.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A new religious movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians. This is sometimes identified as a form of Satanism.\nThe Temple was established in the United States in 1975 by Michael Aquino, an American political scientist, military officer, and a high-ranking member of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan. Dissatisfied with LaVey's materialistic approach, abolition of regional groups, and commercialization of Church degrees, Aquino resigned and \u2013 according to his own claim \u2013 embarked on a ritual to invoke Satan, who revealed to him a sacred text called \"The Book of Coming Forth by Night\". According to Aquino, in this work Satan revealed his true name to be that of Set, which had been the name used by his followers in ancient Egypt. Aquino was joined in establishing the Temple by a number of other dissatisfied members of LaVey's Church, and soon various Setian groups were established across the United States.\nSetians believe that Set is the one real god and that he has aided humanity by giving them a questioning intellect, the \"Black Flame\", which distinguishes them from other animal species. Set is held in high esteem as a teacher whose example is to be emulated but he is not worshipped as a deity. Highly individualistic in basis, the Temple promotes the idea that practitioners should seek self-deification and thus attain an immortality of consciousness.\nSetians believe in the existence of magic as a force which can be manipulated through ritual, however the nature of these rituals is not prescribed by the Temple. Specifically, Aquino described Setian practices as \"black magic\", a term which he defines idiosyncratically.\nFollowing initiation into the Temple, a Setian can proceed along a series of six degrees, each of which requires greater responsibilities to the group; as a result, most members remain in the first two degrees. Governed by a high priest or high priestess and a wider Council of Nine, the Temple is also divided into groups known as \"pylons\", through which Setians can meet or correspond in order to advance their magical work in a particular area. Pylons of the Temple are now present in the United States, Australia, and Europe, with estimates placing the Temple's average membership is 500.\nDefinition.\nThe Temple of Set is a new religious movement, and draws upon earlier forms of Western esotericism. Among academic scholars of religious studies, there has been some debate as to whether the Temple of Set can be characterized as \"Satanism\" or not. The religious studies scholars Asbjorn Dyrendal, Massimo Introvigne, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen describes the Temple of Set as a Satanic group, despite its reluctance to use the term \"Satanism\", because it is an offshoot of the Church of Satan which continues to use satanic mythology. Conversely, the scholar Kennet Granholm argued that it should not be considered a form of Satanism because it does not place an emphasis on the figure of Satan. Granholm acknowledged that it was an \"actor in the Satanic milieu\" and part of the wider left-hand path group of esoteric traditions. He suggested that it could also be seen as a form of \"Post-Satanism\", thereby continuing to reflect its historical origins within religious Satanism.\nThe Temple of Set is far more rooted in esoteric ideas than the Church of Satan had been. It has thus been termed \"Esoteric Satanism\", a term used to contrast it with the \"Rational Satanism\" found in LaVeyan Satanism. Accordingly, it has been labelled the \"intellectual wing of esoteric Satanism\", with the Temple presenting itself as an intellectual religion. Aquino possessed a Ph.D. in political science and this formal education was reflected in the way that he presented his arguments, in which he draws broadly upon Western philosophy and science.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nBorn in 1946, Michael A. Aquino was a military intelligence officer specializing in psychological warfare. In 1969 he joined Anton LaVey's Church of Satan and rose rapidly through the group's ranks. In 1970, while he was serving with the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, Aquino was stationed in B\u1ebfn C\u00e1t in South Vietnam when he wrote a tract titled \"Diabolicon\" in which he reflected upon his growing divergence from the Church of Satan's doctrines. In this tract, teachings about the creation of the world, God, and humanity are presented, as is the dualistic idea that Satan complements God. The character of Lucifer is presented as bringing insight to human society, a depiction of Lucifer that was inherited from John Milton's seventeenth-century epic poem \"Paradise Lost\". By 1971, Aquino was ranked as a Magister Caverns of the IV\u00b0 within the Church's hierarchy, was editor of its publication \"The Cloven Hoof\", and sat on its governing Council of Nine. In 1973, he rose to the previously unattained rank of Magister Templi of IV\u00b0. According to Satanism scholars Per Faxneld and Jesper Petersen, Aquino had effectively become LaVey's \"right-hand man\".\nNonetheless there were things that Aquino disliked about the Church of Satan; he thought that it had attracted many \"fad-followers, egomaniacs, and assorted oddballs, whose primary interest in becoming Satanists was to flash their membership cards for cocktail-party notoriety\". In 1975, when LaVey abolished the system of regional groups, or \"grottos\", and declared that in the future all degrees would be given in exchange for financial or other contributions to the Church, Aquino became increasingly disaffected; he resigned from the organization on June 10, 1975. While LaVey seems to have held a pragmatic and practical view of the degrees and of the Satanic priesthood, intending them to reflect the social role of the degree holder within the organization, Aquino and his supporters viewed the priesthood as being spiritual, sacred and irrevocable. Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen describe Aquino as, in effect, accusing LaVey of the sacrilege of simony. \nAquino then provided what has been described as a \"foundation myth\" for his Setian religion. Having departed the Church, he embarked on a ritual intent on asking Satan for advice on what to do next. According to his account, at Midsummer 1975, Satan appeared and revealed that he wanted to be known by his true name, Set, which had been the name used by his worshippers in ancient Egypt. Aquino produced a religious text, \"The Book of Coming Forth by Night\", which he alleged had been revealed to him by Set through a process of automatic writing. According to Aquino, \"there was nothing overtly sensational, supernatural, or melodramatic about \"The Book of Coming Forth By Night\" working. I simply sat down and wrote it.\" The book proclaimed Aquino to be the Magus of the new Aeon of Set and the heir to LaVey's \"infernal mandate\". Aquino later stated that the revelation that Satan was Set necessitated his own exploration of Egyptology, a subject about which he had previously known comparatively little. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The meeting with the Prince of Darkness marked a point of departure between LaVey and Aquino. LaVey was basically a materialist to whom Satan was a personification of the forces of nature. Aquino is an idealist, basing his theology on Plato and the Gnostic/Hermetic tradition.\"\n Historian of religion Mattias Gardell.\nAquino's \"Book of Coming Forth by Night\" makes reference to \"The Book of the Law\", a similarly revealed text produced by the occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which provided the basis for Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, \"The Book of the Law\" was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making reference to \"The Book of the Law\", Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.\nIn establishing the Temple, Aquino was joined by other ex-members of LaVey's Church, and soon Setian groups, or \"pylons\", were established in various parts of the United States. The structure of the Temple was based largely on those of the ceremonial magical orders of the late nineteenth century, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis.\nAquino has stated that he believed LaVey not to be merely a charismatic leader but to have been actually appointed by Satan himself (referring to this charismatic authority as the \"Infernal Mandate\") to found the Church. After the split of 1975, Aquino believed LaVey had lost the mandate, which the \"Prince of Darkness\" then transferred to Aquino and a new organization, the Temple of Set. According to both the historian of religion Mattias Gardell and journalist Gavin Baddeley, Aquino displayed an \"obsession\" with LaVey after his departure from the Church, for instance by publicly releasing court documents that reflected negatively on his former mentor, among them restraining orders, divorce proceedings, and a bankruptcy filing. In turn, LaVey lampooned the new Temple as \"Laurel and Hardy's \"Sons of the Desert\"\". In 1975, the Temple incorporated as a non-profit Church in California, and later that year secured state and federal recognition and tax-exempted status.\nLater development.\nMany members of the Temple had voiced their opposition to Aquino's position of power within it. Aquino relinquished his office of High Priest in 1979 to Ronald Keith Barrett, who produced an inspired text of his own, titled \"The Book of Opening the Way\". Barrett's approach was later criticized as \"more mystical than magical\" by Temple members. Barrett's leadership was also criticized as authoritarian, resulting in a decline in the Temple's membership. Barrett resigned his office and severed ties with the organization in May 1982. He subsequently established his own Temple of Anubis, which he led until his 1998 death; it survived until the early 2010s. After Barrett's departure, Aquino retook leadership of the Temple of Set. During this period, the sociologist Gini Graham Scott clandestinely participated in the Temple, using her observations as the basis for her 1983 book \"The Magicians: A Study of the Use of Power in a Black Magic Group\".\nAfter receiving his PhD in political science from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1980, Aquino worked as an adjunct professor at Golden Gate University until 1986 while continuing to serve in the United States Army as an Active Guard Reserve officer at the Presidio of San Francisco.\nHe was fascinated with the connections between occultism and Nazism, resulting in some accusations that he was sympathetic to Nazi ideology. In 1983, he performed a solitary rite at Walhalla, the subterranean section of the Wewelsburg castle in Germany that was utilized as a ceremonial space by the Schutzstaffel's Ahnenerbe group during the Nazi period. This resulted in his formation of the Order of the Trapezoid, lifting the name directly from the early governing body of the Church of Satan to repackage it as a Setian version whose members considered themselves a chivalric order of knights. From 1987 through to 1995, the Grand Master of the Order of the Trapezoid was Edred Thorsson, who had joined the Temple of Set in 1984 and risen to the Fifth Degree in 1990. Thorsson exerted a \"discernible influence\" over the Setian community through his books, in which he combined aspects of Satanic philosophy with the Modern Pagan religion of Heathenry. In 1980, he founded the Texas-based Rune-Gild The Ring of Troth which shared many of the Temple's key philosophical tenets but with a focus on the study of runes and their applications in magical practice.\nIn the 1980s, Aquino attracted greater publicity for his Temple through appearances on television talk shows like \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"Geraldo\". In 1987, during the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, the three-year-old daughter of a Christian clergyman accused Aquino of sexually abusing her during Satanic rites held at his Russian Hill home. Responding to the allegations, police raided Aquino's home. However, after no evidence was found to substantiate the allegation and it was revealed that Aquino was living in Washington D.C. at the time of the alleged abuse, the police dropped felony charges. Aquino attempted to bring formal charges against the chaplain and psychiatrist who had encouraged the girl's claims, although he was more successful in bringing legal action against two books\u2014Carl A. Raschke's \"Painted Black\" and Linda Blood's \"The New Satanists\"\u2014that had suggested that he was guilty. He then left the Presidio and was transferred to St. Louis. In 1994, Aquino retired from active service in the Army, being honourably transferred to the Retired Reserve and awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.\nWhile the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria declined, Aquino continued to be a figure of prominence in \"mind control\" conspiracy theories because of his career as a psychological warfare officer in the US Army. In the United Kingdom during this same period, tabloids like the \"News of the World\" and \"Sunday Mirror\" published sensationalist articles about the Temple. In the mid-1990s, a group of British Setians approached the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey and encouraged him to conduct research into the group so as to combat misconceptions about them. The Temple first registered a website in 1997, the same year as the Church of Satan. It would also establish its own intranet, allowing for communication between Setians in different parts of the world.\nOne member of the Temple was the New Zealander Kerry Bolton, who split to form his own Order of The Left Hand Path in 1990. In 1995, another couple who joined were LaVey's daughter Zeena Schreck and her husband Nikolas Schreck, both of whom were vocal critics of Zeena's father.\nIn 1996, Don Webb became the high priest of the Temple, a position that he held until 2002. He was replaced by Zeena Schreck but she resigned after six weeks and was replaced by Aquino, who took charge once more. In that year, Zeena led a schism within the organization establishing her own Berlin-based group, The Storm, which she later renamed the Sethian Liberation Movement. \nAquino stood down as High Priest again in 2004, to be replaced by Patricia Hardy who was elected to the position of High Priestess. Although no longer in charge of the organization, he nevertheless remained its most visible spokesperson.\nAquino died on September 1, 2019.\nIdeology.\nWritings.\nIn addition to the \"Book of Coming Forth by Night\", in which Set himself is purported to speak, the Temple's philosophy and teachings are revealed in a series of occult writings titled the \"Jeweled Tablets of Set\". Each tablet is keyed to a specific degree in the Temple hierarchy. Only the introduction to the first tablet (\"Crystal Tablet of Set\"), titled \"Black Magic\", is available for non-members. The \"Ruby Tablet\", which is available for second-degree members, is the lengthiest and most diverse of the tablets.\nThe private Temple literature is not regarded as secret per se, but is kept restricted because it contains materials which, according to the Temple, may be dangerous to the non-initiated.\nSelf-deification and Xeper.\nThe human individual is at the centre of Setian philosophy. The Temple places great emphasis on the development of the individual, postulating self-deification as the ultimate goal.\nThe realization of the true nature of the Setian is termed \"becoming\" or \"coming into being\" and is represented by the Egyptian hieroglyphic term \"kheper\", or \"Xeper\" (a phonetic of _Xpr_), as the Temple of Set prefers to write it. This term is described in \"The Book of Coming Forth by Night\" as \"the Word of the Aeon of Set\".\nMembers attempt \"to preserve and strengthen\" their \"isolate, psyche-centric existence\" through adherence to the left-hand path. This idea is in opposition to the traditional goal of Hermetic and Western mystical practices, which is the surrendering of the ego into a union with either God or the universe.\nThe Temple teaches that the true self, or \"essence\", is immortal, and \"Xeper\" is the ability to align consciousness with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.\nBarrett presented \"Xem\" as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as a natural and necessary further development of Aquino's \"Xeper\". Aquino later acknowledged \"Xem\" as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's insistence on its exclusivity as incompatible with the Temple's individualistic philosophy.\nSet.\nAquino's understanding of Satan differed from the atheistic interpretation promoted by LaVey, and the Temple's theology differs from that of the Church of Satan. The Temple states that the name \"Satan\" was originally a corruption of the name \"Set\". The Temple of Set promotes the idea that Set is a real entity, and accordingly has been described as being \"openly theistic\". It further argues that Set is ageless and is the only real god in existence, with all others having been created by the human imagination. Set is described as having given humanity\u2014through the means of non-natural evolution\u2014the \"Black Flame\" or the \"Gift of Set\". This refers to humanity's questioning intellect which sets the species apart from other animals and gives it an \"isolate self-consciousness\" and the possibility to attain divinity. Aquino argued that the idea of the Gift of Set was inadvertently promoted to a wider audience in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film \"\". According to Aquino, the black monolith which imparts human-level intelligence onto prehistoric apes in the film was a symbol of Set.\nWhile Setians are expected to revere Set, they do not worship him, instead regarding him as a teacher and a guide. He is portrayed as a role model on which Setians can base their own deification. According to Webb, \"we do not worship Set - only our own potential. Set was and is the patron of the magician who seeks to increase his existence through expansion.\"\nEmbracing the idea of aeons from Crowley's Thelema, Aquino adopted the Crowleyan tripartite division between the Aeon of Isis, Aeon of Osiris, and Aeon of Horus, but added to that the Aeon of Satan, which he dates from 1966 to 1975, and then the Aeon of Set, which he dated from 1975 onward. Despite presenting these chronological parameters, Aquino also portrayed the aeons less as time periods and more as mind-sets that can co-exist alongside one another. Thus, he stated that \"A Jew, Christian or Muslim exists in the \u00c6on of Osiris, a Wiccan in that of Isis, and a Thelemite in that of Horus\".\nMagic.\nAquino placed an emphasis on what he deemed to be the division between the objective and subjective universes. In the Setian religion, the objective world is understood as representing the natural world and humanity's collective meaning systems, while the subjective universe is understood as the individually experienced world and individual meaning systems. Following earlier esotericists like Crowley, Aquino characterized magic as \"causing change in accordance with will\". Unlike LaVey, Aquino expressed belief in the division between black magic and white magic. He described white magic as \"a highly-concentrated form of conventional religious ritual\", characterizing it as being \"more versatile\", \"less difficult\", and \"less dangerous\" than black magic. However, he criticized white magic as \"fraud and/or self-delusion\" which deceives the consciousness into thinking that it has been accepted in the objective universe.\nAquino divided black magic into two forms: lesser black magic and greater black magic. He stated that lesser black magic entails \"impelling\" things that exist in the \"objective universe\" into doing a desired act by using \"obscure physical or behavioral laws\" and into this category he placed stage magic, psychodramas, politics, and propaganda. Conversely, he used the term greater black magic in reference to changes in the subjective universe of the magician, allowing them to realize their self in accordance with the principle of \"Xeper\". Among Setians it is accepted that there may be changes in the objective universe as a result of greater black magic, but such effects are considered secondary to the impact that they have upon the subjective universe.\nWithin the Temple, rituals are typically known as \"workings\", and are most often carried out alone. Stressing the religion's individualist nature, there are no rituals that are specifically prescribed by the Temple. Aquino also emphasized that in order to achieve a desired aim, the Setian should carry out physical actions alongside magical ones. There are no regular occasions which are marked by fixed rituals, and the Temple has no calendar of festivals.\nInsignia.\nThe Temple uses an inverted pentagram as its insignia, known as the \"Pentagram of Set\" to Setians. The use of the geometric shape is derived from the Sigil of Baphomet used by the Church of Satan, although stripped of its overtly Satanic add-ons. The Temple explains the meaning and significance of the pentagram by referring to Pythagorean ideas and \"mathematical perfection\". At Setian gatherings, members wear the pentagram as a medallion. The medallion is colored according to the initiation degree of the Setian.\nBoth the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set also use the trapezoid symbol. The version used by the Church includes flames, a pitchfork and the number 666, while the trapezoid of the Temple has a left-facing Egyptian sceptre, and the number 666 stylized in geometric shapes rather than as clear numbers.\nStructure.\nThe internal structure of the Temple of Set is closely reminiscent of that of the Church of Satan as it existed in the 1970s.\nDegrees.\nAll members of the Temple must be affiliated with a pylon, and thus membership is by application, requiring contact with a Setian priestess or priest followed by an evaluation period. The participation of non-initiated in the Temple's rituals are forbidden, due to the belief that their rituals would be dangerous in the wrong hands.\nThe Temple of Set recognizes several stages or degrees of initiation. The degrees indicate the individual Setian's development and skill in magic. The degree structure is based on that of the Church of Satan, which in turn was based on the degrees of a nineteenth-century occult group, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Temple terms the progression through degrees as \"recognitions\", because the organization's philosophy sees that the individual member initiates themselves and that the Temple merely acknowledges this by granting the degree. These degrees are:\nThe priesthood of the Temple of Set consists of members holding the third degree or higher; those in the first and second degrees are considered \"lay members\" of the Temple. The first degree serves as a space for mutual evaluation, in which the Temple assesses whether the individual is appropriate for the group, and the individual decides whether they wish to further their involvement with it. Full membership comes with recognition to the second degree. Many members do not advance beyond the second degree, nor is this expected of them, as while the first and second degree members use the organization's teachings and tools for their own development, the priesthood involves greater responsibilities towards the organization, such as being its official representatives.\nRecognition is performed by members of the priesthood. The fourth degree, which is acknowledged by the high priest/priestess, entails that the individual is so advanced in their magical skills that they are able to found their own school of magic, represented in the different orders of the Temple. The fifth degree can only be awarded by the unanimous decision of the Council of Nine and by the approval of the Temple's high priest/priestess. A fifth degree member has the power to utter and define a concept which somehow affects the philosophy of the organization, such as the concept of \"Xeper\" defined by Aquino in 1975. Only a handful of members have attained this degree and most \"fifth-degree\" concepts defined in such a manner are no longer studied in the organization. The final sixth degree represents a Magus \"whose Task is complete\". This degree is held by a very select few in the Temple, although any fifth-degree member can assume the sixth degree based on their own assessment.\nLeadership.\nThe organization is led by a high priest/priestess, who is also the public face of the Temple. The high priest is chosen among fourth or higher degree members by the chairman of the Council of Nine. This ruling council has nine members chosen from the priesthood (third degree or higher), whose mandate lasts for nine years with a new member being elected every year. The chairman of the council is chosen from among the council members each year. The council has the ultimate ruling power in the Temple and even the high priest is responsible to it. The Temple also has an executive director, whose task is to deal with administrative issues.\nSince its founding in 1975, the temple has had the following high priests/priestesses:\nPylons, elements, and orders.\nIn addition to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory \"Orders\" and \"Elements\" and local groups called \"Pylons\". Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon is to provide a space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a \"Sentinel\". The term \"pylon\" derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.\n\"Elements\" are loosely structured interest groups, where specific themes and issues are addressed. They can be open for non-members and are commonly in operation only for short periods. Topics of interest include, for example, animal rights, which was the subject of the Arkte element operated by Aquino's wife Lilith.\nThere are sections of the Temple known as \"Orders\", each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular skill, for instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. Orders can be understood as schools of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. Orders are led by grand masters, who will usually be the founder of the order. In longer-lived orders the founder may have a successive grand master. Orders are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the second degree of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing. In normal circumstances, a Setian is only permitted to join one order, however special dispensation can be obtained for a practitioner to join two.\nSetians also hold annual International Conclaves. First Degree Initiates who obtain sponsorship by a member of the Priesthood are permitted to attend the International Conclave and Regional Gatherings.\nDemographics.\nIn 2000, the Temple had thirteen pylons, which were operating in the United States, Australia, Germany, and across Sweden and Finland. The extent of the Temple's membership has not been publicly revealed by the group; however, in 2005 Petersen noted that academic estimates for the Temple's membership varied from between 300 and 500, and Granholm suggested that in 2007 the Temple contained circa 200 members. The Temple's members come from a variety of racial backgrounds.\nIn 1999, the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine suggested that in Britain there were 100 members of the Temple at most, and possibly \"considerably fewer\". In 2001 the scholar Gareth Medway posited that the group had 70 to 80 members in the United Kingdom, adding that it was the largest Satanic group then active in the country. In 2009, Harvey concurred with La Fontaine's assessment, although still believed that it was the largest Satanic group in the United Kingdom. He noted that most members were male, between the ages of twenty and fifty, and that\u2014despite his expectation that they might be political extremists\u2014they endorsed mainstream political positions, with all those whom he communicated with stating that they had voted for either the Conservative Party, Labour Party, or Liberal Democrats.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It forms part of the Tate group together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. It is located in the former Bankside Power Station, in the Bankside area of the London Borough of Southwark.\nTate Modern is one of the largest museums of modern and contemporary art in the world. As with the UK's other national galleries and museums, there is no admission charge for access to the collection displays, which take up the majority of the gallery space, whereas tickets must be purchased for the major temporary exhibitions.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the museum was closed for 173 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 77 per cent to 1,432,991. However, it recovered strongly in 2022, with 3,883,160 visitors, making it the third most visited in Britain and the fourth-most visited art museum in the world.\nThe nearest railway and London Underground station is Blackfriars, which is 550 yards (0.5\u00a0km) from the gallery.\nHistory.\nBankside Power Station.\nAfter sharing the Millbank site with Tate Britain for many decades, since 2000 Tate Modern has occupied the converted former Bankside Power Station. This was originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Battersea Power Station, and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. It is directly across the river from St Paul's Cathedral. The power station closed in 1981.\nPrior to redevelopment, the power station was a long, steel framed, brick clad building with a substantial central chimney standing . The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east\u2013west \u2013 the huge main Turbine Hall in the centre, with the boiler house to the north and the switch house to the south.\nInitial redevelopment.\nFor many years after closure Bankside Power Station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to list the building was refused. In April 1994 the Tate Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Herzog &amp; de Meuron were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The \u00a3134\u00a0million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and was completed in January 2000.\nThe most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An electrical substation, taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company EDF Energy while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.\nThe history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary \"Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern\". The conversion work was carried out by Carillion.\nOpening and initial reception.\nTate Modern was opened by the Queen on 11 May 2000.\nTate Modern received 5.25\u00a0million visitors in its first year. The previous year the three existing Tate galleries had received 2.5\u00a0million visitors combined.\nExtension project.\nTate Modern had attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it had been in preparation since 2004. These plans focused on the south west of the building with the intention of providing 5,000\u00a0m2 of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space.\nThe southern third of the building was retained by the French State owned power company EDF Energy as an electrical substation. In 2006, the company released the western half of this holding and plans were made to replace the structure with a tower extension to the museum, initially planned to be completed in 2015. The tower was to be built over the old oil storage tanks, which would be converted to a performance art space. Structural, geotechnical, civil, and fa\u00e7ade engineering and environmental consultancy was undertaken by Ramboll between 2008 and 2016.\nThis project was initially costed at \u00a3215\u00a0million. Of the money raised, \u00a350\u00a0million came from the UK government; \u00a37\u00a0million from the London Development Agency; \u00a36\u00a0million from philanthropist John Studzinski; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and Elisabeth Murdoch.\nIn June 2013, international shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer pledged \u00a310 million to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds. Eyal Ofer, chairman of London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, said the donation made through his family foundation would enable \"an iconic institution to enhance the experience and accessibility of contemporary art\". The Tate director, Nicholas Serota, praised the donation saying it would help to make Tate Modern a \"truly twenty-first-century museum\".\nThe Tanks.\nThe first phase of the expansion involved the conversion of three large, circular, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station into accessible display spaces and facilities areas. These opened on 18 July 2012 and closed on 28 October 2012 as work on the tower building continued directly above. They reopened following the completion of the Switch House extension in June 2016.\nTwo of the Tanks are used to show live performance art and installations while the third provides utility space. Tate describes them as \"the world's first museum galleries permanently dedicated to live art\".\nThe Switch House.\nA ten-storey tower, high from ground level, was built above the oil tanks.\nThe original western half of the Switch House was demolished to make room for the tower and then rebuilt around it with large gallery spaces and access routes between the main building and the new tower on level 1 (ground level) and level 4. The new galleries on level 4 have natural top lighting. A bridge built across the turbine hall on level 4 provides an upper access route.\nThe new building opened to the public on 17 June 2016.\nThe design, again by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, has been controversial. It was originally designed with a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping fa\u00e7ade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building) despite planning consent for the original design having been granted.\nThe extension provides of additional gross internal area for display and exhibition spaces, performance spaces, education facilities, offices, catering and retail facilities as well as a car parking and a new external public space.\nIn May 2017, the Switch House was formally renamed the Blavatnik Building, after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, who contributed a \"substantial\" amount of the \u00a3260 million cost of the extension. Sir Nicholas Serota commented, \"Len Blavatnik's enthusiastic support ensured the successful realisation of the project and I am delighted that the new building now bears his name\".\nGalleries.\nThe collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and contemporary art dating from 1900 until today.\nLevels 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Each of those floors is split into a large east and west wing with at least 11 rooms in each. Space between these wings is also used for smaller galleries on levels 2 and 4. The Boiler House shows art from 1900 to the present day.\nThe Switch House has eleven floors, numbered 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 consists of the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station's original fuel oil tanks, while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.\nThe Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six storeys tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0. The eastern end provides a very large space that can be used to show exceptionally large artworks due to its unusual height.\nExhibitions.\nCollection exhibitions.\nThe main collection displays consist of 8 areas with a named theme or subject. Within each area there are some rooms that change periodically showing different works in keeping with the overall theme or subject. The themes are changed less frequently. There is no admission charge for these areas.\nAs of June 2016 the themed areas were:\nThere is also an area dedicated to displaying works from the Artist Rooms collection.\nHistory of the collection exhibitions.\nSince the Tate Modern first opened in 2000, the collections have not been displayed in chronological order but have been arranged thematically into broad groups. Prior to the opening of the Switch House there were four of these groupings at a time, each allocated a wing on levels 3 and 5 (now levels 2 and 4).\nThe initial hanging from 2000 to 2006:\nThe first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006. It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art. It also introduced spaces for shorter exhibitions in between the wings. The layout was:\nIn 2012, there was a partial third rehang. The arrangement was:\nTemporary exhibitions.\nThe Turbine Hall.\nThe Turbine hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace. It is used to display large specially-commissioned works by contemporary artists, between October and March each year.\nFrom 2000 until 2012, the series was named after its corporate sponsor, Unilever. In this time the company provided \u00a34.4m sponsorship in total including a renewal deal of \u00a32.2m for a period of five years agreed in 2008.\nThis series was planned to last the gallery's first five years, but the popularity of the series led to its extension until 2012.\nThe artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the Turbine Hall as part of The Unilever Series are:\nIn 2013, Tate Modern signed a sponsorship deal worth around \u00a35\u00a0million with Hyundai to cover a ten-year program of commissions, then considered the largest amount of money ever provided to an individual gallery or museum in the United Kingdom. The first commission for the Hyundai series is Mexican artist, Abraham Cruzvillegas.\nThe artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the Turbine Hall as part of the Hyundai series thus far are:\nWhen there is no series running, the Turbine Hall is used for occasional events and exhibitions. In 2011 it was used to display Damien Hirst's \"For The Love of God\". A sell-out show by Kraftwerk in February 2013 crashed the ticket hotline and website, causing a backlash from the band's fans. In 2018 the Turbine Hall was used for two performances of Messiaen's \"Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum\" and Stockhausen's \"Gruppen\".\nMajor temporary exhibitions.\nTwo wings of the Boiler House are used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the Gilbert and George retrospective due to the size and number of the works.\nA 2014 show of Henri Matisse provided Tate Modern with London's best-attended charging exhibition, and with a record 562,622 visitors overall, helped by a nearly five-month-long run. In 2018, Joan Jonas had a retrospective exhibition.\n\"A Year in Art: Australia 1992\", featuring contemporary Indigenous Australian art of 1992, which opened in June 2021, was extended until September 2022 owing to its popularity.\nIn May 2025, Tate Modern celebrated its 25th anniversary with a free four-day \"Birthday Weekender\". Highlights include the return of Louise Bourgeois\u2019s iconic spider sculpture \"Maman\".\nThe Tanks.\nThe Tanks, located on level 0, are three large underground oil tanks, connecting spaces and side rooms originally used by the power station and refurbished for use by the gallery. One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection. The Tanks have also been used as a venue for live music.\nProject Space.\nThe Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2\u20133 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.\nOther areas.\nWorks are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members' rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.\nOther facilities.\nIn addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:\nAccess and environs.\nThe closest mainline station is Blackfriars via its new south entrance. Nearby underground stations include Southwark, as well as St Paul's and Mansion House north of the river which can be reached via the Millennium Bridge. The lampposts along the route between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange.\nThere is also a riverboat pier just outside the gallery called Bankside Pier, with connections to the Docklands and Greenwich via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.\nTo the west of Tate Modern is an area currently under redevelopment following the demolitions of Ludgate House, the former headquarters of Express Newspapers and Sampson House, a massive late Brutalist office building.\nDirectors.\nThe following have served as Director of the Tate Modern:\nProtests.\nSince 2010 there have been a series of protest art performances by the art collective \"Liberate Tate\" demanding the Tate to \"disengage from BP as a sponsor, and stop allowing Tate to be used to deflect attention away from the devastating impacts that BP has around the world.\" BP is criticised for operations in relation with petroleum exploration in the Arctic, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, oil sands and climate change. In June 2015 a group of artists occupied Tate Modern for 25 hours.\nIncidents.\nIn 2012 and 2024, two people fell to their deaths from the galleries' balconies. In 2019, a six-year old child from France was thrown off the 10th floor by a teenager with a history of violent conduct. The child survived but sustained life-changing injuries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Theophanu was known to be a forceful and capable ruler, and her status in the history of the Empire was in many ways exceptional. According to Wilson, \"She became the only consort to receive the title 'co-empress' (\"coimperatrix augusta\"), and it was envisaged she would succeed as sole ruler if Otto II died without a son.\"\nEarly life.\nAccording to the marriage certificate issued on 14 April 972 Theophanu is identified as the \"neptis\" (niece or granddaughter) of Emperor John I Tzimiskes (925\u2013976, reigned 969\u2013976) who was of Armenian and Byzantine Greek descent. She was of distinguished noble heritage: the Vita Mahthildis identifies her as \"augusti de palatio\" and the Annales Magdeburgenses describe her as \"Grecam illustrem imperatoriae stirpi proximam, ingenio facundam\". Recent research tends to concur that she was most probably the daughter of Tzimiskes' brother-in-law (from his first marriage) Constantine Skleros (c. 920\u2013989), brother of Bardas Skleros and great-grandnephew of Basil I, and cousin Sophia Phokas, the daughter of \"Kouropalat\u0113s\" Leo Phokas, brother of Emperor Nikephoros II (c. 912\u2013969).\nMarriage.\nTheophanu was not \"born in the purple\" as the Ottonians would have preferred. The Saxon chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg writes that the Ottonian preference was for Anna Porphyrogenita, a daughter of late Emperor Romanos II. Theophanu's uncle John I Tzimiskes had overthrown his predecessor Nikephoros II Phokas in 969. Theophanu was escorted back to Rome for her wedding by a delegation of German and Italian churchmen and nobles. When the Ottonian court discovered Theophanu was not a scion of the Macedonian dynasty, as had been assumed, Otto I was told by some to send Theophanu away. His advisors believed that Theophanu's relation to the usurper John Tzimiskes would invalidate the marriage as a confirmation of Otto I as Holy Roman Emperor. He was persuaded to allow her to stay when it was pointed out that John Tzimiskes had wed Theodora, a member of the Macedonian dynasty and sister to Emperor Romanos II. John was therefore a Macedonian, by marriage if not by birth. Otto I must have been convinced, because Theophanu and Otto's heir, Otto II, were married on 14 April 972.\nA reference by the Pope to Emperor Nikephoros II as \"Emperor of the Greeks\" in a letter while Otto's ambassador, Bishop Liutprand of Cremona, was at the Byzantine court, had destroyed the first round of marriage negotiations. With the ascension of John I Tzimiskes, who had not been personally referred to other than as Roman Emperor, the treaty negotiations were able to resume. However, not until a third delegation led by Archbishop Gero of Cologne arrived in Constantinople, were they successfully completed. After the marriage negotiations completed, Theophanu and Otto II were married by Pope John XIII in April 972 and she was crowned as Holy Roman Empress the same day in Rome. According to Karl Leysers' book \"Communications and Power in Medieval Europe: Carolingian and Ottonian,\" Otto I's choice was not \"to be searched for in the parlance of high politics\" as his decision was ultimately made on the basis of securing his dynasty with the birth of the next Ottonian emperor.\nAccording to Laura Wangerin, her father-in-law Otto the Great played an instrumental role in establishing her position as a future ruler. But despite his support, she met a lot of opposition and envy due to her foreign origins and education. After his death in 973, she lost her greatest support at court.\nEmpress.\nOtto II succeeded his father on 8 May 973. Theophanu accompanied her husband on all his journeys, and she is mentioned in approximately one quarter of the emperor's formal documents \u2013 evidence of her privileged position, influence and interest in affairs of the empire. It is known that she was frequently at odds with her mother-in-law, Adelaide of Italy. The young couple and Adelaide collided with each other in several matters, including Adelaide's early association with Henry the Quarrelsome. According to Abbot Odilo of Cluny, Adelaide was very happy when \"that Greek woman\" died.\nNevertheless, the imperial couple were able to secure the trust of their allies at the 973 Reichstag in Worms, after which they traveled the country together, searching for new alliances and strengthening old ties. The young Theophanu showed diplomatic skills and displayed herself as an active partner in political negotiations.\nThe Benedictine chronicler Alpert of Metz describes Theophanu as being an unpleasant and chattery woman. Theophanu was also criticized for having introduced new luxurious garments and jewelry into France and Germany. The theologian Peter Damian even asserts that Theophanu had a love affair with John Philagathos, a Greek monk who briefly reigned as Antipope John XVI.\nOtto II died suddenly on 7 December 983 at the age of 28, probably from malaria. His three-year-old son, Otto III, had already been appointed King of the Romans during a diet held on Pentecost of that year at Verona. At Christmas, Theophanu had him crowned by the Mainz archbishop Willigis at Aachen Cathedral, with herself ruling as Empress Regent on his behalf. Upon the death of Emperor Otto II, Bishop Folcmar of Utrecht released his cousin, the Bavarian duke Henry the Quarrelsome from custody. Duke Henry allied with Archbishop Warin of Cologne and seized his nephew Otto III in spring 984, while Theophanu was still in Italy in the royal palace of Pavia. Nevertheless he was forced to surrender the child to his mother, who was backed by Archbishop Willigis of Mainz and Bishop Hildebald of Worms.\nRegency.\nConsolidation of power.\nTheophanu ruled the Holy Roman Empire as regent for a span of five years, from May 985 to her death in 991, despite early opposition by the Ottonian court. In fact, many queens in the tenth century, on an account of male rulers dying early deaths, found themselves in power, creating an age of greater diversity. Her power as queen, empress and regent was based on the basis of Saxon tradition (which assigned the women an equal role in the family), Byzantine influence (which presented a model of a female counterpart to the emperor) and her mother-in-law Adelaide's legacy. Theophanu and her mother-in-law, Adelaide, are known during the empress' regency to have butted heads frequently\u2014Adelaide of Italy is even quoted as referring to her as \"that Greek empress.\" However, according to historian and author Simon Maclean, Theophanu's rivalry with her mother-in-law is overstated. Theophanu's \"Greekness\" was not an overall issue. Moreover, there was a grand fascination with the culture surrounding Byzantine court in the west that slighted most criticisms to her Greek origin.\nTheophanu did not remain merely as an image of the Ottonian empire, but as an influence within the Holy Roman Empire. She intervened within the governing of the empire a total of seventy-six times during the reign of her husband Otto II\u2014perhaps a foreshadowing of her regency. Her first act as regent was in securing her son, Otto III, as the heir to the Holy Roman Empire. Theophanu also placed her daughters in power by giving them high positions in influential nunneries all around the Ottonian-ruled west, securing power for all her children. She welcomed ambassadors, declaring herself \"imperator\" or \"imperatrix\", as did her relative contemporary\u00a0Irene of Athens, who signed her documents as \"basileus\" rather than \"basilissa\"; the starting date for her reign being 972, the year of her marriage to the late Otto II. Theophanu's regency is a time of considerable peace, as the years 985-991 passed without major crises.\nPolicy.\nIn the North, she made a treaty with King Eric the Victorious, which promoted an alliance against Slavic tribes as well as reinforced trade and cultural connections. In the East, she sent envoys to Vladimir the Great of Kiev, who was married to the Byzantine princess Anna, sister of Emperor Basil II. Economou notes that, \"Theophano had in mind a 'family of kings,' in parallel to Byzantine tradition: The emperor was the 'father' of other kings, who were his 'sons' and 'friends' (amici) in a kind of family hierarchy. She also adopted the Byzantine model of relations between the emperor and patriarch in her relations to the pope (Ostrogorsky 1956b). The 'family' of the western empire included the duke of Poland, Mieszko I, Bohemia and Hungary\". Her model of imperial rulership, influenced by Byzantine and Ancient Roman ideas, was taken over by Otto II and especially Otto III who developed it further (although his abrupt death at a very young age prevented it from becoming an established foundation for the future).\nAccording to historian Gerd Althoff, Theophanu's prowess in diplomacy could be exaggerated. Royal charters present evidence that magnates were at the core of governing the empire. Althoff highlights this as unusual, since kings or emperors in the middle ages rarely shared such a large beacon of power with nobility.\nTheophanu introduced Byzantine protocol, \"which influenced dress, crowns and jewelry, eating habits and utensils, even furniture\". Her retinue of scholars brought to the empire Byzantine lawyers' procedures. The cult of Saint Nicholas in the empire traces its origin from her too.\nAs she and her husband and her son promoted trade in the Empire, Magdeburg and its traders were granted various privileges. Historical evidences show strong commercial activities in regions from L\u00fcneburg to Halle. There are traces of Byzantine, Slavic as well as Arab traders.\nAs with many Byzantine monarchs, Theophanu preferred diplomacy, but she did wage wars when necessary and accepted personal risk. She carried out at least one (successful) military expedition herself, in 987, when she marched with an imperial army to assist the Prince-Bishop Notker of Li\u00e8ge against Odo I, Count of Blois.\nDue to illness beginning in 988, Theophanu eventually died at Nijmegen and was buried in the Church of St. Pantaleon near her wittum in Cologne in 991. The chronicler Thietmar eulogized her as follows: \"\"Though [Theophanu] was of the weak sex she possessed moderation, trustworthiness, and good manners. In this way she protected with male vigilance the royal power for her son, friendly with all those who were honest, but with terrifying superiority against rebels\".\"\nBecause Otto III was still a child, his grandmother Adelaide of Italy took over the regency until Otto III became old enough to rule on his own.\nHistoriography and depictions in arts.\nTheophanu has always attracted considerable controversy from chroniclers and historiographers. While praised by Thietmar of Merseburg and Bruno of Querfurt, she was also criticized by some other scholars, notably Odilo of Cluny, the hagiographer of her mother-in-law and rival Adelaide. Odilo even blamed her for the failed Italian expedition of Otto II. Her modern historiographers are similarly divided, although Knut G\u00f6rich sees the general trend as leaning towards the positive. Some see her as passive, reactive and conservative while the others see her as extremely future-oriented and energetic; still others like Jestice opine that current evidences are not enough to definitely conclude that Theophanu and the other prominent female Ottonian rulers were extraordinarily talented as individuals or not but it is clear that the Ottonian society (which basically treated women and men as equals, except in physical prowess) allowed women the chance to succeed. Her personal role or non-role in the contact or merging between the Macedonian Renaissance and Ottonian Renaissance inspires a lot of debate as well.\nCommemoration.\nThe Empress Theophano Prize, awarded by the Empress Theophano Foundation based in Thessaloniki, \"rewards individuals or organisations who make an outstanding contribution to bridging Europe's historic diversities.\"\nOn the occasion of the millennial commemoration of her death, multiple events in Germany and the Netherlands were organized.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Along with his rival Sir Joshua Reynolds, he is considered one of the most important British artists of the second half of the 18th century. He painted quickly, and the works of his maturity are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. Despite being a prolific portrait painter, Gainsborough gained greater satisfaction from his landscapes. He is credited (with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th-century British landscape school. Gainsborough was a founding member of the Royal Academy.\nYouth and training.\nGainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, the youngest son of John Gainsborough, a weaver and maker of woollen goods, and his wife Mary, sister of the Reverend Humphry Burroughs. One of Gainsborough's brothers, Humphrey, is said to have invented the method of condensing steam in a separate vessel, which was of great service to James Watt; another brother, John, was known as \"Scheming Jack\" because of his passion for designing curiosities.\nThe artist spent his childhood at what is now Gainsborough's House, on Gainsborough Street, Sudbury. He later resided there following the death of his father in 1748 and before his move to Ipswich. The building is now a house-museum dedicated to his life and art.\nAs a boy he demonstrated impressive drawing and painting skills. At the age of ten he was painting heads and small landscapes, including a miniature self-portrait. Gainsborough left home in 1740 to study art in London, where he trained under engraver Hubert Gravelot but became associated with William Hogarth and his school. He assisted Francis Hayman in decorating the supper boxes at Vauxhall Gardens.\nCareer.\nSuffolk.\nIn 1746, Gainsborough married Margaret Burr, an illegitimate daughter of the 3rd Duke of Beaufort, who had settled a \u00a3200 annuity on her. The artist's work, then mostly consisting of landscape paintings, was not selling well. He returned to Sudbury in 1748\u20131749 and concentrated on painting portraits. \nWhile still in Suffolk, Gainsborough painted a portrait of \"The Rev. John Chafy Playing the Violoncello in a Landscape\" (c. 1750\u20131752; Tate Gallery, London).\nIn 1752, he and his family, now including two daughters, Mary (\"Molly\", 1750\u20131826) and Margaret (\"Peggy\", 1751\u20131820), moved to Ipswich. Commissions for portraits increased, but his clients included mainly local merchants and squires. He had to borrow against his wife's annuity. Toward the end of his time in Ipswich, he painted a self-portrait, now in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.\nBath.\nIn 1759, Gainsborough and his family moved to Bath, living at number 17 The Circus. There, he studied portraits by van Dyck and was eventually able to attract a fashionable clientele. Beginning with the Exhibition of 1761 he sent work to the annual exhibition of the Society of Artists of Great Britain (of which he was one of the earliest members) at Spring Gardens in London. From 1769 he submitted works to the Royal Academy's annual exhibitions. The exhibitions helped him enhance his reputation, and he was invited to become a founding member of the Royal Academy in 1769. His relationship with the academy was not an easy one and he stopped exhibiting his paintings in 1773.\nDespite Gainsborough's increasing popularity and success in painting portraits for fashionable society, he expressed frustration during his Bath period at the demands of such work and that it prevented him from pursuing his preferred artistic interests. In a letter to a friend in the 1760s Gainsborough wrote: \"I'm sick of Portraits and wish very much to take my Viol da Gamba and walk off to some sweet Village where I can paint Landskips [landscapes] and enjoy the fag End of Life in quietness and ease\". Of the men he had to deal with as patrons and admirers, and their pretensions, he wrote:... damn Gentlemen, there is not such a set of Enemies to a real artist in the world as they are, if not kept at a proper distance. They think ... that they reward your merit by their Company &amp; notice; but I ... know that they have but one part worth looking at, and that is their Purse; their Hearts are seldom near enough the right place to get a sight of it.Gainsborough was so keen a viol da gamba player that he had at this stage five of the instruments, three made by Henry Jaye and two by Barak Norman.\nLondon.\nIn 1774, Gainsborough and his family moved to London to live in Schomberg House, Pall Mall. A commemorative blue plaque was put on the house in 1951. In 1777, he again began to exhibit his paintings at the Royal Academy, including portraits of contemporary celebrities, such as the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland. Exhibitions of his work continued for the next six years. About this time, Gainsborough began experimenting with printmaking using the then-novel techniques of aquatint and soft-ground etching.\nDuring the 1770s and 1780s Gainsborough developed a type of portrait in which he integrated the sitter into the landscape. An example of this is his portrait of Frances Browne, Mrs John Douglas (1746\u20131811) which can be seen at Waddesdon Manor. The sitter has withdrawn to a secluded and overgrown corner of a garden to read a letter, her pose recalling the traditional representation of Melancholy. Gainsborough emphasised the relationship between Mrs Douglas and her environment by painting the clouds behind her and the drapery billowing across her lap with similar silvery violet tones and fluid brushstrokes. This portrait was included in his first private exhibition at Schomberg House in 1784.\nIn 1776, Gainsborough painted a portrait of Johann Christian Bach, the youngest son of Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach's former teacher Padre Martini of Bologna, Italy, was assembling a collection of portraits of musicians, and Bach asked Gainsborough to paint his portrait as part of this collection. The portrait now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London.\nIn 1780, he painted the portraits of King George III and Queen Charlotte and afterwards received other royal commissions. In February 1780, his daughter Molly was married to his musician friend Johann Christian Fischer, to Gainsborough's dismay, as he realized that Fischer was forming an attachment to Molly while carrying on flirtation with Peggy. The marriage between Molly and Fischer lasted only eight months, owing to their discord and Fischer's deceit.\nIn 1784, Principal Painter in Ordinary Allan Ramsay died and the King was obliged to give the job to Gainsborough's rival and Academy president, Joshua Reynolds. Gainsborough remained the royal family's favourite painter, however.\nIn his later years, Gainsborough often painted landscapes. With Richard Wilson, he was one of the originators of the eighteenth-century British landscape school; though simultaneously, in conjunction with Reynolds, he was the dominant British portraitist of the second half of the 18th century.\nWilliam Jackson in his contemporary essays said of him \"to his intimate friends he was sincere and honest and that his heart was always alive to every feeling of honour and generosity\". Gainsborough did not particularly enjoy reading but letters written to his friends were penned in such an exceptional conversational manner that the style could not be equalled. As a letter writer Henry Bate-Dudley said of him \"a selection of his letters would offer the world as much originality and beauty as is ever traced in his paintings\".\nIn the 1780s, Gainsborough used a device he called a \"Showbox\" to compose landscapes and display them backlit on glass. The original box is on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum with a reproduction transparency.\nHe died of cancer on 2 August 1788 at the age of 61. According to his daughter Peggy, his last words were \"van Dyck\". He is interred in the churchyard St Anne's Church, Kew, Surrey, (located on Kew Green). It was his express wish to be buried near his friend Joshua Kirby. Later his wife and nephew Gainsborough Dupont were interred with him. Coincidentally Johan Zoffany and Franz Bauer are also buried in the graveyard. In 2011, an appeal was given to pay the costs of restoration of his tomb, and the tomb was restored in 2012. A street in Kew, Gainsborough Road, is named after him.\nTechnique.\nThe art historian Michael Rosenthal described Gainsborough as \"one of the most technically proficient and, at the same time, most experimental artists of his time\". He was noted for the speed with which he applied paint, and he worked more from observations of nature (and of human nature) than from application of formal academic rules. The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused John Constable to say, \"On looking at them, we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them.\"\nGainsborough's enthusiasm for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them. His landscapes were often painted at night by candlelight, using a tabletop arrangement of stones, pieces of mirrors, broccoli, and the like as a model. His later work was characterised by a light palette and easy, economical strokes.\nGainsborough's only known assistant was his nephew, Gainsborough Dupont.\nReputation.\nHis more famous works, \"The Blue Boy\"; \"Mr and Mrs Andrews\"; \"Portrait of Mrs Mary Graham\"; \"Mary and Margaret: The Painter's Daughters\"; \"William Hallett and His Wife Elizabeth, nee Stephen\", known as \"The Morning Walk\"; and \"Cottage Girl with Dog and Pitcher\", display the unique individuality of his subjects. \nHis rival, Joshua Reynolds wrote that the painting \"Girl with Pigs\" was \"the best picture he (Gainsborough) ever painted or perhaps ever will\".\nGainsborough's works became popular with collectors from the 1850s on, after Lionel de Rothschild began buying his portraits. The rapid rise in the value of pictures by Gainsborough and also by Reynolds in the mid 19th century was partly because the Rothschild family, including Ferdinand de Rothschild began collecting them.\nIn 2011, Gainsborough's portrait of \"Miss Read\" (Mrs Frances Villebois) was sold by Michael Pearson, 4th Viscount Cowdray, for a record price of \u00a36.54M, at Christie's in London. She was a matrilineal descendant of Cecily Neville, Duchess of York.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Imperial Japanese South Seas Mandate had been seized by the US during the Pacific War, as Japan had administered the territory since the League of Nations gave Japan a mandate over the area from Imperial Germany after World War I. However, in the 1930s, Japan left the League of Nations and invaded additional lands. During World War II, military control of the islands was contested, but by the war's end, the islands had come under the Allies' control. The Trust Territory of the Pacific was created to administer the islands as part of the United States while still under the auspices of the United Nations. Most of the island groups in the territory became independent states, with some degree of association kept with the United States: the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Palau are independent states in a Compact of Free Association with the US, while the Northern Mariana Islands remain under US jurisdiction, as an unincorporated territory and commonwealth.\nHistory.\nSpain initially claimed the islands that later composed the territory of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). Subsequently, Germany established competing claims over the islands. The competing claims were eventually resolved in favor of Germany when Spain, following its loss of several possessions to the United States during the Spanish\u2013American War, ceded its claims over the islands to Germany pursuant to the German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899). Germany, in turn, continued to retain possession until the islands were captured by Japan during World War I. The League of Nations formally placed the islands in the former South Seas Mandate, a mandate that authorized Japanese administration of the islands. The islands then remained under Japanese control until captured by the United States in 1944 during World War II.\nThe TTPI entered UN trusteeship pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21 on July 18, 1947, and was designated a \"strategic area\" in its 1947 trusteeship agreement. Article 83 of the UN Charter provided that, as such, its formal status as a UN trust territory could be terminated only by the Security Council and not by the General Assembly as with other trust territories. The United States Navy controlled the TTPI from a headquarters in Guam until 1951, when the United States Department of the Interior took over control, administering the territory from a base in Saipan.\nThe Territory contained 100,000 people scattered over a water area the size of the continental United States. It was subdivided into six districts and represented a variety of cultures, with nine spoken languages. The Pohnpeians and Kosraeans, Marshallese and Palauans, Chuukese, Yapese and Chamorros had little in common, except they were in the same general area of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe large distances between people, the lack of an economy, and language and cultural barriers all worked against the union. The six district centers became upscale slums, containing deteriorated Japanese-built roads, electricity, modern music, and distractions, which alienated youth and elders. The remainder of the islands maintained their traditional way of life and infrastructure.\nIn the late 1960s, the US opposed the idea of eventual independence. Instead, they aimed for some form of association, perhaps with Hawaii. They estimated that perhaps 10-25% of the population favored independence.\nA Congress of Micronesia first levied an income tax in 1971. It affected mainly foreigners working at military bases in the region.\nOn October 21, 1986, the US ended its administration of the Marshall Islands District. The termination of US administration of the Chuuk, Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and the Mariana Islands districts of the TTPI soon followed on November 3, 1986. The Security Council formally ended the trusteeship for the Chuuk, Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Mariana Islands, and Marshall Islands districts on December 22, 1990, pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683. On May 25, 1994, the Council ended the trusteeship for the Palau District pursuant to Security Council Resolution 956, after which the US and Palau agreed to establish the latter's independence on October 1.\nGeography.\nIn 1969, the 100 occupied islands comprised over an area of of sea. The latter area was comparable in size to the continental United States. The water area is about 5% of the Pacific Ocean.\nDemographics.\nThe islands' population was 200,000 in the latter part of the 19th century. The population decreased to 100,000 by 1969 due to emigration, war, and disease. At that time, the population inhabited less than 100 out of 2,141 of the Marshall, Mariana, and Caroline Islands.\nEducation.\nIn 1947, the Mariana Islands' Teacher Training School (MITTS), a normal school serving all areas of the Trust Territory, opened in Guam. It moved to Chuuk in 1948, to be more central in the Trust Territory, and was renamed Pacific Islands' Teacher Training School (PITTS). It transitioned from being a normal school to a comprehensive secondary school, so it was renamed the Pacific Islands Central School (PICS). The school moved to Pohnpei in 1959. It was a three-year institution housing students who graduated from intermediate schools. The school, later known as Pohnpei Island Central School (PICS), is now Bailey Olter High School.\nPalau Intermediate School, established in 1946, became Palau High School in 1962 as it added senior high grades. From the late 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, several public high schools were built or received additions in the Trust Territory. They included Jaluit High School, Kosrae High School, Marshall Islands High School in Majuro, Palau High, PICS, and Truk High School (now Chuuk High School). The Micronesian Occupational College in Koror, Palau, was also built. It later merged with the Kolonia-based Community College of Micronesia, which began operations in 1969, into the College of Micronesia-FSM in 1976.\nCurrent status.\nFollowing the termination of the trusteeship, the territory of the former TTPI became four separate jurisdictions:\nSovereign states in free association with the United States.\nThe following sovereign states have become freely associated with the United States under the Compact of Free Association (COFA).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "31128", "revid": "8565473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31128", "title": "Theobromine", "text": "Bitter alkaloid of the cacao plant\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox drug/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nTheobromine, also known as xantheose, is the principal alkaloid of \"Theobroma cacao\" (cacao plant). Theobromine is slightly water-soluble (330\u00a0mg/L) with a bitter taste. In industry, theobromine is used as an additive and precursor to some cosmetics. It is found in chocolate and several other foods, including tea (\"Camellia sinensis\"), some American hollies (yaupon and guayusa) and the kola nut. It is a white or colourless solid, but commercial samples can appear yellowish.\nTheobromine, a metabolite of caffeine, is processed in the liver into xanthine and methyluric acid, peaks in the blood 2\u20133 hours after ingestion due to its fat solubility, and primarily acts by inhibiting adenosine receptors with minor phosphodiesterase inhibition. It is a mild heart stimulant and bronchodilator in humans with limited central nervous system effects. It can be toxic or fatal to animals like dogs and cats due to their slower metabolism of the compound.\nStructure.\nTheobromine is a flat molecule, a derivative of purine and an isomer of theophylline. It is also classified as a dimethyl xanthine. Related compounds include theophylline, caffeine, paraxanthine, and 7-methylxanthine, each of which differ in the number or placement of the methyl groups.\nHistory.\nTheobromine was first discovered in 1841 in cacao beans by the chemist A. Woskresensky. Synthesis of theobromine from xanthine was first reported in 1882 by Hermann Emil Fischer.\nEtymology.\n\"Theobromine\" is derived from \"Theobroma\", the name of the genus of the cacao tree, with the suffix \"-ine\" given to alkaloids and other basic nitrogen-containing compounds. That name in turn is made up of the Greek roots \"theo\" (\"god\") and \"broma\" (\"food\"), meaning \"food of the gods\".\nDespite its name, the compound contains no bromine, which is based on Greek \"bromos\" (\"stench\").\nSources.\nTheobromine is the primary alkaloid found in cocoa and chocolate. Cocoa butter only contains trace amounts of theobromine. There are usually higher concentrations in dark than in milk chocolate.\nThere are approximately of theobromine in of milk chocolate, while the same amount of dark chocolate contains about . Cocoa beans naturally contain approximately 1% theobromine.\nPlant species and components with substantial amounts of theobromine are:\nTheobromine can also be found in trace amounts in the kola nut, the guarana berry, yerba mate (\"Ilex paraguariensis\"), and the tea plant.\nThe mean theobromine concentrations in cocoa and carob products are:\nBiosynthesis.\nTheobromine is a purine alkaloid derived from xanthosine, a nucleoside. Cleavage of the ribose and N-methylation yields 7-methylxanthosine. 7-Methylxanthosine in turn is the precursor to theobromine, which in turn is the precursor to caffeine.\nPharmacology.\nEven without dietary intake, theobromine may occur in the body as it is a product of the human metabolism of caffeine, which is metabolised in the liver into 12% theobromine, 4% theophylline, and 84% paraxanthine.\nIn the liver, theobromine is metabolized into xanthine and subsequently into methyluric acid. Important enzymes include CYP1A2 and CYP2E1. The elimination half life of theobromine is between 6 and 8 hours.\nUnlike caffeine, which is highly water-soluble, theobromine is only slightly water-soluble and is more fat soluble, and thus peaks more slowly in the blood. While caffeine peaks after only 30 minutes, theobromine requires 2\u20133 hours to peak.\nThe primary mechanism of action for theobromine inside the body is inhibition of adenosine receptors. Its effect as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor is thought to be small.\nEffects.\nHumans.\nTheobromine is a heart stimulator and diuretic but has no significant stimulant effect on the human central nervous system. It is a bronchodilator and causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. It is available as a prescription drug in South Korea. The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can, in general, be safely consumed by humans.\nCompared with caffeine, theobromine is weaker in both its inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and its antagonism of adenosine receptors. The potential phosphodiesterase inhibitory effect of theobromine is seen only at amounts much higher than what people normally would consume in a typical diet including chocolate.\nToxicity.\nAt doses of 0.8\u20131.5 g/day (50\u2013100 g cocoa), sweating, trembling and severe headaches were noted, with limited mood effects found at 250\u00a0mg/day.\nAlso, chocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because theobromine may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.\nAnimals.\nTheobromine is the reason chocolate is poisonous to dogs. Dogs and other animals that metabolize theobromine (found in chocolate) more slowly can succumb to theobromine poisoning from as little as of milk chocolate for a smaller dog and , or around nine small milk chocolate bars, for an average-sized dog. The concentration of theobromine in dark chocolates (about ) is up to 10 times that of milk chocolate (), meaning dark chocolate is far more toxic to dogs per unit weight or volume than milk chocolate.\nThe median lethal dose of theobromine for dogs is ; therefore, a dog would need to consume a minimum of of the most theobromine-rich () dark chocolate, or a maximum of (of theobromine-rich milk chocolate), to have a 50% chance of receiving a lethal dose. However, even of milk chocolate may induce vomiting and diarrhea.\nThe same risk is reported for cats as well, although cats are less likely to ingest sweet food, as cats lack sweet taste receptors. Complications include digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Later stages of theobromine poisoning include epileptic-like seizures and death. If caught early on, theobromine poisoning is treatable. Although not common, the effects of theobromine poisoning can be fatal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With 2.1 million people, it is 12th-largest by population, and with 16,171 square kilometers, it is 11th-largest in area.\nErfurt is the capital and largest city. Other cities include Jena, Gera and Weimar. Thuringia is bordered by Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. It has been known as \"the green heart of Germany\" () from the late 19th century due to its broad, dense forest. Most of Thuringia is in the Saale drainage basin, a left-bank tributary of the Elbe.\nThe Frankish Duchy of Thuringia was established around 631 AD by King Dagobert I. The modern state was established in 1920 by the Weimar Republic through a merger of the Ernestine duchies, save for Saxe-Coburg. After World War II, Thuringia came under the Soviet occupation zone in Allied-occupied Germany, and its borders were reformed, to become contiguous. Thuringia became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms, and divided into the Districts of Erfurt, Suhl and Gera. Thuringia was re-established in 1990 following German reunification, slightly re-drawn, and became one of the new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nThuringia is home to the Rennsteig, Germany's best-known hiking trail. Its winter resort of Oberhof makes it a well-equipped winter sports destination \u2013 half of Germany's 136 Winter Olympic gold medals had been won by Thuringian athletes as of 2014. Thuringia was favoured by or was the birthplace of three key intellectuals and leaders in the arts: Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. The state is home to the University of Jena, the Ilmenau University of Technology, the University of Erfurt, Bauhaus University of Weimar and the Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences.\nEtymology and symbols.\nThe name \"Thuringia\" or \"Th\u00fcringen\" derives from the Germanic tribe Thuringii, who emerged during the Migration Period. Their origin is largely unknown. An older theory claims that they were successors of the Hermunduri, but later research rejected the idea. Other historians argue that the Thuringians were allies of the Huns, came to central Europe together with them, and lived before in what is Galicia today. Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus first mentioned the Thuringii around 400; during that period, the Thuringii were famous for their excellent horses.\nThe Thuringian Realm existed until after 531. The Landgraviate of Thuringia was the largest state in the region, persisting between 1131 and 1247. Afterwards the state known as Thuringia ceased to exist; nevertheless the term commonly described the region between the Harz mountains in the north, the White Elster river in the east, the Franconian Forest in the south and the Werra river in the west. After the Treaty of Leipzig, Thuringia had its own dynasty again, the Ernestine Wettins. Their various lands formed the State of Thuringia, founded in 1920, together with some other small principalities. The Prussian territories around Erfurt, M\u00fchlhausen and Nordhausen joined Thuringia in 1945.\nThe coat of arms of Thuringia shows the lion of the Ludowingian Landgraves of 12th-century origin. The eight stars around it represent the eight former states which formed Thuringia. The flag of Thuringia is a white-red bicolor, derived from the white and red stripes of the Ludowingian lion. The coat of arms and flag of Hesse are quite similar to the Thuringian ones, since they are also derived from the Ludowingian symbols.\nSymbols of Thuringia in popular culture are the \"Bratwurst\" and the Forest, because a large amount of the territory is forested.\nHistory.\nNamed after the Thuringii Germanic tribe who occupied it around AD 300, Thuringia came under Frankish domination in the 6th century.\nThuringia became a landgraviate in 1130 AD. After the extinction of the reigning Ludowingian line of counts and landgraves in 1247 and the War of the Thuringian Succession (1247\u20131264), the western half became independent under the name of \"Hesse\", never to become a part of Thuringia again. Most of the remaining Thuringia came under the rule of the Wettin dynasty of the nearby Margraviate of Meissen, the nucleus of the later Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony. With the division of the house of Wettin in 1485, Thuringia went to the senior Ernestine branch of the family, which subsequently subdivided the area into a number of smaller states, according to the Saxon tradition of dividing inheritance amongst male heirs. These were the \"Saxon duchies\", consisting, among others, of the states of Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach, Saxe-Jena, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg, and Saxe-Gotha.\nThuringia generally accepted the Protestant Reformation, and Roman Catholicism was suppressed as early as 1520; priests who remained loyal to it were driven away and churches and monasteries were largely destroyed, especially during the German Peasants' War of 1525. In M\u00fchlhausen and elsewhere, the Anabaptists found many adherents. Thomas M\u00fcntzer, a leader of some non-peaceful groups of this sect, was active in this city. Within the borders of modern Thuringia the Roman Catholic faith only survived in the Eichsfeld district, which was ruled by the Archbishop of Mainz, and to a small degree in Erfurt and its immediate vicinity.\nEarly modern period.\nThe modern German black-red-gold tricolour flag's first appearance anywhere in a German-ethnicity sovereign state, within what today comprises Germany, occurred in 1778 as the state flag of the Principality of Reuss-Greiz, a defunct principality within the modern state's borders.\nSome reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line.\nFree State of Thuringia.\nIn 1920, after World War I, these small states merged into one state, called the State of Thuringia (\"Land Th\u00fcringen\"); only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead. Weimar became the new capital. The coat of arms of this new state was simpler than those of its predecessors. The \"Landtag\" of the newly established state first convened in 1920 in Weimar. Its deputies were elected for three years according to proportional representation, with a minimum voting age of 21. Between 1920 and 1932, under the Weimar Republic, six \"Landtag\" elections were held.\nThuringia was one of the states where the Nazi Party first gained real political power during the Weimar Republic. Wilhelm Frick was appointed Minister of the Interior in the state coalition government after the Nazi Party won six deputies to the Thuringian \"Landtag\" in the December 1929 election. In this position, he removed from the Thuringian police force anyone he suspected of being a republican and replaced them with men who were favourable towards the Nazis. He also ensured that, whenever an important position came up within Thuringia, a Nazi was given that post. Following the Nazi seizure of power in Berlin, the \"Landtag\" was formally abolished as a result of the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" of 30 January 1934, which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state. Thuringia was the location of the Buchenwald concentration camp with multiple subcamps.\nAfter being controlled briefly by the US following the end of the Second World War, from July 1945 the state of Thuringia came under the Soviet occupation zone and was expanded to include parts of Prussian Saxony, such as the areas around Erfurt, M\u00fchlhausen, and Nordhausen. Erfurt became the new capital of Thuringia. Ostheim, an exclave of \"Landkreis\" Eisenach, was ceded to Bavaria.\nIn 1952, the German Democratic Republic dissolved its states, and created districts () instead. The three districts that shared the former territory of Thuringia were Erfurt, Gera and Suhl. Altenburg Kreis was part of Leipzig Bezirk.\nThe present Free State of Thuringia was recreated with slightly altered borders during German reunification in 1990.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nFrom the northwest going clockwise; Thuringia borders on the German states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Bavaria and Hesse.\nThe landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich. Within the Basin the smaller hill chains Fahner H\u00f6he and Heilinger H\u00f6hen. South of the Thuringian Basin is the state's largest mountain range, marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle and the Franconian Forest in the south-east. Most of this range is forested and the Gro\u00dfer Beerberg (983 m) is Thuringia's highest mountain. To the south-west, the Forest is followed up by Werra river valley, dividing it from the Rh\u00f6n Mountains in the west and the Grabfeld plain in the south. Eastern Thuringia, commonly described as the area east of Saale and Loquitz valley, is marked by a hilly landscape, rising slowly from the flat north to the mountainous south. The Saale in the west and the White Elster in the east are the two big rivers running from south to north and forming densely settled valleys in this area. Between them lies the flat and forested Holzland in the north, the flat and fertile Orlasenke in the middle and the Vogtland, a hilly but in most parts non-forested region in the south. The far eastern region (east of White Elster) is the Osterland or Altenburger Land along Plei\u00dfe river, a flat, fertile and densely settled agricultural area.\nThere are two large rivers in Thuringia. The Saale, a tributary of the Elbe, with its tributaries the Unstrut, Ilm and White Elster, drains the most part of Thuringia. The Werra \u2013 the headwater of the Weser \u2013 drains the south-west and west of the state. Furthermore, some small areas on the southern border are drained by tributaries of the Main, itself a tributary of the Rhine. There are no large natural lakes in Thuringia, but it does have some of Germany's biggest dams, including the Bleiloch Dam and the Hohenwarte Dam on the River Saale, as well as the Leibis-Lichte Dam and the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station in the Thuringian Highlands. Thuringia is Germany's only state with no connection to navigable waterways.\nThe geographic centre of the Federal Republic is in Thuringia, within the municipality of Vogtei next to M\u00fchlhausen. The centre of Thuringia is eight kilometres south of the capital's Cathedral, in the municipality of Rockhausen.\nClimate.\nThuringia's climate is temperate with humid westerly winds predominating. Increasingly as one moves from the north-west to the south-east, the climate shows continental features: winters can be cold for long periods, and summers can become warm. Dry periods are often recorded, especially within the Thuringian Basin, leeward to mountains in all directions. It is Germany's driest area, with annual precipitation of only 400 to 500\u00a0mm.\nArtern, in the north-east, is warm and dry, with a mean annual temperature of 8.5\u00a0\u00b0C and mean precipitation of 450\u00a0mm; contrast this with wet, cool Oberhof, in the Thuringian Forest, where temperature averages only 4.4\u00a0\u00b0C and mean annual precipitation reaches 1300\u00a0mm.\nNature and environment.\nDue to many centuries of intensive settlement, most of the area is shaped by human influence. The original natural vegetation of Thuringia is forest with beech as its predominant species, as can still be found in the Hainich mountains today. In the uplands, a mixture of beech and spruce would be natural. However, most of the plains have been cleared and are in intensive agricultural use while most of the forests are planted with spruce and pine. Since 1990, Thuringia's forests have been managed aiming for a more natural and tough vegetation more resilient to climate change as well as diseases and vermin. In comparison to the forest, agriculture is still quite conventional and dominated by large structures and monocultures. Problems here are caused especially by increasingly prolonged dry periods during the summer months.\nEnvironmental damage in Thuringia has been reduced to a large extent after 1990. The condition of forests, rivers and air was improved by modernizing factories, houses (decline of coal heating) and cars, and contaminated areas such as the former Uranium surface mines around Ronneburg have been remediated. Today's environmental problems are the salination of the Werra river, caused by discharges of K+S salt mines around Unterbreizbach and overfertilisation in agriculture, damaging the soil and small rivers.\nEnvironment and nature protection has been of growing importance and attention since 1990. Large areas, especially within the forested mountains, are protected as natural reserves, including Thuringia's first national park within the Hainich mountains, founded in 1997, the Rh\u00f6n Biosphere Reserve, the Thuringian Forest Nature Park and the South Harz Nature Park.\nDemographics.\nDemographic history.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Thuringia was at the border between Germanic and Slavic territories, marked by the Saale river. The main Slavic tribe in what is now Thuringia were the Sorbs proper, who unified all tribes in what is now southern half of Eastern Germany. The Ostsiedlung movement led to the assimilation of Slavic people between the 11th and the 13th century under German rule. The population growth increased during the 18th century and stayed high until World War I, before it slowed within the 20th century and changed to a decline since 1990. Since the beginning of Urbanisation around 1840, the Thuringian cities have higher growth rates resp. smaller rates of decline than rural areas (many villages lost half of their population since 1950, whereas the biggest cities (Erfurt and Jena) kept growing).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe 1981 census projected that Thuringia's population would reach 2,221,222 by 2011. The population counted in the 2011 census was 2,181,603, which is about 1.78% less.\nCurrent population.\nThe current population is 2,120,237 (31 December 2020) with an annual rate of decrease of about 0.5%, which varies widely between the local regions. In 2012, 905,000 Thuringians lived in a municipality with more than 20,000 inhabitants, this is an urbanization rate of 42% which continues to rise.\nIn July 2013, there were 41,000 non-Germans by citizenship living in Thuringia (1.9% of the population \u2212 among the smallest proportions of any state in Germany). Nevertheless, the number rose from 33,000 in July 2011, an increase of 24% in only two years. About 4% of the population are migrants (including persons that already received German citizenship). The biggest groups of foreigners by citizenship are (as of 2012): Russians (3,100), Poles (3,000), Turks (2,100) and Ukrainians (2,000). The number of foreigners varies between regions: the college towns Erfurt, Jena, Weimar and Ilmenau have the highest rates, whereas there are almost no migrants living in the most rural smaller municipalities.\nThe Thuringian population has a significant sex ratio gap, caused by the emigration of young women, especially in rural areas. Overall, there are 115 to 120 men per 100 women in the 25\u201340 age group (\"family founders\") which has negative consequences for the birth ratio. Furthermore, the population is getting older and older with some rural municipalities recording more than 30% of over-65s (pensioners). This is a problem for the regional labour market, as there are twice as many people leaving as entering the job market annually.\nNatural and spatial tendencies.\nThe birth rate was about 1.8 children per women in the 1970s and 1980s, shrinking to 0.8 in 1994 during the economic crisis after the reunification and rose again to more than 1.4 children in 2010, which is a higher level than in West Germany. Nevertheless, there are only 17,000 births compared to 27,000 deaths per year, so that the annual natural change of the Thuringian population is about \u22120.45%. In 2015 there were 17,934 births, the highest number since 1990.\nMigration plays an important role in Thuringia. The internal migration shows a strong tendency from rural areas towards the big cities. From 2008 to 2012, there was a net migration from Thuringia to Erfurt of +6,700 persons (33 per 1000 inhabitants), +1,800 to Gera (19 per 1000), +1,400 to Jena (14 per 1000), +1,400 to Eisenach (33 per 1000) and +1,300 to Weimar (21 per 1000). Between Thuringia and the other German states, the balance is negative: In 2012, Thuringia lost 6,500 persons to other federal states, the most to Bavaria, Saxony, Hesse and Berlin. Only with Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg the balance is positive. The international migration is fluctuating heavily. In 2009, the balance was +700, in 2010 +1,800, in 2011 +2,700 and in 2012 +4,800. The most important countries of origin of the Thuringia migrants from 2008 to 2012 were Poland (+1,700), Romania (+1,200), Afghanistan (+1,100) and Serbia/Montenegro/Kosovo (+1,000), whereas the balance was negative with Switzerland (\u22122,800) and Austria (\u2212900).\nCities, towns and villages.\nOf the approximately 850 municipalities of Thuringia, 126 are classed as towns (within a district) or cities (forming their own urban district). Most of the towns are small with a population of less than 10,000; only the ten biggest ones have a population greater than 30,000. The first towns emerged during the 12th century, whereas the latest ones received town status only in the 20th century. Today, all municipalities within districts are equal in law, whether they are towns or villages. Independent cities (i.e. urban districts) have greater powers (the same as any district) than towns within a district.\nReligion.\nSince the Protestant Reformation, the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism. During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 20.8% of the population in 2018. Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.6% of the population, while 71.6% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths. The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia, whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious (up to 88% in Gera). Catholic regions are Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rh\u00f6n Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence.\nThe Protestant parishes of Thuringia belong to the Evangelical Church in Central Germany or to the Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck (Schmalkalden region). Catholic dioceses are Erfurt (most of Thuringia), Dresden-Meissen (eastern parts) and Fulda (Rh\u00f6n around Geisa in the very west).\nPolitics.\nNational.\nThuringia is a stronghold for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the party emerged as the largest in Thuringia in the 2021 national elections. In 2017 the party got 22.7%, in 2021 they got 24.0%, and in 2025 they surged to 38.6%.\nState.\nThuringia is notable for being the first and only state in Germany where the modern successor to the Socialist Unity Party (SED), the party that ruled former East Germany until 1989, The Left (Die Linke), and the new far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have seen their first-ever first place finish in a state election. Die Linke in 2019, and the AfD in 2024.\nSeptember 2024 state election.\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the largest party with 33% of the vote (and 36% of the seats), its best ever performance and the first time it placed first in a state election in Germany. The incumbent governing coalition suffered dramatic losses; the Left had split up, with new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) becoming the more popular part, while the remaining Left lost more than half of its support and fell to fourth place on 13%. The 130+ year old SPD, which since late 2021 rules Germany under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, recorded its worst result in any postwar state election, barely passing the electoral threshold of 5%. The other two parties of the traffic light coalition in Berlin, Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), did not pass the threshold and lost all of their seats, which contributed to the break-up of that coalition on November 6th. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) recorded small gains and came second with 24%. The newly-founded Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW debuted in third place at 16%.\nThe AfD in Thuringia became the first far-right party in Germany since World War II to win a state election. However, they were left out of the governing coalition, which is made up of the CDU, the BSW and the SPD, with the Left offering \"constructive opposition\" (basically they offer some input on the coalition's agenda and provide necessary votes).\nLocal government.\nThuringia is divided into 17 districts (\"Landkreise\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurthermore, there are five urban districts:\nEconomy.\nThuringia's economy is marked by the economic transition that happened after the German reunification and led to the closure of most of the factories within the Land. The unemployment rate reached a peak in 2005. Since that year, the economy has seen an upturn and the general economic situation has improved.\nAgriculture and forestry.\nAgriculture and forestry have declined in importance over the decades. Nevertheless, they are more important than in most other areas of Germany, especially within rural regions. 54% of Thuringia's territory is in agricultural use. The fertile basins such as the large Thuringian Basin or the smaller Goldene Aue, Orlasenke and Osterland are in intensive use for growing cereals, vegetables, fruits and energy crops. Important products are apples, strawberries, cherries and plums in the fruit sector, cabbage, potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes (grown in greenhouses), onions, cucumbers and asparagus in the vegetable sector, as well as maize, rapeseed, wheat, barley and sugar beets in the crop sector.\nMeat production and processing is also an important activity, with pigs, cattle, chickens and turkeys in focus. Furthermore, there are many milk and cheese producers, as well as laying hens. Trout and carp are traditionally bred in aquaculture in many villages.\nMost agricultural enterprises are large cooperatives, founded as Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft during the GDR period, and meat producers are part of multinational companies. Traditional private peasant agriculture is an exception, as is organic farming.\nThuringia's only wine-growing district is around Bad Sulza north of Weimar and Jena along the Ilm and Saale valley. Its production is marketed as Saale-Unstrut wines.\nForestry plays an important role in Thuringia because 32% of the Thuringian territory is forested. The most common trees are spruce, pine and beech. There are many wood and pulp-paper factories near the forested areas.\nIndustry and mining.\nLike most other regions of central and southern Germany, Thuringia has a significant industrial sector reaching back to the mid-19th-century industrialisation. The economic transition after the German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of most large-scale factories and companies, leaving small and medium-sized ones to dominate the manufacturing sector. Well-known industrial centres are Jena (a world centre for optical instruments with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik) and Eisenach, where BMW started its car production in the 1920s and an Opel factory is based today. The most important industrial branches today are engineering and metalworking, vehicle production and food industries. Especially the small and mid-sized towns in central and southwestern Thuringia (e.g. Arnstadt, Schmalkalden and Ohrdruf) are highly industrialised, whereas there are fewer industrial companies in the northern and eastern parts of the Land. Traditional industries like production of glass, porcelain and toys collapsed during the economic crises between 1930 and 1990.\nMining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages, especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau. Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong. On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900. These are the \"S\u00fcdharzrevier\" in the north of the state, between Bischofferode in the west and Ro\u00dfleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre, and the \"Werrarevier\" on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west. Together, they accounted for a significant part of the world's potash production in the mid-20th century. After the reunification, the \"S\u00fcdharzrevier\" was abandoned, whereas K+S took over the mines in the \"Werrarevier\". Between 1950 and 1990, uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union's need for this metal. The centre was Ronneburg near Gera in eastern Thuringia and the operating company Wismut was under direct Soviet control.\nGeneral economic parameters.\nThe GDP of Thuringia is below the national average, in line with the other former East German Lands. Until 2004, Thuringia was one of the weakest regions within the European Union. The accession of several new countries, the crisis in southern Europe and the sustained economic growth in Germany since 2005 has brought the Thuringian GDP close to the EU average since then. The high economic subsidies granted by the federal government and the EU after 1990 are being reduced gradually and will end around 2020.\nThe unemployment rate reached its peak of 17.1% in 2005. Since then, it has decreased to 5.3% in 2019, which is only slightly above the national average. The decrease is caused on the one hand by the emergence of new jobs and on the other by a marked decrease in the working-age population, caused by emigration and low birth rates for decades. The wages in Thuringia are low compared to rich bordering Lands like Hesse and Bavaria. Therefore, many Thuringians are working in other German Lands and even in Austria and Switzerland as weekly commuters. Nevertheless, the demographic transition in Thuringia leads to a lack of workers in some sectors. External immigration into Thuringia has been encouraged by the government since about 2010 to counter this problem.\nThe economic progress is quite different between the regions of Thuringia. The big cities along the A4 motorway such as Erfurt, Jena and Eisenach and their surroundings are booming, whereas nearly all the rural regions, especially in the north and east, have little economic impetus and employment, which is a big issue in regional planning. Young people in these areas often have to commute long distances, and many emigrate soon after finishing school.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in 2023 and was higher than the German average.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSource:\nTourism.\nTourism is an important branch of the economy. Thuringia has a number of well known destinations: Wartburg castle (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Classical Weimar (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Bauhaus Weimar (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Thuringian Forest, Oberhof or Rennsteig (ridge walk). City tourism with the centers of Erfurt, Weimar, Jena, Eisenach and M\u00fchlhausen is experiencing dynamic growth. A total of around 9.2 million overnight stays were booked in 2016, compared to 8.3 million ten years earlier. Around 6% of the bookings were made by foreign guests.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nAs Germany's most central state, Thuringia is an important hub of transit traffic. The transportation infrastructure was in very poor condition after the GDR period. Since 1990, many billions of Euros have been invested to improve the condition of roads and railways within Thuringia.\nDuring the 1930s, the first two motorways were built across the Land, the A4 motorway as an important east\u2013west connection in central Germany and the main link between Berlin and south-west Germany, and the A9 motorway as the main north\u2013south route in eastern Germany, connecting Berlin with Munich. The A4 runs from Frankfurt in Hesse via Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Dresden in Saxony, connecting Thuringia's most important cities. At Hermsdorf junction it is connected with the A9. Both highways were widened from four to six lanes (three each way) after 1990, including some extensive re-routing in the Eisenach and Jena areas. Furthermore, three new motorways were built during the 1990s and 2000s. The A71 crosses the Land in southwest\u2013northeast direction, connecting W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria via Meiningen, Suhl, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, Erfurt and S\u00f6mmerda with Sangerhausen and Halle in Saxony-Anhalt. The crossing of the Thuringian Forest by the A71 has been one of Germany's most expensive motorway segments with various tunnels (including Germany's longest road tunnel, the Rennsteig Tunnel) and large bridges. The A73 starts at the A71 south of Erfurt in Suhl and runs south towards Nuremberg in Bavaria. The A38 is another west\u2013east connection in the north of Thuringia running from G\u00f6ttingen in Lower Saxony via Heiligenstadt and Nordhausen to Leipzig in Saxony. Furthermore, there is a dense network of federal highways complementing the motorway network. The upgrading of federal highways is prioritised in the federal trunk road programme 2015 (\"Bundesverkehrswegeplan\" 2015). Envisaged projects include upgrades of the B247 from Gotha to Leinefelde to improve M\u00fchlhausen's connection to the national road network, the B19 from Eisenach to Meiningen to improve access to Bad Salzungen and Schmalkalden, and the B88 and B281 for strengthening the Saalfeld/Rudolstadt region.\nThe first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880. By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500\u00a0km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from Berlin to Munich. In 2017, a new high speed line will be opened, diverting long-distance services from these mid-19th century lines. Both ICE routes will then use the Erfurt\u2013Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, and the Berlin-Munich route will continue via the Nuremberg\u2013Erfurt high-speed railway. Only the segment west of Erfurt of the Frankfurt-Dresden line will continue to be used by ICE trains after 2017, with an increased line speed of 200\u00a0km/h (currently 160\u00a0km/h). Erfurt's central station, which was completely rebuilt for this purpose in the 2000s (decade), will be the new connection between both ICE lines. The most important regional railway lines in Thuringia are the Neudietendorf\u2013Ritschenhausen railway from Erfurt to W\u00fcrzburg and Meiningen, the Weimar\u2013Gera railway from Erfurt to Chemnitz, the Sangerhausen\u2013Erfurt railway from Erfurt to Magdeburg, the Gotha\u2013Leinefelde railway from Erfurt to G\u00f6ttingen, the Halle\u2013Kassel railway from Halle via Nordhausen to Kassel and the Leipzig\u2013Hof railway from Leipzig via Altenburg to Zwickau and Hof. Most regional and local lines have hourly service, but some run only every other hour.\nA few small airports are in Thuringia. In public transport is Erfurt\u2013Weimar Airport, used for charter flights to the Mediterranean and other holiday destinations. In private flights, Leipzig\u2013Altenburg Airport is a further key airport.\nInternational hub airports are Frankfurt Airport, Berlin Brandenburg Airport and Munich Airport in adjacent states.\nThuringia is the only state without barge or ship waterways; its rivers are too small to be navigable to them.\nEnergy and water supply.\nThe traditional energy supply of Thuringia is lignite, mined in the bordering Leipzig region. Since 2000, the importance of environmentally unfriendly lignite combustion has declined in favour of renewable energies, which reached an amount of 40% (in 2013), and more clean gas combustion, often carried out as cogeneration in the municipal power stations. The most important forms of renewable energies are wind power and biomass, followed by solar energy and hydroelectricity. Furthermore, Thuringia hosts two big pumped storage stations: the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station and the Hohenwarte Dam.\nThe water supply is granted by the big dams, like the Leibis-Lichte Dam, within the Thuringian Forest and the Thuringian Highland, making a drinking water exporter of Thuringia.\nHealth.\nHealth care provision in Thuringia improved after 1990, as did the level of general health. Life expectancy rose, nevertheless it is still a bit lower than the German average. This is caused by a relatively unhealthy lifestyle of the Thuringians, especially in high consumption of grains, industrial seed oils, refined carbohydrates and alcohol, which led to significant higher rates of obesity compared to the German average.\nHealth care in Thuringia is currently undergoing a concentration process. Many smaller hospitals in the rural towns are closing, whereas the bigger ones in centres like Jena and Erfurt get enlarged. Overall, there is an oversupply of hospital beds, caused by rationalisation processes in the German health care system, so that many smaller hospitals generate losses. On the other hand, there is a lack of family doctors, especially in rural regions with increased need of health care provision because of overageing.\nEducation.\nIn Germany, the educational system is part of the sovereignty of the L\u00e4nder; therefore each Land has its own school and college system.\nSchool system.\nThe Thuringian school system was developed after the reunification in 1990, combining some elements of the former GDR school system with the Bavarian school system. Most German school rankings attest that Thuringia has one of the most successful education systems in Germany, resulting in high-quality outcomes.\nEarly-years education is quite common in Thuringia. Since the 1950s, nearly all children have been using the service, whereas early-years education is less developed in western Germany. Its inventor Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel lived in Thuringia and founded the world's first Kindergartens there in the 19th century. The Thuringian primary school takes four years and most primary schools are all-day schools offering optional extracurricular activities in the afternoon. At the age of ten, pupils are separated according to aptitude and proceed to either the Gymnasium or the Regelschule. The former leads to the Abitur exam after a further eight years and prepares for higher education, while the latter has a more vocational focus and finishes with exams after five or six years, comparable to the Hauptschule and Realschule found elsewhere in Germany.\nThuringia is home to a K-12 international school in the city of Weimar, Thuringia International School (ThIS). The school was established in the year 2000 and is accredited by the Council of International Schools and authorised to offer the International Baccalaureate PYP, MYP and DP. Students who graduate from the school are able to gain admission to colleges and universities around the world.\nUniversities.\nThe German higher education system comprises two forms of academic institutions: universities and polytechnics (). The University of Jena is the biggest amongst Thuringia's four universities and offers nearly every discipline. It was founded in 1558, and today has 21,000 students. The second-largest is the Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau with 7,000 students, founded in 1894, which offers many technical disciplines such as engineering and mathematics. The University of Erfurt, founded in 1392, has 5,000 students today and an emphasis on humanities and teacher training. The Bauhaus University Weimar with 4,000 students is Thuringia's smallest university, specialising in creative subjects such as architecture and arts. It was founded in 1860 and came to prominence as Germany's leading art school during the inter-war period, the Bauhaus.\nThe polytechnics of Thuringia are based in Erfurt (4,500 students), Jena (5,000 students), Nordhausen (2,500 students) and Schmalkalden (3,000 students). In addition, there is a civil service college in Gotha with 500 students, the College of Music \"Franz Liszt\" in Weimar (800 students) as well as two private colleges, the Adam-Ries-Fachhochschule in Erfurt (500 students) and the SRH College for nursing and allied medical subjects (\"SRH Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Gesundheit Gera\") in Gera (500 students). The most recent institution of higher education in Thuringia is the Duale Hochschule Gera-Eisenach (1400 students), a cooperative state college founded in 2016 through a merger of the colleges (\"Berufsakademie\") in Gera and Eisenach.\nResearch.\nThuringia's leading research centre is Jena, followed by Ilmenau. Both focus on technology, in particular life sciences and optics at Jena and information technology at Ilmenau. Erfurt is a centre of Germany's horticultural research, whereas Weimar and Gotha with their various archives and libraries are centres of historic and cultural research. Most of the research in Thuringia is publicly funded basic research due to the lack of large companies able to invest significant amounts in applied research, with the notable exception of the optics sector at Jena.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He won two civil wars and was instrumental in establishing the Nicene Creed as the orthodox doctrine for Nicene Christianity. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule the entire Roman Empire before its administration was permanently split between the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. He ended the Gothic War (376\u2013382), but did so on terms disadvantageous to the empire, with the Goths remaining and politically autonomous within Roman territory, albeit as nominal allies.\nBorn in Hispania, Theodosius was the son of a high-ranking general of the same name, Theodosius the Elder, under whose guidance he rose through the ranks of the Roman army. Theodosius held independent command in Moesia in 374, where he had some success against the invading Sarmatians. Not long afterwards, he was forced into retirement, and his father was executed under obscure circumstances. Theodosius soon regained his position following a series of intrigues and executions at Emperor Gratian's court. In 379, after the eastern Roman emperor Valens was killed at the Battle of Adrianople against the Goths, Gratian appointed Theodosius as a successor with orders to take charge of the military emergency. The new emperor's resources and depleted armies were not sufficient to drive the invaders out; in 382 the Goths were allowed to settle south of the Danube as autonomous allies of the empire. In 386, Theodosius signed a treaty with the Sasanian Empire which partitioned the long-disputed Kingdom of Armenia and secured a durable peace between the two powers.\nTheodosius was a strong adherent of the Christian doctrine of consubstantiality and an opponent of Arianism. He convened a council of bishops at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, which confirmed the former as orthodoxy and the latter as a heresy. Although Theodosius interfered little in the functioning of traditional pagan cults and appointed non-Christians to high offices, he failed to prevent or punish the damaging of several Hellenistic temples of classical antiquity, such as the Serapeum of Alexandria, by Christian zealots. \nDuring the earlier part of his reign, Theodosius ruled the eastern provinces, while the west was overseen by the emperor Gratian (and nominally with Valentinian II, his young co-emperor). In 386, he married Valentinian's sister, Galla, the marriage arranged to consolidate Theodosius' political and military power. Theodosius sponsored several measures to improve Constantinople, his capital and main place of residence\u2014notably his expansion of the Forum Tauri, which became the biggest public square known in antiquity. Theodosius marched west twice, in 388 and 394, after Gratian and then Valentinian had been killed and replaced by the usurper Magnus Maximus and Eugenius. Theodosius's final military victory in September 394 made him ruler of the entire empire; he died however only a few months later and was succeeded by his two young sons (and by that stage co-emperors): Arcadius in the eastern half of the empire and Honorius in the west.\nTheodosius was said to have been a diligent administrator, austere in his habits, merciful, and a devout Christian. In the centuries after his death, Theodosius was regarded as a champion of Christian orthodoxy who decisively stamped out paganism; however, modern scholars tend to see this as an interpretation of history by Christian writers more than as an accurate representation of actual history. He is fairly credited with presiding over a revival in classical art that some historians have termed a \"Theodosian renaissance\". Although his pacification of the Goths secured peace for the Empire during his lifetime, their status as an autonomous entity within Roman borders caused problems for succeeding emperors. Theodosius has also received criticism for defending his own dynastic interests at the cost of two civil wars. His two sons proved weak and incapable rulers, and they presided over a period marked by foreign invasions and court intrigues, seriously weakening the empire(s). However, the descendants of Theodosius did rule the Roman world for the next six decades, and the east\u2013west division endured\u2014until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century.\nBackground.\nTheodosius was born in Hispania on 11 January, probably in the year 347. His father of the same name, Theodosius the Elder was a successful and high-ranking general (\"magister equitum\") under the western Roman emperor Valentinian I, and his mother was called Thermantia. The family appear to have been minor landed aristocrats in Hispania, although it is not clear if this social status went back several generations or if Theodosius the Elder was simply awarded land there for his military service. Their roots to Hispania were nevertheless probably long-standing, since various relatives of the future emperor Theodosius are likewise attested as being from there, and Theodosius himself was ubiquitously associated in the ancient literary sources and panegyrics with the image of fellow Spanish-born emperor Trajan. Theodosius, however, never again visited the Iberian peninsula after becoming emperor.\nVery little is recorded of the upbringing of Theodosius. The 5th-century author Theodoret claimed the future emperor grew up and was educated in his Iberian homeland, but his testimony is unreliable. One modern historian instead thinks Theodosius must have grown up among the army, participating in his father's campaigns throughout the provinces, as was customary at the time for families with a tradition of military service. One source says he received a decent education and developed a particular interest in history, which Theodosius then valued as a guide to his own conduct throughout life.\nCareer.\nTheodosius is first attested accompanying his father to Britain on his expedition in 368\u2013369 to suppress the \"Great Conspiracy\", a concerted Celtic and Germanic invasion of the island provinces. After probably serving in his father's staff on further campaigns, Theodosius received his first independent command by 374 when he was appointed the \"dux\" (commanding officer) of the province of Moesia Prima in the Danube. In the autumn of 374, he successfully repulsed an incursion of Sarmatians on his sector of the frontier and forced them into submission. Not long afterwards, however, under mysterious circumstances, Theodosius's father suddenly fell from imperial favor and was executed; it was at this time too that the future emperor felt compelled to retire to his estates in Hispania.\nAlthough these events are poorly documented, historians usually attribute this fall from grace to the machinations of a court faction led by Maximinus, a senior civilian official. According to another theory, the future emperor Theodosius lost his father, or his military post, or both, in the purges of high officials that resulted from the accession of the 4-year-old emperor Valentinian II in November 375. Theodosius's period away from service in Hispania, during which he was said to have received threats from those responsible for his father's death, did not last long, however, as Maximinus, the probable culprit, was himself removed from power around April 376 and then executed. The emperor Gratian immediately began replacing Maximinus and his associates with relatives of Theodosius in key government positions, indicating the family's full rehabilitation, and by 377 Theodosius himself had regained his command against the Sarmatians.\nTheodosius's renewed term of office seems to have gone uneventfully, until news arrived that the eastern Roman emperor, Valens, had been killed at the Battle of Adrianople in August 378 against invading Goths. The disastrous defeat left much of Rome's military leadership dead, discredited, or barbarian in origin, with the result that Theodosius, notwithstanding his own modest record, became the establishment's choice to replace Valens and assume control of the crisis. With the begrudging consent of the western emperor Gratian, Theodosius was formally invested with the purple by a council of officials at Sirmium on 19 January 379.\nReign.\nGothic War (376\u2013382).\nThe immediate problem facing Theodosius upon his accession was how to check the bands of Goths that were laying waste to the Balkans, with an army that had been severely depleted of manpower following the debacle at Adrianople. The western emperor Gratian, who seems to have provided only little immediate assistance, surrendered to Theodosius control of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum for the duration of the conflict, giving his new colleague full charge of the war effort. Theodosius implemented stern and desperate recruiting measures, resorting to the conscription of farmers and miners. Punishments were instituted for harboring deserters and furnishing unfit recruits, and even self-mutilation did not exempt men from service. Theodosius also admitted large numbers of non-Roman auxiliaries into the army, even Gothic deserters from beyond the Danube. Some of these foreign recruits were exchanged with more reliable Roman garrison troops stationed in Egypt.\nIn the second half of 379, Theodosius and his generals, based at Thessalonica, won some minor victories over individual bands of raiders. However, they suffered at least one serious defeat in 380, which was blamed on the treachery of the new barbarian recruits. During the autumn of 380, a life-threatening illness, from which Theodosius recovered, prompted him to request baptism. Some obscure victories were recorded in official sources around this time, however, and, in November 380, the military situation was found to be sufficiently stable for Theodosius to move his court to Constantinople. There, the emperor enjoyed a propaganda victory when, in January 381, he received the visit and submission of a minor Gothic leader, Athanaric. By this point, however, Theodosius seems to have no longer believed that the Goths could be completely ejected from Roman territory. After Athanaric died that very same month, the emperor gave him a funeral with full honors, impressing his entourage and signaling to the enemy that the Empire was disposed to negotiate terms. During the campaigning season of 381, reinforcements from Gratian drove the Goths out of the Diocese of Macedonia and Thessaly into the Diocese of Thrace, while, in the latter sector, Theodosius or one of his generals repulsed an incursion by a group of Sciri and Huns across the Danube.\nFollowing negotiations which likely lasted at least several months, the Romans and Goths finally concluded a settlement on 3 October 382. In return for military service to Rome, the Goths were allowed to settle some tracts of Roman land south of the Danube. The terms were unusually favorable to the Goths, reflecting the fact that they were entrenched in Roman territory and had not been driven out. Namely, instead of fully submitting to Roman authority, they were allowed to remain autonomous under their own leaders, and thus could remain a strong, unified community or force. The Goths now settled within the Empire would fight for the Romans, but largely as a national contingent, as opposed to being fully integrated into the Roman forces.\n383\u2013384.\nAccording to the \"Chronicon Paschale\", Theodosius celebrated his \"quinquennalia\" on 19 January 383 at Constantinople; on this occasion he raised his eldest son Arcadius to co-emperor (\"augustus\"). Sometime in 383, Gratian's wife Constantia died. Gratian remarried, wedding Laeta, whose father was a \"consularis\" of Roman Syria. Early 383 saw the acclamation of Magnus Maximus as emperor in Britain and the appointment of Themistius as \"praefectus urbi\" in Constantinople. On 25 August 383, according to the \"Consularia Constantinopolitana\", Gratian was killed at Lugdunum (Lyon) by Andragathius, the \"magister equitum\" of the rebel emperor during the rebellion of Magnus Maximus. Constantia's body arrived in Constantinople on 12 September that year and was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles on 1 December. Gratian was deified as .\nTheodosius, unable to do much about Maximus due to ongoing military inadequacy, opened negotiations with the Persian emperor Shapur III (r.\u2009383\u00a0\u2013\u00a0388) of the Sasanian Empire. According to the \"Consularia Constantinopolitana\", Theodosius received in Constantinople an embassy from them in 384.\nIn an attempt to curb Maximus's ambitions, Theodosius appointed Flavius Neoterius as the Praetorian Prefect of Italy. In the summer of 384, Theodosius met his co-emperor Valentinian II in northern Italy. Theodosius brokered a peace agreement between Valentinian and Magnus Maximus which endured for several years.\nTheodosius I was based in Constantinople, and according to Peter Heather, wanted, \"for his own dynastic reasons (for his two sons each eventually to inherit half of the empire), refused to appoint a recognized counterpart in the west. As a result he was faced with rumbling discontent there, as well as dangerous usurpers, who found plentiful support among the bureaucrats and military officers who felt they were not getting a fair share of the imperial cake.\"\nMiddle reign: 384\u2013387.\nTheodosius's second son Honorius was born on 9 December 384 and titled \"nobilissimus puer\" (or \"nobilissimus iuvenis\"). The death of Aelia Flaccilla, Theodosius's first wife and the mother of Arcadius, Honorius, and Pulcheria, occurred by 386. She died at Scotumis in Thrace and was buried at Constantinople, her funeral oration delivered by Gregory of Nyssa. A statue of her was dedicated in the Byzantine Senate. In 384 or 385, Theodosius's niece Serena was married to the \"magister militum\", Stilicho.\nIn the beginning of 386, Theodosius's daughter Pulcheria also died.. Her funeral oration was also delivered by Gregory of Nyssa. That summer, more Goths were defeated, and many were settled in Phrygia. According to the \"Consularia Constantinopolitana\", a Roman triumph over the Gothic Greuthungi was then celebrated at Constantinople. The same year, work began on the great triumphal column in the Forum of Theodosius in Constantinople, the Column of Theodosius. The \"Consularia Constantinopolitana\" records that on 19 January 387, Arcadius celebrated his \"quinquennalia\" in Constantinople. By the end of the month, there was an uprising or riot in Antioch (modern Antakya). The Roman\u2013Persian Wars concluded with the signing of the Peace of Acilisene with Persia. By the terms of the agreement, the ancient Kingdom of Armenia was divided between the powers.\nBy the end of the 380s, Theodosius and the court were in Milan and northern Italy had settled down to a period of prosperity. Peter Brown says gold was being made in Milan by those who owned land as well as by those who came with the court for government service. Great landowners took advantage of the court's need for food, \"turning agrarian produce into gold\", while repressing and misusing the poor who grew it and brought it in. According to Brown, modern scholars link the decline of the Roman empire to the avarice of the rich of this era. He quotes Paulinus of Milan as describing these men as creating a court where \"everything was up for sale\". In the late 380s, Ambrose, the bishop of Milan took the lead in opposing this, presenting the need for the rich to care for the poor as \"a necessary consequence of the unity of all Christians\". This led to a major development in the political culture of the day called the \u201cadvocacy revolution of the later Roman empire\". This revolution had been fostered by the imperial government, and it encouraged appeals and denunciations of bad government from below. However, Brown adds that, \"in the crucial area of taxation and the treatment of fiscal debtors, the late Roman state [of the 380s and 390s] remained impervious to Christianity\".\nCivil war: 387\u2013388.\nThe peace with Magnus Maximus was broken in 387, and Valentinian escaped to the east with Justina, reaching Thessalonica (Thessaloniki) in summer or autumn 387 and appealing to Theodosius for aid; Valentinian II's sister Galla was then married to the eastern emperor at Thessalonica in late autumn. Theodosius may still have been in Thessalonica when he celebrated his \"decennalia\" (the ten year anniversary of his coming to power) on 19 January 388. Theodosius was consul for the second time in 388. Galla and Theodosius's first child, a son named Gratian, was born in 388 or 389. In summer 388, Theodosius recovered Italy from Magnus Maximus for Valentinian, and in June, the meeting of Christians deemed heretics was banned by Valentinian.\nThe armies of Theodosius and Maximus fought at the Battle of Poetovio in 388, which saw Maximus defeated. On 28 August 388 Maximus was executed. Now the \"de facto\" ruler of the Western empire as well, Theodosius celebrated his victory in Rome on 13 June 389 and stayed in Milan until 391, installing his own loyalists in senior positions including the new \"magister militum\" of the West, the Frankish general Arbogast. According to the \"Consularia Constantinopolitana\", Arbogast killed Flavius Victor (r.\u2009384\u00a0\u2013\u00a0388), Magnus Maximus's young son and co-emperor, in Gaul in August/September that year. \"Damnatio memoriae\" was pronounced against them, and inscriptions naming them were erased.\nMassacre and its aftermath: 388\u2013391.\nThe Massacre of Thessalonica (Thessaloniki) in Greece was a massacre of local civilians by Roman troops. The best estimate of the date is April of 390. The massacre was most likely a response to an urban riot that led to the murder of a Roman official. What most scholars, such as philosopher Stanislav Dole\u017eal, see as the most reliable of the sources is the \"Historia ecclesiastica\" written by Sozomen about 442; in it Sozomen supplies the identity of the murdered Roman official as Butheric, the commanding general of the field army in Illyricum (magister militum per Illyricum). According to Sozomen, a popular charioteer tried to rape a cup-bearer, (or possibly Butheric himself), and in response, Butheric arrested and jailed the charioteer. The populace demanded the chariot racer's release, and when Butheric refused, a general revolt rose up costing Butheric his life. Dole\u017eal says the name \"Butheric\" indicates he might have been a Goth, and that the general's ethnicity \"could have been\" a factor in the riot, but none of the early sources actually say so.\nSources.\nThere are no contemporaneous accounts. Church historians Sozomen, Theodoret the bishop of Cyrrhus, Socrates of Constantinople and Rufinus wrote the earliest accounts during the fifth century. These are moral accounts emphasizing imperial piety and ecclesial action rather than historical and political details. Further difficulty is created by these events moving into legend in art and literature almost immediately. Dole\u017eal explains that yet another problem is created by aspects of these accounts contradicting one another to the point of being mutually exclusive. Nonetheless, most classicists accept at least the basic account of the massacre, although they continue to dispute when it happened, who was responsible for it, what motivated it, and what impact it had on subsequent events.\nTheodosius's role.\nTheodosius was not in Thessalonica when the massacre occurred. The court was in Milan. Several scholars, such as historian G. W. Bowersock and authors Stephen Williams and Gerard Friell, think that Theodosius ordered the massacre in an excess of \"volcanic anger\". McLynn also puts all the blame on the Emperor as does the less dependable fifth century historian, Theodoret. Other scholars, such as historians Mark Hebblewhite and N. Q. King, do not agree. Peter Brown points to the empire's established process of decision making, which required the emperor \"to listen to his ministers\" before acting. There is some indication in the sources Theodosius did listen to his counselors but received bad or misleading advice.\nJ. F. Matthews argues that the Emperor first tried to punish the city by selective executions. Peter Brown concurs: \"As it was, what was probably planned as a selective killing\u00a0... got out of hand\". Dole\u017aal says Sozomen is very specific in saying that in response to the riot, the soldiers made random arrests in the hippodrome to perform a few public executions as a demonstration of imperial disfavor, but the citizenry objected. \"The soldiers, realizing that they were surrounded by angry citizens, perhaps panicked\u00a0... and\u00a0... forcibly cleared the hippodrome at the cost of several thousands of lives of local inhabitants\". McLynn says Theodosius was \u201cunable to impose discipline upon the faraway troops\" and covered that failure by taking responsibility for the massacre on himself, declaring he had given the order then countermanded it too late to stop it.\nAmbrose, the bishop of Milan and one of Theodosius's many counselors, was away from court. After being informed of events concerning Thessalonica, he wrote Theodosius a letter offering what McLynn calls a different way for the emperor to \"save face\" and restore his public image. Ambrose urged a semi-public demonstration of penitence, telling the emperor he will not give Theodosius communion until this is done. Wolf Liebeschuetz notes that \"Theodosius duly complied and came to church without his imperial robes, until Christmas, when Ambrose openly admitted him to communion\".\nWashburn says the image of the mitered prelate braced in the door of the cathedral in Milan blocking Theodosius from entering is a product of the imagination of Theodoret who wrote of the events of 390 \"using his own ideology to fill the gaps in the historical record\". Peter Brown also says there was no dramatic encounter at the church door. McLynn states that \"the encounter at the church door has long been known as a pious fiction\". Wolf Liebeschuetz says Ambrose advocated a course of action which avoided the kind of public humiliation Theodoret describes, and that is the course Theodosius chose.\nAftermath and historical assessment.\nIt is only modern scholarship that has begun disputing Theodosius's responsibility for those events. According to the early twentieth century historian Henry Smith Williams, history's assessment of Theodosius's character has been stained by the massacre of Thessalonica for centuries. Williams describes Theodosius as a virtuous-minded, courageous man, who was vigorous in pursuit of any important goal, but by contrasting the \"inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica\" with \"the generous pardon of the citizens of Antioch\" after civil war, Williams nevertheless concludes that Theodosius was also \"hasty and choleric\". \nFrom the time Edward Gibbon wrote his \"Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire\", Ambrose's action after the fact has been cited as an example of the church's dominance over the state in Antiquity. Alan Cameron says \"the assumption is so widespread it would be superfluous to cite authorities. But there is not a shred of evidence for Ambrose exerting any such influence over Theodosius\". Brown says Ambrose was just one among many advisors, and Cameron says there is no evidence Theodosius favored him above anyone else.\nBy the time of the Thessalonian affair, Ambrose, an aristocrat and former governor, had been a bishop for 16 years, and during his episcopate, had seen the death of three emperors before Theodosius. These produced significant political storms, yet Ambrose held his place using what McLynn calls his \"considerable qualities [and] considerable luck\" to survive. Theodosius was in his 40s, had been emperor for 11 years, had temporarily settled the Gothic wars, and won a civil war. As a Latin speaking Nicene western leader of the Greek largely Arian East, Boniface Ramsey says he had already left an indelible mark on history.\nMcLynn asserts that the relationship between Theodosius and Ambrose transformed into myth within a generation of their deaths. He also observes that the documents revealing the relationship between these two formidable men do not show the personal friendship the legends portray. Instead, those documents read more as negotiations between the institutions the men represent: the Roman state and the Italian Church.\nSecond civil war: 392\u2013394.\nIn 391, Theodosius left his trusted general Arbogast, who had served in the Balkans after Adrianople, to be \"magister militum\" for the Western emperor Valentinian II, while Theodosius attempted to rule the entire empire from Constantinople. On 15 May 392, Valentinian II died at Vienna in Gaul (Vienne), either by suicide or as part of a plot by Arbogast. Valentinian had quarrelled publicly with Arbogast, and was found hanged in his room. Arbogast announced that this had been a suicide. Stephen Williams asserts that Valentinian's death left Arbogast in \"an untenable position\". He had to carry on governing without the ability to issue edicts and rescripts from a legitimate acclaimed emperor. Arbogast was unable to assume the role of emperor himself because of his non-Roman background. Instead, on 22 August 392, Arbogast had Valentinian's master of correspondence, Eugenius, proclaimed emperor in the West at Lugdunum.\nAt least two embassies went to Theodosius to explain events, one of them Christian in make-up, but they received ambivalent replies, and were sent home without achieving their goals. Theodosius raised his second son Honorius to emperor on 23 January 393, implying the illegality of Eugenius's rule. Williams and Friell say that by the spring of 393, the split was complete, and \"in April Arbogast and Eugenius at last moved into Italy without resistance\". Flavianus, the praetorian prefect of Italy whom Theodosius had appointed, defected to their side. Through early 394, both sides prepared for war.\nTheodosius gathered a large army, including the Goths whom he had settled in the eastern empire as \"foederati\", and Caucasian and Saracen auxiliaries, and marched against Eugenius. The battle began on 5 September 394, with Theodosius's full frontal assault on Eugenius's forces. Thousands of Goths died, and in Theodosius's camp, the loss of the day decreased morale. It is said by Theodoret that Theodosius was visited by two \"heavenly riders all in white\" who gave him courage.\nThe next day, the extremely bloody battle began again and Theodosius's forces were aided by a natural phenomenon known as the Bora, which can produce hurricane-strength winds. The Bora blew directly against the forces of Eugenius and disrupted the line. Eugenius's camp was stormed; Eugenius was captured and soon after executed. According to Socrates Scholasticus, Theodosius defeated Eugenius at the Battle of the Frigidus (the Vipava) on 6 September 394. On 8 September, Arbogast killed himself. According to Socrates, on 1 January 395, Honorius arrived in Mediolanum and a victory celebration was held there. Zosimus records that, at the end of April 394, Theodosius's wife Galla had died while he was away at war.\nA number of Christian sources report that Eugenius cultivated the support of the pagan senators by promising to restore the altar of Victory and provide public funds for the maintenance of cults if they would support him and if he won the coming war against Theodosius. Cameron notes that the ultimate source for this is Ambrose's biographer Paulinus the Deacon, whom he argues fabricated the entire narrative and deserves no credence. Historian Michele Renee Salzman explains that \"two newly relevant texts \u2013 John Chrysostom's Homily 6, \"adversus Catharos\" (PG 63: 491\u2013492) and the \"Consultationes Zacchei et Apollonii\", re-dated to the 390s, reinforces the view that religion was not the key ideological element in the events at the time\". According to Maijastina Kahlos, Finnish historian and Docent of Latin language and Roman literature at the University of Helsinki, the notion of pagan aristocrats united in a \"heroic and cultured resistance\" who rose up against the ruthless advance of Christianity in a final battle near Frigidus in 394 is a romantic myth.\nDeath.\nTheodosius suffered from a disease involving severe edema. He died in Mediolanum (Milan) on 17 January 395, and his body lay in state in the palace there for forty days. His funeral was held in the cathedral on 25 February. Bishop Ambrose delivered a panegyric titled \"De obitu Theodosii\" in the presence of Stilicho and Honorius in which Ambrose praised the suppression of paganism by Theodosius.\nOn 8 November 395, his body was transferred to Constantinople, where according to the \"Chronicon Paschale\" he was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles. He was honored . He was interred in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in his work \"De Ceremoniis\".\nMarriage and issue.\nTheodosius married twice. \nHis first wife was Aelia Flaccilla, married in 376 and dead in 386. By her he had three children: \nHis second wife was Galla, married in 387 and dead in childbirth in 394. By her he had other three children: \nHonorific.\nTheodosius was initially styled \"the Great\" simply as a way to differentiate him from his grandson Theodosius II. Later, at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the honorific was deemed merited due to his promotion of Nicene Christianity.\nVeneration.\nTheodosius the Great is venerated in Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches:\nEmperor (king) Theodosius is commemorated in Armenian Anaphora with saint kings: Abgar, Constantine and Tiridates.\nIn Eastern Orthodox Church he is commemorated as ktetor of Vatopedi and donator of Vatopedi icon of the Mother of God.\nArt patronage.\nAccording to art historian David Wright, art of the era around the year 400 reflects optimism amongst the traditional polytheists. This is likely connected to what Ine Jacobs calls a renaissance of classical styles of art in the Theodosian period (AD 379\u2013395) often referred to in modern scholarship as the \"Theodosian renaissance\". The \"Forum Tauri\" in Constantinople was renamed and redecorated as the Forum of Theodosius, including a column and a triumphal arch in his honour. The \"missorium\" of Theodosius, the city of Aprodisias's statue of the emperor, the base of the Obelisk of Theodosius, the columns of Theodosius and Arcadius, and the diptych of Probus were all commissioned by the court and reflect a similar renaissance of classicism.\nAccording to Armin Wirsching, two obelisks were shipped by the Romans from Karnak to Alexandria in 13/12 BC. In 357, Constantius II had one (that became known as the Lateran obelisk) shipped to Rome. Wirsching says the Romans had previously watched and learned from the Egyptians how to transport such large heavy objects, so they constructed \"a special sea\u2010going version of the Nile vessels ... \u2013 a double\u2010ship with three hulls\". In 390, Theodosius oversaw the removal of the other to Constantinople.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Linda Safran says that relocating the obelisk was motivated by Theodosius's victory over \"the tyrants\" (most likely Maximus Magnus and his son Victor). It is now known as the obelisk of Theodosius and still stands in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, the long Roman circus that was, at one time, the centre of Constantinople's public life. Re-erecting the monolith was a challenge for the technology that had been honed in the construction of siege engines.\nThe obelisk's white marble base is entirely covered with bas-reliefs documenting Theodosius's imperial household and the engineering feat of removing the obelisk to Constantinople. Theodosius and the imperial family are separated from the nobles among the spectators in the imperial box, with a cover over them as a mark of their status. From the perspective of style, it has served as \"the key monument in identifying a so-called Theodosian court style, which is usually described as a \"renaissance\" of earlier Roman classicism\".\nReligious policy.\nArianism and orthodoxy.\nIt is traditionally stated that the Arian Controversy, a dispute concerning the nature of the divine trinity, and its accompanying struggles for political influence, started in Alexandria during the reign of Constantine the Great between a presbyter, Arius of Alexandria, and his bishop, Alexander of Alexandria. However, \u201cmany of the issues raised by the controversy were under lively discussion \"before\" Arius and Alexander publicly clashed.\u201d \u201cThe views of Arius were such as \u2026 to bring into unavoidable prominence a doctrinal crisis which had gradually been gathering. \u2026 He was the spark that started the explosion. But in himself he was of \"no great significance\".\u201d\nIt is also traditionally stated that Alexander represented orthodoxy and that, when he died, his successor, Athanasius, became the representative of orthodoxy. In reality, \u201cNicene apologists \u2026 turn \u2018Arianism' into a self-conscious sect \u2013 as if the boundaries of Catholic identity were firmly and clearly drawn in advance. But the whole history of Arius and of Arianism reminds us that this was not so.\u201d (RW, 83) The Arian Controversy \"is not the story of a defence of orthodoxy, but of a \"search\" for orthodoxy.\"\nArius asserted that God the Father created the Son. This meant the Son, though still seen as divine, was not equal to the Father, because he had a beginning, and was not eternal. \"The controversy had spread from Alexandria into almost all the African regions and was considered a disturbance of the public order by the Roman Empire.\" (Eusebius of Caesarea in The Life of Constantine)\nConstantine had tried to settle the issues at the Council of Nicaea, but as Arnold Hugh Martin Jones states: \"The rules laid down at Nicaea were not universally accepted\". After the Nicene Creed was formulated in 325, many in the church reacted strongly against the word \"homoousios\" in the Creed, and therefore Councils at Ariminum (Rimini), Nike (southeast of Adrianople), and Constantinople, held in 359\u201360 by Emperor Constantius II, formulated creeds that were intended to replace or revise the Nicene Creed; in particular, to find alternatives for \"homoousios.\" These councils are no longer regarded as Ecumenical Councils in the tradition of the Church; their creeds, which are at odds with the Nicene Creed, are known as Arian Creeds.\nDuring this time, Athanasius was at the center of the controversy and became the \"champion of orthodoxy\" after Alexander died. To Athanasius, Arius's interpretation of Jesus's nature (Homoiousian), that the Father and Son are similar but not identical in substance, could not explain how Jesus could accomplish the redemption of humankind which is the foundational principle of Christianity. \"According to Athanasius, God had to become human so that humans could become divine ... That led him to conclude that the divine nature in Jesus was identical to that of the Father, and that Father and Son have the same substance\" (\"homoousios\"). Athanasius's teaching was a major influence in the West, especially on Theodosius I.\nOn 28 February 380, Theodosius, along with Gratian and Valentinian II, issued the Edict of Thessalonica, a decree addressed to the city of Constantinople, determining that only Christians who believed in the consubstantiality of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit could style themselves \"catholic\" and have their own places of worship officially recognized as \"churches\"; deviants were labeled heretics and described as \"out of their minds and insane\".\nRecent scholarship has tended to reject former views that the edict was a key step in establishing Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, since it was aimed exclusively at Constantinople and seems to have gone largely unnoticed by contemporaries outside the capital. For example, German ancient historian Karl Leo Noethlichs writes that the Edict of Thessalonica was neither anti-pagan nor antisemitic; it did not declare Christianity to be the official religion of the empire; and it gave no advantage to Christians over other faiths. It is clear from mandates issued in the years after 380 that Theodosius had made no requirement for pagans or Jews to convert to Christianity. Nonetheless, the edict is the first known secular Roman law to positively define a religious orthodoxy.\nAccording to Robinson Thornton, Theodosius began taking steps to repress Arianism immediately after his baptism in 380. On 26 November 380, two days after he had arrived in Constantinople, Theodosius expelled the Homoian bishop, Demophilus of Constantinople, and appointed Meletius patriarch of Antioch, and Gregory of Nazianzus, one of the Cappadocian Fathers from Cappadocia (today in Turkey), patriarch of Constantinople. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Ascholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness.\nIn May 381, Theodosius summoned a new ecumenical council at Constantinople to repair the schism between East and West on the basis of Nicene orthodoxy. The council went on to define orthodoxy, including the Third Person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, as equal to the Father and 'proceeding' from Him. The council also \"condemned the Apollonarian and Macedonian heresies, clarified jurisdictions of the bishops according to the civil boundaries of dioceses. and ruled that Constantinople was second in precedence to Rome.\"\nPolicy towards paganism.\nTheodosius seems to have adopted a cautious policy toward traditional non-Christian cults, reiterating his Christian predecessors' bans on animal sacrifice, divination, and apostasy, while allowing other pagan practices to be performed publicly and temples to remain open. He also voiced his support for the preservation of temple buildings, but nonetheless failed to prevent the damaging of many holy sites, images and objects of piety by Christian zealots, some including even his own officials. Theodosius also turned pagan holidays into workdays, but the festivals associated with them continued. A number of laws against paganism were issued towards the end of his reign, in 391 and 392, but historians have tended to downplay their practical effects and even the emperor's direct role in them. Modern scholars think there is little if any evidence Theodosius pursued an active and sustained policy against the traditional cults.\nThere is evidence that Theodosius took care to prevent the empire's still substantial pagan population from feeling ill-disposed toward his rule. Following the death in 388 of his praetorian prefect, Cynegius, who had vandalized a number of pagan shrines in the eastern provinces, Theodosius replaced him with a moderate pagan who subsequently moved to protect the temples. During his first official tour of Italy (389\u2013391), the emperor won over the influential pagan lobby in the Roman Senate by appointing its foremost members to important administrative posts. Theodosius also nominated the last pair of pagan consuls in Roman history (Tatianus and Symmachus) in 391.\nTemple destruction.\nContemporary archaeology has found that the area with the most destruction against temples by Christians took place in the territory around Constantinople in the diocese of Orientis (the East) under Theodosius's prefect, Maternus Cynegius, where archaeological digs have discovered several destroyed temples. Theodosius officially supported temple preservation, but Garth Fowden says Cynegius did not limit himself to Theodosius's official policy, but instead, commissioned temple destruction on a wide scale, even employing the military under his command for this purpose. Christopher Haas also says Cynegius oversaw temple closings, the prohibition of sacrifices, and the destruction of temples in Osrhoene, Carrhae, and Beroea.\nEarlier scholars believed Cynegius's actions were just part of a tide of violence against temples that continued throughout the 390s. However, recent archaeological discoveries have undermined this view. The archaeological evidence for the violent destruction of temples in the fourth and early fifth centuries around the entire Mediterranean is limited to a handful of sites. Temple destruction is attested to in 43 cases in the written sources, but only 4 of them were confirmed by archaeological evidence. Trombley and MacMullen say part of what creates this discrepancy are details in the historical sources that are commonly ambiguous and unclear. For example, Malalas claimed Constantine destroyed all the temples, then he said Theodosius did, then he said Constantine converted them all to churches. There is no evidence of any desire on the part of the emperor to institute a systematic destruction of temples anywhere in the Theodosian Code, and no evidence in the archaeological record that extensive temple destruction ever took place.\nTheodosian decrees.\nAccording to \"The Cambridge Ancient History\", the Theodosian Law Code is a set of laws, originally dated from Constantine to Theodosius I, that were gathered together, organized by theme, and reissued throughout the empire between 389 and 391. Jill Harries explains that, in their original forms, these laws were created by different emperors and governors to resolve the issues of a particular place at a particular time. They were not intended as general laws. Local politics and culture had produced divergent attitudes, and as a result, these laws present a series of conflicting opinions: for example, some laws called for the complete destruction of the temples and others for their preservation. French historian of Antiquity, Philippe Fleury, observes that \"Ammianus Marcellinus\" says this legal complexity produced corruption, forgery of rescripts, falsified appeals, and costly judicial delays.\nThe Theodosian Law Code has long been one of the principal historical sources for the study of Late Antiquity. Gibbon described the Theodosian decrees, in his \"Memoires\", as a work of history rather than jurisprudence. Brown says the language of these laws is uniformly vehement, and penalties are harsh and frequently horrifying, leading some historians, such as Ramsay MacMullen, to see them as a 'declaration of war' on traditional religious practices. It is a common belief the laws marked a turning point in the decline of paganism.\nYet, many contemporary scholars such as Lepelly, Brown and Cameron, question the use of the Code, a legal document, not an actual historical work, for understanding history. One of many problems with using the Theodosian Code as a record of history is described by archaeologists Luke Lavan and Michael Mulryan. They explain that the Code can be seen to document \"Christian ambition\" but not historic reality. The overtly violent fourth century that one would expect to find from taking the laws at face value is not supported by archaeological evidence from around the Mediterranean.\nEnd of paganism.\nThe picture of Theodosius as \"the most pious emperor\", who presided over the end of paganism through the aggressive application of law and coercion \u2013 a view which R. Malcolm Errington says \"has dominated the European historical tradition almost to this day\" \u2013 was first written by Theodoret who, in Errington's view, had a habit of ignoring facts and cherry picking. In the centuries following his death, Theodosius gained a reputation as the champion of orthodoxy and the vanquisher of paganism, but modern historians see this as a later interpretation of history by Christian writers rather than actual history.\nAn increase in the variety and abundance of sources has brought about the reinterpretation of religion of this era. According to Salzman: \"Although the debate on the death of paganism continues, scholars ...by and large, concur that the once dominant notion of overt pagan-Christian religious conflict cannot fully explain the texts and artifacts or the social, religious, and political realities of Late Antique Rome\".\nScholars agree that Theodosius gathered copious legislation on religious subjects, and that he continued the practices of his predecessors, prohibiting sacrifices with the intent of divining the future in December of 380, issuing a decree against heretics on 10 January 381, and an edict against Manichaeism in May of that same year. Theodosius convened the First Council of Constantinople, the second ecumenical council after Constantine's First Council of Nicaea in 325; and the Constantinopolitan council which ended on 9 July. What is important about this, according to Errington, is how much this 'copious legislation' was applied and used, which would show how dependable it is as a reflection of actual history.\nBrown asserts that Christians still comprised a minority of the overall population, and local authorities were still mostly pagan and lax in imposing anti-pagan laws; even Christian bishops frequently obstructed their application. Harries says, \"The contents of the Code provide details from the canvas but are an unreliable guide, in isolation, to the character of the picture as a whole\". Previously undervalued similarities in language, society, religion, and the arts, as well as current archaeological research, indicate paganism slowly declined, and that it was not forcefully overthrown by Theodosius I in the fourth century.\nMaijastina Kahlos writes that the fourth century Roman empire contained a wide variety of religions, cults, sects, beliefs and practices and they all generally co-existed without incident. Coexistence did occasionally lead to violence, but such outbreaks were relatively infrequent and localized. Jan N. Bremmer says that \"religious violence in Late Antiquity is mostly restricted to violent rhetoric: 'in Antiquity, not all religious violence was that religious, and not all religious violence was that violent'\".\nThe Christian church believed that victory over \"false gods\" had begun with Jesus and was completed through the conversion of Constantine; it was a victory that took place in heaven, rather than on earth, since Christians were only about 15\u201318% of the empire's population in the early 300s. Brown indicates that, as a result of this \"triumphalism,\" paganism was seen as vanquished, and Salzman adds that judging by the sheer number of laws, heresy was a much higher priority than paganism for Christians in the fourth and fifth centuries.\nLavan says Christian writers gave the narrative of victory high visibility, but that it does not necessarily correlate to actual conversion rates. There are many signs that a healthy paganism continued into the fifth century, and in some places, into the sixth and beyond. According to Brown, Christians objected to anything that called the triumphal narrative into question, and that included the mistreatment of non-Christians. Archaeology indicates that in most regions away from the imperial court, the end of paganism was both gradual and untraumatic. The \"Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity\" says that \"Torture and murder were not the inevitable result of the rise of Christianity.\" Instead, there was fluidity in the boundaries between the communities and \"coexistence with a competitive spirit.\" Brown says that \"In most areas, polytheists were not molested, and, apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence, Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable, even privileged, existence.\"\nWhile conceding that Theodosius's reign may have been a watershed in the decline of the old religions, Cameron downplays the role of the emperor's 'copious legislation' as limited in effect, and writes that Theodosius did 'certainly not' ban paganism. In his 2020 biography of Theodosius, Mark Hebblewhite concludes that Theodosius never saw or advertised himself as a destroyer of the old cults; rather, the emperor's efforts to promote Christianity were cautious, 'targeted, tactical, and nuanced', and intended to prevent political instability and religious discord.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is closely related to the Northern Sotho and Southern Sotho languages, as well as the Kgalagadi language and the Lozi language.\nTswana is an official language of South Africa and Zimbabwe. It is a lingua franca in Botswana and parts of South Africa, particularly North West Province. Tswana speaking ethnic groups are found in more than two provinces of South Africa, primarily in the North West, where about four million people speak the language. An urbanised variety is known as Pretoria Sotho, and is the principal unique language of the city of Pretoria. The three South African provinces with the most speakers are Gauteng (circa 11%), Northern Cape, and North West (over 70%). Until 1994, South African Tswana people were notionally citizens of Bophuthatswana, one of the bantustans of the apartheid regime. The Tswana language in the Northwest Province has variations in which it is spoken according to the ethnic groups found in the Tswana culture (Bakgatla, Barolong, Bakwena, Batlhaping, Bahurutshe, Bafokeng, Batlokwa, Bataung, and Batswapong, among others); the written language remains the same. A small number of speakers are also found in Zimbabwe (unknown number) and Namibia (about 10,000 people).\nHistory.\nThe first European to describe the language was the German traveller Hinrich Lichtenstein, who lived among the Tswana people Batlhaping in 1806 although his work was not published until 1930. He mistakenly regarded Tswana as a dialect of the Xhosa, and the name that he used for the language \"Beetjuana\" may also have covered the Northern and Southern Sotho languages.\nThe first major work on Tswana was carried out by the British missionary Robert Moffat, who had also lived among the Batlhaping, and published \"Bechuana Spelling Book\" and \"A Bechuana Catechism\" in 1826. In the following years, he published several other books of the Bible, and in 1857, he was able to publish a complete translation of the Bible.\nThe first grammar of Tswana was published in 1833 by the missionary James Archbell although it was modelled on a Xhosa grammar. The first grammar of Tswana which regarded it as a separate language from Xhosa (but still not as a separate language from the Northern and Southern Sotho languages) was published by the French missionary, E. Casalis in 1841. He changed his mind later, and in a publication from 1882, he noted that the Northern and Southern Sotho languages were distinct from Tswana.\nSolomon Plaatje, a South African intellectual and linguist, was one of the first writers to extensively write in and about the Tswana language.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nThe vowel inventory of Tswana can be seen below.\nSome dialects have two additional vowels, the close-mid vowels and . The circumflex on e and o in general Setswana writing is only encouraged at elementary levels of education and not at upper primary or higher; usually these are written without the circumflex.\nConsonants.\nThe consonant inventory of Tswana can be seen below.\nThe consonant is merely an allophone of , when the latter is followed by the vowels or . Two more sounds, v and \nz , exist only in loanwords.\nTswana also has three click consonants, but these are only used in interjections or ideophones, and tend only to be used by the older generation, and are therefore falling out of use. The three click consonants are the dental click , orthographically \u27e8c\u27e9; the lateral click , orthographically \u27e8x\u27e9; and the alveolar click , orthographically \u27e8q\u27e9.\nThere are some minor dialectal variations among the consonants between speakers of Tswana. For instance, is realised as either or by many speakers; is realised as in most dialects; and and are realised as and in northern dialects.\nThe consonant can exist at the end of a word without being followed by a vowel (as in Jwaneng and Barolong Seboni).\nStress.\nStress is fixed in Tswana and thus always falls on the penult of a word, although some compounds may receive a secondary stress in the first part of the word. The syllable on which the stress falls is lengthened. Thus, mosadi (woman) is realised as .\nTone.\nTswana has two tones, high and low, but the latter has a much wider distribution in words than the former. Tones are not marked orthographically, which may lead to ambiguity.\n go bua \"to speak\"\n go bua \"to skin an animal\"\n o bua Setswana \"He speaks Setswana\"\n o bua Setswana \"You speak Setswana\"\nAn important feature of the tones is the so-called spreading of the high tone. If a syllable bears a high tone, the following two syllables will have high tones unless they are at the end of the word.\n simolola &gt; \"to begin\"\n simolog\u00eala &gt; \"to begin for/at\"\nOrthography.\nTswana orthography is based on the Latin alphabet.\nThe letter \u0161 was introduced in 1937, but the corresponding sound is still sometimes written as \u27e8sh\u27e9. The letters \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f4\u27e9 are used in textbooks and language reference books, but not so much in daily standard writing.\nGrammar.\nNouns.\nNouns in Tswana are grouped into nine noun classes and one subclass, each having different prefixes. The nine classes and their respective prefixes can be seen below, along with a short note regarding the common characteristics of most nouns within their respective classes.\nSome nouns may be found in several classes. For instance, many class 1 nouns are also found in class 1a, class 3, class 4, and class 5.\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is widely considered to be the founder of morphophonology. He was also associated with the Russian Eurasianists.\nLife and career.\nTrubetzkoy was born into privilege. His father, Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy, came from the Lithuanian Gediminid princely family of Trubetskoy. In 1908, he enrolled at the Imperial Moscow University. While spending some time at the University of Leipzig, Trubetzkoy was taught by August Leskien, a pioneer of research into sound laws.\nAfter he graduated from the Moscow University (1913), Trubetzkoy delivered lectures there until the Russian Revolution, when he moved first to the University of Rostov-on-Don, then to the University of Sofia (1920\u20131922) and finally took the chair of Professor of Slavic Philology at the University of Vienna (1922\u20131938). Trubetzkoy was involved with the Eurasianist movement and became one of their leading theorists and political leaders. After the emergence of \"left Eurasianism\" in Paris, where some of the movement's leaders became pro-Soviet, Trubetzkoy, who was a staunch anti-communist, heavily criticised them and eventually broke with the Eurasianist movement.\nTrubetzkoy died from a heart attack attributed to Nazi persecution after he had published an article that was highly critical of Hitler's theories.\nLegacy.\nTrubetzkoy's chief contributions to linguistics lie in the domain of phonology, particularly in the analyses of the phonological systems of individual languages and in the search for general and universal phonological laws. His magnum opus, \"Grundz\u00fcge der Phonologie\" (\"Principles of Phonology\") was issued posthumously in which he defined the phoneme as the smallest distinctive unit within the structure of a given language. It was crucial in establishing phonology as a discipline separate from phonetics.\nTrubetzkoy also wrote as a literary critic. In \"Writings on Literature\", a brief collection of translated articles, he analyzed Russian literature beginning with the Old Russian epic \"The Tale of Igor's Campaign\" and proceeding to 19th-century Russian poetry and Dostoevsky.\nIt is sometimes hard to distinguish Trubetzkoy's views from those of his friend Roman Jakobson, who should be credited with spreading the Prague School views on phonology after Trubetzkoy's death.\nAs structuralist.\nIn his biography of the mathematical collective Nicolas Bourbaki, Amir Aczel described Trubetzkoy as a pioneer in structuralism, an interdisciplinary outgrowth of structural linguistics that would be applied in mathematics by the Bourbaki group, as in the notion of a mathematical structure, and in anthropology by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, who sought to describe rules governing human behavior. According to Aczel, Trubetzkoy's focus in \"Principles of Phonology\" was the study of phonemes and their opposing aspects to describe rules of language, the goal of describing general underlying rules being the common goal of structuralism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nygard thought it was a good idea and was surprised that it had not been done before. The first filming session took place at the Fantasticon science fiction convention at the Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles organized by William Campbell. Nygard felt that the footage from this first convention was good enough to warrant continuing with the project.\nRelease.\n\"Trekkies\" received a national release in the United States on May 21, 1999. It was in direct competition with \"\".\nReception.\nColin Covert gave three and a half stars in his review for the \"Star Tribune\", adding that it was likely to shake up the viewer's opinions of \"Star Trek\" fans. He praised the structure of the film, with the initial \"shock value\" of each fan being followed up with further background to round out the portrait. Renee Graham at the \"Boston Globe\" gave a similar opinion, saying that despite the expectation of the reviewer, none of the opinions put forward by \"Trekkies\" felt like a \"put-down\". She summed up the documentary by saying \"The Trekkie phenomenon may fall short of common definitions of normalcy, but as a film, '\"Trekkies\"' sure beats sleeping outside for days to see a mediocre movie about some galaxy far, far away.\"\nRegarding some of the film's more eccentric characters, \"The Tufts Daily\" film critic singled out Barbara Adams, a Star Trek uniform-wearing Trekkie that requests her fellow employees at Kinko's address her as \"Commander.\" Adams turns out to be the so-called \"Star Trek Juror,\" who was sworn-in as an alternate juror in the 1996 Clinton Whitewater hearings and wore her Starfleet uniform to court. Adams was ultimately dismissed from the Whitewater jury panel, not because of her Trek outfit, for being interviewed after court by the TV news program \"American Journal\" about her devotion to the \"Star Trek\" television series.\nAlso singled out by critics was mullet wearing, 15-year old computer expert Gabriel K\u00f6erner.\nBob Stauss, the film critic for the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" gave two and a half stars, saying that the documentary goes on too long and did not delve into the \"real psychological issues raised by such obsessive interest\". He added that the fans were \"amusing for about 15 minutes, tops\" and that the cumulative effect of watching the fans for that long was \"numbing\". James Verniere for the \"Boston Herald\" gave three stars, suggesting that Nygard may have found his niche as the \"Michael Moore of weirdness\" with this and his following film, \"Six Days in Roswell\". Verniere suggested that \"Trekkies\" wasn't as definitive as the film \"Free Enterprise\" (1999) but described it as an \"interesting, often hilarious piece of sociological comedy\". Alicia Potter, also at the \"Boston Herald\", described the film as \"surreally funny\".\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 86% from 42 reviews with the consensus: \"To fan or not to fawn over: this lifelong and prosperous journey into a sometimes cringeworthy world makes \"Trekkies\" the lovable center of its universe.\"\nSequels.\nIn 2004, a sequel was released, titled \"Trekkies 2\". This documentary travels throughout the world, mainly in Europe, to show fans of \"Star Trek\" from outside the United States. It also revisits memorable fans featured in the previous film.\nNygard sought to answer some of the criticism received from Trekkies in the sequel, in that he was accused of not showing \"normal\" fans. With this in mind, he attempted to include some degree of a description of what was normal fan behaviour and what was more unusual.\nIn an interview with TrekNews.net at the \"Star Trek Mission: New York\" convention in September 2016, Crosby talked about the potential for another documentary about \"Star Trek\":\nWe do want to make a Trekkies 3. In earnest, we\u2019re hoping to get started in two more years. We have to time it with the rights and all the legal stuff. There\u2019s a lot of politics involved. We approached CBS/Viacom/Paramount [who own various rights to Star Trek] already and there\u2019s interest. So fingers crossed. When producing these documentaries, I\u2019m always delighted by the surprise at something we didn\u2019t expect, such as the stories people tell and interacting with the fans, hearing stories. I never get tired of it...\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31139", "revid": "1314411303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31139", "title": "The Goodies", "text": "Trio of British comedians known for the TV series of the same name\nThe Goodies were a trio of British comedians: Tim Brooke-Taylor (17 July 1940 \u2013 12 April 2020), Graeme Garden (b. 18 February 1943) and Bill Oddie (b. 7 July 1941). The trio created, wrote for and performed in their eponymous television comedy show from 1970 until 1982, combining sketches and situation comedy.\nBeginnings.\nThe three actors met each other while undergraduates at the University of Cambridge, where Brooke-Taylor (Pembroke) was a law student, Garden (Emmanuel) was studying medicine and Oddie (Pembroke) was reading English. Their contemporaries included Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle, who later became members of Monty Python, and with whom they became close friends. Brooke-Taylor and Cleese studied together and swapped lecture notes, for they were both law students, but at different colleges within the university. All three Goodies became members of the Cambridge University Footlights Club, with Brooke-Taylor becoming president in 1963, and Garden succeeding him as president in 1964.\nIn 1965, Eric Idle succeeded Garden as Footlights Club president. Idle had initially become aware of the Footlights when he auditioned for a \"Smoking Concert\" at Pembroke College in front of Brooke-Taylor and Oddie.\nCareer before \"The Goodies\".\nBrooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie were cast members of the 1960s BBC radio comedy show \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", which also featured John Cleese, David Hatch and Jo Kendall, and lasted until 1973. \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\" resulted from the 1963 Cambridge University Footlights Club revue \"A Clump of Plinths\". After having its title changed to \"Cambridge Circus\", the revue went on to play in the West End in London, England, followed by a tour of New Zealand, then on Broadway in New York City (including an appearance on the \"Ed Sullivan Show\").\nThey also took part in various TV shows with other people, including Brooke-Taylor in \"At Last the 1948 Show\" (with Cleese, Chapman and Marty Feldman). Brooke-Taylor also took part in \"Marty\" (with Marty Feldman, John Junkin and Roland MacLeod). In 1968 Brooke-Taylor appeared with Cleese, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman in \"How to Irritate People\". Garden and Oddie took part in \"Twice a Fortnight\" (with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Jonathan Lynn), before Brooke-Taylor, Garden, and Oddie worked on the late-1960s TV show \"Broaden Your Mind\" (of which only about ten minutes survives).\n\"The Goodies\" television series.\nThe original BBC television series ran from November 1970 to February 1980 on BBC 2, with 67 half-hour episodes and two forty-five-minute Christmas specials. The series was created by Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, and originally co-written by all three, with Oddie providing the music for the show. Later episodes were co-written by Garden and Oddie.\nIt was one of the first shows in the UK to use chroma key and one of the first to use stop-motion techniques in a live action format. Other effects include hand editing for repeated movement, mainly used to make animals \"talk\" or \"sing\", and play speed effects as used in the episode \"Kitten Kong\". In the series, the threesome travelled on, and frequently fell off, a three-seater bicycle known to them as a 'trandem'.\nIn September 1978, the trio appeared in character in an episode of the BBC1 television game show \"Star Turn Challenge\", presented by Bernard Cribbins, in which teams of celebrities competed in acting games. Their opponents were three members of the cast of \"The Liver Birds\", Nerys Hughes, Elizabeth Estensen and Michael Angelis. They also presented the Christmas 1976 edition of \"Disney Time\" from the toy department of Selfridges store in London, broadcast on BBC1 on Boxing Day at 5.50\u00a0pm.\nThe Goodies never had a formal contract with the BBC, and when the BBC Light Entertainment budget for 1980 was exhausted by the production of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" TV series, the Goodies signed a contract with London Weekend Television (LWT) for ITV. However, after one half-hour Christmas special (\"Snow White 2\") in 1981, and a six-part series in early 1982, the series was cancelled. In later interviews the cast suggest the reasons were mainly economic, and that a typical Goodies sketch was more expensive than it appeared.\nAwards and nominations.\n\"The Goodies\" won the Silver Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or, held in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1972 for a special episode, based on the \"original\" 1971 Goodies' \"Kitten Kong\" episode, titled \"Kitten Kong: Montreux '72 Edition\". In the first episode of the next series, \"The New Office\", Tim Brooke-Taylor can be seen painting the trophy gold.\n\"The Goodies\" was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1972, losing to \"The Benny Hill Show\".\n\"The Goodies\" won the Silver Rose in 1975 at the Festival Rose d'Or for their episode \"The Movies\".\n\"The Goodies\" was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1976, losing to \"The Two Ronnies\".\nInternational releases and repeats of the TV series.\nBritain.\nUnlike many long-running BBC comedy series, \"The Goodies\" has not enjoyed extensive repeats on terrestrial television in the UK. In 1986, BBC2 broadcast the episode \"Kitten Kong\" during a week of programmes screened under the banner \"TV-50\", when the BBC celebrated 50 years of broadcasting. In the late 1980s the pan-European satellite-channel Super Channel broadcast a couple of episodes, and the short-lived Comedy Channel broadcast some of the later \"Goodies\" episodes in the early 1990s. Later UK Gold screened many of the earlier episodes, often with commercial timing cuts. The same episodes subsequently aired on UK Arena, also cut. When UK Arena became UK Drama, later UKTV Drama, \"The Goodies\" was dropped along with its other comedy and documentary shows.\nThe cast finally took matters into their own hands and arranged with Network Video for the release of a digitally remastered 'best of' selection entitled \"The Goodies ... At Last\" on VHS and Region 0 DVD in April 2003. A second volume, \"The Goodies ... At Last a Second Helping\" was released on Region 2 in February 2005. Series 9 (including the Xmas special) was released on Region 2 as \"The Goodies \u2013 The Complete LWT Series\" on 26 March 2007 and a fourth volume \"The Goodies ... At Last Back for More, Again\" was released on region 2 in 2010 as well as a DVD box set containing all four volumes to celebrate 40 years of \"The Goodies\".\nIn 2004, an episode of the BBC documentary series \"Comedy Connections\" was devoted to the Goodies. During Christmas that year, Channel 5 repeated the classic 1973 episode \"The Goodies and the Beanstalk\". Christmas 2005 saw a 90-minute \"Goodies\" special, a documentary about the series, \"Return of the Goodies\", broadcast on BBC Two.\nEarly in 2006, a single episode (\"Winter Olympics\") was broadcast on BBC Two. In February 2007, the 1982 LWT series was repeated on pay-TV channel Paramount 2.\nIn December 2010, BBC Two showed selected late-night repeats of the BBC series, which ran nightly from 23 to 30 December. This apparent gesture followed years of campaigning by The Goodies that the shows had not been repeated like other BBC shows such as \"Dad's Army\", \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\". The episodes shown were: \"Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms\" / \"Earthanasia\" / \"The Goodies and the Beanstalk\" / \"Kitten Kong\" / \"Lighthouse Keeping Loonies\" / \"Saturday Night Grease\" / \"The Baddies\" (a.k.a. \"Double Trouble\") and \"The Stone Age\", although \"Scoutrageous\", \"Kung Fu Kapers\" and \"Scotland\" (a.k.a. \"Loch Ness Monster\") were originally billed as episodes 1, 2 and 7 of the repeat run. The episodes garnered good ratings given their time slot, and the first six episodes were taken from the BBC's own master tapes, rather than the digital remasters, the rights to which are currently owned by Network Video. \"The Baddies\" and \"The Stone Age\" have never been digitally remastered.\nOn Sunday 8 June 2014, during a 1970s weekend, BBC Two repeated the Montreux '72 Edition of \"Kitten Kong\" once again; however, this has been the only episode to be repeated twice, and no full series have been repeated since.\nIn September 2018, Network released a box set titled \"The Goodies: The Complete BBC Collection\". This set contains every single episode from 1970-1980 (excepting the lost, original version of \"Kitten Kong\") and, as a bonus feature, a one-hour edit of the show \"An Audience with the Goodies\", hosted by Stewart Lee and filmed live at Leicester Square in June 2018.\nIn late September 2022 the TV channel 'That's TV' (numbered 183 on SKY TV listings and 65 on Freeview) started showing the BBC episodes, one episode every day, starting with series one episode one on 26 September at 21.40. Series 2 started airing at 21.45 on 5 October. Series 3 started airing at 21:40 on 11 October. Series 4 started airing at 21:30 on 17 October. Series 5 started airing at 21:30 on 24 October. Series 6 started airing at 21:30 on 6 November. Some episodes are being aired in poor quality and/or black &amp; White as the tapes were sadly wiped for reuse by the BBC in the 1970s. Although there is a message before each episode stating; 'This programme reflects the standards, language and attitudes of its time. Some viewers may find this content offensive', it seems that not all episodes are being aired - noticeably the 'Kitten Kong', 'Special Tax Edition' &amp; 'The Goodies Rule \u2013 O.K.?' specials, but also series 2 episodes 'Pollution', 'The Lost Tribe', 'Come Dancing', 'Gender Education, 'Charity Bounce' &amp; 'The Baddies', series 3 episode 'Superstar', series 4 episodes 'The Goodies and the Beanstalk' &amp; 'The Race', series 5 episodes 'Scatty Safari' &amp; 'South Africa' were not aired, with no notice or reason given.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the series has had continued popularity. It was especially popular when it was repeated through the 1970s and 1980s by the ABC. As the show was typically broadcast in the 25-minute 6:00 pm children's timeslot, portions often had to be cut. The 1981-82 LWT series was played once on the Seven Network in the early 1980s. The ABC screened the BBC episodes again in the early 1990s, but skipped several stories due to either inappropriate material for a children's timeslot, or a lack of colour prints at the time. The BBC episodes were then heavily edited to allow time for commercials when repeated on Network Ten in the 1990s, before moving to the pay television channel UK.TV during the late 1990s and early 2000s, where they were screened in full. ABC2 ran re-runs of the series, beginning in 2010.\nThree of the Goodies DVDs are available in Australia under different titles to the UK releases: \"The Goodies: 8 Delicious Episodes\", \"The Goodies: A Tasty Second Helping\" and \"The Goodies: The Final Episodes\", respectively. The Goodies' DVDs are also available in a boxed set with a commemorative booklet (\"The Goodies: The Tasty Box\"). This collection contains the same 16 episodes as the original two DVD releases but with additional material such as commentaries on several episodes and the original scripts of some episodes in PDF format. Picture quality has been greatly improved using digital restoration techniques and the episode \"Come Dancing\", which was originally thought to only have survived as a black-and-white film recording, is presented in colour from a 625-line low-band broadcast standard PAL VT recording, made for training purposes, which has had the low-level colour boosted. (The original Australian DVD release, \"The Goodies \u2013 A Tasty Second Helping\" (2 disc set), and \"The Goodies \u2013 A Second Helping: 4 tasty serves\" (1 Disc), featured the b/w telerecording of this episode.)\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the series was shown in on the CBC national broadcast network during the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the traditional \"after school\" time slot, later a Friday night 10\u00a0pm slot, and occasionally in a midnight slot. Several episodes were also shown on the CTV Television Network. In the mid-1970s it was shown on TVOntario on Saturday evenings, repeated on Thursday evenings, until it was replaced by \"Doctor Who\" in 1976.\nGermany.\nIn Germany in 1972, German TV screened the 13-part variety show \"Engelbert and the Young Generation\", a co-production between the BBC and German station ZDF in which The Goodies appeared in short 3-to-4-minute film sequences. The first six of these sequences were culled from the first and second series of \"The Goodies\": \"Pets\" (from \"Kitten Kong\"), \"Pop Festival\" (from \"The Music Lovers\"), \"Keep Fit\" (from \"Commonwealth Games\"), \"Post Office\" (from \"Radio Goodies\"), \"Sleepwalking\" (from \"Snooze\") and \"Factory Farm\" (from \"Fresh Farm Foods\"); and there were seven new film sequences, \"Good Deed Day\", \"The Gym\", \"The Country Code\", \"Street Entertainers\", \"Plum Pudding\", \"Bodyguards\" and \"Pan's Grannies\" \u2013 these also featured intro sequences with host Engelbert Humperdinck visiting the Goodies at their office. The shows were dubbed into German and because the Goodies part of the shows was more visual than dialogue-based, it translated very well.\nFive of these new films were also cut together, with a new story involving The Goodies filling out their \"Tax Evasion\" form, as a special 25-minute \"Goodies\" compilation episode, \"A Collection of Goodies\", first broadcast on BBC1 at 8.15\u00a0pm on 24 September 1972, and produced by Jim Franklin. \"The Country Code\" and \"Bodyguards\" were not used.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, the series was originally shown in full by the NZBC (later TV One) during the 1970s and 1980s. Since then, it has been re-run on SKY Network Television's Comedy Central.\nSpain.\nIn Spain, a couple of episodes of \"The Goodies\" were shown as part of a season of television-award-winning programmes (the Goodies were Montreux Festival winners) on TVE 2 entitled \"Festival TV\" in 1981.\nUnited States.\nIn the US, the series was shown widely in syndication during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has been little seen since. It was shown also on PBS stations, sometimes in tandem with \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\nBooks.\nGoodies books, written by the Goodies.\nIn their heyday The Goodies also produced successful books:\nGoodies songs.\n\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\" was released as a single credited to The Goodies in 1973, although it had been recorded in 1966 when they were part of \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\".\nThe first true Goodies album, \"The Goodies Sing Songs From The Goodies\", was released in 1973 and reissued as \"The World of the Goodies\" in 1974. \"The Goodies Theme\" was released as a single in 1973.\nThey had a string of successful chart singles penned by Bill Oddie. In 1974\u201375, they chalked up five hit singles in twelve months: \"The Inbetweenies\", \"Black Pudding Bertha\", \"Nappy Love\" and \"The Funky Gibbon\" (all performed during the episode \"The Goodies \u2013 Almost Live\"), and \"Make a Daft Noise for Christmas\".\n\"The Funky Gibbon\" was their biggest hit, reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The Goodies made an appearance on \"Top of the Pops\" with the song. They also performed it during the Amnesty International show \"A Poke in the Eye (with a Sharp Stick)\". \"The Funky Gibbon\" became a favourite in the United States on Dr. Demento's radio shows and reached number 79 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1975.\n\"The New Goodies LP\", which featured most of the hit singles, reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart in 1975.\nGoodies Theme.\nThree variations of the Goodies Theme were used on the opening titles for the 1970\u20131982 television series. Apart from the original Goodies Theme, used from 1970 to 1972 and released as a single, two other variations surfaced, one, with a contemporary feel from 1973\u20131974, sung by Bill and then the third and final theme for the rest of the series from 1975 onwards, again sung by Bill. This variation lasted for the rest of the TV series and also surfaced on later Goodies LPs and, eventually, singles.\nOther collaborations.\nTim Brooke-Taylor was a writer/performer on the television comedy series \"At Last the 1948 Show\" (which also included John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in the cast), in which Eric Idle and Bill Oddie guest-starred in some of the episodes. The famous \"Four Yorkshiremen\" sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor, John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman.\nTim Brooke-Taylor was a cast member of the television comedy series \"Marty\" with Marty Feldman and John Junkin \u2013 a compilation of the two series of \"Marty\" has been released on a DVD with the title of \"It's Marty\".\nBrooke-Taylor was also a cast member of John Cleese's special \"How to Irritate People\".\nAlong with John Junkin and Barry Cryer, Brooke-Taylor was a regular cast member of the long-running Radio 2 comedy sketch show \"Hello, Cheeky!\", which ran from 1973 to 1979. The series also transferred to Yorkshire Television for two series in 1975 and 1976.\nTim Brooke-Taylor also appeared on BBC's hospital comedy \"TLC\", as well as the sitcoms \"You Must Be The Husband\" (with Diane Keen and Sheila Steafel), and \"Me and My Girl\" (with Richard O'Sullivan and Joan Sanderson). He also played in a televised pro-celebrity golf match opposite Bruce Forsyth.\nGraeme Garden and Bill Oddie were writers/performers on the television comedy series \"Twice a Fortnight\" (which also included Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Jonathan Lynn in the cast).\nTim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were writers/performers on the television comedy series \"Broaden Your Mind\", with Bill Oddie joining them for the second series.\nThe three writers and performers also collaborated on the 1983 animated children's programme \"Bananaman\", where they played various voice roles.\nBill Oddie has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\", on which Garden and Brooke-Taylor are regular panellists.\nGraeme Garden and Bill Oddie worked on the television comedy \"Doctor in the House\": they co-wrote most of the first series and all of the second. Garden also appeared as a television interviewer in the series, in the episode titled \"On the Box\".\nBetween 1981 and 1983 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a science fiction sitcom called \"Astronauts\" for Central and ITV. The show was set in a British space station in the near future.\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show \"If I Ruled the World\". Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time \"The Goodies\" episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to refute this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more...it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\nIn 2004, Garden and Brooke-Taylor were co-presenters of Channel 4's daytime game show \"Beat the Nation\", in which they indulged in usual game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. Oddie hosts a very successful series of nature programmes for the BBC.\nGoodies reunion shows.\n2005 Australian reunion shows.\nThe trio reunited in Australia for \"The Goodies (Still A) Live on Stage\" as part of Sydney's Big Laugh Comedy Festival in March 2005. The show toured the country, visiting Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra and selling out most of the 13 performances.\nA further Australian tour by the Goodies, sans Bill, took place during November and December 2005.\n\"Return of the Goodies\" (2005).\nOn 30 December, BBC2 broadcast a feature-length special, featuring some new material by Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie, linking clips from the original television series and interview footage.\n2006 and 2007 UK reunion shows.\nTim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden took their Goodies Live show to the 2006 Edinburgh Fringe festival. The show was similar to the second leg of the Goodies Australian tour, with Bill Oddie participating via video (due to his many filming commitments). The show was also performed at the Paramount Comedy Festival in Brighton in October 2006.\nBrooke-Taylor and Garden performed the show at 22 further UK venues in 2007.\n2009 World's Funniest Island and Riverside.\nTim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden appeared at Sydney's Riverside Theatre (Parramatta) on 15 October 2009 and the World's Funniest Island comedy festival on Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour on 17\u201318 October 2009. The show was hosted by Andrew Hansen of Australian comedy team The Chaser.\n2010 The One Show.\nOn 4 November 2010, The Goodies were once again reunited when the BBC1 magazine and chat show \"The One Show\" brought them back together.\n2013: \"An Oldie but a Goodie\".\nBill Oddie toured Australia to present a series of one-man shows, \"An Oldie but a Goodie\", during June 2013. The tour took in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. A video with the three Goodies was shown during the shows.\nOn 19 June 2013, Oddie made personal appearances on both \"The Project\" and the \"Adam Hills Tonight\" television shows in conjunction with the tour.\n2019: \"The Big Ben Theory\".\nThe final time that The Goodies collaborated on a commercially available project was a single, hour-long audiobook created for Audible UK, entitled \"The Big Ben Theory\". Scripted by Gareth Gwynn and John-Luke Roberts, along with Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, and recorded in front of a highly appreciative live audience, the cast comprised Tim, Bill (an indisposed Graeme was replaced at the last minute by the project's originator and producer, Barnaby Eaton-Jones), Joanna Lumley, Philip Pope, Jon Culshaw and Kate Harbour, with direction from Dirk Maggs. Graeme Garden's own description reads \u2018As Parliament falls apart and sinister dictators threaten the world, Tim, Graeme and Bill must save the day. They defeated Kitten Kong! They stuffed the Funky Gibbon! They invented Ecky Thump! Can they save Parliament as well? 52% say yes. 48% say no. But you just can't rely on statistics, can you?!\u2019 The audiobook, released by Audible on 9 October 2019, was intended to be the pilot for a forthcoming series of new episodes to be written and recorded in 2020; however, the project ended with Tim Brooke-Taylor\u2019s death from complications from COVID-19 on 12 April that year in Cookham, Berkshire, aged 79.\nIn January 2022 it was announced that a series of novellas based on the planned Audible episodes was set to be published by Chinbeard Books, commencing with \"Avengers Dissemble\", adapted by producer and writer Barnaby Eaton Jones, with a foreword by Joanna Lumley, and based on material co-devised with the Goodies. The first book is dedicated to Tim Brooke-Taylor, 2 years since his death from COVID-19 complications and published with the backing of Tim's family and the 2 remaining Goodies: Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, with a percentage of the royalties going to the charity Tim was President of for over 25 years \u2013 Thames Valley Adventure Playground.\nCultural influence.\n\"The Mighty Boosh\" was started when Julian Barratt asked Noel Fielding if he wanted to make a modern-day Goodies.\nThe official Goodies fan club's (Goodies Rule-OK!) newsletter is called the \"Clarion &amp; Globe\". It was named after the newspaper in The Goodies' episode \"Fleet Street Goodies\" (a.k.a. \"Cunning Stunts\").\nDuring the 1970s, \"Cor!!\" comic, released by Fleetway publications, had a \"Goodies\" comics strip. When the comic later merged with \"Buster\", the \"Goodies\" did not move across, although the TV show was still running.\nAustralian rock band Spiderbait released a 1993 album and EP which contained a rocked-up fast cover version of the Goodies song \"Run\".\nAustralian theatre company Shaolin Punk produced a short play titled \"A Record or an OBE\", written by Melbourne comedian and actor Ben McKenzie, and featuring Tim and Graeme as characters. Set in 1975, the two remaining Goodies struggle to carry on after Bill leaves the group to pursue a music career. The play premiered in the 2007 Melbourne Fringe Festival, where it was highly commended in the Comedy category. Later seasons were also performed for the Adelaide Fringe and Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2008.\nU.S. rock band The White Stripes named their 6th album \"Icky Thump\" in reference to The Goodies sketch \"The Battle of Ecky Thump\". The name was changed from \"Ecky Thump\" to \"Icky Thump\" to make the title more palatable to an American teenage audience.\nHonours.\nAll three Goodies were awarded OBEs. Bill Oddie received his OBE in 2003 for wildlife conservation, while Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden received their OBEs in 2011 for services to light entertainment. The show often mocked OBEs: in particular, a running joke was that Tim desperately wanted to receive one.\nAwards.\nAll three Goodies have been regular attendees at Slapstick Festival in Bristol, and in 2011 they were awarded the Aardman Slapstick Visual Comedy Legend Award at the festival for the significant contributions to the field of visual comedy they have made during their careers.\nViewer incidents.\nOn 24 March 1975, Alex Mitchell, a 50-year-old bricklayer from King's Lynn, literally died laughing while watching an episode of \"The Goodies\". According to his wife, who was a witness, Mitchell was unable to stop laughing whilst watching a sketch in the episode \"Kung Fu Kapers\" in which Tim Brooke-Taylor, dressed as a kilted Scotsman, used a set of bagpipes to defend himself from a black pudding-wielding Bill Oddie (master of the ancient Lancastrian martial art \"Ecky-Thump\") in a demonstration of the Scottish martial art of \"Hoots-Toot-ochaye\". After twenty-five minutes of continuous laughter, Mitchell finally slumped on the settee and died from heart failure.

{"id": "31140", "revid": "3022076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31140", "title": "Divine Comedy", "text": "Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri\nThe Divine Comedy (, ) is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c.\u20091308 and completed around 1321, shortly before the author's death. It is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: \"Inferno\", \"Purgatorio\", and \"Paradiso\".\nThe poem explores the condition of the soul following death and portrays a vision of divine justice, in which individuals receive appropriate punishment or reward based on their actions. It describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas.\nIn the poem, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil, who represents human reason, and who guides him for all of \"Inferno\" and most of \"Purgatorio\"; Beatrice, who represents divine revelation in addition to theology, grace, and faith; and guides him from the end of \"Purgatorio\" onwards; and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother, guiding him in the final cantos of \"Paradiso\".\nThe work was originally simply titled Comed\u00eca (, Tuscan for \"Comedy\") \u2013 so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472 \u2013 later adjusted to the modern Italian . The earliest known use of the adjective appears in Giovanni Boccaccio's biographical work \"Trattatello in laude di Dante\" (\"Treatise in Praise of Dante\"), which was written between 1351 and 1355 \u2013 the adjective likely referring to the poem's profound subject matter and elevated style. The first edition to name the poem \"Divina Comedia\" in the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce, published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari.\nStructure and story.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" is composed of 14,233 lines that are divided into three \"cantiche\" (singular \"cantica\")\u00a0\u2013 \"Inferno\" (Hell), \"Purgatorio\" (Purgatory), and \"Paradiso\" (Paradise)\u00a0\u2013 each consisting of 33 cantos (Italian plural \"canti\"). An initial canto, serving as an introduction to the poem and generally considered to be part of the first \"cantica\", brings the total number of cantos to 100. It is generally accepted, however, that the first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the entire epic, and that the opening two cantos of each \"cantica\" serve as prologues to each of the three \"cantiche\".\nThe number three is prominent in the work, represented in part by the number of \"cantiche\" and their lengths. Additionally, the verse scheme used, \"terza rima\", is hendecasyllabic (lines of eleven syllables), with the lines composing tercets according to the rhyme scheme ABA BCB CDC DED... The total number of syllables in each tercet is thus 33, the same as the number of cantos in each \"cantica\".\nWritten in the first person, the poem tells of Dante's journey through the three realms of the dead, lasting from the night before Good Friday to the Wednesday after Easter in the spring of 1300. The Roman poet Virgil guides him through Hell and Purgatory; Beatrice, Dante's ideal woman, guides him through Heaven. Beatrice was a Florentine woman he had met in childhood and admired from afar in the mode of the then-fashionable courtly love tradition, which is highlighted in Dante's earlier work \"La Vita Nuova\". The Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux guides Dante through the last three cantos.\nThe structure of the three realms follows a common numerical pattern of 9 plus 1, for a total of 10. There are nine circles of the Inferno, followed by Lucifer contained at its bottom; nine rings of Mount Purgatory, followed by the Garden of Eden crowning its summit; and the nine celestial bodies of Paradiso, followed by the Empyrean containing the very essence of God. Within each group of nine, seven elements correspond to a specific moral scheme, subdivided into three subcategories, while two others of greater particularity are added to total nine. For example, the seven deadly sins that are cleansed in Purgatory are joined by special realms for the late repentant and the excommunicated. The core seven sins within Purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, subdivided into three groups corresponding to excessive love (Lust, Gluttony, Greed), deficient love (Sloth), and malicious love (Wrath, Envy, Pride).\nIn central Italy's political struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines, Dante was part of the Guelphs, who in general favoured the papacy over the Holy Roman Emperor. Florence's Guelphs split into factions around 1300\u00a0\u2013 the White Guelphs and the Black Guelphs. Dante was among the White Guelphs who were exiled in 1302 by the Lord-Mayor Cante de' Gabrielli di Gubbio, after troops under Charles of Valois entered the city, at the request of Pope Boniface\u00a0VIII, who supported the Black Guelphs. This exile, which lasted the rest of Dante's life, shows its influence in many parts of the \"Comedy\", from prophecies of Dante's exile to Dante's views of politics, to the eternal damnation of some of his opponents.\nThe last word in each of the three \"cantiche\" is \"stelle\" (\"stars\").\n\"Inferno\".\nThe poem begins on the night before Good Friday in the year 1300, \"halfway along our life's path\" (\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\"). Dante is thirty-five years old, half of the biblical lifespan of seventy (Psalms 89:10, Vulgate), lost in a dark wood (understood as sin), assailed by beasts (a lion, a leopard, and a she-wolf) he cannot evade and unable to find the \"straight way\" (\"diritta via\") to salvation (symbolised by the sun behind the mountain). Conscious that he is ruining himself and that he is falling into a \"low place\" (\"basso loco\") where the sun is silent (\"'l sol tace\"), Dante is at last rescued by Virgil, and the two of them begin their journey to the underworld. Each sin's punishment in \"Inferno\" is a \"contrapasso\", a symbolic instance of poetic justice; for example, in Canto XX, fortune-tellers and soothsayers must walk with their heads on backwards, unable to see what is ahead, because that was what they had tried to do in life:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAllegorically, the \"Inferno\" represents the Christian soul seeing sin for what it really is, and the three beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 for the sins of violence against one's neighbor, against oneself, and against God, art, and nature; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of fraud and treachery. Added to these are two dissimilar, spiritual categories: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ.\n\"Purgatorio\".\nHaving survived the depths of Hell, Dante and Virgil ascend out of the undergloom to the Mountain of Purgatory on the far side of the world. The Mountain is on an island, the only land in the Southern Hemisphere, created by the displacement of rock which resulted when Satan's fall created Hell (which Dante portrays as existing underneath Jerusalem). The mountain has seven terraces, corresponding to the seven deadly sins or \"seven roots of sinfulness\". The classification of sin here is more psychological than that of the \"Inferno\", being based on motives, rather than actions. It is also drawn primarily from Christian theology, rather than from classical sources. However, Dante's illustrative examples of sin and virtue draw on classical sources as well as on the Bible and on contemporary events.\nLove, a theme throughout the \"Divine Comedy\", is particularly important for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough (Sloth) or love that is too strong (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from the church and the Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten. \nAllegorically, the \"Purgatorio\" represents the Christian life. Christian souls arrive escorted by an angel, singing \"In exitu Israel de Aegypto\". In his letter to Cangrande (the authenticity of which is disputed), Dante explains that this reference to Israel leaving Egypt refers both to the redemption of Christ and to \"the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to the state of grace.\" Appropriately, therefore, it is Easter Sunday when Dante and Virgil arrive.\nThe \"Purgatorio\" demonstrates the medieval knowledge of a spherical Earth. During the poem, Dante discusses the different stars visible in the Southern Hemisphere, the altered position of the Sun, and the various time zones of the Earth. At this stage it is, Dante says, sunset at Jerusalem, midnight on the River Ganges, and sunrise in Purgatory.\n\"Paradiso\".\nAfter an initial ascension, Beatrice guides Dante through the nine celestial spheres of Heaven. These are concentric and spherical, as in Aristotelian and Ptolemaic cosmology. While the structures of the \"Inferno\" and \"Purgatorio\" were based on different classifications of sin, the structure of the \"Paradiso\" is based on the four cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues.\nThe seven lowest spheres of Heaven deal solely with the cardinal virtues of Prudence, Fortitude, Justice and Temperance. The first three spheres involve a deficiency of one of the cardinal virtues\u00a0\u2013 the Moon, containing the inconstant, whose vows to God waned as the moon and thus lack fortitude; Mercury, containing the ambitious, who were virtuous for glory and thus lacked justice; and Venus, containing the lovers, whose love was directed towards another than God and thus lacked temperance. The final four incidentally are positive examples of the cardinal virtues, all led on by the Sun, containing the prudent, whose wisdom lighted the way for the other virtues, to which the others are bound (constituting a category on its own). Mars contains the men of fortitude who died in the cause of Christianity; Jupiter contains the kings of justice; and Saturn contains the temperate, the monks. The seven subdivided into three are raised further by two more categories: the eighth sphere of the fixed stars that contain those who achieved the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love, and represent the Church Triumphant\u00a0\u2013 the total perfection of humanity, cleansed of all the sins and carrying all the virtues of heaven; and the ninth circle, or Primum Mobile (corresponding to the geocentricism of medieval astronomy), which contains the angels, creatures never poisoned by original sin. Topping them all is the Empyrean, which contains the essence of God, completing the nine-fold division to ten.\nDante meets and converses with several great saints of the Church, including Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Saint Peter, and St. John. Near the end, Beatrice departs and Bernard of Clairvaux takes over as the guide. The \"Paradiso\" is more theological in nature than the \"Inferno\" and the \"Purgatorio\". However, Dante admits that the vision of heaven he receives is merely the one his human eyes permit him to see, and thus Dante's personal vision.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" finishes with Dante seeing the Triune God. In a flash of understanding that he cannot express, Dante finally understands the mystery of Christ's divinity and humanity, and his soul becomes aligned with God's love:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nManuscripts.\nAccording to the Italian Dante Society, no original manuscript written by Dante has survived, although there are many manuscript copies from the 14th and 15th centuries\u00a0\u2013 some 800 are listed on their site.\nEarly translations.\nColuccio Salutati translated some quotations from the \"Comedy\" into Latin for his \"De fato et fortuna\" in 1396\u20131397. The first complete translation of the \"Comedy\" was made into Latin prose by Giovanni da Serravalle in 1416 for two English bishops, Robert Hallam and Nicholas Bubwith, and an Italian cardinal, Amedeo di Saluzzo. It was made during the Council of Constance. The first verse translation, into Latin hexameters, was made in 1427\u20131431 by Matteo Ronto.\nThe first translation of the \"Comedy\" into another vernacular was the prose translation into Castilian completed by Enrique de Villena in 1428. The first vernacular verse translation was that of Andreu Febrer into Catalan in 1429.\nEarly printed editions.\nThe first printed edition was published in Foligno, Italy, by Johann Numeister and Evangelista Angelini da Trevi on 11 April 1472. Of the 300 copies printed, fourteen still survive. The original printing press is on display in the \"Oratorio della Nunziatella\" in Foligno.\nThematic concerns.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" can be described simply as an allegory: each canto, and the episodes therein, can contain many alternative meanings. Dante's allegory, however, is more complex, and, in explaining how to read the poem\u00a0(see the \"Letter to Cangrande\") he outlines other levels of meaning besides the allegory: the historical, the moral, the literal, and the anagogical (compare to the four senses of Scripture).\nThe structure of the poem is also quite complex, with mathematical and numerological patterns distributed throughout the work, particularly threes and nines. The poem is often lauded for its particularly human qualities: Dante's skillful delineation of the characters he encounters in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise; his bitter denunciations of Florentine and Italian politics; and his powerful poetic imagination. Dante's use of real characters, according to Dorothy Sayers in her introduction to her translation of the \"Inferno\", allows Dante the freedom of not having to involve the reader in description, and allows him to \"[make] room in his poem for the discussion of a great many subjects of the utmost importance, thus widening its range and increasing its variety.\"\nDante called the poem \"Comedy\" (the adjective \"Divine\" was added later, in the 16th century) because poems in the ancient world were classified as High (\"Tragedy\") or Low (\"Comedy\"). Low poems had happy endings and were written in everyday language, whereas High poems treated more serious matters and were written in an elevated style. Dante was one of the first in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of humanity, in the low and \"vulgar\" Italian language and not the Latin one might expect for such a serious topic. Boccaccio's account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in Latin is still controversial.\nScientific themes.\nAlthough the \"Divine Comedy\" is primarily a religious poem, discussing sin, virtue, and theology, Dante also discusses several elements of the science of his day (this mixture of science with poetry has received both praise and criticism over the centuries). The \"Purgatorio\" repeatedly refers to the implications of a spherical Earth, such as the different stars visible in the Southern Hemisphere, the altered position of the sun, and the various time zones of the Earth. For example, at sunset in Purgatory it is midnight at the Ebro, dawn in Jerusalem, and noon on the River Ganges:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDante travels through the centre of the Earth in the \"Inferno\", and comments on the resulting change in the direction of gravity in Canto\u00a0XXXIV (lines 76\u2013120). A little earlier (XXXIII, 102\u2013105), he queries the existence of wind in the frozen inner circle of hell, since it has no temperature differentials.\nInevitably, given its setting, the \"Paradiso\" discusses astronomy extensively, but in the Ptolemaic sense. The \"Paradiso\" also discusses the importance of the experimental method in science, with a detailed example in lines 94\u2013105 of Canto\u00a0II:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Numbered verses/styles.css\" /&gt; style=\"counter-reset: versus 93;\"&gt;\"Paradiso\", Canto II\nA briefer example occurs in Canto XV of the \"Purgatorio\" (lines 16\u201321), where Dante points out that both theory and experiment confirm that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Other references to science in the \"Paradiso\" include descriptions of clockwork in Canto\u00a0XXIV (lines 13\u201318), and Thales' theorem about triangles in Canto\u00a0XIII (lines 101\u2013102).\nGalileo Galilei is known to have lectured on the \"Inferno\", and it has been suggested that the poem may have influenced some of Galileo's own ideas regarding mechanics.\nInfluences.\nClassical.\nWithout access to the works of Homer, Dante used Virgil, Lucan, Ovid, and Statius as the models for the style, history, and mythology of the \"Comedy\". This is most obvious in the case of Virgil, who appears as a mentor character throughout the first two canticles and who has his epic, the \"Aeneid\", praised with language Dante reserves elsewhere for Scripture. Ovid is given less explicit praise in the poem, but besides Virgil, Dante uses Ovid as a source more than any other poet, mostly through metaphors and fantastical episodes based on those in the \"Metamorphoses\". Less influential than either of the two are Statius and Lucan, the latter of whom has only been given proper recognition as a source in the \"Divine Comedy\" in the twentieth century.\nBesides Dante's fellow poets, the classical figure that most influenced the \"Comedy\" is Aristotle. Dante built up the philosophy of the \"Comedy\" with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. Dante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly from quotations in the works of Albertus Magnus. Dante even acknowledges Aristotle's influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno's structure by citing the \"Nicomachean Ethics\". In the same canto, Virgil draws on Cicero's \"De Officiis\" to explain why sins of the intellect are worse than sins of violence, a key point that would be explored from canto XVIII to the end of the \"Inferno\".\nChristian.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\"'s language is often derived from the phraseology of the Vulgate. This was the only translation of the Bible Dante had access to, as it was one the vast majority of scribes were willing to copy during the Middle Ages. This includes five hundred or so direct quotes and references Dante derives from the Bible (or his memory of it). Dante also treats the Bible as a final authority on any matter, including on subjects scripture only approaches allegorically.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" is also a product of Scholasticism, especially as expressed by St. Thomas Aquinas. This influence is most pronounced in the \"Paradiso\", where the text's portrayals of God, the beatific vision, and substantial forms all align with scholastic doctrine. It is also in the \"Paradiso\" that Aquinas and fellow scholastic St. Bonaventure appear as characters, introducing Dante to all of Heaven's wisest souls. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". Despite all this, there are issues on which Dante diverges from the scholastic doctrine, such as in his unbridled praise for poetry. \nThe Apocalypse of Peter is one of the earliest examples of a Christian-Jewish katabasis, a genre of explicit depictions of heaven and hell. Later works inspired by it include the Apocalypse of Thomas in the 2nd\u20134th century, and more importantly, the Apocalypse of Paul in the 4th century. Despite a lack of \"official\" approval, the Apocalypse of Paul would go on to be popular for centuries, possibly due to its popularity among the medieval monks that copied and preserved manuscripts in the turbulent centuries following the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The \"Divine Comedy\" belongs to the same genre and was influenced by the Apocalypse of Paul.\nIslamic.\nDante lived in a Europe of substantial literary and philosophical contact with the Muslim world, encouraged by such factors as Averroism (\"Averrois, che'l gran comento feo\" Commedia, Inferno, IV, 144, meaning \"Averrois, who wrote the great comment\") and the patronage of Alfonso\u00a0X of Castile. Of the twelve wise men Dante meets in Canto\u00a0X of the \"Paradiso\", Thomas Aquinas and, even more so, Siger of Brabant were strongly influenced by Arabic commentators on Aristotle. Medieval Christian mysticism also shared the Neoplatonic influence of Sufis such as Ibn Arabi. Philosopher Frederick Copleston argued in 1950 that Dante's respectful treatment of Averroes, Avicenna, and Siger of Brabant indicates his acknowledgement of a \"considerable debt\" to Islamic philosophy.\nIn 1919, Miguel As\u00edn Palacios, a Spanish scholar and a Catholic priest, published \"La Escatolog\u00eda musulmana en la Divina Comedia\" (\"Islamic Eschatology in the Divine Comedy\"), an account of parallels between early Islamic philosophy and the \"Divine Comedy\". Palacios argued that Dante derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter from the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi and from the Isra and Mi'raj, or night journey of Muhammad to heaven. The latter is described in the \"ahadith\" and the \"Kitab al Miraj\" (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before as \"Liber scalae Machometi\", \"The Book of Muhammad's Ladder\"), and has significant similarities to the \"Paradiso\", such as a sevenfold division of Paradise, although this is not unique to the \"Kitab al Miraj\" or Islamic cosmology.\nMany scholars have not been satisfied that Dante was influenced by the \"Kitab al Miraj\". The 20th-century Orientalist Francesco Gabrieli expressed skepticism regarding the claimed similarities, and the lack of evidence of a vehicle through which it could have been transmitted to Dante. The Italian philologist Maria Corti pointed out that, during his stay at the court of Alfonso\u00a0X, Dante's mentor Brunetto Latini met Bonaventura de Siena, a Tuscan who had translated the \"Kitab al Miraj\" from Arabic into Latin. Corti speculates that Brunetto may have provided a copy of that work to Dante. Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, a Sufi convert and scholar of Ibn Arabi, confirms in \"The Esoterism of Dante\" the theory of the Islamic influence (direct or indirect) on Dante. Palacios' theory that Dante was influenced by Ibn Arabi was satirised by the Turkish academic Orhan Pamuk in his novel \"The Black Book\".\nIn addition to that, it has been claimed that \"Ris\u0101lat al-Ghufr\u0101n\" (\"The Epistle of Forgiveness\"), a satirical work mixing Arabic poetry and prose written by Abu al-\u02bfAla\u02be al-Ma\u02bfarri around 1033 CE, had an influence on, or even inspired, Dante's \"Divine Comedy\".\nCriticism and textual history.\nCritical reception of the \"Divine Comedy\" has varied considerably prior to its universal renown today. Although recognised as a masterpiece in the centuries immediately following its publication, the work largely fell into obscurity during the Enlightenment, with some notable exceptions: Vittorio Alfieri; Antoine de Rivarol, who translated the \"Inferno\" into French; and Giambattista Vico, who in the \"Scienza nuova\" and in the \"Giudizio su Dante\" inaugurated what would later become the romantic reappraisal of Dante, juxtaposing him to Homer.\nThe \"Comedy\" was \"rediscovered\" in the English-speaking world by William Blake\u00a0\u2013 who illustrated several passages of the epic\u00a0\u2013 and the Romantic writers of the 19th century. Later authors such as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Samuel Beckett, C. S. Lewis and James Joyce have drawn on it for inspiration. The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was its first American translator, and modern poets, including Seamus Heaney, Robert Pinsky, John Ciardi, W. S. Merwin, and Stanley Lombardo, have also produced translations of all or parts of the book. In Russia, beyond Alexander Pushkin's translation of a few tercets, Osip Mandelstam's late poetry has been said to bear the mark of a \"tormented meditation\" on the \"Comedy\". In 1934, Mandelstam gave a modern reading of the poem in his labyrinthine \"Conversation on Dante\". Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance, as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues, concluding that this, along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" inaugurated literary realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction. In T. S. Eliot's estimation, \"Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them. There is no third.\" For Jorge Luis Borges the \"Divine Comedy\" was \"the best book literature has achieved\".\nThe \"Comedy\" is considered one originator of the encyclopedic novel across multiple formulations of the concept. Mendelson's coinage of the term contrasted Dante's initial ostracism with his later importance to Italian national identity, comparing this to the culture-building function of later encyclopedic authors like Shakespeare, Cervantes, or Melville.\nEnglish translations.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" has been translated into English more times than any other language, and new English translations of the \"Divine Comedy\" continue to be published regularly. Notable English translations of the complete poem include the following.\nA number of other translators, such as Robert Pinsky, have translated the \"Inferno\" only.\nIn popular culture.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" has been a source of inspiration for countless artists for almost seven centuries. There are many references to Dante's work in literature. In music, Franz Liszt was one of many composers to write works based on the \"Divine Comedy\". In contemporary music, Hozier's 2023 album Unreal Unearth also draws inspiration from Dante's epic. In sculpture, the work of Auguste Rodin includes themes from Dante. Sculptor Timothy Schmalz created a series of 100 sculptures, one for each canto, on the 700th anniversary of the date of Dante's death, and many visual artists have illustrated Dante's work, as shown by the examples above. There have also been many references to the \"Divine Comedy\" in cinema, television, comics and video games.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since the current organisation's creation in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority (GLA), TfL has been responsible for operating multiple urban rail networks, including the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway, as well as London's buses, taxis, principal road routes, cycling provision, trams, and river services. It does not control all National Rail services in London, although it is responsible for London Overground and Elizabeth line services. The underlying services are provided by a mixture of wholly owned subsidiary companies (principally London Underground), by private-sector franchisees (the remaining rail services, trams and most buses) and by licencees (some buses, taxis and river services). Fares are controlled by TfL, rail services fares calculated using numbered zones across the capital.\nTfL has overseen various initiatives and infrastructure projects. Throughout the 2000s, a new radio communication system was implemented across its underground lines. Passenger convenience systems, such as the Oyster card and contactless payments, were also provisioned around this time. During 2008, the consumption of alcohol was banned on TfL services; this move has led to a decrease in anti-social behaviour. On 16 August 2016, TfL oversaw the launch of the Night Tube scheme, which introduced through-the-night services on both the London Underground and London Overground. Perhaps the biggest undertaking it has been responsible for, in this case shared jointly with the national Department for Transport (DfT), was the commissioning of the Crossrail Project; since its completion in 2022, TfL has been responsible for franchising its operation as the Elizabeth line.\nIn addition to the GLA, the central British government used to provide regular funding for TfL. However, this was tapered off during the 2010s with the aim of the organisation becoming self-sufficient. Direct central government funding for operations ceased during 2018. During 2019\u20132020, TfL had a budget of \u00a310.3\u00a0billion, 47% of which came from fares; the remainder came from grants, mainly from the GLA (33%), borrowing (8%), congestion charging and other income (12%). In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, fare revenues dropped by 90% and TfL obtained multiple rounds of support from the British government. It also responded with various cutbacks, including a proposal for a 40% reduction in capital expenditure.\nHistory.\nLondon's transportation system was unified in 1933, with the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board, which was succeeded by London Transport Executive, London Transport Board, London Transport Executive (GLC), and London Regional Transport. From 1933 until 2000, these bodies used the London Transport brand.\nTransport for London was created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority (GLA) by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. The first Commissioner of TfL was Bob Kiley. The first chair was then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, and the first deputy chair was Dave Wetzel. Livingstone and Wetzel remained in office until the election of Boris Johnson as Mayor in 2008. Johnson took over as chairman, and in February 2009 fellow-Conservative Daniel Moylan was appointed as his deputy.\nTransport for London Corporate Archives holds business records for TfL and its predecessor bodies and transport companies. Some early records are also held on behalf of TfL Corporate Archives at the London Metropolitan Archives.\nOn 17 February 2003, the London congestion charge was introduced, covering the approximate area of the London Inner Ring Road. The congestion charge had been a manifesto promise by Ken Livingstone during the 2000 London Mayoral election. It was introduced to reduce congestion in the centre of the capital as well as to make London more attractive to business investment; the resulting revenue was to be invested in London's transport system. At the time of its implementation, the scheme was the largest ever undertaken by a capital city.\nDuring 2003, TfL took over responsibility for the London Underground, after terms for a controversial public-private partnership (PPP) maintenance contract had been agreed. While the Underground trains themselves were operated by the public sector, the infrastructure (track, trains, tunnels, signals, and stations) were to be leased to private firms for 30 years, during which these companies would implement various improvements. The two consortiums awarded contracts were Tube Lines and Metronet. In July 2007, following financial difficulties, Metronet was placed in administration and its responsibilities were transferred back into public ownership under TfL in May 2008. During 2009, Tube Lines, having encountered a funding shortfall for its upgrades, was denied a request to TfL for an additional \u00a31.75billion; the matter was instead referred to the PPP arbiter, who stated that \u00a3400million should be provided. On 7 May 2010, Transport for London agreed to buy out Bechtel and Amey (Ferrovial), the shareholders of Tube Lines for \u00a3310million, formally ending the PPP.\nTfL was heavily impacted by multiple bombings on the underground and bus systems on 7 July 2005. Numerous TfL staff were recognised in the 2006 New Year honours list for the actions taken on that day, including aiding survivors, removing bodies, and restoring the transport system so that millions of commuters were able to depart London at the end of the workday. The incident was heavily scrutinised, leading to various long term changes being proposed by groups such as London Assembly, including the accelerated implementation of underground radio connectivity.\nOn 20 February 2006, the DfT announced that TfL would take over management of services then provided by Silverlink Metro. On 5 September 2006, the London Overground branding was announced, and it was confirmed that the extended East London line would be included. On 11 November 2007, TfL took over the North London Railway routes from Silverlink Metro. At the launch, TfL undertook to revamp the routes by improving service frequencies and station facilities, staffing all stations, introducing new rolling stock and allowing Oyster pay as you go throughout the network from the outset. This launch was accompanied by a marketing campaign entitled \"London's new train set\", with posters and leaflets carrying an image of model railway packaging containing new Overground trains, tracks and staff.\nOn 1 June 2008, the drinking of alcoholic beverages was banned on Tube and London Overground trains, buses, trams, Docklands Light Railway and all stations operated by TfL across London but not those operated by other rail companies. Carrying open containers of alcohol was also banned on public transport operated by TfL. The then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson and TfL announced the ban with the intention of providing a safer and more pleasant experience for passengers. There were \"Last Round on the Underground\" parties on the night before the ban came into force. Passengers refusing to observe the ban may be refused travel and asked to leave the premises. The GLA reported in 2011 that assaults on London Underground staff had fallen by 15% since the introduction of the ban.\nBetween 2008 and 2022, TfL was engaged in the Crossrail programme to construct a new high-frequency hybrid urban\u2013suburban rail service across London and into its suburbs. TfL Rail took over Heathrow Connect services from Paddington to Heathrow in May 2018. In August 2018, four months before the scheduled opening of the core section of the Elizabeth line, it was announced that completion had been delayed and that the line would not open before autumn 2019. Further postponements ensued. Having an initial budget of \u00a314.8billion, the total cost of Crossrail rose to \u00a318.25billion by November 2019, and increased further to \u00a318.8billion by December 2020. On 17 May 2022, the line was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in honour of her Platinum Jubilee.\nTfL commissioned a survey in 2013 which showed that 15% of women using public transport in London had been the subject of some form of unwanted sexual behaviour but that 90% of incidents were not reported to the police. In an effort to reduce sexual offences and increase reporting, TfL\u2014in conjunction with the British Transport Police, Metropolitan Police Service, and City of London Police\u2014launched Project Guardian. In 2014, TfL launched the 100 years of women in transport campaign in partnership with the Department for Transport, Crossrail, Network Rail, the Women's Engineering Society and the Women's Transportation Seminar (WTS). The programme was a celebration of the significant role that women had played in transport over the previous 100 years, following the centennial anniversary of the First World War, when 100,000 women entered the transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service.\nAs early as 2014, an Ultra\u2013Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) was under consideration since 2014 under London Mayor Boris Johnson. Johnson announced in 2015 that the zone covering the same areas as the congestion charge would come into operation in September 2020. Sadiq Khan, Johnson's successor, introduced an emissions surcharge, called the Toxicity Charge or \"T-Charge\", for non-compliant vehicles from 2017. The Toxicity Charge was replaced by the Ultra Low Emission Zone on 8 April 2019, which was introduced ahead of schedule. On 29 August 2023, the ULEZ was expanded to cover all 32 London boroughs, bringing an additional five million people into the zone.\nDuring 2020, passenger numbers, along with associated revenue, went into a sharp downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In response, TfL services were reduced; specifically, all Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo &amp; City line, were suspended from 20 March, while 40 tube stations were closed on the same day. The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to only use public transport if absolutely essential so that it could be used by critical workers. The London Underground brought in new measures on 25 March to combat the spread of the virus; these included slowing the flow of passengers onto platforms via the imposition of queuing at ticket gates and turning off some escalators. In April, TfL trialled changes encouraging passengers to board London buses by the middle doors to lessen the risks to drivers, after the deaths of 14 TfL workers including nine drivers. This measure was extended to all routes on 20 April, and passengers were no longer required to pay, so that they did not need to use the card reader near the driver.\nOrganisation.\nTfL is controlled by a board whose members are appointed by the Mayor of London, a position held by Sadiq Khan since May 2016. The Commissioner of Transport for London reports to the Board and leads a management team with individual functional responsibilities.\nThe body is organised in two main directorates and corporate services, each with responsibility for different aspects and modes of transport. The two main directorates are:\nOperations centre.\nTfL's Surface Transport and Traffic Operations Centre (STTOC) was officially opened by the then Prince Andrew, Duke of York (later Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor), in November 2009. The centre monitors and coordinates official responses to traffic congestion, incidents and major events in London. Network Management Control Centre (manages the bus network) (NMCC), London Streets Traffic Control Centre (LSTCC) and the Metropolitan Police Traffic Operation Control Centre (MetroComm) were brought together under STTOC.\nSTTOC played an important part in the security and smooth running of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The London Underground Network Operations Centre is now located on the fifth floor of Palestra and not within STTOC. The centre featured in the 2013 BBC Two documentary series \"\".\nPlaces for London.\nPlaces for London, is the property-owning arm of Transport for London. Launched in 2015, it was re-branded as Places for London in 2023, as part of a programme of homebuilding. As of 2024[ [update]], it owns and manages over of land throughout London, making it one of the city's largest landowners. Places for London plans to build 20,000 new homes across London by the 2030s, with around half of them being affordable housing. TfL plans to reinvest profits made by Places for London back into the transport network, similar to the Rail + Property model used by the MTR Corporation in Hong Kong.\nConnect project.\nTransport for London introduced the \"Connect\" project for radio communications during the 2000s, to improve radio connections for London Underground staff and the emergency services. The system replaced various separate radio systems for each tube line, and was funded under a private finance initiative. The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with Motorola as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are Thales Group (33 per cent), Fluor Corporation (18%), Motorola (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and HSBC (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32\u00a0billion over twenty years. Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the King's Cross fire disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006, the London Assembly published the 7 July Review Committee report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.\nThe East London line was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface. That same year, it was rolled out to the District, Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and Victoria lines, with the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Jubilee, Waterloo &amp; City and Central lines following during 2007. The final line, the Northern, was handed over in November 2008.\nThe 2010 TfL investment programme included the project \"LU-PJ231 LU-managed Connect communications\", which provided Connect with a new transmission and radio system comprising 290 cell sites with two to three base stations, 1,400 new train mobiles, 7,500 new telephone links and 180 CCTV links.\nLondon Transport Museum.\nTfL also owns and operates the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, a museum that conserves, explores and explains London's transport system heritage over the last 200 years. It both explores the past, with a retrospective look at past days since 1800, and the present-day transport developments and upgrades. The museum also has an extensive depot, situated at Acton, that contains material impossible to display at the central London museum, including many additional road vehicles, trains, collections of signs and advertising materials. The depot has several open weekends each year. There are also occasional heritage train runs on the Metropolitan line.\nFinancing.\nThe majority of TfL's funding is provided by the GLA and the Mayor of London. Traditionally, the British government via the Department for Transport (DfT) also used to contribute considerably; however, throughout the 2010s, there was a concerted drive by the Conservative government to reduce central government expenditure on TfL, and that the organisation ought to pursue self-sufficiency and make greater efforts to generate its own revenue to supplement its grants. Accordingly, the operational budget of almost \u00a3700 million per year provided by the DfT by 2015 was to be entirely eliminated by 2020.\nBy February 2018, TfL was projecting a budget deficit of \u00a31 billion, a roughly five-fold increase from 2013, which reportedly threatened its long-term investment plans. Revenue collected from fares was set to make up a greater proportion of TfL's budget, yet a \u00a3240 million downturn in ticket sales by mid-2018 had been recorded. In September 2019, a TfL application for government funding to upgrade the Piccadilly Line was rejected by the Treasury. That same month, TfL head Mike Brown publicly criticised the government's decision to impose borrowing limits upon the organisation, and there was little long term certainty in terms of funding, necessitating pauses on multiple upgrade programmes.\nOn 22 April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, London mayor Sadiq Khan warned that TfL could run out of money to pay staff by the end of the month unless the government stepped in. Two days later, TfL announced it was furloughing around 7,000 employees, about a quarter of its staff, to help mitigate a 90% reduction in fare revenues. Following the implementation of a lockdown in London on 23 March, Tube journeys had reportedly fallen by 95% and bus journeys by 85%, though TfL continued to operate limited services to allow \"essential travel\" for key workers. Without government financial support for TfL, London Assembly members warned that Crossrail, the Northern line extension and other projects such as step-free schemes at tube stations could be delayed.\nOn 7 May, it was reported that TfL had requested \u00a32 billion in state aid to keep services running until September 2020. On 12 May, TfL documents warned it expected to lose \u00a34 billion due to the pandemic and said it needed \u00a33.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for 2021, having lost 90% of its overall income. Without an agreement with the government, deputy mayor for transport Heidi Alexander said TfL might have to issue a Section 114 notice - the equivalent of a public body going bust. On 14 May, the UK Government agreed \u00a31.6 billion in emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services running until September - a bailout condemned as \"a sticking plaster\" by Khan who called for agreement on a new longer-term funding model.\nOn 1 June 2020, TfL released details of its emergency budget for 2020\u20132021; it involved a reduction in capital investment by 39% from \u00a31.3 billion to \u00a3808 million along with cuts to maintenance and renewal spending by 38% to \u00a3201 million. In November 2021, the then Transport Secretary Grant Shapps criticised reports that senior TfL officials would be offered bonuses potentially in excess of \u00a312 million per year in return for efforts to help break-even. By December 2021, the British government and the Major of London had implemented three consecutive short-term funding agreements cumulatively costing in excess of \u00a34b to avert closures of several bus routes and tube lines.\nIn August 2022, additional British government support was granted to TfL; the organisation was still unable to meet all spending commitments. In response, a new facility was established to balance TfL's budget via the provision of up to \u00a3500 million; this facility restricted the GLA's future financial flexibility. During late 2023, TfL issued further urgent calls for long-term funding to support its operations; it claimed that the British government would need to provide one quarter of its capital investment plans for 2024. The Department of Transport's position has been that long term funding for TfL should be provided via the Mayor of London, and that in excess of \u00a36 billion in extraordinary funding has already been provided.\nFares.\nMost of the transport modes that come under the control of TfL have their own charging and ticketing regimes for single fare. Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\nZonal fare system.\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into eleven fare zones, with every station on the London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\nTravelcard.\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the Travelcard system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\nOyster card.\nThe Oyster card is a contactless smart card system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges based on the zones used in the day.\nContactless payments.\nIn addition to Oyster card, TfL also operates a contactless payment system in London and surrounding areas, which is codenamed CPAY.\nAlmost all contactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK, and also most international cards supporting contactless payment, are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an Oyster card, including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets. The widespread use of contactless payment - around 25 million journeys each week - has meant that TfL is now one of Europe's largest contactless merchants, with one in 10 contactless transactions in the UK taking place on the TfL network.\nMobile payments - such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay - are also accepted in the same way as contactless payment cards. The fares are the same as those charged on a debit or credit card, including the same daily capping. During 2020, one in five journeys were made using mobile devices instead of using contactless bank cards, and TfL had become the most popular Apple Pay merchant in the UK.\nTfL's expertise in contactless payments has led other cities such as New York, Sydney, Brisbane and Boston to license the technology from TfL and Cubic.\nIdentity and marketing.\nEach of the main transport units has its own corporate identity, formed by differently coloured versions of the standard roundel logo and adding appropriate lettering across the horizontal bar. The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name \"London Buses\" to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.\nTransport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist Stephen Whatley to paint an interior \u2013 'The Grand Staircase' \u2013 which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace. This painting was reproduced on posters and displayed all over the London Underground.\nDuring 2010, TfL commissioned artist Mark Wallinger to assist them in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Underground, by creating the Labyrinth Project, with one enamel plaque mounted permanently in each of the Tube's 272 stations.\nIn 2015, in partnership with the London Transport Museum and sponsored by Exterion Media, TfL launched Transported by Design, an 18-month programme of activities. The intention was to showcase the importance of both physical and service design across London's transport network. In October 2015, after two months of public voting, the black cab topped the list of favourite London transport icons, which also included the original Routemaster bus and the Tube map, among others. In 2016, the programme held exhibitions, walks and a festival at Regent Street on 3 July.\nTypeface.\n\"Johnston\" (or \"Johnston Sans\") is typeface designed by and named after Edward Johnston. The typeface was commissioned in 1913 by Frank Pick, then commercial manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (also known as 'The Underground Group'), as part of his plan to strengthen the company's corporate identity. \"Johnston\" was originally created for printing (with a planned height of 1 inch or 2.5\u00a0cm), but it rapidly became used for the enamel station signs of the Underground system as well.\nJohnston was originally printed using wood type for large signs and metal type for print. Johnston was redesigned in 1979 to produce New Johnston. The new family comes in eight members: Light, Medium, Bold weights with corresponding Italics, Medium Condensed and Bold Condensed. After the typeface was digitised in 1981\u201382, New Johnston finally became ready for Linotron photo-typesetting machine, and first appeared in London's Underground stations in 1983. It has been the official typeface exclusively used by Transport for London and The Mayor of London ever since, with minor updates to specific letterforms occurring in 1990\u20131992 and 2008. A new version, known as Johnston 100, was commissioned by Transport for London from Monotype in 2016 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the typeface, and was designed to be closer to the original version of the Johnston typeface.\nAdvertising bans.\nIn May 2019, TfL banned advertising from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates due to their poor human rights records. This brought the number of countries to 11 from which TfL has banned adverts, due to them having the death penalty for homosexuality. Countries previously banned from advertising were Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nIn 2019, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, introduced restrictions on advertising of unhealthy food and drinks across the TfL network. A study estimated that this led to a 7% reduction in the average weekly household purchase of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar. The largest reductions were seen in the sales of chocolate and sweets. There was no change in purchases of foods not classified as being high in fat, salt, and sugar.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is widely used in electronic engineering tools like circuit simulators and control systems. In simple cases, this function can be represented as a two-dimensional graph of an independent scalar input versus the dependent scalar output (known as a transfer curve or characteristic curve). Transfer functions for components are used to design and analyze systems assembled from components, particularly using the block diagram technique, in electronics and control theory.\nDimensions and units of the transfer function model the output response of the device for a range of possible inputs. The transfer function of a two-port electronic circuit, such as an amplifier, might be a two-dimensional graph of the scalar voltage at the output as a function of the scalar voltage applied to the input; the transfer function of an electromechanical actuator might be the mechanical displacement of the movable arm as a function of electric current applied to the device; the transfer function of a photodetector might be the output voltage as a function of the luminous intensity of incident light of a given wavelength.\nThe term \"transfer function\" is also used in the frequency domain analysis of systems using transform methods, such as the Laplace transform; it is the amplitude of the output as a function of the frequency of the input signal. The transfer function of an electronic filter is the amplitude at the output as a function of the frequency of a constant amplitude sine wave applied to the input. For optical imaging devices, the optical transfer function is the Fourier transform of the point spread function (a function of spatial frequency).\nLinear time-invariant systems.\nTransfer functions are commonly used in the analysis of systems such as single-input single-output filters in signal processing, communication theory, and control theory. The term is often used exclusively to refer to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Most real systems have non-linear input-output characteristics, but many systems operated within nominal parameters (not over-driven) have behavior close enough to linear that LTI system theory is an acceptable representation of their input-output behavior.\nContinuous-time.\nDescriptions are given in terms of a complex variable, formula_1. In many applications it is sufficient to set formula_2 (thus formula_3), which reduces the Laplace transforms with complex arguments to Fourier transforms with the real argument \u03c9. This is common in applications primarily interested in the LTI system's steady-state response (often the case in signal processing and communication theory), not the fleeting turn-on and turn-off transient response or stability issues.\nFor continuous-time input signal formula_4 and output formula_5, dividing the Laplace transform of the output, formula_6, by the Laplace transform of the input, formula_7, yields the system's transfer function formula_8:\nformula_9\nwhich can be rearranged as:\nformula_10\nDiscrete-time.\nDiscrete-time signals may be notated as arrays indexed by an integer formula_11 (e.g. formula_12 for input and formula_13 for output). Instead of using the Laplace transform (which is better for continuous-time signals), discrete-time signals are dealt with using the z-transform (notated with a corresponding capital letter, like formula_14 and formula_15), so a discrete-time system's transfer function can be written as:\nformula_16\nDirect derivation from differential equations.\nA linear differential equation with constant coefficients\nformula_17\nwhere \"u\" and \"r\" are suitably smooth functions of \"t\", has \"L\" as the operator defined on the relevant function space that transforms \"u\" into \"r\". That kind of equation can be used to constrain the output function \"u\" in terms of the \"forcing\" function \"r\". The transfer function can be used to define an operator formula_18 that serves as a right inverse of \"L\", meaning that formula_19.\nSolutions of the homogeneous constant-coefficient differential equation formula_20 can be found by trying formula_21. That substitution yields the characteristic polynomial\nformula_22\nThe inhomogeneous case can be easily solved if the input function \"r\" is also of the form formula_23. By substituting formula_24, formula_25 if we define\nformula_26\nOther definitions of the transfer function are used, for example formula_27\nGain, transient behavior and stability.\nA general sinusoidal input to a system of frequency formula_28 may be written formula_29. The response of a system to a sinusoidal input beginning at time formula_30 will consist of the sum of the steady-state response and a transient response. The steady-state response is the output of the system in the limit of infinite time, and the transient response is the difference between the response and the steady-state response; it corresponds to the homogeneous solution of the differential equation. The transfer function for an LTI system may be written as the product:\nformula_31\nwhere \"sPi\" are the \"N\" roots of the characteristic polynomial and will be the poles of the transfer function. In a transfer function with a single pole formula_32 where formula_33, the Laplace transform of a general sinusoid of unit amplitude will be formula_34. The Laplace transform of the output will be formula_35, and the temporal output will be the inverse Laplace transform of that function:\nformula_36\nThe second term in the numerator is the transient response, and in the limit of infinite time it will diverge to infinity if \"\u03c3P\" is positive. For a system to be stable, its transfer function must have no poles whose real parts are positive. If the transfer function is strictly stable, the real parts of all poles will be negative and the transient behavior will tend to zero in the limit of infinite time. The steady-state output will be:\nformula_37\nThe frequency response (or \"gain\") \"G\" of the system is defined as the absolute value of the ratio of the output amplitude to the steady-state input amplitude:\nformula_38\nwhich is the absolute value of the transfer function formula_39 evaluated at formula_40. This result is valid for any number of transfer-function poles.\nSteady state behavior for sinusoidal excitation.\nThe steady state behavior of a linear system\nformula_41\nfor sinusoidal excitation formula_42 can be expressed in terms of its transfer function\nformula_43\nevaluated at formula_44, i.e. with real part formula_45:\nformula_46\nTo show this, use the ansatz function\nformula_47\nplug it into the above given differential equation, solve for formula_48, and note that formula_49.\nFrom the complex identity formula_50, the argument follows.\nSignal processing.\nIf formula_51 is the input to a general linear time-invariant system, and formula_52 is the output, and the bilateral Laplace transform of formula_51 and formula_52 is\n formula_55\nThe output is related to the input by the transfer function formula_39 as\n formula_57\nand the transfer function itself is \n formula_58\nIf a complex harmonic signal with a sinusoidal component with amplitude formula_59, angular frequency formula_60 and phase formula_61, where arg is the argument\nformula_62\nwhere formula_63\nis input to a linear time-invariant system, the corresponding component in the output is:\nformula_64\nIn a linear time-invariant system, the input frequency formula_65 has not changed; only the amplitude and phase angle of the sinusoid have been changed by the system. The frequency response formula_66 describes this change for every frequency formula_65 in terms of gain\nformula_68\nand phase shift\nformula_69\nThe phase delay (the frequency-dependent amount of delay introduced to the sinusoid by the transfer function) is\nformula_70\nThe group delay (the frequency-dependent amount of delay introduced to the envelope of the sinusoid by the transfer function) is found by computing the derivative of the phase shift with respect to angular frequency formula_65,\nformula_72\nThe transfer function can also be shown using the Fourier transform, a special case of bilateral Laplace transform where formula_73.\nCommon transfer-function families.\nAlthough any LTI system can be described by some transfer function, \"families\" of special transfer functions are commonly used:\nControl engineering.\nIn control engineering and control theory, the transfer function is derived with the Laplace transform. The transfer function was the primary tool used in classical control engineering. A transfer matrix can be obtained for any linear system to analyze its dynamics and other properties; each element of a transfer matrix is a transfer function relating a particular input variable to an output variable. A representation bridging state space and transfer function methods was proposed by Howard H. Rosenbrock, and is known as the Rosenbrock system matrix.\nImaging.\nIn imaging, transfer functions are used to describe the relationship between the scene light, the image signal and the displayed light.\nNon-linear systems.\nTransfer functions do not exist for many non-linear systems, such as relaxation oscillators; however, describing functions can sometimes be used to approximate such nonlinear time-invariant systems.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Analog computer\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The taste of Twiglets, which has been compared to that of Marmite, primarily derives from the yeast extract used in the coating. Twiglets are packaged in 24\u00a0g, 45\u00a0g, 105\u00a0g, 150\u00a0g bags, and in 200\u00a0g cylindrical containers.\nHistory.\nTwiglets were invented in 1929 by a French biscuit maker J. Rondalin, a technical manager at Peek Freans' Bermondsey factory, who added brewer's yeast to a leftover batch of Vitawheat dough. They were first launched onto the consumer market in 1932 by Peek Freans. Today, Twiglets are manufactured in Aintree by United Biscuits subsidiary Jacob's.\nDuring the Christmas season, Twiglets were traditionally sold in drum-shaped tin boxes as a high-class cocktail accompaniment from the 1930s until the 1970s. In modern times, the tin boxes have been substituted with large cardboard tubes decorated with seasonal themes.\nIn the early 1990s, a range of tangy Worcester Sauce Twiglets were introduced. Jacobs also released a curry flavoured edition from 1999 to 2001, in collaboration with several Indian restaurant chains in Northern England. From 2010 until 2012, Tangy Twiglets were briefly re-released as a limited edition to commemorate Twiglets' 80th anniversary.\nTwiglets used to be manufactured partly from grain prepared using hammer milling machinery located at the Parker Brothers Lark Roller Mills in Mildenhall. The machinery was powered by water turbines fed by water from the river Lark and this process created the broken grains that give Twiglets their crunchy irregular shape and texture.

{"id": "31150", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31150", "title": "Lagrange's theorem (group theory)", "text": "Theorem on the orders of subgroups\nIn the mathematical field of group theory, Lagrange's theorem states that if H is a subgroup of any finite group G, then formula_1 is a divisor of formula_2. That is, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup divides the order of the whole group. \nThe theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The following variant states that for a subgroup formula_3 of a finite group formula_4, not only is formula_5 an integer, but its value is the index formula_6, defined as the number of left cosets of formula_3 in formula_4.\nThis variant holds even if formula_4 is infinite, provided that formula_2, formula_1, and formula_6 are interpreted as cardinal numbers.\nProof.\nThe left cosets of H in G are the equivalence classes of a certain equivalence relation on G: specifically, call x and y in G equivalent if there exists h in H such that \"x\" \n \"yh\". \nTherefore, the set of left cosets forms a partition of G.\nEach left coset \"aH\" has the same cardinality as H because formula_13 defines a bijection formula_14 (the inverse is formula_15).\nThe number of left cosets is the index [\"G\" : \"H\"].\nBy the previous three sentences, \nformula_16\nExtension.\nLagrange's theorem can be extended to the equation of indices between three subgroups of G.\nIf we take \"K\" \n {\"e\"} (e is the identity element of G), then [\"G\" : {\"e\"}] \n |\"G\"| and [\"H\" : {\"e\"}] \n |\"H\"|. Therefore, we can recover the original equation |\"G\"| \n [\"G\" : \"H\"] |\"H\"|.\nApplications.\nA consequence of the theorem is that the order of any element a of a finite group (i.e. the smallest positive integer number k with , where e is the identity element of the group) divides the order of that group, since the order of a is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by a. If the group has n elements, it follows\nformula_17\nThis can be used to prove Fermat's little theorem and its generalization, Euler's theorem. These special cases were known long before the general theorem was proved.\nThe theorem also shows that any group of prime order is cyclic and simple, since the subgroup generated by any non-identity element must be the whole group itself.\nLagrange's theorem can also be used to show that there are infinitely many primes: suppose there were a largest prime formula_18. Any prime divisor formula_19 of the Mersenne number formula_20 satisfies formula_21 (see modular arithmetic), meaning that the order of formula_22 in the multiplicative group formula_23 is formula_18. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of formula_22 must divide the order of formula_23, which is formula_27. So formula_18 divides formula_27, giving formula_30, contradicting the assumption that formula_18 is the largest prime.\nExistence of subgroups of given order.\nLagrange's theorem raises the converse question as to whether every divisor of the order of a group is the order of some subgroup. This does not hold in general: given a finite group \"G\" and a divisor \"d\" of |\"G\"|, there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of \"G\" with order \"d\". The smallest example is \"A\"4 (the alternating group of degree 4), which has 12 elements but no subgroup of order 6.\nA \"Converse of Lagrange's Theorem\" (CLT) group is a finite group with the property that for every divisor of the order of the group, there is a subgroup of that order. It is known that a CLT group must be solvable and that every supersolvable group is a CLT group. However, there exist solvable groups that are not CLT (for example, \"A\"4) and CLT groups that are not supersolvable (for example, \"S\"4, the symmetric group of degree 4).\nThere are partial converses to Lagrange's theorem. For general groups, Cauchy's theorem guarantees the existence of an element, and hence of a cyclic subgroup, of order any prime dividing the group order. Sylow's theorem extends this to the existence of a subgroup of order equal to the maximal power of any prime dividing the group order. For solvable groups, Hall's theorems assert the existence of a subgroup of order equal to any unitary divisor of the group order (that is, a divisor coprime to its cofactor).\nCounterexample of the converse of Lagrange's theorem.\nThe converse of Lagrange's theorem states that if d is a divisor of the order of a group G, then there exists a subgroup H where |\"H\"| = \"d\".\nWe will examine the alternating group \"A\"4, the set of even permutations as the subgroup of the Symmetric group \"S\"4.\nLet V be the non-cyclic subgroup of \"A\"4 called the Klein four-group.\n\"V\" = {\"e\", (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)}.\nLet \"K\" = \"H\" \u22c2 \"V\". Since both H and V are subgroups of \"A\"4, K is also a subgroup of \"A\"4.\nFrom Lagrange's theorem, the order of K must divide both 6 and 4, the orders of H and V respectively. The only two positive integers that divide both 6 and 4 are 1 and 2. So |\"K\"| = 1 or 2.\nAssume |\"K\"| = 1, then \"K\" = {\"e\"}. If H does not share any elements with V, then the 5 elements in H besides the Identity element e must be of the form (\"a b c\") where \"a, b, c\" are distinct elements in {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nSince any element of the form (\"a b c\") squared is (\"a c b\"), and (\"a b c\")(\"a c b\") = \"e\", any element of H in the form (\"a b c\") must be paired with its inverse. Specifically, the remaining 5 elements of H must come from distinct pairs of elements in \"A\"4 that are not in V. This is impossible since pairs of elements must be even and cannot total up to 5 elements. Thus, the assumptions that |\"K\"| = 1 is wrong, so |\"K\"| = 2.\nThen, \"K\" = {\"e\", \"v\"} where \"v\" \u2208 \"V\", v must be in the form (\"a b\")(\"c d\") where a, b, c, d are distinct elements of {1, 2, 3, 4}. The other four elements in H are cycles of length 3.\nNote that the cosets generated by a subgroup of a group form a partition of the group. The cosets generated by a specific subgroup are either identical to each other or disjoint. The index of a subgroup in a group [\"A\"4 : \"H\"] = |\"A\"4|/|\"H\"| is the number of cosets generated by that subgroup. Since |\"A\"4| = 12 and |\"H\"| = 6, H will generate two left cosets, one that is equal to H and another, gH, that is of length 6 and includes all the elements in \"A\"4 not in H.\nSince there are only 2 distinct cosets generated by H, then H must be normal. Because of that, \"H\" = \"gHg\"\u22121 (\u2200\"g\" \u2208 \"A\"4). In particular, this is true for \"g\" = (\"a b c\") \u2208 \"A\"4. Since \"H\" = \"gHg\"\u22121, \"gvg\"\u22121 \u2208 \"H\".\nWithout loss of generality, assume that \"a\" = 1, \"b\" = 2, \"c\" = 3, \"d\" = 4. Then \"g\" = (1 2 3), \"v\" = (1 2)(3 4), \"g\"\u22121 = (1 3 2), \"gv\" = (1 3 4), \"gvg\"\u22121 = (1 4)(2 3). Transforming back, we get \"gvg\"\u22121 = (\"a\" \"d\")(\"b\" \"c\"). Because V contains all disjoint transpositions in \"A\"4, \"gvg\"\u22121 \u2208 \"V\". Hence, \"gvg\"\u22121 \u2208 \"H\" \u22c2 \"V\" = \"K\".\nSince \"gvg\"\u22121 \u2260 \"v\", we have demonstrated that there is a third element in K. But earlier we assumed that |\"K\"| = 2, so we have a contradiction.\nTherefore, our original assumption that there is a subgroup of order 6 is not true and consequently there is no subgroup of order 6 in \"A\"4 and the converse of Lagrange's theorem is not necessarily true.\nQ.E.D.\nHistory.\nLagrange himself did not prove the theorem in its general form. He stated, in his article \"R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations\", that if a polynomial in n variables has its variables permuted in all \"n\"! ways, the number of different polynomials that are obtained is always a factor of \"n\"!. (For example, if the variables x, y, and z are permuted in all 6 possible ways in the polynomial \"x\" + \"y\" \u2212 \"z\" then we get a total of 3 different polynomials: \"x\" + \"y\" \u2212 \"z\", \"x\" + \"z\" \u2212 \"y\", and \"y\" + \"z\" \u2212 \"x\". Note that 3 is a factor of 6.) The number of such polynomials is the index in the symmetric group \"S\"n of the subgroup \"H\" of permutations that preserve the polynomial. (For the example of \"x\" + \"y\" \u2212 \"z\", the subgroup \"H\" in \"S\"3 contains the identity and the transposition (\"x y\").) So the size of \"H\" divides \"n\"!. With the later development of abstract groups, this result of Lagrange on polynomials was recognized to extend to the general theorem about finite groups which now bears his name.\nIn his \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" in 1801, Carl Friedrich Gauss proved Lagrange's theorem for the special case of formula_32, the multiplicative group of nonzero integers modulo p, where p is a prime. In 1844, Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved Lagrange's theorem for the symmetric group \"S\"n.\nCamille Jordan finally proved Lagrange's theorem for the case of any permutation group in 1861.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Adapted by William Goldman from his novel of the same name, it tells the story of a swashbuckling farmhand named Westley, accompanied by companions befriended along the way, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck. The film preserves the novel's metafictional narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather to his sick grandson.\nThe film was first released in the United States on September 25, 1987, and received widespread critical acclaim. After only having modest initial box office success, it has over time become a cult film and gained recognition as one of the greatest films of the 1980s as well as one of Reiner's best works. The film is number 50 on the Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\", number 88 on The American Film Institute's (AFI) \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions\" list of the 100 greatest film love stories, and 46 in Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Films list. The film also won the 1988 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. The film also won the People's Choice Award at the 12th Toronto International Film Festival. In 2016, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nA grandfather reads a novel to his sick grandson, who initially dismisses the story. The book is about Buttercup, a young woman living on a farm in the fictional kingdom of Florin. Whenever she tells farmhand Westley to do something, he always complies, saying, \"As you wish\", as his way of telling her he loved her. The two fall in love, and Westley leaves to seek his fortune overseas so they can marry; however, Westley is presumed dead after his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nFive years later, Buttercup is forcibly betrothed to Florin's Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by crafty Sicilian criminal Vizzini and his henchmen: Fezzik, a giant, and Inigo Montoya, a Spanish fencing master obsessed with revenge against the six-fingered man who murdered his father. A masked man in black pursues them, as do Humperdinck and his soldiers.\nAtop the Cliffs of Insanity, the man in black defeats Inigo in a sword duel and knocks him out, chokes Fezzik into unconsciousness, and kills Vizzini by tricking him into drinking a deadly poison. He takes Buttercup and flees ahead of Humperdinck's party. She correctly guesses he is the Dread Pirate Roberts, rebukes him for killing Westley, and shoves him down a steep hill. While tumbling down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Realizing the man is Westley, Buttercup tumbles after him, and they are reunited.\nWhile making their way through the Fire Swamp to avoid Humperdinck and his soldiers, Westley explains that \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" is a transferable title that he assumed when the previous Roberts retired. Having found Buttercup, Westley intends to retire himself and pass on the title to someone else. Humperdinck captures the pair after they emerge from the Fire Swamp. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck after he promises to release Westley; however, he secretly orders Count Rugen to take Westley to his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair. After Westley notices that Rugen has six fingers on his right hand, Rugen knocks him out.\nWhen Buttercup threatens to commit suicide if the wedding happens, Humperdinck falsely promises to find Westley for her. His real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing them for it. Humperdinck had secretly hired Vizzini to kill her, but Westley interfered. Meanwhile, Fezzik becomes part of the brute squad ordered to clear the thieves' forest before the wedding. He finds a drunk Inigo in the forest, whom he sobers up and tells about Rugen. Inigo says that he and Fezzik need Westley's help to storm the castle.\nButtercup realizes that Humperdinck did not search for Westley and calls him a coward. Enraged, he imprisons her and tortures Westley to near death. Inigo and Fezzik follow Westley's screams to the pit and take his body to Miracle Max, a folk healer whom Humperdinck recently fired. The \"mostly dead\" Westley is revived by him, though he is severely weakened. As Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik storm the castle during the wedding, Humperdinck panics and orders the priest to conclude at once. Inigo confronts Rugen, who flees and then stabs him in an ambush, taunting his obsession. Inigo braves his injuries and kills Rugen.\nWestley locates Buttercup as she is about to commit suicide and assures her that the marriage is invalid as she never said \"I do\". Humperdinck finds them and challenges Westley to a duel, but Westley intimidates him into surrendering. Inigo finds Westley and Buttercup, and Fezzik procures four horses for their escape. When Inigo is unsure what to do next with his life, Westley offers him the Dread Pirate Roberts title. As dawn breaks, the reunited Westley and Buttercup share a passionate kiss. The sick grandson eagerly asks his grandfather to read him the story again the next day. His grandfather replies, \"As you wish.\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdditional cast members include Betsy Brantley as the mother of Savage's character; Margery Mason as the Ancient Booer who heckles Buttercup in her dream; Willoughby Gray and Anne Dyson as the King and Queen of Florin; Malcolm Storry as chief enforcer Yellin; Paul Badger as an assistant brute; and Anthony Georghiou and Danny Blackner as the Rodents Of Unusual Size.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nRob Reiner, who had been enamored of Goldman's book ever since he was given it as a gift from his father, realized he wanted to make the film adaptation after successfully demonstrating his filmmaking skill with the release of \"This Is Spinal Tap\" in 1984. During production of \"Stand by Me\", released in 1986, Reiner had spoken to an executive at Paramount Pictures regarding what his next film would be, and suggested the adaptation of \"The Princess Bride\". He was told they could not, leading Reiner to discover that several studios had previously attempted to bring Goldman's book to the big screen without success.\nThose previous attempts included 20th Century Fox, which paid Goldman $500,000 for the film rights and to do a screenplay in 1973. Richard Lester was signed to direct and the movie was almost made, but the head of production at Fox was fired and the project was put on hiatus. Goldman subsequently bought back the film rights to the novel with his own money. Other directors had also attempted to adapt the book, including Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Robert Redford and Norman Jewison, and at one point, Christopher Reeve was interested in playing Westley in one planned adaptation. Reiner found success by gaining financial support from Norman Lear, whom Reiner knew from \"All in the Family\" and who had funded production of \"This Is Spinal Tap\", with the production to be distributed by 20th Century Fox. Reiner worked closely with Goldman to adapt the book for the screenplay.\nIn a 2011 interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Reiner acknowledged that then-20th Century Fox head Barry Diller also had a prominent role in the film's production, instructing him to make it a film which, like The Wizard of Oz, could instead find greater success over time rather than immediately after its initial release.\nCasting.\nReiner had quickly decided on Cary Elwes for Westley, based on his performance in \"Lady Jane\"; however, during the casting period in Los Angeles, Elwes was in West Germany on set for \"Maschenka\". Reiner flew out to West Berlin to meet with Elwes, confirming his appropriateness for the role. While Reiner and casting director Jane Jenkins auditioned other actors for Westley, they knew Elwes was perfect for the part. Elwes had read the book in his childhood and associated himself with the character of Westley, but never believed he would have the opportunity to play him.\nRobin Wright was cast late in the process, about a week before filming. Uma Thurman, Meg Ryan, Sean Young, Suzy Amis, Courteney Cox, Alexandra Paul and Whoopi Goldberg all auditioned for the role. Wright's agent had heard of the casting call and encouraged Wright to audition. Though initially shy, Wright impressed Jenkins, and later Reiner. They invited Wright to come meet Goldman at his house. Jenkins recalls: \"The doorbell rang. Rob went to the door, and literally, as he opened the door, [Wright] was standing there in this little white summer dress, with her long blonde hair, and she had a halo from the sun. She was backlit by God. And Bill Goldman looked across the room at her, and he said, 'Well, that's what I wrote.' It was the most perfect thing.\" Mandy Patinkin and Wallace Shawn were early choices for the cast; Shawn in particular was chosen as Vizzini due to his diminutive size to contrast that of the giant Fezzik. Danny DeVito was considered for the role of Vizzini.\nWhen Goldman originally shopped his novel in the early 1970s, his first choice for Fezzik was Andr\u00e9 the Giant, whose wrestling schedule left him unavailable for filming. Goldman's second choice was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who at that time was almost unknown as an actor. By the time \"The Princess Bride\" was finally green-lit, Schwarzenegger was a major film star and the studio could not afford him. Jenkins contacted the World Wrestling Federation to ask about hiring Andr\u00e9, but were told that the filming conflicted with a wrestling match in Tokyo that would pay him $5\u00a0million. Jenkins auditioned other tall men, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lou Ferrigno and Carel Struycken, but these did not pan out. Andr\u00e9 was hesitant to take the part on the account of the fact that the film's dialogue was in English while he was French and because he was a professional wrestler, not an actor. Furthermore, Andr\u00e9 was suffering much pain resulting from his acromegaly, which was to eventually lead to his early death. Liam Neeson also auditioned for the role, but he was turned down due to height. Near the end of casting, the World Wrestling Federation told Jenkins that Andr\u00e9's match in Tokyo had been cancelled, clearing him to play the role of Fezzik. For his part, Andr\u00e9 found his participation was a gratifying experience considering that no one stared at him on set during production as a kind of freak, but instead simply treated him as a fellow member of the cast.\nFilming.\nThe film was shot in various locations in England and Ireland in late 1986:\nThe framing story scenes, the last to be filmed, were shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Reiner rented a house in England near these sites and frequently invited the cast over for meals and light-hearted get-togethers. Many cast members believed this helped to create a sense of \"family\" that helped to improve their performances for the film. Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin learned to fence (both left- and right-handed) for the film, and they performed the combat scenes themselves, with the exception of two somersaults performed by stunt doubles. They were trained by fencing instructor Bob Anderson and stunt coordinator Peter Diamond, both of whom had also worked on training the actors in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Elwes and Patinkin spent about three weeks prior to filming learning to fence, and they spent most of their off-camera free time practicing. Anderson encouraged the two to learn the other's choreography for the fight to help them anticipate the movements and avoid an accident. They also watched many sword fights from previous films to see how they could improve on those.\nAndr\u00e9 the Giant had undergone major back surgery prior to filming and, despite his great size and strength, could not support the weight of Elwes during their fight scene or Wright for a scene at the end of the film. For the wrestling scene, when Elwes hangs on Andr\u00e9's back, he was actually walking on a series of ramps below the camera during close-ups. For the wide shots, a stunt double took the place of Andr\u00e9. When he was apparently carrying Wright, she was actually suspended by cables. Billy Crystal and Carol Kane spent time before traveling to England to work out the backstory between Miracle Max and his wife and develop a rapport for their characters. Once on set, Reiner allowed them to improvise some of their lines.\nSoundtrack.\nThe original soundtrack album was composed by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. It was released by Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Vertigo Records internationally in November 1987. The album contains the song \"Storybook Love\", performed by Willy DeVille and produced by Mark Knopfler. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 60th Academy Awards.\nIn his audio commentary of the film on the special edition DVD, director Rob Reiner said that only Knopfler could create a soundtrack to capture the film's quirky yet romantic nature. Reiner was an admirer of Knopfler's work but did not know him before working on the film. He sent the script to him hoping he would agree to score the film. Knopfler agreed on one condition: that somewhere in the film Reiner would include the baseball cap (which had been modified to say \"USS Ooral Sea OV-4B\") he wore as Marty DiBergi in \"This Is Spinal Tap\". Reiner was unable to produce the original cap, but did include a similar cap in the grandson's room. Knopfler later said he was joking.\nReception.\nThe film premiered at the Ryerson Theatre in Toronto as part of the 1987 Toronto International Film Festival. It went into wide release later that fall in North America.\nBox office.\nUnsure how to describe the film's postmodern narrative, Fox promoted it to theaters as a zany comedy and released it without an audience trailer. The film was initially a modest success, grossing $30.8\u00a0million at the United States and Canada box office, on a $16\u00a0million production budget. Fox head Barry Diller, who wanted the film to be a success over the course of time rather than in its initial release, reassured a frustrated Reiner that the film could find a broader audience in time.\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Princess Bride\" holds a 96% approval rating based on 85 reviews and an average rating of 8.50/10. The site's consensus states, \"A delightfully postmodern fairy tale, \"The Princess Bride\" is a deft, intelligent mix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel-in-distress story and makes it fresh.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 78 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on scale of A to F. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating on their television program. Ebert also wrote a very favorable print review in his column for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". Richard Corliss of \"Time\" said the film was fun for the whole family, and later, \"Time\" listed the film as one of the \"Best of '87\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" praised the cast and the sweetness of the film.\nThe American critic Dalton Mullins praised the film as one of the best love stories ever filmed, writing: \"The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and is clear from the first moment they're on screen together. When Buttercup asks Wesley [\"sic\"] to do something, the tension of the unspoken love between the two is profound and dense, especially when they were standing face to face right before they professed their undying love for each other.\" Mullins argued that the phrase \"as you wish\" sums up the film's philosophy as Westley was willing to suffer any hardship and brave any peril for the woman he loves, which led him to argue the film was a story about \"true love\". He wrote that the scenes in the swamp were especially effective because the characters have been apart for so long and: \"the way Wesley [\"sic\"] cradles Buttercup and the affectionate hug has always been a moment that stood out to me because it accentuates the love between the two characters and reinforces the themes of longing and true love\". Mullins called the film the \"...greatest romantic, fantasy, adventure story. It flawlessly represents love in that it can be a long arduous process but when fought for, it can be the most beautiful, passionate thing and fill you with the most joyful feelings\".\nLegacy.\n\"The Princess Bride\" was not a major box-office success, but it became a cult classic after its release to the home video market. The film is widely regarded as eminently quotable. Elwes noted in 2017, on the film's 30th anniversary, that fans still frequently come up to him and quote lines from the movie. According to him, Wallace Shawn had it worse because any time he made a small error, like dropping his keys, people would shout \"Inconceivable!\" at him.\nIn 2000, readers of \"Total Film\" magazine voted \"The Princess Bride\" the 38th greatest comedy film of all time. In 2005 \"The Princess Bride\" was voted 40th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Family Films poll ahead of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"Beetlejuice\" and just behind \"Bugsy Malone\" and \"Bedknobs &amp; Broomsticks\". In 2006, William Goldman's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 84th best screenplay of all time; it earned the same ranking in the Guild's 2013 update. The film was selected number 88 on the American Film Institute's (AFI) \"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Passions\" listing the 100 greatest film love stories of all time. BBC Radio 5's resident film critic, Mark Kermode, is a fan of the film, frequently considering it a model to which similar films aspire.\nIn December 2011, director Jason Reitman staged a live dramatic reading of \"The Princess Bride\" script at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), with Paul Rudd as Westley; Mindy Kaling as Buttercup; Patton Oswalt as Vizzini; Kevin Pollak as Miracle Max; Goran Visnjic as Inigo Montoya; Cary Elwes (switching roles) as Humperdinck; director Rob Reiner as the grandfather; and Fred Savage reprising his role as the grandson. In 2013, director Ari Folman released a live-action animated film titled \"The Congress\", which directly referenced \"The Princess Bride\". Folman's film starred Robin Wright, playing both a live and animated version of herself, as a digitally cloned actress.\nIn 2014, Cary Elwes wrote \"As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride\", a behind-the-scenes account of the film's production, co-written with Joe Layden. To help Elwes recall the production, Lear sent him a bound copy of the filming's call sheets. The book debuted at No. 3 on the New York Times Bestseller list. In addition to a foreword by director Rob Reiner and a limited edition poster, the book includes exclusive photos and interviews with the cast members from the 25th anniversary cast reunion, as well as unique stories and set secrets from the making of the film. In 2018, Savage reprised his role as The Grandson in a PG-13 version of \"Deadpool 2\" entitled \"Once Upon a Deadpool\", with Deadpool taking the role of The Narrator and reading \"Deadpool 2\"'s story to him at bedtime and skipping over the more adult parts from the R-rated version. In 2020, a bar themed after the film, named \"As You Wish\", opened in Chicago. The menu features 16 themed cocktails.\nAccolades.\nAt the 60th Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Storybook Love.\" At the 15th Saturn Awards it won Best Fantasy Film and Best Costume Design, it was nominated for Best Writing, and Robin Wright was nominated for Best Actress. It won the 1988 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and at the 1987 Toronto International Film Festival it won the People's Choice Award. At the 9th Youth in Film Awards Fred Savage won Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture: Drama. At the 4th Artios Awards it was nominated for best Feature Film Casting \u2014 Comedy.\nPost-theatrical release.\nIn North America, the film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1988 by Nelson Entertainment, the latter being a \"bare bones\" release in unmatted full screen. New Line Home Video reissued the VHS in 1994. The film was also released on Video CD by Philips. The Criterion Collection released a matted widescreen version, bare bones version on laserdisc in 1989, supplementing it with liner notes. In 1997 Criterion re-released the Laserdisc as a \"special edition\". This edition was widescreen and included an audio commentary by Rob Reiner, William Goldman, Andrew Scheinman, Billy Crystal and Peter Falk (this commentary would also later appear on the Criterion Blu-ray and DVD release); excerpts from the novel read by Rob Reiner; behind the scenes footage; a production scrapbook by unit photographer Clive Coote; design sketches by production designer Norman Garwood; and excerpts from the television series \"Morton and Hayes\", directed by Christopher Guest.\nBy 1998, MGM had acquired the US home video rights to the film (as part of the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment film library package) and released the film on VHS and DVD. The DVD release featured the soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 with the film in wide and full screen versions, and included the original US theatrical trailer. The next year MGM Home Entertainment re-released the film in another widescreen \"special edition\", this time with two audio commentaries\u2014one by Rob Reiner, the other by William Goldman\u2014\"As You Wish\", \"Promotional\", and \"Making Of\" featurettes; a \"Cary Elwes Video Diary\"; the US and UK theatrical trailers; four television spots; a photo gallery; and a collectible booklet.\nIn 2006, MGM and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released a two-disc set with varying covers\u2014the \"Dread Pirate\" and \"Buttercup\" editions. Each featured their respective character, but had identical features: in addition to the features in the previous release were, the \"Dread Pirate Roberts: Greatest Legend of the Seven Seas\", \"Love is Like a Storybook Story\", and \"Miraculous Make Up\" featurettes, \"The Quotable Battle of Wits\" game, and Fezzik's \"Guide to Florin\" booklet. A year later, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the film, MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film with flippable cover art featuring the title displayed in an ambigram. This DVD did not include any bonus features from the older editions, but had new short featurettes and a new game. A Blu-ray Disc was released on March 17, 2009, encoded in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Special features included two audio commentaries, the original theatrical trailer and eight featurettes.\nIn 2007, the film was released for download in the iTunes Store. The film is available in Europe (DVD Region 2), published by Lions Gate Entertainment. Its extras are the theatrical trailer and text filmographies. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 30, 2018. It included a new 4K digital transfer, the same audio commentary from the Criterion LaserDisc release, an edited 1987 audiobook reading of Goldman's novel by director Rob Reiner, new programs on William Goldman's screenplay and tapestry, a new interview with art director Richard Holland, an essay by author Sloane Crosley, and a Blu-ray exclusive book highlighting four screenplays, as well as Goldman's introduction to the 1995 screenplay. Criterion would re-release the film on a 4K/Blu-Ray combo pack on September 3, 2023. \"The Princess Bride\" has been made available on May 1, 2020, on The Walt Disney Company's streaming service Disney+.\nAdaptations.\nIt was announced that composer Adam Guettel was working with William Goldman on a musical adaptation of \"The Princess Bride\" in 2006. The project was abandoned in February 2007 after Goldman reportedly demanded 75 percent of the author's share, even though Guettel was writing both the music and the lyrics. In late 2013, Disney Theatrical Productions announced that they would adapt a stage musical adaptation of \"The Princess Bride\". A website was launched a couple of months later. In 2016, Rob Reiner said the project was still in development despite \"roadblocks\" and that Marc Shaiman, Randy Newman and John Mayer had all been approached to write songs, but had turned them down. In June 2019, it was confirmed Rick Elice and Bob Martin were writing the script and David Yazbek was composing the music and lyrics. In 2018, \"The Princess Bride\" was adapted by players of a virtual reality social game, \"Rec Room\", into what is likely to be the world's first full-length virtual reality stage production. The duration of the production was approximately 80 minutes, and ran for a total of four shows.\nThere have been many board games based on the film, beginning with a promotional roll and move game distributed with an early VHS video release in 1988. In 2008, PlayRoom Entertainment released \"The Princess Bride: Storming the Castle\", a board game based on the film. Since 2013, Game Salute (now Tabletop Tycoon, under the SparkWorks imprint) has published multiple games based on specific scenes from the film, including party game \"The Princess Bride: Prepare to Die!\", card game \"The Princess Bride: A Battle of Wits\", and dice game \"The Princess Bride: I Hate to Kill You...\" In 2020, Ravensburger published \"The Princess Bride Adventure Book Game\", a collaborative card and miniatures game with several boards presented as \"chapters\" of a book. \"The Princess Bride Game\" is a casual video game developed and published by New York game development studio Worldwide Biggies.\nIn June 2020, a \"fan made\" recreation of \"The Princess Bride\" was released on Quibi called \"\". It was produced by Jason Reitman during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine in March 2020 with help from an ensemble cast who filmed themselves recreating the various scenes at their homes to raise money for the World Central Kitchen charity. Reitman received backing from Jeffrey Katzenberg for the project, as well as the rights to stream the film on his Quibi service. The \"fan-made\" film also had approval from Norman Lear and the estate of William Goldman, and Mark Knopfler permitted the use of his music. Rob Reiner approved of the project, even briefly stepping in to play the grandfather. It also features the final performance of Carl Reiner, playing the grandfather in the last scene to his own son. The film was dedicated to his memory as he died days later.\nOn September 13, 2020, most of the original cast members took part in a virtual live read-through of \"The Princess Bride\" script, \"Princess Bride Reunion\", to support the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. The returning cast included Elwes, Wright, Sarandon, Patinkin, Guest, Shawn, Crystal, and Kane, with additional performances by Rob Reiner as the Grandfather, Josh Gad as Fezzik, Eric Idle as the Impressive Clergyman, Whoopi Goldberg as the Ancient Booer and the Mother, King Bach as Yellin, the Assistant Brute and the King, Finn Wolfhard as the Grandson, Shaun Ross as The Man With Albinism, and Jason Reitman as the narrator. Norman Lear joined the Q&amp;A session at the end, which was hosted by Patton Oswalt. Cast members promoted the event beforehand using the hashtags \"#PrincessBrideReunion and \"#DumpTrumperdinck\". More than 110,000 viewers donated a dollar or more to Wisconsin Democrats to view the livestream event. Zen Studios released \"The Princess Bride\" table for \"Pinball FX\" on August 29, 2024.\nPotential remake.\nIn a September 2019 biographical article on Norman Lear in \"Variety\", Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra, speaking of Lear's works and interest in remaking them, stated, \"Very famous people whose names I won't use, but they want to redo \"The Princess Bride.\"\" The reaction to this via social media was very negative, with fans of the film asserting that a remake would be a bad idea and, in reference to the film, \"inconceivable\". Elwes paraphrased the film, saying, \"There's a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one.\" Jamie Lee Curtis, Guest's wife, stated \"there is only ONE \"The Princess Bride\" and it's William Goldman and [Reiner]'s\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These included the adventures of one Dr. Bataille, a surgeon serving in the French merchant navy who has infiltrated the Freemasons and observes their evil rituals as they occur all over the world. Buddhists, Hindus, and Spiritualists join with Freemasons in conspiring against the Catholic Church, and Bataille uncovers an even more secret order within the Masons called the Palladists, who take their orders directly from demons. As Dr. Bataille's tale unfolds, he introduces Diana Vaughan, a former high priestess of Palladism who has converted to Catholicism and is in grave danger of assassination from vengeful Freemasons. \nIn 1897, Taxil called a press conference at which he promised to produce Vaughan. Instead he declared that his revelations about the Freemasons were made up. Nine years later he told an American magazine that he at first thought readers would recognize his tales as \"amusement pure and simple\"\u2014too outlandish to be true\u2014but when he realized they believed them and that there was \"lots of money\" to be made in publishing them, he continued to perpetrate the hoax.\nTaxil and Freemasonry.\nL\u00e9o Taxil was the pen name of Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pag\u00e8s, who had been accused earlier of libel regarding a book he wrote called \"The Secret Loves of Pope Pius IX\". On April 20, 1884, Pope Leo XIII published an encyclical, \"Humanum genus\", that said that the human race was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;separated into two diverse and opposite parts, of which the one steadfastly contends for truth and virtue, the other of those things which are contrary to virtue and to truth. The one is the kingdom of God on earth, namely, the true Church of Jesus Christ... The other is the kingdom of Satan... At this period, however, the partisans of evil seems to be combining together, and to be struggling with united vehemence, led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the Freemasons.\nAfter this encyclical, Taxil underwent a public, feigned conversion to Catholicism and declared his intention of repairing the damage he had done to the true faith.\nThe first book produced by Taxil after his conversion was a four-volume history of Freemasonry, which contained fictitious eyewitness verifications of their participation in Satanism. With a collaborator who published as \"Dr. Karl Hacks\", Taxil wrote another book called \"Le Diable au XIXe si\u00e8cle\" (\"The Devil in the Nineteenth Century\"), which introduced a new character, Diana Vaughan, a supposed descendant of the Rosicrucian alchemist Thomas Vaughan. The book contained many tales about her encounters with incarnate demons, one of whom, a devil snake, was supposed to have written prophecies on her back with its tail, and another who played the piano while in the shape of a crocodile.\nDiana was supposedly involved in Satanic Freemasonry but was redeemed when one day she professed admiration for Joan of Arc, at whose name the demons were put to flight. As Diana Vaughan, Taxil published a book called \"Eucharistic Novena\", a collection of prayers which were praised by the Pope.\nPalladists.\nIn the Taxil hoax, Palladists were members of an alleged Theistic Satanist cult within Freemasonry. According to Taxil, Palladism was a religion practiced within the highest orders of Freemasonry. Adherents worshipped Lucifer and interacted with demons. \nIn 1891 L\u00e9o Taxil and Adolphe Ricoux claimed to have discovered a Palladian Society. An 1892 French book \"Le Diable au XIXe si\u00e8cle\" (The Devil in the 19th Century\", 1892), written by \"Dr. Bataille\" (actually Taxil himself) alleged that Palladists were Satanists based in Charleston, South Carolina, headed by the American Freemason Albert Pike and created by the Italian liberal patriot and author Giuseppe Mazzini.\nArthur Edward Waite, debunking the existence of the group in \"Devil-Worship in France, or The Question of Lucifer\", ch. II: \"The Mask of Masonry\" (London, 1896), reports according to \"the works of Domenico Margiotta and Dr Bataille\" that \"[t]he Order of Palladium founded in Paris 20 May 1737 or Sovereign Council of Wisdom\" was a \"Masonic diabolic order\". Dr. Bataille asserted that women would supposedly be initiated as \"Companions of Penelope\". According to Dr. Bataille, the society had two orders, \"Adelph\" and \"Companion of Ulysses\"; however, the society was broken up by French law enforcement a few years after its founding. A supposed Diana Vaughan published \"Confessions of an Ex-Palladist\" in 1895.\nConfession.\nOn April 19, 1897, L\u00e9o Taxil called a press conference at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie at which he claimed he would introduce Diana Vaughan to the press. He declared that his claims about the Freemasons were hoaxes.\nTaxil's confession was printed, in its entirety, in the Parisian newspaper \"Le Frondeur\", on April 25, 1897, titled: \"Twelve Years Under the Banner of the Church, The Prank Of Palladism. Miss Diana Vaughan\u2013The Devil At The Freemasons. A Conference held by M. L\u00e9o Taxil, at the Hall of the Geographic Society in Paris\".\nDespite this confession, belief in Vaughan and the Palladists did not entirely die out and a Palladist organization is central to the plot of the 1943 film, \"The Seventh Victim\". The hoax material is still cited to this day. The Chick Publications tract, \"The Curse of Baphomet\", and Randy Noblitt's book on satanic ritual abuse, \"Cult and Ritual Abuse\", both cite Taxil's fictitious claims.\nLater interview with Taxil.\nTen months before his death on March 31, 1907, Taxil was quoted in the American \"National Magazine\" as giving his true reasons behind the hoax.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Members of the Masonic orders understand the false exposure heaped upon that organization in anti-Mason wars. The Catholic church and many other religious orders have been the victims of these half-written and oftentimes venomous attacks. The confession of Taxil, the French Free-thinker, who first exposed Catholics and then Masons, makes interesting reading bearing on the present situation today. Similar motives actuate some of the \"muck rakes\" of today, as indicated in the following confession:\n\"The public made me what I am; the arch-liar of the period,\" confessed Taxil, \"for when I first commenced to write against the Masons my object was amusement pure and simple. The crimes I laid at their door were so grotesque, so impossible, so widely exaggerated, I thought everybody would see the joke and give me credit for originating a new line of humor. But my readers wouldn't have it so; they accepted my fables as gospel truth, and the more I lied for the purpose of showing that I lied, the more convinced became they that I was a paragon of veracity.\n\"Then it dawned upon me that there was lots of money in being a Munchausen of the right kind, and for twelve years I gave it to them hot and strong, but never too hot. When inditing such slush as the story of the devil snake who wrote prophecies on Diana's back with the end of his tail, I sometimes said to myself: 'Hold on, you are going too far,' but I didn't. My readers even took kindly to the yarn of the devil who, in order to marry a Mason, transformed himself into a crocodile, and, despite the masquerade, played the piano wonderfully well.&lt;br&gt;\n\"One day when lecturing at Lille, I told my audience that I had just had an apparition of Nautilus, the most daring affront on human credulity I had so far risked. But my hearers never turned a hair. 'Hear ye, the doctor has seen Nautulius,' they said with admiring glances. Of course no one had a clear idea of who Nautilus was, I didn't myself, but they assumed that he was a devil.\n\"Ah, the jolly evenings I spent with my fellow authors hatching out new plots, new, unheard of perversions of truth and logic, each trying to outdo the other in organized mystification. I thought I would kill myself laughing at some of the things proposed, but everything went; there is no limit to human stupidity\".\nThe Luciferian quote.\nA series of paragraphs about Lucifer are frequently associated with the Taxil hoax. They read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That which we must say to the world is that we worship a god, but it is the god that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the higher degrees, maintained in the Purity of the Luciferian doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay and his priests calumniate him?\nYes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods; darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive...\nThus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy, and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.\nWhile this quotation was published by Abel Clarin de la Rive in his \"Woman and Child in Universal Freemasonry\", it does not appear in Taxil's writings proper, though it is sourced in a footnote to Diana Vaughan, Taxil's creation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31156", "revid": "45397322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31156", "title": "Taiwan independence movement", "text": "Independence movement in East Asia\nThe Taiwan independence movement is a political movement which advocates the formal declaration of Taiwan as an independent and sovereign state, as opposed to Chinese unification in accordance to the One China policy or the status quo of co-existence in cross-strait relations.\nTaiwan's political status is ambiguous. Mainland China, under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), claims the island of Taiwan as a province of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Republic of China (ROC) consisting of Taiwan and other islands under its control exercise full autonomy in its internal governance and already conducts official diplomatic relations with and is recognized by 11 member states of the United Nations and the Holy See. The use of \"independence\" for Taiwan can be ambiguous. If some supporters articulate that they agree to the independence of Taiwan, they may either be referring to the notion of formally creating an independent Taiwanese state called the Republic of Taiwan or to the notion that Taiwan has become synonymous with the current Republic of China and is already independent (as reflected in the concept of \"Huadu\"). Since 2016, the current government, led by the independent-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has asserted that there is no need for a formal push for independence through legal means, maintaining that Taiwan is already an independent country called ROC.\nThe Taiwan independence movement is supported by the DPP and the broader Pan-Green Coalition given the threat posed to its sovereignty, regionalist identity, liberal democratic system and human rights. Radical activists advocate the ideal goal of de-Sinicization and Taiwanization of the island and society, although that sentiment is not always shared by the Pan-Green establishment, which favors a more pragmatic status quo under the ROC. The movement is opposed by the Kuomintang (KMT) and the broader Pan-Blue Coalition, which seeks to retain the somewhat ambiguous status quo of the ROC under the so-called \"1992 Consensus\" or gradually \"reunify\" with mainland China at some point. The process for a constitutional amendment in ROC or national territory alternation must be initiated by one-fourth (25%) of the members of the Legislative Yuan (the unicameral parliament of ROC), then voted in the Legislative Yuan with at least three-fourths (75%) members attended and by a three-fourths (75%) supermajority, then approved by majority popular vote in a referendum.\nThe CCP and the PRC government oppose Taiwanese independence, believing that Taiwan and mainland China comprise two portions of a single country's territory, and regards any moves toward independence as potentially triggering a military response under the Anti-Secession Law. According to the PRC's interpretation, the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration and the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 establish that Taiwan is part of the PRC under international law. The PRC has officially maintained its position of \"peaceful unification\" of Taiwan under a \"one country, two systems\" formula but does not rule out using military force, if necessary, to \"reunify\" the island should formal independence be declared. Under 2024 legal guidelines, the PRC regards advocating for Taiwan independence, regardless of jurisdiction, as a criminal offense that can be subject to capital punishment.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nTaiwan is an island in East Asia. The indigenous population, who came from nearby China, spoke Austronesian languages. These aboriginal people have lived on the island for over 6000 years and, before 1620, were its only inhabitants. Taiwan has been occupied by several nations, including Spain, the Netherlands, Ming and Qing Dynasty China, and Japan.\nAfter its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the KMT party, which had ruled Nationalist China since 1928, moved to Taiwan where they reigned until Chen Shui-bian of the DPP became president in 2000.\nEarly.\nFrom a pro-independence supporter's point of view, the movement for Taiwan independence began under Qing rule in the 1680s which led to a well known the saying, \"Every three years an uprising, every five years a rebellion\". Taiwan Independence supporters compared Taiwan under KMT rule to South Africa under apartheid. \nThe Taiwan independence movement under Japan was supported by Mao Zedong in the 1930s as a means of freeing Taiwan from Japanese rule.\nWith the end of World War II in 1945, by issuing \"General Order No. 1\" to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, the Allies agreed that the Republic of China Army under the KMT would \"temporarily occupy Taiwan, on behalf of the Allied forces.\"\nEarly CCP position on Taiwan.\nFrom 1928 to 1942, the CCP maintained that Taiwan was a separate nation. Mao Zedong was an early supporter of Taiwanese independence, telling Edgar Snow in the 1930s that the CCP would lend \"our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence.\" He changed this position only after the Nationalists started claiming Taiwan with the Cairo Declaration, challenging the status of China.\nMartial law period.\nThe modern-day political movement for Taiwan independence dates back to the Japanese colonial period, but it only became a viable political force within Taiwan in the 1990s. Taiwanese independence was advocated periodically during the Japanese colonial period, but was suppressed by the Japanese government. These efforts were the goal of the Taiwanese Communist Party of the late 1920s. Unlike current formulations, and in line with the thinking of the Comintern, such a state would have been a proletarian one. With the end of World War II in 1945, Japanese rule ended, but the subsequent autocratic rule of the KMT later revived calls for local rule. However, it was a movement supported by the Chinese students who were born on the Island and not associated with KMT. It found its roots in the US and Japan. In the 1950s, a Republic of Taiwan Provisional Government was set up in Japan. Thomas Liao was nominally the President. At one time it held quasi-official relations with the newly independent Indonesia. This was possible mainly through the connections between Sukarno and the Provisional Government's Southeast Asian liaison, Chen Chih-hsiung, who had assisted in Indonesia's local resistance movements against Japanese rule.\nAfter the transfer of power from Japan to the ROC, the focus of the movement was as a vehicle for discontent from the native Taiwanese against the rule of \"mainlanders\" (i.e. mainland Chinese-born people who fled to Taiwan with KMT in the late 1940s). The February 28 Incident in 1947 and the ensuing martial law that lasted until 1987 contributed to the period of White Terror on the island, persecuting not only indigenous leftists, but liberals and democracy advocates as well.\nBetween 1949 and 1991, the official position of the ROC government on Taiwan was that it was the legitimate government of all of China and it used this position as justification for authoritarian measures such as the refusal to vacate the seats held by delegates elected on the mainland in 1947 for the Legislative Yuan. The Taiwan independence movement intensified in response to this and presented an alternative vision of a sovereign and independent Taiwanese state. This vision was represented through a number of symbols such as the use of Taiwanese in opposition to the school-taught Mandarin Chinese.\nSeveral scholars drafted various versions of a constitution, as both political statement or vision and as intellectual exercise. Most of these drafts favor a bicameral parliament rather than presidential system. In at least one such draft, seats in the upper house would be divided equally among Taiwan's established ethnicities. In the 1980s the Chinese Nationalist government considered publication of these ideas criminal. In the most dramatic case, it decided to arrest the pro-independence publisher Cheng Nan-jung for publishing a version in his Tang-wai magazine, \"Liberty Era Weekly\" (). Rather than giving himself up, Cheng self-immolated in protest. Other campaigns and tactics toward such a State have included soliciting designs from the public for a new national flag and anthem (for example, \"Taiwan the Formosa\"). More recently the Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign () has played an active role. More traditional independence supporters, however, have criticized name rectification as merely a superficial tactic devoid of the larger vision inherent in the independence agenda.\nVarious overseas Taiwan independence movements, such as the Formosan Association, World United Formosans for Independence, United Young Formosans for Independence, Union for Formosa's Independence in Europe, United Formosans in America for Independence, and Committee for Human Rights in Formosa, published \"The Independent Formosa\" in several volumes with the publisher \"Formosan Association.\" In \"The Independent Formosa, Volumes 2\u20133\", they tried to justify Taiwanese collaboration with Japan during World War II by saying that the \"atmosphere covered the whole Japanese territories, including Korea and Formosa, and the Japanese mainlands as well\", when Taiwanese publications supported Japan's \"holy war\", and that the people who did it were not at fault.\nThe anti-communist KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek, President of the ROC on Taiwan, believed that the Americans were going to plot a coup against him in collusion with Taiwan independence activists. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the secret police, which he remained until 1965. Chiang also considered some people who were friends to Americans to be his enemies. An enemy of the Chiang family, Wu Kuo-chen, was kicked out of his position of governor of Taiwan by Chiang Ching-kuo and fled to America in 1953. Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet style military organization in the ROC Military. He reorganized and Sovietized the political officer corps, surveillance, and KMT party activities. Opposed to this was Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute. Chiang orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General Sun Li-jen in August 1955, for plotting a coup d'\u00e9tat with the American CIA against his father Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT. The CIA allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence.\nDuring the martial law era lasting until 1987, discussion of Taiwan independence was forbidden in Taiwan, at a time when recovery of the mainland and national unification were the stated goals of the ROC. During that time, many advocates of independence and other dissidents fled overseas, and carried out their advocacy work there, notably in Japan and the United States. Part of their work involved setting up think tanks, political organizations, and lobbying networks in order to influence the politics of their host countries, notably the United States, the ROC's main ally at the time, though they would not be very successful until much later. Within Taiwan, the independence movement was one of many dissident causes among the intensifying democracy movement of the 1970s, which culminated in the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident. The DPP was eventually formed to represent dissident causes.\nMultiparty period.\nAfter the lifting of martial law in 1987 and the acceptance of multi-party politics, the DPP became increasingly identified with Taiwan independence, which was added to its party platform in 1991. At the same time, many overseas independence advocates and organizations returned to Taiwan. For the first time, they openly promoted their cause and gradually built up political support. Many had previously fled to the US or Europe and had been on a blacklist held by the KMT, which had prevented them from returning to Taiwan. In their places of exile, they established organisations like the European Federation of Taiwanese Associations and the Formosan Association for Public Affairs. \nAs the electoral success of the DPP, and later, the DPP-led Pan-Green Coalition grew in recent years, the Taiwan independence movement shifted its focus to identity politics by proposing many plans involving symbolism and social engineering. The reinterpretation of historical events such as the February 28 Incident, the use of broadcast language and mother tongue education in schools, the official name and flag of the ROC, slogans in the army, and the orientation of maps all have been issues of concern to the present-day Taiwan independence movement activists.\nThe movement, which peaked in the 70s through the 90s with the Taiwan literature movement and other cultural upheavals, has moderated in recent years with the assimilation of these changes. Friction between \"mainlander\" and \"native\" communities on Taiwan has decreased due to shared interests, such as increasing economic ties with mainland China, continuing threats by the PRC to invade, and doubts as to whether or not the United States would support a unilateral declaration of independence. Since the late 1990s many supporters of Taiwan independence have argued that Taiwan, as the ROC, is already independent from the mainland, making a formal declaration unnecessary. In May 1999, the DPP formalized this position in its \"Resolution on Taiwan's Future\".\nLee Teng-hui administration (1988\u20132000).\nIn 1995, Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui was given permission to speak at Cornell University about his dream of Taiwanese independence, the first time a Taiwanese leader had been allowed to visit the United States. This led to a military response from China that included buying Russian submarines and conducting missile tests near Taiwan.\nChen Shui-bian administration (2000\u20132008).\nIn February 2007, President Chen Shui-bian initiated changes to names of state-owned enterprises, and the nation's embassies and overseas representative offices. As a result, Chunghwa Post Co. () was renamed Taiwan Post Co. () and Chinese Petroleum Corporation () is now called \"CPC Corporation, Taiwan\" () and the signs in Taiwan's embassies now display the word \"Taiwan\" in brackets after \"Republic of China\". In 2007, the Taiwan Post Co. issued stamps bearing the name \"Taiwan\" in remembrance of the February 28 Incident. However, the name of the post office was reverted to \"Chunghwa Post Co.\" following the inauguration of KMT president Ma Ying-jeou in 2008.\nThe Pan-Blue camp voiced its opposition to the changes and the former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said that it would generate diplomatic troubles and cause cross-strait tensions. It also argued that without a change in the relevant legislation pertaining to state-owned enterprises, the name changes of these enterprises could not be valid. As the Pan-Blue camp held only a slim parliamentary majority throughout the administration of President Chen, the Government's motion to change the law to this effect was blocked by the opposition. Later, U.S. Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack said that the U.S. does not support administrative steps that would appear to change the status-quo by either Taipei or Beijing as threats to regional security.\nFormer president Lee Teng-hui has stated that he never pursued Taiwanese independence. Lee views Taiwan as already an independent state, and that the call for \"Taiwanese independence\" could even confuse the international community by implying that Taiwan once viewed itself as part of China. From this perspective, Taiwan is independent even if it remains unable to enter the UN. Lee said the most important goals are to improve the people's livelihoods, build national consciousness, make a formal name change and draft a new constitution that reflects the present reality so that Taiwan can officially identify itself as a country.\nMa Ying-jeou administration (2008\u20132016).\nLegislative elections were held on 12 January 2008, resulting in a supermajority (86 of the 113 seats) in the legislature for the KMT and the Pan-Blue Coalition. President Chen Shui-bian's DPP was handed a heavy defeat, winning only the remaining 27 seats. The junior partner in the Pan-Green Coalition, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, won no seats.\nTwo months later, the election for the 12th-term President and vice-president of the Republic of China was held on Saturday, 22 March 2008. KMT nominee Ma Ying-jeou won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of DPP rule. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma's landslide victory brought the KMT back to power in Taiwan.\nOn 1 August 2008, the Board of Directors of Taiwan Post Co. resolved to reverse the name change and restored the name \"Chunghwa Post\". The Board of Directors, as well as resolving to restore the name of the corporation, also resolved to re-hire the chief executive dismissed in 2007, and to withdraw defamation proceedings against him.\nOn 2 September 2008, President Ma defined the relations between Taiwan and mainland China as \"special\", but \"not that between two states\" \u2013 they are relations based on two areas of one state, with Taiwan considering that state to be the ROC, and mainland China considering that state to be the PRC.\nMa's approach with the mainland is conspicuously evasive of political negotiations that may lead to unification which is the mainland's ultimate goal. The National Unification Guidelines remain \"frozen\" and Ma precluded any discussion of unification during his term by his \"three no's\" (no unification, no independence, and no use of force).\nTsai Ing-wen and Lai Ching-te administration (2016\u2013present).\nThe DPP, led by Tsai Ing-wen, won a landslide victory over the KMT in 2016 and was reelected in 2020. Her administration stated that it sought to maintain the current political status of Taiwan. The PRC government continued to criticize the ROC government, as the DPP administration has continued to not officially recognize the 1992 Consensus and the One China policy.\nLai Ching-te, the DPP candidate, won the presidential election in 2024. During the campaign period, Lai asserted Taiwanese sovereignty, adding that the ROC and PRC are \"not subordinate to each other\" but said a formal declaration of independence would be unnecessary and favored maintaining the status quo. He also said he would be willing to work with the Chinese government, but only if they renounce any intentions to use force against Taiwan.\nPositions.\nThe questions of independence and the island's relationship to mainland China are complex and inspire very strong emotions among Taiwanese people. There are some who continue to maintain the Kuomintang's position, which states that the ROC is the sole legitimate government for \"all\" of China (of which they consider Taiwan to be a part), and that the aim of the government should be eventual unification of the mainland and Taiwan under the rule of the ROC. Some argue that Taiwan has been, and should continue to be, completely independent from China and should become a Taiwanese state with a distinct name. Then, there are numerous positions running the entire spectrum between these two extremes, as well as differing opinions on how best to manage either situation should it ever be realized.\nTaiwan independence is supported by the Pan-Green Coalition in Taiwan, led by the centre-left DPP, but opposed by the Pan-Blue Coalition, led by the conservative KMT. The former coalition aims to eventually achieve full sovereign independence for Taiwan. Whereas, the latter coalition aims to improve relations with the Beijing government (PRC) \u2014 which it refers to as \"mainland China\" \u2014 and eventually \"reunify\" at some point.\nBoth factions have long been forced to precariously dance around the so-called \"status quo\" of Taiwan's political status. The DPP is unable to immediately declare independence due to pressure from the PRC and the KMT, whereas the KMT and PRC are unable to immediately achieve Chinese unification due to pressure from the DPP and its \"de facto\" allies (including the United States, Japan, and the European Union); further, the vast majority of Taiwanese as well as the KMT oppose the mainland's proposed one country, two systems solution.\nSupport for independence.\nThe first view considers the move for Taiwan independence as a nationalist movement. Historically, this was the view of such pro-independence groups as the Tangwai movement (which later grew into the DPP) who argued that the ROC under the KMT had been a \"foreign regime\" forcibly imposed on Taiwan. Since the 1990s, supporters of Taiwan independence no longer actively make this argument. Instead, the argument has been that, in order to survive the growing power of the PRC, Taiwan must view itself as a separate and distinct entity from \"China.\" Such a change in view involves: \nThe goal of this movement is the eventual creation of a country where China is a \"foreign\" entity, and Taiwan is an internationally recognized \"country\" separate from any concept of \"China.\" Some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that the Treaty of San Francisco justifies Taiwan independence by not explicitly granting Taiwan to either the ROC or the PRC, even though neither the PRC nor the ROC government accepts such legal justification.\nThe Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP) won a single seat in the Legislative Yuan in the 1998 legislative election. The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) was formed in 2001, and is also supportive of independence. Though it gained more legislative support than TAIP in elections, the TSU's legislative representation has dropped over time. In 2018, political parties and organizations demanding a referendum on Taiwan's independence formed an alliance to further their objective. The Formosa Alliance was established on 7 April 2018, prompted by a sense of crisis in the face of growing pressure from China for unification. The alliance wanted to hold a referendum on Taiwan's independence in April 2019, and change the island's name from the \"Republic of China\" to \"Taiwan,\" and apply for membership in the United Nations. In August 2019, another party supportive of independence, the Taiwan Action Party Alliance was founded.\n\"Huadu\" and \"Taidu\".\nWithin the Pan-Green Coalition of Taiwan, there are two main factions, the \"Huadu\" and \"Taidu\". The more moderate \"Huadu\" faction, mainly located in the DPP establishment, posits Taiwan and its outlying islands are \"already\" a sovereign state under the name \"Republic of China\"\",\" making a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. \"Huadu\" politics is the semi-official stance of the ruling DPP under the Lai Ching-te and Tsai Ing-wen administrations.\nConversely, the more radical \"Taidu\" faction advocates a more radical departure from the \"status quo\" by making a formal declaration of independence to create a \"de jure\" \"Republic of Taiwan\"; advocates for a \"de jure\" Taiwanese state can be found in smaller parties in the Pan-Green coalition, such as the Taiwan Statebuilding Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union, as well as in minority elements of the ruling DPP.\nThe term \"Taiwan independence movement\" is thus somewhat imprecise inasmuch its main representative, the DPP, does not support any change in the constitutional name of the Taiwanese state for the foreseeable future; they generally view the modern ROC as synonymous with a sovereign Taiwanese state; the incumbent President of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te of the DPP, believes that \"Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country called the Republic of China\".\nSupport for status quo.\nA second view is that Taiwan is already an independent nation with the official name \"Republic of China,\" which has been independent (i.e. de facto separate from mainland China/de jure separate from PRC) since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, when the ROC lost control of mainland China, with only Taiwan (including the Penghu islands), Kinmen (Quemoy), the Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian Province, and some of the islands in the South China Sea remaining under its administration. Although previously no major political faction adopted this pro-status quo viewpoint, because it is a \"compromise\" in face of PRC threats and American warnings against a unilateral declaration of independence, the DPP combined it with their traditional belief to form their latest official policy. \nThis viewpoint has not been adopted by more radical groups such as the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which favor only the view described above and are in favor of an independent Republic or State of Taiwan. In addition, many members of the Pan-Blue Coalition are rather suspicious of this view, fearing that adopting this definition of Taiwan independence is merely an insincere stealth tactical effort to advance de-sinicization and the radical view of Taiwan independence. As a result, supporters of Pan-Blue tend to make a clear distinction between Taiwan \"independence\" and Taiwan \"sovereignty\", while supporters of Pan-Green tend to try to blur the distinction between the two.\nMost Taiwanese and political parties of the ROC support the status quo and recognize de facto independence through sovereign self-rule. Even among those who believe Taiwan is and should remain independent, the threat of war from the PRC softens their approach, and they tend to support maintaining the status quo rather than pursuing an ideological path that could result in war with the PRC. When President Lee Teng-hui put forth the two-states policy, he received 80% support. A similar situation arose when President Chen Shui-bian declared that there was \"one country on each side\" of the Taiwan Strait. To this day, the parties disagree, sometimes bitterly, on such things as territory, name (ROC or Taiwan), future policies, and interpretations of history. The Pan-Blue Coalition and the PRC believe that Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian are intent on publicly promoting a moderate form of Taiwan independence in order to advance secretly deeper forms of Taiwan independence, and that they intend to use popular support on Taiwan for political separation to advance notions of cultural and economic separation.\nThe United States does not officially support Taiwanese independence, following its longstanding adherence to the \"One China policy\". However, the U.S. has a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" and opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait from either side.\nOpposition to independence.\nThe third view, put forward by the government of the PRC and the Kuomintang, defines Taiwan independence as \"splitting Taiwan from China, causing division of the nation and the people.\" What the PRC claims by this statement is somewhat ambiguous according to supporters of Taiwanese independence, as some statements by the PRC seem to identify China solely and uncompromisingly with the PRC. Others propose a broader and more flexible definition suggesting that both mainland China and Taiwan are parts that form one cultural and geographic entity, although divided politically as a vestige of the Chinese Civil War. Chinese nationalists have called the Taiwan independence movement and its supporters to be \"hanjian\" (traitors).\nThe Kuomintang and the broader Pan-Blue coalition believe that China should be unified under the ROC and opposes any attempts in de-sinicization that erases any links with China. Since 2016, divisions have emerged in the coalition following electoral defeats and widespread sentiments among the Taiwanese electorate that rejects any form of unification, with pro-Beijing elements beginning to infiltrate the ranks of the coalition through the united front that advocate unification under the PRC.\nThe PRC considers itself the sole legitimate government of all China, and the ROC to be a defunct entity replaced in the Communist revolution that succeeded in 1949. Therefore, assertions that the ROC is a sovereign state are construed as support for Taiwan independence, so are proposals to change the name of the ROC. Such a name change is met with even more disapproval since it rejects Taiwan as part of the greater China entity (as one side of a still-unresolved Chinese civil war). The ROC used to be recognized by the UN as the sole legal government of China until 1971. In that year, the UN Resolution 2758 was passed, and the PRC became recognized as the legal government of China by the UN.\nThe CCP classifies Taiwan independence activists as one of the Five Poisons. In 2005, the 10th National People's Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law authorizing military force for unification. In 2024, the Chinese government issued the Guidelines on Imposing Criminal Punishments on Diehard \"Taiwan independence\" Separatists for Conducting or Inciting Secession to the courts stating that \"diehard\" independence supporters could be tried \"in absentia\" with capital punishment imposed.\nLegal basis.\nThe 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki and 1951 Treaty of San Francisco are often cited as the main bases for Taiwan independence in international law if such things as \"self-determination\" and the Montevideo Convention (on the Rights and Duties of States) are to be disregarded. These two treaties are not recognized by the Beijing government and the Pan-Blue Coalition of Taiwan.\nUndetermined status theory.\nOne hypothesis as to a legal basis for an independent Taiwanese state, the theory of the undetermined status of Taiwan, posits that:\na) Japan gained sovereignty over Taiwan in 1895\nb) Japan lost sovereignty over Taiwan around 1951\u20131952 according to the Treaty of San Francisco\nc) The Treaty of San Francisco does not assign Taiwan to any power\nTherefore, some activists and legal scholars hold that, legally speaking, the island of Taiwan is not an integral part of the territory of the ROC (or any other internationally recognized state); its status is more similar to a League of Nations mandate or United Nations trust territory administered by the ROC pending a final decision.\nPRC position.\nThe PRC government regards these agreements as irrelevant to the Taiwan issue, arguing that the Treaty of Shimonoseki (being an unequal treaty) has been nullified and that the Treaty of San Francisco assigns Taiwan to China. It also cites the Potsdam Declaration and Cairo Communique as confirming Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan; inasmuch as the PRC is the internationally recognized \"China\", it thus posits that it is the lawful sovereign power on the island. The United Nations currently recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of China (and thus, implicitly, the PRC).\n2024 guidelines.\nIn 2024, the PRC issued the Guidelines on Imposing Criminal Punishments on Diehard \"Taiwan independence\" Separatists for Conducting or Inciting Secession, based partially on the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, stating that supporters of Taiwanese independence, regardless of their location, could be tried \"in absentia\" and sentenced to death by Chinese courts.\nKinmen and Matsu issue.\nKinmen and Matsu are unique and important for several reasons. The islands straddle the southeastern coastline of mainland China, only a few kilometers away from mainland China's Fujian Province. They are geographically defined as being part of mainland China rather than Taiwan. The islands are defined as comprising the truncated, streamlined Fujian Province (officially \"Fuchien Province\") of the ROC on Taiwan.\nWithin Taiwan, the radical camp believes that Kinmen County (Quemoy) and Lienchiang County (Matsu) should be abandoned from a potential independent and sovereign Taiwanese state. This view aligns with the aforementioned treaties and acts that do not define Kinmen and Matsu as being part of Taiwan. This same camp also believes that the PRC has only \"allowed\" the ROC to continue controlling Kinmen and Matsu in order to \"tether\" Taiwan to mainland China. The fact that the PRC propagandizes Kinmen and Matsu is evidence that this is true to at least a certain degree. In a hypothetical scenario where Kinmen and Matsu are abandoned by the Taiwanese state, they would likely be \"ceded\" to the PRC via a peace treaty, officially ending the Chinese Civil War. Many domestic and foreign defense analysts also grimly conclude that the islands could likely be easily taken by the PLA given its short distance from the mainland should the Chinese choose to do so, and many inhabitants identify with China and would likely not resist due to their shared identity and ethnicity.\nAlso within Taiwan, the moderate camp believes that Quemoy and Matsu belong to Taiwan. This camp believes that the ROC and Taiwan have become one and the same. By this logic, Taiwan effectively owns all of the same territories that the ROC is said to own. Among these territories is Quemoy and Matsu. If a potential Taiwanese state were to be created, this camp believes that the new country will actually be the successor state to the ROC, rather than an entirely new country. Therefore, if Taiwan independence were to be successfully achieved, then the islands of Quemoy and Matsu would hypothetically cease to be administered as \"Fujian Province\", and would instead simply be classified as \"satellite islands of Taiwan\" (much in the same way as Penghu).\nDespite the differing views of these two camps, there is a general understanding throughout Taiwan that Quemoy and Matsu are not part of the historical region of \"Taiwan\", due to having never been governed under the following regimes: Dutch Formosa, Spanish Formosa, Kingdom of Tungning, Republic of Formosa, and Japanese Formosa. Additionally, Quemoy and Matsu experienced a unique history for several years as military outposts of the ROC, further separating the islands from Taiwan in terms of culture.\nOpinion polls.\nSeveral polls have indicated an increase in support of Taiwanese independence in the three decades after 1990. In a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) poll conducted in June 2020, 54% of respondents supported \"de jure\" independence for Taiwan, 23.4% preferred maintaining the status quo, 12.5% favored unification with China, and 10% did not hold any particular view on the matter. This represented the highest level of support for Taiwanese independence since the survey was first conducted in 1991. A later TPOF poll in 2022 showed similar results, as 50% said they support Taiwan independence, 11.8% were for unification, 25.7% were for maintaining status quo. In the Taiwan Independence vs. Unification with the Mainland Survey by The Election Study Center of National Chengchi University there has been a steady increase in respondents choosing \"maintain the status quo and move toward independence in the future\" since the survey began in 1994. However, the option \"maintain the status quo indefinitely\" had a similar increase in the same period and the most popular option was \"maintain the status quo and decide in the future between independence or unification\" every year between 1994 and 2022. The option \"independence as soon as possible\" never went above 10% in the same time period. \"Unification as soon as possible\" has been more unpopular \u2013 never going above 4.5%.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31158", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31158", "title": "Trident (missile)", "text": "American class of submarine-launched ballistic missile\nThe Trident missile is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Trident missiles are carried by twelve United States Navy s, with American warheads, as well as four Royal Navy s, with British warheads. The missile is named after the mythological trident of Neptune.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1971, the US Navy began studies of an advanced Undersea Long-range Missile System (ULMS). A Decision Coordinating Paper (DCP) for the ULMS was approved on 14 September 1971. ULMS program outlined a long-term modernization plan, which proposed the development of a longer-range missile termed ULMS II, which was to achieve twice the range of the existing Poseidon (ULMS I) missile. In addition to a longer-range missile, a larger submarine was proposed to replace the , and -class SSBNs in 1978. The ULMS II missile system was designed to be retrofitted to the existing SSBNs, while also being fitted to the proposed .\nIn May 1972, the term ULMS II was replaced with Trident. The Trident was to be a larger, higher-performance missile with a range capacity greater than . The first test of the Trident was on 18 January 1977 when an unarmed missile was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida and traveled almost its full range of , to a point in the South Atlantic Ocean near Ascension Island.\nTrident I (designated as \"C4\") was deployed in 1979 and retired in 2005. Its objective was to achieve performance similar to Poseidon (C3) but at extended range. Trident II (designated \"D5\") had the objective of improved circular error probable (CEP), or accuracy, and was first deployed in 1990, and was planned to be in service for the thirty-year life of the submarines, until 2027.\nTrident missiles are provided to the United Kingdom under the terms of the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement which was modified in 1982 for Trident. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to President Carter on 10 July 1980, to request that he approve supply of Trident I missiles. However, in 1982 Thatcher wrote to President Reagan to request the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the Trident II system, the procurement of which had been accelerated by the US Navy. This was agreed upon in March 1982. Under the agreement, the United Kingdom paid an additional 5% of their total procurement cost of $2.5 billion to the US government as a research and development contribution.\nThe total cost of the Trident program thus far came to $39.546 billion in 2011, with a cost of $70 million per missile.\nIn 2009, the United States upgraded the warheads carried by American D5 missiles with an arming, fuzing and firing (AF&amp;F) system called the \"super-fuze\" that allows them to time their detonation to target silos and bunkers more accurately, greatly increasing their effectiveness against hardened targets.\nDescription.\nThe launch from the submarine occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge in a separate container. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike is strong enough to eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000\u00a0ft/s (6,000\u00a0m/s), or 13,600\u00a0mph (21,600\u00a0km/h) Mach 18. Minutes after launch, the missile is outside the atmosphere and on a sub-orbital trajectory. \nThe guidance system for the missile was developed by the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory and is maintained by a joint Draper/General Dynamics Mission Systems facility. It is an inertial navigation system with an additional star-sighting system (this combination is known as astro-inertial guidance), which is used to correct small position and velocity errors that result from launch condition uncertainties due to errors in the submarine navigation system and errors that may have accumulated in the guidance system during the flight due to imperfect instrument calibration. GPS has been used on some test flights but is assumed not to be available for a real mission. The fire control system was designed and continues to be maintained by General Dynamics Mission Systems. Once the star-sighting has been completed, the \"bus\" section of the missile maneuvers to achieve the various velocity vectors that will send the deployed multiple independent reentry vehicles to their individual targets. The downrange and crossrange dispersion of the targets remains classified.\nThe Trident was built in two variants: the I (C4) UGM-96A and II (D5) UGM-133A; however, these two missiles have little in common. While the C4, formerly known as EXPO (Extended Range Poseidon), is just an improved version of the Poseidon C-3 missile, the Trident II D-5 has a completely new design (although with some technologies adopted from the C-4). The C4 and D5 designations put the missiles within the \"family\" that started in 1960 with Polaris (A1, A2 and A3) and continued with the 1971 Poseidon (C3). Both Trident versions are three-stage, solid-propellant, inertially guided missiles, and both guidance systems use a star sighting to improve overall weapons system accuracy.\nTrident I (C4) UGM-96A.\nThe first eight \"Ohio\"-class submarines were built with the Trident I missiles.\nTrident II (D5) UGM-133A.\nThe second variant of the Trident is more sophisticated and can carry a heavier payload. It is accurate enough to be a first strike, counterforce, or second strike weapon. All three stages of the Trident II are made of graphite epoxy, making the missile much lighter. The Trident II was the original missile on the British \"Vanguard\"-class and American \"Ohio\"-class SSBNs from \"Tennessee\" on. The D5 missile is currently carried by fourteen \"Ohio\"-class and four \"Vanguard\"-class SSBNs. There have been 191 successful test flights of the D5 missile since design completion in 1989, the most recent being from in September 2023. There have been fewer than 10 test flights that were failures, the most recent being from in January 2024. This is the second failure in a row for the Royal Navy after a launch from , one of Britain's four nuclear-armed submarines, off the coast of Florida in June 2016.\nThe Royal Navy operates their missiles from a shared pool, together with the Atlantic squadron of the U.S. Navy \"Ohio\"-class SSBNs at King's Bay, Georgia. The pool is 'co-mingled' and missiles are selected at random for loading on to either nation's submarines.\nD5LE (D5 Life Extension Program).\nIn 2002, the United States Navy announced plans to extend the life of the submarines and the D5 missiles to the year 2040. This requires a D5 Life Extension Program (D5LEP), which is currently underway. The main aim is to replace obsolete components at minimal cost by using commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware; all the while maintaining the demonstrated performance of the existing Trident II missiles. In 2007, Lockheed Martin was awarded a total of $848 million in contracts to perform this and related work, which also includes upgrading the missiles' reentry systems. On the same day, Draper Labs was awarded $318 million for upgrade of the guidance system. Then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined plans in Parliament on 4 December 2006 to build a new generation of submarines (Dreadnought-class) to carry existing Trident missiles, and join the D5LE project to refurbish them.\nThe first flight test of a D-5 LE subsystem, the MK 6 Mod 1 guidance system, in Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO)-23, took place on on 22 February 2012. This was almost exactly 22 years after the first Trident II missile was launched from \"Tennessee\" in February 1990.\nD5LE2 (D5 Life Extension Program 2).\nUS Navy Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, in charge of overall submarine weapons systems procurement, indicated in 2020 that he had initiated trade studies to apply lessons from the D5LE program to extend the Trident II's lifespan to 2084. Wolfe said he expected the first D5LE2 missiles to be deployed aboard the ninth \"Columbia\"-class submarine by FY 2039.\nConventional Trident.\nThe Pentagon proposed the Conventional Trident Modification program in 2006 to diversify its strategic options, as part of a broader long-term strategy to develop worldwide rapid strike capabilities, dubbed \"Prompt Global Strike\".\nThe $503 million program would have converted existing Trident II missiles (presumably two missiles per submarine) into conventional weapons, by fitting them with modified Mk4 reentry vehicles equipped with GPS for navigation update and a reentry guidance and control (trajectory correction) segment to perform 10-meter class impact accuracy. No explosive is said to be used since the reentry vehicle's mass and hypersonic impact velocity provide sufficient mechanical energy and \"effect\". The second conventional warhead version is a fragmentation version that would disperse thousands of tungsten rods which could obliterate an area of 3000 square feet (approximately 280 square meters). It offered the promise of accurate conventional strikes with little warning and flight time.\nThe primary drawback of using conventionally armed ballistic missiles is that to missile warning systems, they are virtually indistinguishable from nuclear armed missiles. This leaves open the likelihood that other nuclear-armed countries might mistake it for a nuclear launch which could provoke a counterattack. For that reason among others, this project raised a substantial debate before the US Congress for the FY07 Defense budget, but also internationally. Russian President Vladimir Putin, among others, warned that the project would increase the danger of accidental nuclear war. \"The launch of such a missile could\u2026 provoke a full-scale counterattack using strategic nuclear forces,\" Putin said in May 2006.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and underwater explosions (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind, or tides, which are in turn generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water from a large event.\nTsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer. Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide. For this reason, it is often referred to as a tidal wave, although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis. Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves, with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called \"wave train\". Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean.\nThe Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes, but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century, and much remains unknown. Major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do. This ongoing research is designed to help accurately forecast the passage of tsunamis across oceans as well as how tsunami waves interact with shorelines.\nTerminology.\nTsunami.\nThe term \"tsunami\" is a borrowing from the Japanese , meaning 'harbour wave'. For the plural, one can either follow ordinary English practice and add an \"s\", or use an invariable plural as in the Japanese. Some English speakers alter the word's initial to an by dropping the \"t,\" since English does not natively permit at the beginning of words, though the original Japanese pronunciation is . The term has become commonly accepted in English, although its literal Japanese meaning is not necessarily descriptive of the waves, which do not occur only in harbours.\nTidal wave.\nTsunamis are sometimes referred to as \"tidal waves\". This once-popular term derives from the most common appearance of a tsunami, which is that of an extraordinarily high tidal bore. Tsunamis and tides both produce waves of water that move inland, but in the case of a tsunami, the inland movement of water may be much greater, giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide. In recent years, the term \"tidal wave\" has fallen out of favour, especially in the scientific community, because the causes of tsunamis have nothing to do with those of tides, which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of water. Although the meanings of \"tidal\" include \"resembling\" or \"having the form or character of\" tides, use of the term \"tidal wave\" is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers.\nSeismic sea wave.\nThe term seismic sea wave is also used to refer to the phenomenon because the waves most often are generated by seismic activity such as earthquakes. Prior to the rise of the use of the term \"tsunami\" in English, scientists generally encouraged the use of the term \"seismic sea wave\" rather than \"tidal wave\". However, like \"tidal wave\", \"seismic sea wave\" is not a completely accurate term, as forces other than earthquakes\u2014including underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, land or ice slumping into the ocean, meteorite impacts, and the weather when the atmospheric pressure changes very rapidly\u2014can generate such waves by displacing water.\nOther terms.\nThe use of the term \"tsunami\" for waves created by landslides entering bodies of water has become internationally widespread in both scientific and popular literature, although such waves are distinct in origin from large waves generated by earthquakes. This distinction sometimes leads to the use of other terms for landslide-generated waves, including landslide-triggered tsunami, displacement wave, non-seismic wave, impact wave, and, simply, giant wave.\nA tsunami which cannot be linked to an earthquake is sometimes termed an \"orphan tsunami\". This may happen in the case of tsunamis caused in the distant past, before international communications, by earthquakes far away, such as a tsunami in Japan caused by an earthquake in the Americas.\nHistory.\nJapan has the longest recorded history of tsunamis.\nAs early as 426 BC the Greek historian Thucydides inquired in his book \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" about the causes of tsunami, and was the first to argue that ocean earthquakes must be the cause. The oldest human record of a tsunami dates back to 479 BC, in the Greek colony of Potidaea, thought to be triggered by an earthquake. The tsunami may have saved the colony from an invasion by the Achaemenid Empire.\nThe cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back, and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident could happen.\nThe Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus (\"Res Gestae\" 26.10.15\u201319) described the typical sequence of a tsunami, including an incipient earthquake, the sudden retreat of the sea and a following gigantic wave, after the 365 AD tsunami devastated Alexandria.\nTsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of Europe. Of historical and current (with regard to risk assumptions) importance are the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami (which was caused by the Azores\u2013Gibraltar transform fault), the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes, each causing several tens of thousands of deaths and the 1908 Messina earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the deadliest natural disasters in modern Europe. The Storegga Slide in the Norwegian Sea and some examples of tsunamis affecting the British Isles refer to landslide and meteotsunamis, predominantly and less to earthquake-induced waves.\nThe destruction caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times, killing around 230,000 people. The Sumatran region is also accustomed to tsunamis, due to earthquakes of varying magnitudes that occur regularly off the coast of the island.\nCauses.\nThe principal generation mechanism of a tsunami is the displacement of a substantial volume of water or perturbation of the sea. This displacement of water is usually caused by earthquakes, but can also be attributed to landslides, volcanic eruptions, glacier calvings or more rarely by meteorites and nuclear tests. However, the possibility of a meteorite causing a tsunami is debated.\nSeismicity.\nTsunamis can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Tectonic earthquakes are a particular kind of earthquake that are associated with the Earth's crustal deformation; when these earthquakes occur beneath the sea, the water above the deformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position. More specifically, a tsunami can be generated when thrust faults associated with convergent or destructive plate boundaries move abruptly, resulting in water displacement, owing to the vertical component of movement involved. Movement on normal (extensional) faults can also cause displacement of the seabed, but only the largest of such events (typically related to flexure in the outer trench swell) cause enough displacement to give rise to a significant tsunami, such as the 1977 Sumba and 1933 Sanriku events.\nTsunamis have a small wave height offshore, and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometres long, whereas normal ocean waves have a wavelength of only 30 or 40 metres), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell usually about above the normal sea surface. They grow in height when they reach shallower water, in a wave shoaling process described below. A tsunami can occur in any tidal state and even at low tide can still inundate coastal areas.\nOn April 1, 1946, the 8.6 Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (\"Strong\"). It generated a tsunami which inundated Hilo on the island of Hawaii with a surge. Between 165 and 173 were killed. It also destroyed the village in the Halawa Valley of Molokai, though the residents fled to higher ground when some saw the ocean recede, and rang alarm bells, so nobody was killed, though the village was obliterated. The area where the earthquake occurred is where the Pacific Ocean floor is subducting (or being pushed downwards) under Alaska.\nExamples of tsunamis originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include Storegga about 8,000 years ago, Grand Banks in 1929, and Papua New Guinea in 1998 (Tappin, 2001). The Grand Banks and Papua New Guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments, causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami. They dissipated before travelling transoceanic distances.\nThe cause of the Storegga sediment failure is unknown. Possibilities include an overloading of the sediments, an earthquake or a release of gas hydrates (methane etc.).\nThe 1960 Valdivia earthquake (\"M\"w 9.5), 1964 Alaska earthquake (\"M\"w 9.2), 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (\"M\"w 9.2), and 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake (\"M\"w9.0) are recent examples of powerful megathrust earthquakes that generated tsunamis (known as teletsunamis) that can cross entire oceans. Smaller (\"M\"w 4.2) earthquakes in Japan can trigger tsunamis (called local and regional tsunamis) that can devastate stretches of coastline, but can do so in only a few minutes at a time.\nLandslides.\nThe Tauredunum event was a large tsunami on Lake Geneva in 563 CE, caused by sedimentary deposits destabilised by a landslide.\nIn the 1950s, it was discovered that tsunamis larger than had previously been believed possible can be caused by giant submarine landslides. These large volumes of rapidly displaced water transfer energy at a faster rate than the water can absorb. Their existence was confirmed in 1958, when a giant landslide in Lituya Bay, Alaska, caused the highest wave ever recorded, which had a height of . The wave did not travel far as it struck land almost immediately. The wave struck three boats\u2014each with two people aboard\u2014anchored in the bay. One boat rode out the wave, but the wave sank the other two, killing both people aboard one of them.\nAnother landslide-tsunami event occurred in 1963 when a massive landslide from Monte Toc entered the reservoir behind the Vajont Dam in Italy. The resulting wave surged over the -high dam by and destroyed several towns. Around 2,000 people died. Scientists named these waves megatsunamis.\nSome geologists claim that large landslides from volcanic islands, e.g. Cumbre Vieja on La Palma (Cumbre Vieja tsunami hazard) in the Canary Islands, may be able to generate megatsunamis that can cross oceans, but this is disputed by many others.\nIn general, landslides generate displacements mainly in the shallower parts of the coastline, and there is conjecture about the nature of large landslides that enter the water. This has been shown to subsequently affect water in enclosed bays and lakes, but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history. Susceptible locations are believed to be the Big Island of Hawaii, Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands, La Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and Cumbre Vieja on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands; along with other volcanic ocean islands. This is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing. However, there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are.\nVolcanic eruptions.\nOther than by landslides or sector collapse, volcanoes may be able to generate waves by pyroclastic flow submergence, caldera collapse, or underwater explosions. Tsunamis have been triggered by a number of volcanic eruptions. The best-known is perhaps the massive tsunami caused by the eruption of the Santorini volcano around 1600 BC, which is often mentioned as driving the destruction of many harbours in the region and ultimately the decline of Minoan civilization - a question still subject to open debate. Others include the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and the 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha'apai eruption. Over 20% of all fatalities caused by volcanism during the past 250 years are estimated to have been caused by volcanogenic tsunamis.\nDebate has persisted over the origins and source mechanisms of such tsunamis as those generated by Krakatoa in 1883, and they remain lesser understood than their seismic relatives. This poses the larger problem of awareness and preparedness, as exemplified by the eruption and collapse of Anak Krakatoa in 2018, which killed 426 and injured thousands when no warning was available. In all cases, developing better tsunami forecasting models and assessing the risks for densely populated coastal areas to be hit by severe tsunamis is a matter of global priority. \nIt is still regarded that lateral landslides and ocean-entering pyroclastic currents are most likely to generate the largest and most hazardous waves from volcanism; however, field investigation of the Tongan event, as well as developments in numerical modelling methods, currently aim to expand the understanding of the other source mechanisms.\nMeteorological.\nSome meteorological conditions, especially rapid changes in barometric pressure, as seen with the passing of a front, can displace bodies of water enough to cause trains of waves with wavelengths. These are comparable to seismic tsunamis, but usually with lower energies. Essentially, they are dynamically equivalent to seismic tsunamis, the only differences being 1) that meteotsunamis lack the transoceanic reach of significant seismic tsunamis, and 2) that the force that displaces the water is sustained over some length of time such that meteotsunamis cannot be modelled as having been caused instantaneously. In spite of their lower energies, on shorelines where they can be amplified by resonance, they are sometimes powerful enough to cause localised damage and potential for loss of life. They have been documented in many places, including the Great Lakes, the Aegean Sea, the English Channel, and the Balearic Islands, where they are common enough to have a local name, \"rissaga\". In Sicily they are called \"marubbio\" and in Nagasaki Bay, they are called \"abiki\". Some examples of destructive meteotsunamis include 31 March 1979 at Nagasaki and 15 June 2006 at Menorca, the latter causing damage in the tens of millions of euros.\nMeteotsunamis should not be confused with storm surges, which are local increases in sea level associated with the low barometric pressure of passing tropical cyclones, nor should they be confused with setup, the temporary local raising of sea level caused by strong on-shore winds. Storm surges and setup are also dangerous causes of coastal flooding in severe weather but their dynamics are completely unrelated to tsunami waves. They are unable to propagate beyond their sources, as waves do.\nHuman-made or triggered tsunamis.\nThe accidental Halifax Explosion in 1917 triggered an high tsunami in the harbour at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.\nThere have been studies of the potential for the use of explosives to induce tsunamis as a tectonic weapon. As early as World War II (1939\u20131945), consideration of the use of conventional explosives was explored, and New Zealand's military forces initiated Project Seal, which attempted to create small tsunamis with explosives in the area of what is now Shakespear Regional Park at the tip of the Whangapar\u0101oa Peninsula in the Auckland Region of New Zealand; the attempt failed.\nThere has been considerable speculation about the possibility of using nuclear weapons to cause tsunamis near an enemy coastline. Nuclear testing in the Pacific Proving Ground by the United States generated poor results. In Operation Crossroads in July 1946, two bombs were detonated, one in the air over and one underwater within the shallow waters of the deep lagoon at Bikini Atoll. The bombs detonated about from the nearest island, where the waves were no higher than when they reached the shoreline. Other underwater tests, mainly Operation Hardtack I/Wahoo in deep water and Operation Hardtack I/Umbrella in shallow water, confirmed the results. Analysis of the effects of shallow and deep underwater explosions indicate that the energy of the explosions does not easily generate the kind of deep, all-ocean waveforms typical of tsunamis because most of the energy creates steam, causes vertical fountains above the water, and creates compressional waveforms. Tsunamis are hallmarked by permanent large vertical displacements of very large volumes of water which do not occur in explosions.\nCharacteristics.\nTsunamis are caused by earthquakes, landslides, volcanic explosions, glacier calvings, and bolides. They cause damage by two mechanisms: the smashing force of a wall of water travelling at high speed, and the destructive power of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying a large amount of debris with it, even with waves that do not appear to be large.\nWhile everyday wind waves have a wavelength (from crest to crest) of about and a height of roughly , a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to . Such a wave travels at well over , but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about . This makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water, where ships are unable to feel their passage.\nThe velocity of a tsunami can be calculated by obtaining the square root of the depth of the water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10\u00a0m/s2). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the velocity of a tsunami would be \u221a5000 \u00d7 10 = \u221a50000 \u2248 , which equates to a speed of about . This is the formula used for calculating the velocity of shallow-water waves. Even the deep ocean is shallow in this sense because a tsunami wave is so long (horizontally from crest to crest) by comparison.\nThe reason for the Japanese name \"harbour wave\" is that sometimes a village's fishermen would sail out, and encounter no unusual waves while out at sea fishing, and come back to land to find their village devastated by a huge wave.\nAs the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, wave shoaling compresses the wave and its speed decreases below . Its wavelength diminishes to less than and its amplitude grows enormously\u2014in accord with Green's law. Since the wave still has the same very long period, the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height. Except for the very largest tsunamis, the approaching wave does not break, but rather appears like a fast-moving tidal bore. Open bays and coastlines adjacent to very deep water may shape the tsunami further into a step-like wave with a steep-breaking front.\nWhen the tsunami's wave peak reaches the shore, the resulting temporary rise in sea level is termed \"run up\". Run up is measured in metres above a reference sea level. A large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving over a period of hours, with significant time between the wave crests. The first wave to reach the shore may not have the highest run-up.\nAbout 80% of tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean, but they are possible wherever there are large bodies of water, including lakes. However, tsunami interactions with shorelines and the seafloor topography are extremely complex, which leaves some countries more vulnerable than others. For example, the Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico lie adjacent to each other, but the United States has recorded ten tsunamis in the region since 1788, while Mexico has recorded twenty-five since 1732. Similarly, Japan has had more than a hundred tsunamis in recorded history, while the neighbouring island of Taiwan has registered only two, in 1781 and 1867.\nDrawback.\nAll waves have a positive and negative peak; that is, a ridge and a trough. In the case of a propagating wave like a tsunami, either may be the first to arrive. If the first part to arrive at the shore is the ridge, a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land. However, if the first part to arrive is a trough, a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically, exposing normally submerged areas. The drawback can exceed hundreds of metres, and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed.\nA typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about twelve minutes. Thus, the sea recedes in the drawback phase, with areas well below sea level exposed after three minutes. For the next six minutes, the wave trough builds into a ridge which may flood the coast, and destruction ensues. During the next six minutes, the wave changes from a ridge to a trough, and the flood waters recede in a second drawback. Victims and debris may be swept into the ocean. The process repeats with succeeding waves.\nScales of intensity and magnitude.\nAs with earthquakes, several attempts have been made to set up scales of tsunami intensity or magnitude to allow comparison between different events.\nIntensity scales.\nThe first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunamis were the \"Sieberg-Ambraseys scale\" (1962), used in the Mediterranean Sea and the \"Imamura-Iida intensity scale\" (1963), used in the Pacific Ocean. The latter scale was modified by Soloviev (1972), who calculated the tsunami intensity \"I\" according to the formula:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the \"tsunami height\" in metres, averaged along the nearest coastline, with the tsunami height defined as the rise of the water level above the normal tidal level at the time of occurrence of the tsunami. This scale, known as the \"Soloviev-Imamura tsunami intensity scale\", is used in the global tsunami catalogues compiled by the NGDC/NOAA and the Novosibirsk Tsunami Laboratory as the main parameter for the size of the tsunami.\nThis formula yields:\nIn 2013, following the intensively studied tsunamis in 2004 and 2011, a new 12-point scale was proposed, the Integrated Tsunami Intensity Scale (ITIS-2012), intended to match as closely as possible to the modified ESI2007 and EMS earthquake intensity scales.\nMagnitude scales.\nThe first scale that genuinely calculated a magnitude for a tsunami, rather than an intensity at a particular location was the ML scale proposed by Murty &amp; Loomis based on the potential energy. Difficulties in calculating the potential energy of the tsunami mean that this scale is rarely used. Abe introduced the \"tsunami magnitude scale formula_7\", calculated from,\nformula_8\nwhere \"h\" is the maximum tsunami-wave amplitude (in m) measured by a tide gauge at a distance \"R\" from the epicentre, \"a\", \"b\" and \"D\" are constants used to make the Mt scale match as closely as possible with the moment magnitude scale.\nTsunami heights.\nSeveral terms are used to describe the different characteristics of tsunami in terms of their height:\nWarnings and predictions.\nDrawbacks can serve as a brief warning. People who observe drawback (many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound) can survive only if they immediately run for high ground or seek the upper floors of nearby buildings.\nIn 2004, ten-year-old Tilly Smith of Surrey, England, was on Maikhao beach in Phuket, Thailand with her parents and sister, and having learned about tsunamis recently in school, told her family that a tsunami might be imminent. Her parents warned others minutes before the wave arrived, saving dozens of lives. She credited her geography teacher, Andrew Kearney.\nIn the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami drawback was not reported on the African coast or any other east-facing coasts that it reached. This was because the initial wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the megathrust and upwards on the western side. The western pulse hit coastal Africa and other western areas.\nA tsunami cannot be precisely predicted, even if the magnitude and location of an earthquake is known. Geologists, oceanographers, and seismologists analyse each earthquake and based on many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami, and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives. One of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors, attached to buoys, which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column.\nRegions with a high tsunami risk typically use tsunami warning systems to warn the population before the wave reaches land. On the west coast of the United States, which is prone to tsunamis from the Pacific Ocean, warning signs indicate evacuation routes. In Japan, the populace is well-educated about earthquakes and tsunamis, and along Japanese shorelines, tsunami warning signs remind people of the natural hazards along with a network of warning sirens, typically at the top of the cliffs of surrounding hills.\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning System is based in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi. It monitors Pacific Ocean seismic activity. A sufficiently large earthquake magnitude and other information triggers a tsunami warning. While the subduction zones around the Pacific are seismically active, not all earthquakes generate a tsunami. Computers assist in analysing the tsunami risk of every earthquake that occurs in the Pacific Ocean and the adjoining land masses.\nAs a direct result of the Indian Ocean tsunami, a re-appraisal of the tsunami threat for all coastal areas is being undertaken by national governments and the United Nations Disaster Mitigation Committee. A tsunami warning system is being installed in the Indian Ocean.\nComputer models can predict tsunami arrival, usually within minutes of the arrival time. Bottom pressure sensors can relay information in real time. Based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor's shape (bathymetry) and coastal topography, the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami. All Pacific Rim countries collaborate in the Tsunami Warning System and most regularly practise evacuation and other procedures. In Japan, such preparation is mandatory for government, local authorities, emergency services and the population.\nAlong the United States west coast, in addition to sirens, warnings are sent on television and radio via the National Weather Service, using the Emergency Alert System.\nPossible animal reaction.\nSome zoologists hypothesise that some animal species have an ability to sense subsonic Rayleigh waves from an earthquake or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes and tsunamis. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the Lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in Sri Lanka in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants' reaction was to move away from the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.\nMitigation.\nIn some tsunami-prone countries, earthquake engineering measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused onshore.\nJapan, where tsunami science and response measures first began following a disaster in 1896, has produced ever-more elaborate countermeasures and response plans. The country has built many tsunami walls of up to high to protect populated coastal areas. Other localities have built floodgates of up to high and channels to redirect the water from an incoming tsunami. However, their effectiveness has been questioned, as tsunamis often overtop the barriers.\nThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was directly triggered by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, when waves exceeded the height of the plant's sea wall and flooded the emergency generators. Iwate Prefecture, which is an area at high risk from tsunami, had tsunami barriers walls (Taro sea wall) totalling long at coastal towns. The 2011 tsunami toppled more than 50% of the walls and caused catastrophic damage.\nThe Okushiri, Hokkaid\u014d tsunami, which struck within two to five minutes of the earthquake on July 12, 1993, created waves tall\u2014as high as a 10-storey building. The port town of Aonae was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall, but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood-framed structures in the area. The wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami, but it did not prevent major destruction and loss of life.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was initially a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham) until 1952 (the Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\nThe Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II in the 17th century, the monarch would traditionally prepare for several nights at the Tower, and lead a procession from there to Westminster Abbey for their coronation. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower was in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the Princes in the Tower were housed at the castle when they mysteriously disappeared, presumed murdered. Under the Tudors, the Tower was used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.\nThe zenith of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Elizabeth Throckmorton, were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \"sent to the Tower\". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the world wars of the 20th century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures.\nIn the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, operated by the Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House, and guarded by the Yeomen Warders, the property is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.\nArchitecture.\nLayout.\nThe Tower was oriented with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking Saxon London, which archaeologist Alan Vince suggests was deliberate. It would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the River Thames. The castle is made up of three \"wards\", or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of Richard I (1189\u20131199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under Edward I. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285.\nThe castle encloses an area of almost with a further around the Tower of London constituting the Tower Liberties \u2013 land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons. The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13th century when Henry III ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear. Despite popular fiction, the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber, although the basement of the White Tower housed a rack in later periods. Tower Wharf was built on the bank of the Thames under Edward I and was expanded to its current size during the reign of Richard II (1377\u20131399).\nWhite Tower.\nThe White Tower is a keep (also known as a donjon), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord \u2013 in this case, the king or his representative. According to military historian Allen Brown, \"The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon \"par excellence\"\". As one of the largest keeps in the Christian world, the White Tower has been described as \"the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe\".\nThe White Tower, not including its projecting corner towers, measures at the base, and is high at the southern battlements. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in Norman keeps, was above ground, in this case on the south face, and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. It was probably during Henry II's reign (1154\u20131189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east. At the western corners of the building are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner there is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel. As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.\nThe main building material is Kentish ragstone, although some local mudstone was also used. Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17th and 18th centuries. Reigate stone was also used as ashlar and for carved details. Its location, in the lower courses of the building and at higher levels corresponding to a building break, suggest it was readily available and may have been used when access to Caen stone was restricted. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th century, only two original \u2013 albeit restored \u2013 examples remain, in the south wall at the gallery level.\nThe tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.\nThe entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the Constable of the Tower, Lieutenant of the Tower of London and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The crypt of St John's Chapel occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, \"the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents\".\nThe upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east\u00a0\u2013 both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall\u00a0\u2013 and St John's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th century, along with the present roof. St John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls. Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior. The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and stained glass windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and the Holy Trinity.\nInnermost ward.\nThe innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower, stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century Hen Domen, the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s. The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle. Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers \u2013 located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river \u2013 began around 1220. They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively.\nThe earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A great hall existed in the south of the ward, between the two towers. It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by Henry III at Winchester Castle. Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward. Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed. The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower.\nInner ward.\nThe inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. Henry III created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward I. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13 towers that stud the curtain wall. Clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.\nAs a result of Henry's expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over \u00a3300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663, just over \u00a34,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.\nOuter ward.\nA third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's northwest corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the northeast corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the southwest corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives.\nEdward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on is unknown, although it was probably in either the outer ward or the Lion Tower. By 1560, the Mint was located in a building in the outer ward near Salt Tower. Between 1348 and 1355, a second water-gate, Cradle Tower, was added east of St Thomas's Tower for the king's private use.\nHistory.\nFoundation and early history.\nVictorious at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, the invading Duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror, spent the rest of the year securing his holdings by fortifying key positions. He founded several castles along the way, but took a circuitous route toward London; only when he reached Canterbury did he turn towards England's largest city. As the fortified bridge into London was held by Saxon troops, he decided instead to ravage Southwark before continuing his journey around southern England. A series of Norman victories along the route cut the city's supply lines and in December 1066, isolated and intimidated, its leaders yielded London without a fight. Between 1066 and 1087, William established 36 castles, although references in the Domesday Book indicate that many more were founded by his subordinates. The Normans undertook what has been described as \"the most extensive and concentrated programme of castle-building in the whole history of feudal Europe\". They were multi-purpose buildings, serving as fortifications (used as a base of operations in enemy territory), centres of administration, and residences.\nWilliam sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance, to celebrate his victory and found a castle; in the words of William's biographer, William of Poitiers, \"certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace. For he [William] realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners\". At the time, London was the largest town in England; the foundation of Westminster Abbey and the old Palace of Westminster under Edward the Confessor had marked it as a centre of governance, and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement. The other two castles in London \u2013 Baynard's Castle and Montfichet's Castle \u2013 were established at the same time. The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south-east corner of the Roman town walls, using them as prefabricated defences, with the River Thames providing additional protection from the south. This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade, and probably had accommodation suitable for William.\nMost of the early Norman castles were built from timber, but by the end of the 11th century a few, including the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower \u2013 which gives the whole castle its name \u2013 is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point of the early castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that in 1097 King William II ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone and likely replaced the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall (to the east) and the Thames (to the south). The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.\nThe death in 1135 of Henry I left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda, just a few days after Henry's death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a Constable, a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became \"the richest and most powerful man in England\". When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville, but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower. Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.\nExpansion.\nThe castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of Richard I (1189\u20131199). The castle was extended under William Longchamp, King Richard's Lord Chancellor and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade. The Pipe rolls record \u00a32,881 1s 10d spent at the Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190, from an estimated \u00a37,000 spent by Richard on castle building in England. According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden, Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames. Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower, and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with King Richard's younger brother, Prince John, who in Richard's absence arrived in England to try to seize power. As Longchamp's main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege.\nJohn succeeded Richard as king in 1199, but his rule proved unpopular with many of his barons, who in response moved against him. In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed Magna Carta. The king reneged on his promises of reform, leading to the outbreak of the First Barons' War. Even after Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis, the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Henry III. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry III's supporters would prevail.\nIn the 13th century, Kings Henry III (1216\u20131272) and Edward I (1272\u20131307) extended the castle, essentially creating it as it stands today. Henry was disconnected from his barons, and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule. As a result, he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification; at the same time Henry was an aesthete and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live. From 1216 to 1227 nearly \u00a310,000 was spent on the Tower of London; in this period, only the work at Windsor Castle cost more (\u00a315,000). Most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward. The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower (from which it derives its name) began in 1240.\nBeginning around 1238, the castle was expanded to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through the reign of Henry III and into that of Edward I, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and \u00a3166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.\nHenry III often held court at the Tower of London, and held parliament there on at least two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by Simon de Montfort, forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. Henry III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal Ottobuon came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was \"not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner, much less of an ecclesiastic\". Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle. The Earl retreated, allowing the King control of the capital, and the Tower experienced peace for the rest of Henry's reign.\nAlthough he was rarely in London, Edward I undertook an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing \u00a321,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that spent on the castle during the whole of Henry III's reign. Edward I was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by Henry III and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of Henry III's curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle's old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican. In an effort to make the castle self-sufficient, Edward I also added two watermills. Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278, charged with coin clipping. Persecution of the country's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing the Jews out of the country. In 1279, the country's numerous mints were unified under a single system whereby control was centralised to the mint within the Tower of London, while mints outside of London were reduced, with only a few local and episcopal mints continuing to operate.\nDuring this period, many Jews were imprisoned at the Tower before Edward I's edict of expulsion in 1290.\nLater medieval period.\nDuring Edward II's reign (1307\u20131327) there was relatively little activity at the Tower of London. However, it was during this period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded. The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state's arms. In 1321, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to target Isabella, killing six of the royal escort. Generally reserved for high-ranking inmates, the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country. However it was not necessarily very secure, and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape. In 1323, Roger Mortimer, Baron Mortimer, was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer's men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King.\nOne of Mortimer's first acts on entering England in 1326 was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there. For four years he ruled while Edward III was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him into the Tower. Under Edward III's rule (1312\u20131377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French. Amongst Edward's successes were the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner, and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville's Cross. During this period, the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war. Edward II had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair, and by the reign of Edward III the castle was an uncomfortable place. The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons, for instance Windsor. Edward III ordered that the castle should be renovated.\nWhen Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413\u20131422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.\nMuch of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \"the Kingmaker\") Henry recaptured the throne for a short time in 1470. However, Edward IV soon regained control and Henry VI was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was probably murdered. In 1471, during the Siege of London, the Tower's Yorkist garrison exchanged fire with Lancastrians holding Southwark, and sallied from the fortress to take part in a pincer movement to attack Lancastrians who were assaulting Aldgate on London's defensive wall. During the wars, the Tower was fortified to withstand gunfire, and provided with loopholes for cannons and handguns: an enclosure called the Bulwark was created for this purpose to the south of Tower Hill, although it no longer survives.\nShortly after the death of Edward IV in 1483, the notorious murder of the Princes in the Tower is traditionally believed to have taken place. The incident is one of the most infamous events associated with the Tower of London. Edward V's uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule. Traditional accounts have held that the 12-year-old Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother Richard. The Duke of Gloucester was proclaimed King Richard III in June. The princes were last seen in public in June 1483; it has traditionally been thought that the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483. Bones thought to belong to them were discovered in 1674 when the 12th-century forebuilding at the entrance to the White Tower was demolished; however, the reputed level at which the bones were found () would put the bones at a depth similar to that of the Roman graveyard found, in 2011, underneath the Minories a few hundred yards to the north. Opposition to Richard escalated until he was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 by the Lancastrian Henry Tudor, who ascended to the throne as Henry VII. As king, Henry VII built a tower for a library next to the King's Tower.\nChanging use.\nThe beginning of the Tudor period marked the start of the decline of the Tower of London's use as a royal residence. As 16th-century chronicler Raphael Holinshed said the Tower became used more as \"an armouries and house of munition, and thereunto a place for the safekeeping of offenders than a palace roiall for a king or queen to sojourne in\". Henry VII visited the Tower on fourteen occasions between 1485 and 1500, usually staying for less than a week at a time. The Yeoman Warders have been the Royal Bodyguard since at least 1509. In 1517 the Tower fired its cannon at City crowds engaged in the xenophobic Evil May Day riots, in which the properties of foreign residents were looted. It is not thought that any rioters were hurt by the gunfire, which was probably meant merely to intimidate the mob.\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII, the Tower was assessed as needing considerable work on its defences. In 1532, Thomas Cromwell spent \u00a33,593 on repairs and imported nearly 3,000 tons of Caen stone for the work. Even so, this was not sufficient to bring the castle up to the standard of contemporary military fortifications which were designed to withstand powerful artillery. Although the defences were repaired, the palace buildings were left in a state of neglect after Henry's death. Their condition was so poor that they were virtually uninhabitable. From 1547 onwards, the Tower of London was only used as a royal residence when its political and historic symbolism was considered useful, for instance each of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I briefly stayed at the Tower before their coronations.\nIn the 16th century, the Tower acquired an enduring reputation as a grim, forbidding prison. This had not always been the case. As a royal castle, it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons, however these were usually high-status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people. Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower. As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower \u2013 as would have been the case for any castle \u2013 there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a \"Prison for Soldiers\", was built to the north-west of the White Tower. The Tower's reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century romanticists. Although much of the Tower's reputation is exaggerated, the 16th and 17th centuries marked the castle's zenith as a prison, with many religious and political undesirables locked away. The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture, so it was not often used; between 1540 and 1640, the peak of imprisonment at the Tower, there were 48 recorded cases of the use of torture. The three most common forms used were the infamous rack, the Scavenger's daughter, and manacles. The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter, the Constable of the Tower; consequentially it was also known as the Duke of Exeter's daughter. One of those tortured at the Tower was Guy Fawkes, who was brought there on 6 November 1605; after torture he signed a full confession to the Gunpowder Plot.\nAmong those held and executed at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners. The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112 people were executed on the hill over 400 years. Before the 20th century, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; as was the case with Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth I, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.\nThe Office of Ordnance and Armoury Office were founded in the 15th century, taking over the Privy Wardrobe's duties of looking after the monarch's arsenal and valuables. As there was no standing army before 1661, the importance of the royal armoury at the Tower of London was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war. The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward. The Board of Ordnance (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the Military Store Department of the War Office) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich (where the recently closed Woolwich Dockyard was converted into a vast ordnance store).\nPolitical tensions between Charles I and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's Trained Bands, a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers. By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.\nThe last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned was Charles II in 1661. At the time, the castle's accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation. Under the Stuart kings the Tower's buildings were remodelled, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. Just over \u00a34,000 was spent in 1663 on building a new storehouse, now known as the New Armouries in the inner ward. In the 17th century there were plans to enhance the Tower's defences in the style of the \"trace italienne\", however they were never acted on. Although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose-built quarters for soldiers (the \"Irish Barracks\") in 1670, the general accommodations were still in poor condition.\nWhen the Great Fire of London broke out on 2 September 1666, Samuel Pepys ascended the Tower to view the early progress of the fire, which he reported, collecting further reports from witnesses on the way, to King Charles II and his brother, the Duke of York at Whitehall Palace. Two days later (Tuesday 4 September), through the day, the flames began to move eastward from the neighbourhood of Pudding Lane, straight against the prevailing east wind and towards the Tower, potentially threatening its gunpowder stores. The garrison at the Tower took matters into their own hands after waiting all day for requested help from the official firemen supervised by the Duke of York, who were busy in the west, by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity to create firebreaks, halting the advance of the fire.\nWhen the Hanoverian dynasty ascended the throne, their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Most of the work in this period (1750 to 1770) was done by the King's Master Mason, John Deval. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle \"would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege\". For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still an integral part of the castle's defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the Duke of Wellington, ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000 men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The popularity of the Chartist movement between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. It was the last major programme of fortification at the castle. Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period.\nDuring the First World War, eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the Tower for espionage. During the Second World War, the Tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war. One such person was Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy, albeit just for four days in 1941. He was the last state prisoner to be held at the castle. The last person to be executed at the Tower was German spy Josef Jakobs who was shot on 15 August 1941. The executions for espionage during the wars took place in a prefabricated miniature rifle range which stood in the outer ward and was demolished in 1969. The Second World War also saw the last use of the Tower as a fortification. In the event of a German invasion, the Tower, together with the Royal Mint and nearby warehouses, was to have formed one of three \"keeps\" or complexes of defended buildings which formed the last-ditch defences of the capital.\nRestoration and tourism.\nThe Tower of London has become established as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it was one of the sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The Crown Jewels also garner much interest, and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19th century, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year.\nOver the 18th and 19th centuries, the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished. Only the Wakefield and St Thomas's Towers survived. The 18th century marked an increasing interest in England's medieval past. One of the effects was the emergence of Gothic Revival architecture. In the Tower's architecture, this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower. It featured elements of Gothic Revival architecture such as battlements. Other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the Waterloo Barracks were described as \"castellated Gothic of the 15th century\". Between 1845 and 1885 institutions such as the Mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites; many of the post-medieval structures left vacant were demolished. In 1855, the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office, which was gradually phased out of the castle. At the same time, there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London.\nPublic interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers, of whom the work of William Harrison Ainsworth was particularly influential. In \"The Tower of London: A Historical Romance\" he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination. Ainsworth also played another role in the Tower's history, as he suggested that Beauchamp Tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of 16th- and 17th-century prisoners. Working on the suggestion, Anthony Salvin refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of Prince Albert. Salvin was succeeded in the work by John Taylor. When a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture Taylor would ruthlessly remove it; as a result, several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post-medieval internal decoration removed.\nAlthough only one bomb fell on the Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz, high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.\nA 1974 bombing in the White Tower Mortar Room left one person dead and 41 injured. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was behind it.\nIn the 21st century, tourism is the Tower's primary role, with the remaining routine military activities, under the Royal Logistic Corps, having wound down in the latter half of the 20th century and moved out of the castle. However, the Tower is still home to the regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor, the Royal Fusiliers. Also, a detachment of the unit providing the King's Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a guard at the Tower, and with the Yeomen Warders, takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day. On several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the Tower by the Honourable Artillery Company, these consist of 62 rounds for royal occasions, and 41 on other occasions.\nSince 1990, the Tower of London has been cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006 where visitors can explore the restored chambers. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. The Constable is appointed for a five-year term; this is primarily a ceremonial post today but the Constable is also a trustee of Historic Royal Palaces and of the Royal Armouries. General Sir Gordon Messenger was appointed Constable in 2022.\nAt least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Ravenmaster, one of the Yeoman Warders. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower.\nGarrison.\nThe Yeomen Warders provided the permanent garrison of the Tower, but the Constable of the Tower could call upon the men of the Tower Hamlets to supplement them when necessary. The Tower Hamlets, aka Tower Division of Middlesex's Ossulstone Hundred was an area, significantly larger than the modern London Borough of the same name, which owed military service to the Constable in his \"ex officio\" role as Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets.\nThe earliest surviving reference to the inhabitants of the Tower Hamlets having a duty to provide a guard for the Tower of London is from 1554, during the reign of Mary I, but the relationship is thought to go back much further. Some believe the connection goes back to the time of the Conqueror. The duty is likely to have had its origin in the rights and obligations of the Manor of Stepney which covered most or all of the Hamlets area.\nCrown Jewels.\nThe tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III (1216\u20131272). The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy and consequently was closely guarded. A new position for \"keeper of the jewels, armouries and other things\" was created, which was well rewarded; in the reign of Edward III (1327\u20131377) the holder was paid 12d a day. The position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels, gold, and silver, and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers.\nIn 1649, during the English Commonwealth following Charles I's execution, the contents of the Jewel House were disposed of along with other royal properties, as decreed by Cromwell. Metal items were sent to the Mint to be melted down and re-used, and the crowns were \"totallie broken and defaced\".\nWhen the monarchy was restored in 1660, the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings from the time of Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them.\nIn 1669, the Jewel House was demolished and the Crown Jewels moved into Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public. This was exploited two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid their hands on the Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.\nSince 1994, the Crown Jewels have been on display in the Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some of the pieces were once regularly used by Queen Elizabeth II. The display includes 23,578 gemstones, the 800-year-old Coronation Spoon, St Edward's Crown (traditionally placed on a monarch's head at the moment of crowning) and the Imperial State Crown.\nRoyal Menagerie.\nThere is evidence that King John (1166\u20131216) first started keeping wild animals at the Tower. Records of 1210\u20131212 show payments to lion keepers.\nThe Royal Menagerie is frequently referenced during the reign of Henry III. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II presented Henry with three leopards, c.\u20091235, which were kept in the Tower. In 1252, the sheriffs were ordered to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep of the King's polar bear, a gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear attracted a great deal of attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames while tied to the land by a chain. In 1254 or 1255, Henry III received an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his . A wooden structure was built to house the elephant, measuring . The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also perhaps because of the cold climate of England.\nIn 1288, Edward I added a lion and a lynx and appointed the first official Keeper of the animals.\nEdward III added other types of animals, two lions, a leopard and two wildcats. Under subsequent kings, the number of animals grew to include additional cats of various types, jackals, hyenas, and an old brown bear, Max, gifted to Henry VIII by Emperor Maximilian. In 1436, during the time of Henry VI, all the lions died and the employment of Keeper William Kerby was terminated.\nHistorical records indicate that a semi-circular structure or barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower. Records from 1335 indicate the purchase of a lock and key for the lions and leopards, also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the Tower. By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie. Between 1604 and 1606 the Menagerie was extensively refurbished and an exercise yard was created in the moat area beside the Lion Tower. An overhead platform was added for viewing of the lions by the royals, during lion baiting, for example in the time of James I. Reports from 1657 include mention of six lions, increasing to 11 by 1708, in addition to other types of cats, eagles, owls and a jackal.\nBy the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves, and \"other animals\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant, and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828, there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.\nAfter the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie on the orders of the Duke of Wellington. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or Ensign Seymour had been bitten by a monkey. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.\nIn 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280 to 1385 and 1420\u20131480. In 2011, an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste.\nIn folklore.\nThe Tower of London has been represented in popular culture in many ways. As a result of 16th- and 19th-century writers, the Tower has a reputation as a grim fortress, a place of torture and execution.\nOne of the earliest traditions associated with the Tower was that it was built by Julius Caesar; the story was popular amongst writers and antiquaries. The earliest recorded attribution of the Tower to the Roman ruler dates to the mid-14th\u00a0century in a poem by Sir Thomas Gray. The origin of the myth is uncertain, although it may be related to the fact that the Tower was built in the corner of London's Roman walls. Another possibility is that someone misread a passage from Gervase of Tilbury in which he says Caesar built a tower at Odnea in France. Gervase wrote Odnea as Dodres, which is close to the French for London, Londres. Today, the story survives in William Shakespeare's \"Richard\u00a0II\" and \"Richard\u00a0III\", and as late as the 18th\u00a0century some still regarded the Tower as built by Caesar.\nAnne Boleyn was beheaded in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII; her ghost supposedly haunts the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower, where she is buried, and has been said to walk around the White Tower carrying her head under her arm. This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song \"With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm\". Other reported ghosts include Henry VI, Lady Jane Grey, Margaret Pole, and the Princes in the Tower. In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Edmund Lenthal Swifte. He said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: \"Oh, Christ! It has seized me!\" Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral bibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mifflin signed the United States Constitution, was the first governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1790 to 1799, and was also the state's last president, succeeding Benjamin Franklin in 1788.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Mifflin became a merchant following his graduation from the College of Philadelphia. After serving in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly and the First Continental Congress, where he signed the Continental Association, he joined the Continental Army in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, Mifflin was an aide to General George Washington and was appointed the army's Quartermaster General, rising to the rank of major general. He returned to Congress in 1782 and was elected president of the Congress the following year. He served as speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1785 to 1787 and as president of Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council from 1788 to 1790.\nMifflin was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and signed the United States Constitution. He then presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania's state constitution, becoming the state's first governor after the constitution's ratification in 1790. Mifflin left office as governor in 1799 and died the following year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and family.\nMifflin was born January 10, 1744, in Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Mifflin and Elizabeth Bagnall. His great-grandfather John Mifflin Jr. (1662\u20131714) was born in Warminster, Wiltshire, England and settled in the Province of Pennsylvania.\nIn 1760, Mifflin graduated from the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) and joined the mercantile business of William Biddle. After returning from a trip to Europe in 1765, he established a commercial business partnership with his brother, George Mifflin.\nHe married a second cousin, Sarah Morris, on March 4, 1767. Their daughter https:// married Joseph Hopkinson, the son of Francis Hopkinson. After Sarah's death in 1790, Emily became her father's hostess and a family source references a total of four daughters in the family, \"all beautiful women.\" A source indicates that Sarah \"had no children of her own.\"\nMilitary service.\nEarly in the Revolutionary War, Mifflin left the Continental Congress to serve in the Continental Army. He was commissioned as a major, then became an \"aide-de-camp\" of George Washington.\nOn August 14, 1775, Washington appointed him to become the army's first quartermaster general, under order of Congress. Although it has been said that he was good at the job despite preferring to be on the front lines, questions were raised regarding his failure to properly supply Washington and the troops at Valley Forge, alleging that he had instead warehoused and sold supplies intended for Valley Forge to the highest bidder. Reportedly, after Washington confronted him about this, Mifflin asked to be relieved as quartermaster general but was persuaded to resume those duties because Congress was having difficulty finding a replacement.\nMifflin's leadership in the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Princeton led to a promotion to major general. In Congress, there was debate regarding whether a national army was more efficient or whether the individual states should maintain their own forces. As a result of this debate the Congressional Board of War was created, on which Mifflin served from 1777 to 1778. He then rejoined the army but took little active role, following criticism of his service as quartermaster general. He was accused of embezzlement and welcomed an inquiry; however, one never took place. He resigned his commission, but Congress continued to ask his advice even after accepting his resignation.\nPolitical career.\nPrior to American independence, Mifflin was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly (1772\u20131776). He served two terms in the Continental Congress (1774\u20131775 and 1782\u20131784), including seven months (November 1783 to June 1784) as that body's presiding officer.\nMifflin's most important duty as president was to accept on behalf of Congress the resignation of General George Washington on December 23, 1783. After the war, the importance of Congress declined so precipitously that Mifflin found it difficult to convince the states to send enough delegates to Congress to ratify the Treaty of Paris, which finally took place on January 14, 1784, at the Maryland State House in Annapolis. He also appointed Thomas Jefferson as a minister to France on May 7, 1784, and he appointed his former aide, Colonel Josiah Harmar, to be the commander of the First American Regiment.\nMifflin later served as a delegate to the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787. He was a signatory to the Continental Association and the Constitution. He served in the house of Pennsylvania General Assembly (1785\u20131788). He was a member of the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and on November 5, 1788, he was elected president of the Council, replacing Benjamin Franklin. He was unanimously reelected to the presidency on November 11, 1789. He presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania's 1790 state constitution. That document did away with the Executive Council, replacing it with a single governor.\nOn December 21, 1790, Mifflin became the last president of Pennsylvania and the first governor of the Commonwealth. He held the latter office until December 17, 1799, when he was succeeded by Thomas McKean. The Whiskey Rebellion and the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic happened during his term in office. Fries Rebellion also started during his term. He then returned to the state legislature, where he served until his death the following month.\nPersonal life.\nAlthough Mifflin's family had been Quakers for four generations, he was expelled from the Religious Society of Friends when he joined the Continental Army, because his involvement with the military contradicted that faith's pacifistic doctrines. Mifflin became a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1768 and served for two years as its secretary. He served from 1773 to 1791 as a trustee of the College and Academy of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), including two years as treasurer (1773\u20131775).\nDeath and legacy.\nMifflin died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on January 23, 1800. He is interred at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster.\nA Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historical marker outside Holy Trinity, dedicated in 1975, commemorates Thomas Wharton and Mifflin, the first and last Presidents of Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. It reads: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Holy Trinity Lutheran Church. Founded in 1730.

{"id": "31174", "revid": "39732090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31174", "title": "Thar Desert", "text": "Arid region in India and Pakistan\nThe Thar Desert (), also known as the Great Indian Desert, is an arid region in the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent that covers an area of in India and Pakistan. It is the world's 18th-largest desert and the world's 9th-largest hot subtropical desert.\nAbout 85% of the Thar Desert is in India, and about 15% is in Pakistan. The Thar Desert is about 4.56% of the total geographical area of India. More than 60% of the desert lies in the Indian state of Rajasthan; the portion in India also extends into Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana. The portion in Pakistan extends into the provinces of Sindh and Punjab (the portion in the latter province is referred to as the Cholistan Desert). The Indo-Gangetic Plain lies to the north, west and northeast of the Thar desert, the Rann of Kutch lies to its south, and the Aravali Range borders the desert to the east.\nGeography.\nThe northeastern part of the Thar Desert lies between the Aravalli Hills. The desert stretches to Punjab and Haryana in the north, to the Great Rann of Kutch along the coast, and to the alluvial plains of the Indus River in the west and northwest. Much of the desert area is covered by huge, shifting sand dunes that receive sediments from the alluvial plains and the coast. The sand is highly mobile due to the strong winds that rise each year before the onset of the monsoon. The Luni River is the only river in the desert. Rainfall is per year, almost all of it between June and September.\nSaltwater lakes within the Thar Desert include the Sambhar, Kuchaman, Didwana, Pachpadra, and Phalodi in Rajasthan and Kharaghoda in Gujarat. These lakes receive and collect rainwater during monsoon and evaporate during the dry season. The salt comes from the weathering of rocks in the region.\nLithic tools belonging to the prehistoric Aterian culture of the Maghreb have been discovered in Middle Paleolithic deposits in the Thar Desert.\nClimate.\nThe climate is arid and subtropical. Average temperature varies with season, and extremes can range from near-freezing in the winter to more than 50\u00a0\u00b0C in the summer months. Average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 500\u00a0mm, and occurs during the short July-to-September southwest monsoon.\nThe desert has both a very dry part (the Marusthali region in the west) and a semidesert part (in the east) that has fewer sand dunes and slightly more precipitation.\nDesertification.\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, approximately 20,000 years before present, an estimated ice sheet covered the Tibetan Plateau, significantly affecting radiative forcing; due to its low latitude, the Tibetan ice sheet reflected at least four times more solar radiation per unit area into space than ice at higher latitudes, further cooling the overlying atmosphere during that period. Without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating, there was no monsoon over the Indian subcontinent. This lack of monsoon caused extensive rainfall over the Sahara, expansion of the Thar Desert, more dust deposited into the Arabian Sea, a lowering of the biotic life zones on the Indian subcontinent, and animals responded to this shift in climate with the Javan rusa deer migrating into India.\nBetween 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, a paleo channel of the Ghaggar-Hakra River \u2013 identified with the paleo Sarasvati River \u2013 after its confluence with the Sutlej flowed into the Nara river, a delta channel of the Indus River, but then changed its course. This left the Ghaggar-Hakra as a system of monsoon-fed rivers that no longer reached the sea and now ends in the Thar desert.\nAround 5,000 years ago, when the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished further, the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) prospered in this area, with the rise of numerous IVC urban sites at Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Banawali and Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Dholavira and Lothal (Gujarat) along this course.\nBy 4,000 years ago, when monsoons diminished even further, the dried-up Hakra became an intermittent river, and the urban Harappan civilisation declined, becoming localized in smaller agricultural communities.\nDesertification control.\nThe soil of the Thar Desert remains dry for much of the year, so it is prone to wind erosion. High-velocity winds blow soil from the desert, depositing some of it on neighboring fertile lands, and causing sand dunes within the desert to shift. To counteract this problem, sand dunes are stabilised by first erecting micro windbreak barriers with scrub material and then by afforestation of the treated dunes\u2014planting the seedlings of shrubs (such as phog, senna, and castor oil plant) and trees (such as gum acacia, \"Prosopis juliflora\", and lebbek tree). The 649-km-long Indira Gandhi Canal brings fresh water to the Thar Desert. It was built to halt any spreading of the desert into fertile areas.\nProtected areas.\nThere are several protected areas in the Thar Desert:\nBiodiversity.\nFauna.\nSome wildlife species that are fast vanishing in other parts of India are found in the desert in large numbers, including the blackbuck (\"Antilope cervicapra\"), chinkara (\"Gazella bennettii\"), and Indian wild ass (\"Equus hemionus khur\") in the Rann of Kutch. This may be partly because they are well adapted to this environment: they are smaller than similar animals that live in other environments, and they are mainly nocturnal. It may also be because grasslands in this region have not been transformed into cropland as fast as in other regions, and because a local community, the Bishnois, has made special efforts to protect them.\nOther mammals in the Thar Desert include a subspecies of red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes pusilla\") and the caracal, and a number of reptiles dwell there too.\nThe region is a haven for 141 species of migratory and resident desert birds, including harriers, falcons, buzzards, kestrels, vultures, short-toed eagles (\"Circaetus gallicus\"), tawny eagles (\"Aquila rapax\"), greater spotted eagles (\"Aquila clanga\"), and laggar falcons (\"Falco jugger\").\nThe Indian peafowl is a resident breeder in the Thar region. The peacock is designated as the national bird of India and the provincial bird of the Punjab (Pakistan). It can be seen sitting on khejri or pipal trees in villages.\nThe Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps), one of the world\u2019s heaviest flying birds, inhabits the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. Critically endangered, it thrives in open grasslands and semi-arid regions.\nFlora.\nThe natural vegetation of this dry area is classified as northwestern thorn scrub forest (i.e. small, loosely-scattered patches of greenery). The densities and sizes of these green patches increase from west to east, following an increase in rainfall. The primary vegetation of the Thar Desert is composed of trees, shrubs, and perennial herb species, including:\nThe endemic floral species include \"Calligonum polygonoides\", \"Prosopis cineraria\", \"Acacia nilotica\", \"Tamarix aphylla\", and \"Cenchrus biflorus\".\nHistory.\nThe Desert National Park in Jaisalmer district has a collection of 180-million-year-old animal and plant fossils. The historical foundations of Jaisalmer State lie in the large empire ruled by the Bhati dynasty, which stretched from what is now Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan to what is Sialkot, Lahore and Rawalpindi in modern-day Pakistan and extended to the region that is Bhatinda and Hanumangarh in modern-day India.\nAccording to Satish Chandra, the Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan made an alliance with the Bhatti rulers of Multhan to end the slave raids conducted by the Turkic ruler of Ghazni, but the alliance was broken apart by Alp Tigin in 977 CE. Bhati dominions continued to shift southwards: they ruled Multan, then finally got pushed into Cholistan and Jaisalmer, where Rawal Devaraja built Dera Rawal / Derawar. Jaisalmer was founded as the new capital in 1156 by Maharawal Jaisal Singh and the state took its name from the capital. On 11 December 1818 Jaisalmer became a British protectorate through the Rajputana Agency.\nThe kingdom\u2019s economy, which had long depended on levies on caravans, declined after Bombay became a major port and sea trade largely replaced traditional land routes. Maharawals Ranjit Singh and Bairi Sal Singh attempted to reverse the economic decline, but the kingdom nevertheless became impoverished. Adding to the hardship, a severe drought and resulting famine from 1895 to 1900 during the reign of Maharawal Salivahan Singh caused widespread loss of livestock, upon which the increasingly agricultural kingdom had come to rely.\nIn 1965 and 1971, population exchanges took place in the Thar between India and Pakistan; 3,500 Muslims moved from the Indian section of the Thar to Pakistani Thar, while thousands of Hindu families migrated from Pakistani Thar to the Indian section.\nIn 2023, Sunil Bajpai and colleagues described the remains of \"Tharosaurus indicus\", a new species of the herbivorous sauropod dinosaur found in the Thar Desert in India. These outcrops belong to the Jaisalmer Formation, dating to the Bathonian age of the Middle Jurassic. \nPopulation.\nThe Thar people are the natives of the area. The Thar Desert is the most widely populated desert in the world, with a population density of 83 people per km2. In India, the inhabitants comprise Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Muslims. In Pakistan, inhabitants include both Muslims and Hindus.\nAbout 40% of the total population of Rajasthan lives in the Thar Desert. The main occupations of the inhabitants are agriculture and animal husbandry.\nJodhpur, the largest city in the region, lies in the scrub forest zone at the desert's perimeter. Bikaner and Jaisalmer are the largest cities located entirely in the desert.\nWater and housing in the desert.\nIn the true desert areas, the only sources of water for animals or humans are small, scattered ponds - some that are natural (\"tobas\") and some that are human-made (\"johads\"). The persistence of water scarcity heavily influences life in all areas of the Thar, prompting many inhabitants to adopt a nomadic lifestyle. Most of the permanent human settlements are located near the two seasonal streams of the Karon-Jhar hills. Potable groundwater is also rare in the Thar Desert. Much of it tastes sour due to dissolved minerals. Potable water is mostly available only deep underground. When wells are dug that happen to yield sweet tasting water, people tend to settle near them, but such wells are difficult and dangerous to dig, sometimes claiming the lives of the well-diggers.\nCrowded housing conditions are common in some areas.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture.\nThe Thar is one of the most heavily populated desert areas in the world with the main occupations of its inhabitants being agriculture and animal husbandry.\nAgricultural production is mainly from kharif crops, which are grown in the summer season and seeded in June and July. These are then harvested in September and October and include bajra, pulses such as guar, jowar (\"Sorghum vulgare\"), maize (\"zea mays\"), sesame and groundnuts.\nThe Thar region of Rajasthan is a major opium production and consumption area.\nAgroforestry.\n\"P. cineraria\" wood is reported to contain high calorific value and provide high-quality fuel wood. The lopped branches are good as fencing material. Its roots also encourage nitrogen fixation, which produces higher crop yields.\nEcotourism.\nDesert safaris on camels have become increasingly popular around Jaisalmer. Domestic and international tourists frequent the desert seeking adventure on camels for one to several days. This ecotourism industry ranges from cheaper backpacker treks to plush Arabian-Nights-style campsites replete with banquets and cultural performances. During the treks, tourists are able to view the fragile and beautiful ecosystem of the Thar Desert. This form of tourism provides income to many operators and camel owners in Jaisalmer, as well as employment for many camel trekkers in the desert villages nearby. People from various parts of the world come to see the Pushkar ka Mela (Pushkar Fair) and oases.\nIndustry.\nThe government of India initiated departmental exploration for oil in 1955 and 1956 in the Jaisalmer area, Oil India Limited discovered natural gas in 1988 in the Jaisalmer basin. \nThe 5,700-hectare Bhadla Solar Park, with a generation capacity of over 2 gigawatts, is located in the Thar Desert.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31175", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31175", "title": "Tobin tax", "text": "Form of tax\nA Tobin tax was originally defined as a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. It was suggested by James Tobin, an economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Tobin's tax was originally intended to penalize short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. By the late 1990s, the term Tobin tax was being applied to all forms of short term transaction taxation, whether across currencies or not. The concept of the Tobin tax is being picked up by various tax proposals currently being discussed, amongst them the European Union Financial Transaction Tax as well as the Robin Hood tax.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOriginal proposal.\nTobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the Bretton Woods system of monetary management ended in 1971. Prior to 1971, one of the chief features of the Bretton Woods system was an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value\u2014plus or minus one percent\u2014in terms of gold. Then, on August 15, 1971, United States President Richard Nixon announced that the United States dollar would no longer be convertible to gold, effectively ending the system. This action created the situation whereby the U.S. dollar became the sole backing of currencies and a reserve currency for the member states of the Bretton Woods system, leading the system to collapse in the face of increasing financial strain in that same year. In that context, Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include an international charge on foreign-exchange transactions.\nIn 2001, in another context, just after \"the 90s' crises in Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia,\" which included the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis, Tobin summarized his idea:\n The tax on foreign exchange transactions was devised to cushion exchange rate fluctuations. The idea is very simple: at each exchange of a currency into another a small tax would be levied - let's say, 0.5% of the volume of the transaction. This dissuades speculators as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis. If this money is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase interest rates for their currency to still be attractive. But high interest is often disastrous for a national economy, as the nineties' crises in Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia have proven. My tax would return some margin of maneuver to issuing banks in small countries and would be a measure of opposition to the dictate of the financial markets.\nThough James Tobin suggested the rate as 0.5%, in that interview setting, others have tried to be more precise in their search for the optimum rate.\nEconomic literature of the period 1990s-2000s emphasized that variations in the terms of payment in trade-related transactions (so-called \"swaps\" for instance) provided a ready means of evading a tax levied on currency only. Accordingly, most debate on the issue has shifted towards a general financial transaction tax which would capture such proxies. Other measures to avoid punishing hedging (a form of insurance for cashflows) were also proposed. By the 2010s the Basel II and Basel III frameworks required reporting that would help to differentiate them and economic thought was tending to reject the belief that they could not be differentiated, or (as the \"Chicago School\" had held) should not be.\nRecent proposals.\nIn March 2016 China drafted rules to impose a genuine currency transaction tax and this was referred to in financial press as a Tobin tax. This was widely viewed as a warning to curb shorting of its currency the yuan. It was however expected to keep this tax at 0% initially, calculating potential revenue from different rate schemes and exemptions, and not to impose the actual tax unless speculation increased.\nAlso in 2016 US Democratic Party POTUS nominee Hillary Clinton included in her platform a vow to \"Impose a tax on high-frequency trading. The growth of high-frequency trading has unnecessarily placed stress on our markets, created instability, and enabled unfair and abusive trading strategies. Hillary would impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading and reform rules to make our stock markets fairer, more open, and transparent.\". However, the term \"high-frequency\" implied that only a few large volume transaction players engaged in arbitrage would likely be affected. Clinton referred separately to \"Impose a risk fee on the largest financial institutions. Big banks and financial companies would be required to pay a fee based on their size and their risk of contributing to another crisis.\" The calculations of such fees would necessarily depend on financial risk management criteria (see Basel II and Basel III). Because of its restriction to so-called \"harmful high-frequency trading\" rather than to inter-currency transactions, neither of Clinton's proposals could be considered a true Tobin tax though international exposure would be a factor in the \"risk fee\".\nConcepts and definitions.\nHedging vs. speculation.\nCritics of all financial transaction taxes and currency transaction taxes emphasize the financial risk management difficulty of differentiating hedging from speculation, and the economic argument (attributed to the \"Chicago School\") that they cannot in principle be differentiated. However, advocates of such taxes considered these problems manageable, especially in context of broader financial transaction tax.\nTobin's concept.\nJames Tobin's purpose in developing his idea of a currency transaction tax was to find a way to manage exchange-rate volatility. In his view, \"currency exchanges transmit disturbances originating in international financial markets. National economies and national governments are not capable of adjusting to massive movements of funds across the foreign exchanges, without real hardship and without significant sacrifice of the objectives of national economic policy with respect to employment, output, and inflation.\"\nTobin saw two solutions to this issue. The first was to move \"toward a common currency, common monetary and fiscal policy, and economic integration.\" The second was to move \"toward greater financial segmentation between nations or currency areas, permitting their central banks and governments greater autonomy in policies tailored to their specific economic institutions and objectives.\" Tobin's preferred solution was the former one but he did not see this as politically viable so he advocated for the latter approach: \"I therefore regretfully recommend the second, and my proposal is to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively efficient international money markets.\"\nTobin's method of \"throwing sand in the wheels\" was to suggest a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another, proportional to the size of the transaction. In the development of his idea, Tobin was influenced by the earlier work of John Maynard Keynes on general financial transaction taxes.\nKeynes' concept stems from 1936 when he proposed that a transaction tax should be levied on dealings on Wall Street, where he argued that excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. For Keynes (who was himself a speculator) the key issue was the proportion of 'speculators' in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant.\nVariations on idea.\nThe most common variations on Tobin's idea are a general currency transaction tax, a more general financial transaction tax and (the most general) Robin Hood tax on transactions only richer investors can afford to engage in.\nPollin and Baker.\nA key issue with Tobin's tax was \"avoidance by change of product mix... market participants would have an incentive to substitute out of financial instruments subject to the tax and into instruments not subject to it. In this fashion, markets would innovate so as to avoid the tax... [so] focusing on just spot currency markets would clearly induce a huge shifting of transactions into futures and derivatives markets. Thus, the real issue is how to design a tax that takes account of all the methods and margins of substitution that investors have for changing their patterns of activity to avoid the tax. Taking account of these considerations implies a Tobin tax that is bigger in scope, and pushes the design toward a generalized securities transaction tax that resembles the tax suggested by Pollin et al. (1999). There are four benefits to this. First, it is likely to generate significantly greater revenues. Second, it maintains a level playing field across financial markets so that no individual financial instrument is arbitrarily put at a competitive disadvantage versus another. Third, it is likely to enhance domestic financial market stability by discouraging domestic asset speculation. Fourth, to the extent that advanced economies already put too many real resources into financial dealings, it would cut back on this resource use, freeing these resources for other productive uses [Fourth] such substitution is costly both in resource use, and because alternative instruments do not provide exactly the same services [thus] just as the market provides an incentive to avoid a Tobin tax, so too it automatically sets in motion forces that deter excessive avoidance.\" - Palley, 2000 \nPollin, Palley and Baker (2000) emphasize that transaction taxes \"have clearly not prevented the efficient functioning of these markets. \"\nThe Spahn tax.\nAccording to Paul Bernd Spahn in 1995, \"Analysis has shown that the Tobin tax as originally proposed is not viable and should be laid aside for good.\"\nSpecial drawing rights.\nOn September 19, 2001, retired speculator George Soros put forward a proposal based on the IMF's existing special drawing rights (SDRs) mechanism. In Soros' scheme, rich countries would pledge SDRs (which are denominated as a basket of multiple 'hard' currencies) for the purpose of providing international assistance. Soros was not necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. He stated, \"I think there is a case for a Tobin tax ... (but) it is not at all clear to me that a Tobin tax would reduce volatility in the currency markets. It is true that it may discourage currency speculation but it would also reduce the liquidity of the marketplace.\" In this Soros appeared to agree with the Chicago School.\nScope.\nThe term \"Tobin tax\" has sometimes been used interchangeably with a specific currency transaction tax (CTT) in the manner of Tobin's original idea, and other times it has been used interchangeably with the various different ideas of a more general financial transaction tax (FTT). In both cases, the various ideas proposed have included both national and multinational concepts. Examples of associating Tobin's tax with these:\nProposals and implementations.\nIt was originally assumed that the Tobin tax would require multilateral implementation, since one country acting alone would find it very difficult to implement this tax. Many people have therefore argued that it would be best implemented by an international institution. It has been proposed that having the United Nations manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the UN a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states. However, there have also been initiatives of national dimension about the tax. (This is in addition to the many countries that have foreign exchange controls.)\nWhile finding some support in countries with strong left-wing political movements such as France and Latin America, the Tobin tax proposal came under much criticism from economists and governments, especially those with liberal markets and a large international banking sector, who said it would be impossible to implement and would destabilise foreign exchange markets.\nMost of the actual implementation of Tobin taxes, whether in the form of a specific currency transaction tax, or a more general financial transaction tax, has occurred at a national level. In July, 2006, analyst Marion G. Wrobel examined the international experiences of various countries with financial transaction taxes.\nEU financial transaction tax.\nThe EU financial transaction tax (EU FTT) is a proposal made by the European Commission in September 2011 to introduce a financial transaction tax within the 27 member states of the European Union by 2014. The tax would only impact financial transactions between financial institutions charging 0.1% against the exchange of shares and bonds and 0.01% across derivative contracts. According to the European Commission it could raise \u20ac57 billion every year, of which around \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.4bn) would go to Great Britain, which hosts Europe's biggest financial center. It is unclear whether a financial transaction tax is compatible with European law.\nIf implemented the tax must be paid in the European country where the financial operator is established. This \"R plus I\" (residence plus issuance) solution means the EU-FTT would cover all transactions that involve a single European firm, no matter if these transactions are carried out in the EU or elsewhere in the world. The scheme makes it impossible for say French or German banks to avoid the tax by moving their transactions offshore, unless they give up all their European customers.\nBeing faced with stiff resistance from some non-eurozone EU countries, particularly United Kingdom and Sweden, a group of eleven states began pursuing the idea of utilizing enhanced co-operation to implement the tax in states which wish to participate. Opinion polls indicate that 41 percent of the British people are in favour of some forms of FTT (see section: Public opinion).\nThe proposal supported by the eleven EU member states, was approved in the European Parliament in December 2012, and by the Council of the European Union in January 2013. The formal agreement on the details of the EU FTT still need to be decided upon and approved by the European Parliament.\nSwedish financial transaction taxes.\nWrobel's paper highlighted the Swedish experience with financial transaction taxes. In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed-income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.\nThe revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.\nOn the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.\nEven though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s and 2000s.\nTobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience.\nThe Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives. In global international currency trading, however, the situation could, some argue, look quite different.\nWrobel's studies do not address the global economy as a whole, as James Tobin did when he spoke of \"the nineties' crises in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia,\" which included the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\nBritish stock transaction tax (Stamp Duty).\nAn existing example of a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) is Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) and stamp duty. Stamp duty was introduced as an ad valorem tax on share purchases in 1808, preceding by over 150 years the Tobin tax on currency transactions. Changes were made in 1963. In 1963 the rate of the UK Stamp Duty was 2%, subsequently fluctuating between 1% and 2%, until a process of its gradual reduction started in 1984, when the rate was halved, first from 2% to 1%, and then once again in 1986 from 1% to the current level of 0.5%.\nThe changes in Stamp Duty rates in 1974, 1984, and 1986 provided researchers with \"natural experiments\", allowing them to measure the impact of transaction taxes on market volume, volatility, returns, and valuations of UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Jackson and O'Donnel (1985), using UK quarterly data, found that the 1% cut in the Stamp Duty in April 1984 from 2% to 1% lead to a \"dramatic 70% increase in equity turnover\". Analyzing all three Stamp Duty rate changes, Saporta and Kan (1997) found that the announcements of tax rate increases (decreases) were followed by negative (positive) returns, but even though these results were statistically significant, they were likely to be influenced by other factors, because the announcements were made on Budget Days. Bond et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of previous studies, noting also that the impact of the announced tax rate cuts was more beneficial (increasing market value more significantly) in case of larger firms, which had higher turnover, and were therefore more affected by the transaction tax than stocks of smaller companies, less frequently traded.\nBecause the UK tax code provides exemptions from the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax for all financial intermediaries, including market makers, investment banks and other members of the LSE, and due to the strong growth of the contract for difference (CFD) industry, which provides UK investors with untaxed substitutes for LSE stocks, according to the Oxera (2007) report, more than 70% percent of the total UK stock market volume, including the entire institutional volume remained (in 2005) exempt from the Stamp Duty, in contrast to the common perception of this tax as a \"tax on bank transactions\" or a \"tax on speculation\". On the other hand, as much as 40% of the Stamp Duty revenues come from taxing foreign residents, because the tax is \"chargeable whether the transaction takes place in the UK or overseas, and whether either party is resident in the UK or not.\"\nSterling Stamp Duty.\nIn 2005, the Tobin tax was developed into a modern proposal by the United Kingdom NGO Stamp Out Poverty. It simplified the two-tier tax in favour of a mechanism designed solely as a means for raising development revenue. The currency market by this time had grown to $2,000 billion a day. To investigate the feasibility of such a tax they hired the City of London firm Intelligence Capital, who found that a tax on the pound sterling wherever it was traded in the world, as opposed to a tax on all currencies traded in the UK, was indeed feasible and could be unilaterally implemented by the UK government.\nThe Sterling Stamp Duty, as it became known, was to be set at a rate 200 times lower than Tobin had envisaged in 2001, which \"pro Tobin tax\" supporters claim wouldn't have affected currency markets and could still raise large sums of money. The global currency market grew to $3,200 billion a day in 2007, or \u00a3400,000 billion per annum with the trade in sterling, the fourth most traded currency in the world, worth \u00a334,000 billion a year. A sterling stamp duty set at 0.005% as some claim would have raised in the region of \u00a32 billion a year in 2007. The All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade published a report in November 2007 into financing for development in which it recommended that the UK government undertake rigorous research into the implementation of a 0.005% stamp duty on all sterling foreign exchange transactions, to provide additional revenue to help bridge the funding gap required to pay for the Millennium Development Goals.\nMultinational proposals.\nIn 1996, the United Nations Development Programme sponsored a comprehensive feasibility and cost-benefit study of the Tobin tax:\nHaq, Mahbub ul; Kaul, Inge; Grunberg, Isabelle (August 1996). The Tobin Tax: Coping with Financial Volatility. Oxford University Press. .\nEuropean idea for a 'first Euro tax'.\nIn late 2001, a Tobin tax amendment was adopted by the French National Assembly. However, it was overturned by March 2002 by the French Senate.\nOn June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing a Spahn tax. According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Tobin tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law. In July 2005 former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel called for a European Union Tobin tax to base the communities' financial structure on more stable and independent grounds. However, the proposal was rejected by the European Commission.\nOn November 23, 2009, the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, after attending a meeting of the Bilderberg Group argued for a European version of the Tobin tax. This tax would go beyond just financial transactions: \"all shopping and petrol would be taxed.\".\nCountering him was his sister, Christine Van Rompuy, who said, \"any new taxes would directly affect the poor\".\nOn June 29, 2011, the European Commission called for Tobin-style taxes on the EU's financial sector to generate direct revenue starting from 2014. At the same time it suggested to reduce existing levies coming from the 27 member states.\nG20 nations.\nThe first nation in the G20 group to formally accept the Tobin tax was Canada. On March 23, 1999, the House of Commons of Canada passed a resolution directing the government to \"enact a tax on financial transactions in concert with the international community.\" However, ten years later, in November 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit in Scotland, the representatives of the minority government of Canada spoke publicly on the world stage in opposition to that House of Commons of Canada resolution.\nIn September 2009, French president Nicolas Sarkozy brought up the issue of a Tobin tax once again, suggesting it be adopted by the G20.\nOn November 7, 2009, prime minister Gordon Brown said that G-20 should consider a tax on speculation, although did not specify that it should be on currency trading alone. The BBC reported that there was a negative response to the plan among the G20.\nBy December 11, 2009, European Union leaders expressed broad support for a Tobin tax in a communiqu\u00e9 sent to the International Monetary Fund.\nFor supporters of a Tobin tax, there is a wide range of opinion on who should administer a global Tobin tax and what the revenue should be used for. There are some who think that it should take the form of an insurance: In early November 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit in Scotland, the British Prime Minister \"Mr. Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president, suggested that revenues from the Tobin tax could be devoted to the world's fight against climate change, especially in developing countries. They suggested that funding could come from \"a global financial transactions tax.\" However British officials later argued the main point of a financial transactions tax would be provide insurance for the global taxpayer against a future banking crisis.\"\nThe feasibility of gradual implementation of the FTT, beginning with a few EU nations.\nThis scenario is possible, given the events in May and June, 2010:\nSimultaneous taxes in the European Union.\nOn June 28, 2010, the European Union's executive said it will study whether the European Union should go alone in imposing a tax on financial transactions after G20 leaders failed to agree on the issue.\nThe financial transaction tax would be \"separate\" from a bank levy, or a resolution levy, which some governments are \"also\" proposing to impose on banks to insure them against the costs of any future bailouts. EU leaders instructed their finance ministers, in May, 2010, to work out by the end of October 2010, details for the banking levy, but any financial transaction tax remains much more controversial.\nLatin America \u2013 Bank of the South.\nIn early November 2007, a regional Tobin tax was adopted by the Bank of the South, after an initiative of Presidents Hugo Ch\u00e1vez from Venezuela and N\u00e9stor Kirchner from Argentina.\nUN Global Tax.\nAccording to Stephen Spratt, \"the revenues raised could be used for ... international development objectives ... such as meeting the Millennium Development Goals.\"(, p.\u00a019) These are eight international development goals that 192 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed (in 2000) to achieve by the year 2015. They include reducing extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development.\nAt the UN September 2001 World Conference against Racism, when the issue of compensation for colonialism and slavery arose in the agenda, Fidel Castro, the President of Cuba, advocated the Tobin Tax to address that issue. (According to Cliff Kincaid, Castro advocated it \"specifically in order to generate U.S. financial reparations to the rest of the world,\" however a closer reading of Castro's speech shows that he never did mention \"the rest of the world\" as being recipients of revenue.) Castro cited Holocaust reparations as a previously established precedent for the concept of reparations.\nOriginal idea and anti-globalization movement.\nTobin's more specific concept of a \"currency transaction tax\" from 1972 lay dormant for more than 20 years but was revived by the advent of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In December, 1997 Ignacio Ramonet, editor of \"Le Monde Diplomatique\", renewed the debate around the Tobin tax with an editorial titled \"Disarming the markets\". Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens). The tax then became an issue of the global justice movement or alter-globalization movement and a matter of discussion not only in academic institutions but even in streets and in parliaments in the UK, France, and around the world.\nIn an interview given to the Italian independent radio network Radio Popolare in July 2001 James Tobin distanced himself from the global justice movement. \"There are agencies and groups in Europe that have used the Tobin Tax as an issue of broader campaigns, for reasons that go far beyond my proposal. My proposal was made into a sort of milestone for an antiglobalization program\". James Tobin's interview with Radio Popolare was quoted by the Italian foreign minister at the time, former director-general of the World Trade Organization Renato Ruggiero, during a Parliamentary debate on the eve of the G8 2001 summit in Genoa. Afterwards James Tobin distanced himself from the global justice movement.\nTobin observed that, while his original proposal had only the goal of \"putting a brake on the foreign exchange trafficking\", the antiglobalization movement had stressed \"the income from the taxes with which they want to finance their projects to improve the world\". He declared himself not contrary to this use of the tax's income, but stressed that it was not the important aspect of the tax.\nATTAC and other organizations have recognized that while they still consider Tobin's original aim as paramount, they think the tax could produce funds for development needs in the South (such as the Millennium Development Goals), and allow governments, and therefore citizens, to reclaim part of the democratic space conceded to the financial markets.\nIn March, 2002, London School of Economics Professor Willem Buiter, who studied under James Tobin, wrote an obituary for the man, but also remarked that, \"This [Tobin Tax] ... was in recent years adopted by some of the most determined enemies of trade liberalisation, globalisation and the open society.\" Buiter added, \"The proposal to use the Tobin tax as a means of raising revenues for development assistance was rejected by Tobin, and he forcefully repudiated the anti-globalisation mantra of the Seattle crowd.\" In September 2009, Buiter also wrote in the \"Financial Times\", \"Tobin was a genius ... but the Tobin tax was probably his one daft idea\".\nIn those same \"years\" that Buiter spoke of, the Tobin tax was also \"adopted\" or supported in varying degrees by the people who were not, as he put it, \"enemies of trade liberalisation.\" Among them were several supporters from 1990 to 1999, including Larry Summers and several from 2000 to 2004, including lukewarm support from George Soros.\nEvaluating the Tobin tax as a Currency Transaction Tax (CTT).\nStability, volatility and speculation.\nThe appeal of stability.\nIn 1972, Tobin examined the global monetary system that remained after the Bretton Woods monetary system was abandoned. This examination was subsequently revisited by other analysts, such as Ellen Frank, who, in 2002 wrote: \"If by globalization we mean the determined efforts of international businesses to build markets and production networks that are truly global in scope, then the current monetary system is in many ways an endless headache whose costs are rapidly outstripping its benefits.\" She continues with a view on how that monetary system stability is appealing to many players in the world economy, but is being undermined by volatility and fluctuation in exchange rates: \"Money scrambles around the globe in quest of the banker's holy grail \u2013 sound money of stable value \u2013 while undermining every attempt by cash-strapped governments to provide the very stability the wealthy crave.\"\nFrank then corroborates Tobin's comments on the problems this instability can create (e.g. high interest rates) for developing countries such as Mexico (1994), countries in South East Asia (1997), and Russia (1998). She writes, \"Governments of developing countries try to peg their currencies, only to have the peg undone by capital flight. They offer to dollarize or euroize, only to find themselves so short of dollars that they are forced to cut off growth. They raise interest rates to extraordinary levels to protect investors against currency losses, only to topple their economies and the source of investor profits. ... IMF bailouts provide a brief respite for international investors but they are, even from the perspective of the wealthy, a short-term solution at best ... they leave countries with more debt and fewer options.\"\nEffect on volatility.\nOne of the main economic hypotheses raised in favor of financial transaction taxes is that such taxes reduce return volatility, leading to an increase of long-term investor utility or more predictable levels of exchange rates. The impact of such a tax on volatility is of particular concern because the main justification given for this tax by Tobin was to improve the autonomy of macroeconomic policy by curbing international currency speculation and its destabilizing effect on national exchange rates.\nTheoretical models.\nMost studies of the likely impact of the Tobin tax on financial markets volatility have been \"theoretical\"\u2014researches conducted laboratory simulations or constructed economic models. Some of these theoretical studies have concluded that a transaction tax could reduce volatility by crowding out speculators or eliminating individual 'noise traders' but that it 'would not have any impact on volatility in case of sufficiently deep global markets such as those in major currency pairs, unlike in case of less liquid markets, such as those in stocks and (especially) options, where volatility would probably increase with reduced volumes. Behavioral finance theoretical models, such as those developed by Wei and Kim (1997) or Westerhoff and Dieci (2006) suggest that transaction taxes can reduce volatility, at least in the foreign exchange market. In contrast, some papers find a positive effect of a transaction tax on market volatility. Lanne and Vesala (2006) argue that a transaction tax \"is likely to amplify, not dampen, volatility in foreign exchange markets\", because such tax penalises informed market participants disproportionately more than uninformed ones, leading to volatility increases.\nEmpirical studies.\nIn most of the available \"empirical\" studies however, no statistically significant causal link has been found between an increase in transaction costs (transaction taxes or government-controlled minimum brokerage commissions) and a reduction in volatility\u2014in fact a frequent unintended consequence observed by 'early adopters' after the imposition of a financial transactions tax (see Werner, 2003) has been an \"increase in the volatility\" of stock market returns, usually coinciding with significant declines in liquidity (market volume) and thus in taxable revenue (Umlauf, 1993).\nFor a recent evidence to the contrary, see, e.g., Liu and Zhu (2009), which may be affected by selection bias given that their Japanese sample is subsumed by a research conducted in 14 Asian countries by Hu (1998), showing that \"an increase in tax rate reduces the stock price but has no significant effect on market volatility\". As Liu and Zhu (2009) point out, [...] the different experience in Japan highlights the comment made by Umlauf (1993) that it is hazardous to generalize limited evidence when debating important policy issues such as the STT [securities transaction tax] and brokerage commissions.\"\nOptimum Tobin tax rate.\nWhen James Tobin was interviewed by \"Der Spiegel\" in 2001, the tax rate he suggested was 0.5%. His use of the phrase \"let's say\" (\"sagen wir\") indicated that he was not, at that point, in an interview setting, trying to be precise. Others have tried to be more precise or practical in their search for the Tobin tax rate.\nAccording to Garber (1996), competitive pressure on transaction costs (spreads) in currency markets has reduced these costs to fractions of a basis point. For example, the EUR.USD currency pair trades with spreads as tight as 1/10 of a basis point, i.e. with just a 0.00001 difference between the bid and offer price, so \"a tax on transactions in foreign exchange markets imposed unilaterally, 6/1000 of a basis point (or 0.00006%) is a realistic maximum magnitude.\" Similarly Shvedov (2004) concludes that \"even making the unrealistic assumption that the rate of 0.00006% causes no reduction of trading volume, the tax on foreign currency exchange transactions would yield just $4.3 billion a year, despite an annual turnover in dozens of trillion dollars.\"\nAccordingly, one of the modern Tobin tax versions, called the \"Sterling Stamp Duty\", sponsored by certain UK charities, has a rate of 0.005% \"in order to avoid market distortions\", i.e., 1/100 of what Tobin himself envisaged in 2001. Sterling Stamp Duty supporters argue that this tax rate would not adversely affect currency markets and could still raise large sums of money.\nThe same rate of 0.005% was proposed for a currency transactions tax (CTT) in a report prepared by Rodney Schmidt for The North-South Institute (a Canadian NGO whose \"research supports global efforts to [..] improve international financial systems and institutions\"). Schmidt (2007) used the observed negative relationship between bid\u2013ask spreads and transactions volume in foreign exchange markets to estimate the maximum \"non-disruptive rate\" of a currency transaction tax. A CTT tax rate designed with a pragmatic goal of raising revenue for various development projects, rather than to fulfill Tobin's original goals (of \"slowing the flow of capital across borders\" and \"preventing or managing exchange rate crises\"), should avoid altering the existing \"fundamental market behavior\", and thus, according to Schmidt, must not exceed 0.00005, i.e., the observed levels of currency transaction costs (bid-ask spreads).\nThe mathematician Paul Wilmott has pointed out that while perhaps some trading ought to be discouraged, trading for the hedging of derivatives is generally considered a good thing in that it can reduce risk, and this should not be punished. He estimates that any financial tax should be at most one basis point so as to have negligible effect on hedging.\nAssuming that all currency market participants incur the same maximum level of transaction costs (the full cost of the bid-ask spread), as opposed to earning them in their capacity of market makers, and assuming that no untaxed substitutes exist for spot currency markets transactions (such as currency futures and currency exchange-traded funds), Schmidt (2007) finds that a CTT rate of 0.00005 would be nearly volume-neutral, reducing foreign exchange transaction volumes by only 14%. Such volume-neutral CTT tax would raise \"relatively little revenue\" though, estimated at $33 bn annually, i.e., an order of magnitude less than the \"carbon tax [which] has by far the greatest revenue-raising potential, estimated at $130-750 bn annually.\" The author warns however that both these market-based revenue estimates \"are necessarily speculative\", and he has more confidence in the revenue-raising potential of \"The International Finance Facility (IFF) and International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm).\"\nIs the tax easy to avoid.\nTechnical feasibility.\nAlthough Tobin had said his own tax idea was unfeasible in practice, Joseph Stiglitz, former Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank, said, on October 5, 2009, that modern technology meant that was no longer the case. Stiglitz said, the tax is \"much more feasible today\" than a few decades ago, when Tobin recanted.\nHowever, on November 7, 2009, at the G20 finance ministers summit in Scotland, Dominique Strauss-Khan, head of the International Monetary Fund, said \"transactions are very difficult to measure and so it's very easy to avoid a transaction tax.\"\nNevertheless, in early December 2009, economist Stephany Griffith-Jones agreed that the \"greater centralisation and automisation of the exchanges and banks clearing and settlements systems ... makes avoidance of payment more difficult and less desirable.\"\nIn January 2010, feasibility of the tax was supported and clarified by researcher Rodney Schmidt, who noted \"it is technically easy to collect a financial tax from exchanges ... transactions taxes can be collected by the central counterparty at the point of the trade, or automatically in the clearing or settlement process.\" (All large-value financial transactions go through three steps. First dealers agree to a trade; then the dealers' banks match the two sides of the trade through an electronic central clearing system; and finally, the two individual financial instruments are transferred simultaneously to a central settlement system. Thus a tax can be collected at the few places where all trades are ultimately cleared or settled.)\nBased on digital technology, a new form of taxation, levied on bank transactions, was successfully used in Brazil from 1993 to 2007 and proved to be evasion-proof, more efficient and less costly than orthodox tax models. In his book, \"Bank transactions: pathway to the single tax ideal\", Marcos Cintra carries out a qualitative and quantitative in-depth comparison of the efficiency, equity and compliance costs of a bank transactions tax relative to orthodox tax systems, and opens new perspectives for the use of modern banking technology in tax reform across the world.\nHow many nations are needed to make it feasible?\nIn the year 2000, \"eighty per cent of foreign-exchange trading [took] place in just seven cities. Agreement [to implement the tax] by [just three cities,] London, New York and Tokyo alone, would capture 58 per cent of speculative trading.\"\nEvaluating the Tobin tax as a general Financial Transaction Tax (FTT).\nSweden's experience in implementing Tobin taxes.\nIn July, 2006, analyst Marion G. Wrobel examined the actual international experiences of various countries in implementing financial transaction taxes. Wrobel's paper highlighted the Swedish experience with financial transaction taxes. In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.\nThe revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.\nOn the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.\nEven though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.\nTobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience.\nThe Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives. In global international currency trading, however, the situation could, some argue, look quite different.\nWrobel's studies do not address the global economy as a whole, as James Tobin did when he spoke of \"the nineties' crises in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia,\" which included the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\nPros and cons if the Tobin tax (FTT) were implemented?\nViews of ABAC.\nThe APEC Business Advisory Council, the business representatives' body in APEC, which is the forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region, expressed its views in a letter to the IMF on 15 February 2010.\nIn addition, ABAC expressed further concerns in the letter:\nNote - APEC's 21 Member Economies are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Republic of the Philippines, The Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States of America, Vietnam.\nViews of the ITUC/APLN.\nThe International Trade Union Confederation/Asia-Pacific Labour Network (ITUC/APLN), the informal trade union body of the Asia-Pacific, supported the Tobin Tax in their Statement to the 2010 APEC Economic Leaders Meeting. The representatives of APEC's national trade unions centers also met with the Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, the host Leader of APEC for 2010, and called for the Prime Minister's support on the Tobin Tax.\nThe ITUC shares its support for Tobin Tax with the Trade Union Advisory Council (TUAC), the official OECD trade union body, in a research on the feasibility, strengths and weaknesses of a potential Tobin Tax. ITUC, APLN and TUAC refer to Tobin Tax as the Financial Transactions Tax.\nRegular investors loss.\nAn economist speaking out against the common belief that investment banks would bear the burden of a Tobin tax is Simon Johnson, Professor of Economics at the MIT and a former Chief Economist at the IMF, who in a BBC Radio 4 interview discussing banking system reforms presented his views on the Tobin tax.\nLet Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill.\nIn 2009, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon proposed a financial transaction tax in his \"Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill\". (This was proposed domestically for the United States only.)\nWould there be net job losses if a FTT tax was introduced?\nSchwabish (2005) examined the potential effects of introducing a stock transaction (or \"transfer\") tax in a single city (New York) on employment not only in the securities industry, but also in the supporting industries. A financial transactions tax would lead to job losses also in non-financial sectors of the economy through the so-called multiplier effect forwarding in a magnified form any taxes imposed on Wall Street employees through their reduced demand to their suppliers and supporting industries. The author estimated the ratios of financial- to non-financial job losses of between 10:1 to 10:4, that is \"a 10 percent decrease in securities industry employment would depress employment in the retail, services, and restaurant sectors by more than 1 percent; in the business services sector by about 4 percent; and in total private jobs by about 1 percent.\"\nIt is also possible to estimate the impact of a reduction in stock market volume caused by taxing stock transactions on the rise in the overall unemployment rate. For every 10 percent decline in stock market volume, elasticities estimated by Schwabish implied that a stock transaction (\"transfer\") tax could cost New York City between 30,000 and 42,000 private-sector jobs, and if the stock market volume reductions reached levels observed by Umlauf (1993) in Sweden after a stock FTT was introduced there (\"By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London\") then according to Schwabish (2005), following an introduction of a FTT tax, there would be 150,000-210,000 private-sector jobs losses in the New York alone.\nThe cost of currency hedges\u2014and thus \"certainty what importers and exporters' money is worth\"\u2014has nothing to do with volatility whatsoever, as this cost is exclusively determined by the interest rate differential between two currencies. Nevertheless, as Tobin said, \"If ... [currency] is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase interest rates for their currency to still be attractive.\"\nIs there an optimum tax rate.\nFinancial transaction tax rates of the magnitude of 0.1%-1% have been proposed by normative economists, without addressing the practicability of implementing a tax at these levels. In positive economics studies however, where due reference was paid to the prevailing market conditions, the resulting tax rates have been significantly lower.\nFor instance, Edwards (1993) concluded that if the transaction tax revenue from taxing the futures markets were to be maximized (see Laffer curve), with the tax rate not leading to a prohibitively large increase in the marginal cost of market participants, the rate would have to be set so low that \"a tax on futures markets will not achieve any important social objective and will not generate much revenue.\"\nPolitical opinion.\nOpinions are divided between those who applaud that the Tobin tax could protect countries from spillovers of financial crises, and those who claim that the tax would also constrain the effectiveness of the global economic system, increase price volatility, widen bid\u2013ask spreads for end users such as investors, savers and hedgers, and destroy liquidity.\nTobin tax proponents response to empirical evidence on volatility.\nLack of \"direct\" supporting evidence for stabilizing (volatility-reducing) properties of Tobin-style transaction taxes in econometric research is acknowledged by some of the Tobin tax supporters:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese Tobin tax proponents propose on \"indirect\" evidence in their favor, reinterpreting studies which do not deal directly with volatility, but instead with trading volume (with volume being generally reduced by transaction taxes, though it constitutes their tax base, see: negative feedback loop). This allows these Tobin tax proponents to state that \"some studies show (implicitly) that higher transaction costs might dampen price volatility. This is so because these studies report that a reduction of trading activities is associated with lower price volatility.\" So if a study finds that reducing trading volume or trading frequency reduces volatility, these Tobin tax supporters combine it with the observation that Tobin-style taxes are volume-reducing, and thus should also indirectly reduce volatility (\"this finding implies a negative relationship between [..] transaction tax [..] and volatility, because higher transaction costs will 'ceteris paribus' always dampen trading activities).\" (Schulmeister et al., 2008, p.\u00a018).\nSome Tobin tax supporters argue that volatility is better defined as a \"long-term overshooting of speculative prices\" than by standard statistical definitions (e.g., conditional variance of returns) ) which are typically used in empirical studies of volatility.\nThe lack of empirical evidence to support or clearly refute the Tobin tax proponents' claim it will reduce \"excess\" volatility is due in part to a lack of an agreed definition of \"excess\" volatility that allows to be distinguished and formally measured.\nShould speculators be encouraged, penalized or dissuaded?\nThe Tobin tax rests on the premise that speculators ought to be, as Tobin puts it, \"dissuaded.\" This premise itself is a matter of debate: \"See Speculation.\"\nOn the other side of the debate were the leaders of Germany who, in May 2008, planned to propose a worldwide ban on oil trading by speculators, blaming the 2008 oil price rises on manipulation by hedge funds. At that time India, with similar concerns, had already suspended futures trading of five commodities.\nOn December 3, 2009, US Congressman Peter DeFazio stated, \"The American taxpayers bailed out Wall Street during a crisis brought on by reckless speculation in the financial markets, ... This [ proposed financial transaction tax ] legislation will force Wall Street to do their part and put people displaced by that crisis back to work.\"\nOn January 21, 2010, President Barack Obama endorsed the Volcker Rule which deals with proprietary trading of investment banks and restricts banks from making certain speculative kinds of investments if they are not on behalf of their customers. Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, President Obama's advisor, has argued that such speculation played a key role in the 2008 financial crisis.\nVolcker endorsed only the UK's tax on bank bonuses, calling it \"interesting\", but was wary about imposing levies on financial market transactions, because he is \"instinctively opposed\" to any tax on financial transactions.\nQuestions of volatility.\nIn February 2010, Tim Harford, writing in the Undercover Economist column of the \"Financial Times\", commented directly on the claims of Keynes and Tobin that 'taxes on financial transactions would reduce financial volatility'.\nComparing Currency Transaction Taxes (CTT) and Financial Transaction Taxes (FTT).\nResearch evidence.\nIn 2003, researchers like Aliber et al. proposed that empirical evidence on the observed effects of the already introduced and abolished stock transaction taxes and a hypothetical CTT (Tobin) can probably be treated \"interchangeably.\" They did not find any evidence on the differential effects of introducing or removing, stock transactions taxes or a hypothetical currency (Tobin) tax on any subset of markets or all markets.\nResearchers have used models belonging to the GARCH family to describe both the volatility behavior of stock market returns and the volatility behavior of foreign exchange rates. This is used as evidence that the similarity between currencies and stocks in the context of a tax designed to curb volatility such as a CTT (or FTT in general) can be inferred from the almost identical (statistically indistinguishable) behavior of the volatilities of equity and exchange rate returns.\nPractical considerations.\nHanke et al. state, \"The economic consequences of introducing a [currency-only] Tobin Tax are [...] completely unknown, as such a tax has not been introduced on any real foreign exchange market so far\". At the same time, even in the case of stock transaction taxes, where some empirical evidence is available, researchers warn that \"it is hazardous to generalize limited evidence when debating important policy issues such as the transaction taxes\".\nAccording to Stephan Schulmeister, Margit Schratzenstaller, and Oliver Picek (2008), from the practical viewpoint it is no longer possible to introduce a non-currency transactions tax (even if foreign exchange transactions were formally exempt) since the advent of currency derivatives and currency exchange-traded funds. All of these would have to be taxed together under a \"non-currency\" financial transactions tax (such as under certain proposals in the U.S. in 2009 which, although not intending to tax currencies directly, would still do so due to taxation of currency futures and currency exchange traded funds). Because these three groups of instruments are nearly perfect substitutes, if at least one of these groups were to be exempt, it would likely attract most market volume from the taxed alternatives.\nAccording to Stephan Schulmeister, Margit Schratzenstaller, and Oliver Picek (2008), restricting the financial transactions tax to foreign exchange only (as envisaged originally by Tobin) would not be desirable. Any \"general FTT seems...more attractive than a specific transaction tax\" (such as a currency-only Tobin tax), because it could reduce tax avoidance (i.e., substitution of similar untaxed instruments), could significantly increase the tax base and could be implemented more easily on organized exchanges than in a dealership market like the global foreign exchange market. (See also the discussion of tax avoidance as it relates to a currency transaction tax.)\nOn October 5, 2009, Joseph Stiglitz said that any new tax should be levied on all asset classes \u2013 not merely foreign exchange, and would be based on the gross value of the assets, thereby helping to discourage the creation of asset bubbles.\nNon-tax regulatory equivalent.\nOne non-tax regulatory equivalent of Tobin's (very narrow original) tax is to require \"non-interest bearing deposit requirements on all open foreign exchange positions.\". If these deposit requirements result in forfeits or losses if a currency suddenly declines due to speculation, they act as inhibitions against deliberate speculative shorts of a currency. However, they would not raise funds for other purposes, so are not a tax.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Hayley Mills in a dual role as a pair of teenage twins who switch places with each other in order to reunite their divorced parents, played by Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith. Although the plot is very close to that of the 1945 film \"Twice Blessed\", \"The Parent Trap\" is based on the 1949 German children's novel \"Das doppelte Lottchen\" by Erich K\u00e4stner.\nProduced by Walt Disney Productions, \"The Parent Trap\" was released on June 21, 1961, by Buena Vista Distribution. It grossed $25.1 million at the box office and was nominated for two Academy Awards. It was broadcast on television, and three television sequels followed the later adventures of the twins. The film was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan. It was released on VHS, in digital stereo LaserDisc format (1986), and on DVD (2002). \"The Parent Trap\" was the second of six films Mills made for Disney.\nPlot.\nTeenagers Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers meet at a girls summer camp. Their identical appearance causes jealousy, resentment, and a rivalry in which they continually get each other into trouble and disrupt camp activities. As punishment, they must spend the remainder of the camp season rooming and dining together in isolation. They overcome their mutual dislike when they realize that they are identical twin sisters, whom their parents, Mitch and Maggie, separated upon divorcing shortly after their birth. Eager to meet the parents from whom they were separated, they decide to cut their hair identically, coach each other on their lives, and switch places.\nIn Boston with their mother and grandparents, Susan poses as Sharon, while Sharon goes to Mitch's California ranch as Susan. Sharon learns that Mitch is engaged to a much younger woman, Vicky Robinson, who is interested only in Mitch's money and intends to send Susan to boarding school after the wedding. The girls communicate by phone at night. Susan tells Sharon to break up the couple, but when that fails, Susan decides to end the charade. After a happy reunion, Maggie brings her to California. Mitch is upset by Maggie's unexpected arrival, until he learns the truth and is reunited with both daughters. Vicky is jealous of Maggie, who is staying at the ranch.\nThe girls scheme to reunite their parents by recreating Maggie and Mitch's first date. At first, the ex-spouses are drawn together, but then they argue over why they divorced. They make up before Maggie and Sharon are to leave the next morning, and Maggie wishes Mitch well with Vicky. To delay the return to Boston, the twins dress and act alike, so their parents cannot tell them apart. They refuse to reveal their identities unless the family takes a camping trip. Mitch and Maggie reluctantly agree, and Vicky, who loathes the outdoors, is furious. Maggie cajoles Vicky into taking her place, wanting to give Vicky a chance to become better acquainted with each twin.\nThe twins take every opportunity to exploit Vicky's hatred of camping, pulling a series of pranks on her. That night, both sneak into her tent and pour honey over Vicky's feet and leave a small honey trail outside the tent. Vicki awakens the following morning to find two bear cubs licking the honey off her feet to which she has a tantrum over her hatred of the outdoors and the twins. She further says all the trouble she has been through does not make marrying Mitch for his money worth it and storms off.\nBack at the house, the twins apologize for their actions; Mitch accepts their apology and says they do not have to discuss the situation anymore. Maggie and Sharon prepare to return to Boston the next day, with the twins now resigned to seeing each other only during visits and shuttling back and forth between parents. Later, Mitch tells Maggie everything he misses about her and their marriage. They realize that they still love each other. The film ends with their second wedding, with Susan and Sharon as their bridesmaids.\nProduction.\nThe source material, \"Das doppelte Lottchen\", was discovered by Disney's story editor Bill Dover, who recommended the studio buy it.\nIn March 1960, Disney announced that Hayley Mills would star in \"His and Hers\" to be written and directed by David Swift. Swift and Mills had just made \"Pollyanna\" for Disney. It was also known as \"Petticoats and Blue Jeans\" and was the first in a five-film contract Mills signed with Disney, to make one each summer.\nMaureen O'Hara signed in June. She wrote in her memoirs that Disney offered her a third of her normal fee of $75,000 but that she held out for her quote and got it. O'Hara said her contract gave her top billing but that Disney decided to give that to Mills; she says this caused tension with the studio and was why she never worked with Disney again.\nProduction started in July under the title of \"We Belong Together\" and went until September.\nThe production used split screen technology to create the effect of Mills playing both girls, with Susan Henning acting as a body double as part of the filming process.\nThe film was shot mostly at various locales in California. The summer camp scenes were filmed at Bluff Lake Camp (then owned by the Pasadena YMCA, now by Habonim Dror's Camp Gilboa) and the family camping scenes later in the movie at Cedar Lake Camp, both in the San Bernardino Mountains near the city of Big Bear Lake in Southern California. The Monterey scenes were filmed in various California locations, including millionaire Stuyvesant Fish's ranch in Carmel and Monterey's Pebble Beach golf course. The scenes at the Monterey house were shot at the studio's Golden Oak Ranch in Placerita Canyon, where Mitch's ranch was built. It was the design of this set that proved the most popular, and to this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans of the home's interior design. In fact, there never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a sound stage. Camp Inch was based on a real girls' camp called Camp Crestridge for Girls at the Ridgecrest Baptist Conference Center near Asheville, North Carolina.\nIn 1962, a year after Disney adapted \"Das doppelte Lottchen\" into \"The Parent Trap\", Cyrus Brooks translated the German book into English as \"Lisa and Lottie\", an edition still published in the United States and Canada.\nIn 2014, \"Das doppelte Lottchen\" was faithfully retranslated into English by Anthea Bell and republished in the United Kingdom and Australia by Pushkin Press as \"The Parent Trap,\" after the hit Disney film. Then in 2020, Australian actress Ruby Rees recorded an unabridged narration of Bell's translation for Bolinda.\nMusical numbers.\nRichard and Robert Sherman provided the songs, which, besides the title song \"The Parent Trap\", includes \"For Now, For Always\", and \"Let's Get Together\". \"Let's Get Together\" (sung by Annette Funicello) is heard playing from a record player at the summer camp; the tune is reprised by the twins when they restage their parents' first date and that version is sung double-tracked by Hayley Mills (Hayley's own single of the song, credited to \"Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills\", reached #8 on the US charts). The film's title song was performed by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello, who were both on the studio lot shooting \"Babes in Toyland\" at the time. The campers whistle the 1914 marching song, \"Colonel Bogey March\", as they march through camp, mirroring the scene from \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\".\nReception.\nCritical.\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"it should be most appealing to adults, as well as to children, because of the cheerfully persuasive dual performance of Hayley Mills\". \"Variety\" stated that the film was \"absolutely predictable from the outset\", but was still \"a winner\" thanks to the performance of Mills, who \"seems to have an instinctive sense of comedy and an uncanny ability to react in just the right manner. Her contribution to the picture is virtually infinite\". Charles Stinson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared it \"a comedy unusually well designed for the entire family \u2014 enough sight gags to keep the children screaming and enough clever dialogue to amuse their parents\". \"Harrison's Reports\" graded the film as \"Very Good\" and Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"charmingly lively\" even though \"the terrain is familiar\".\nThe film holds a score of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews.\nBox office.\nThe film was a huge success at the box office. It grossed an estimated $9.3 million in the US.\nAccolades.\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards: one for Sound by Robert O. Cook, and the other for Film Editing by Philip W. Anderson. The film and its editor, Philip W. Anderson, won the inaugural 1962 Eddie Award of the American Cinema Editors.\nSubsequent developments.\nIn 1961, a comic book version of the film was published, adapted, and illustrated by Dan Spiegle.\nThe film was theatrically re-released in 1968 and earned $1.8 million in rentals.\nThe Disney Studios produced three television sequels \"The Parent Trap II\" (1986), \"Parent Trap III\" (1989) and \"\" (1989). The original was remade in 1998 starring Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, and Natasha Richardson. Joanna Barnes also made an appearance as Vicki Blake, the mother of Dennis Quaid's character's fianc\u00e9e, Meredith.\nIn 2018, a potential remake of \"The Parent Trap\" was considered for Walt Disney Studios' streaming service Disney+.\nIn India, there have been several films inspired by \"The Parent Trap\". In 1965, a Tamil language version of the story called \"Kuzhandaiyum Deivamum\", starring Kutty Padmini was released. The following year, it was remade into Telugu as \"Leta Manasulu\" also starring Kutty Padmini. A Hindi version \"Do Kaliyaan\" starring Neetu Singh in the double role was made in 1968. The 1987 film \"Pyar Ke Kabil\" also has a similar storyline, as does the 2001 film \"Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi\" which has Kajol playing the double role of 23-year-old twins.\nHome media.\n\"The Parent Trap\" was initially released by Walt Disney Home Video through VHS on April 7, 1984, and on May 28, 1986, as part of Disney's \"Wonderland Campaign\".\nThe film was released on a 2-disc special edition DVD in May 2002, as part of the Vault Disney collection, with a new digital remaster by THX.\nIn 2005, the film was once again released in a 2-Movie Collection, which also contained the made-for-television sequel, \"The Parent Trap II\" (1986), plus the original film trailer and other bonus features.\nThe film was released for the first time on Blu-ray, but as a Disney Movie Club exclusive on April 24, 2018. The 1998 remake was also released on Blu-ray the same day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
