It is headquartered at the UN Office in Vienna, Austria, with a permanent presence in over 60 countries. As of October 4,2024, UNIDO comprises 173 member states, which together set the organization's policies, programs, and principles through the biannual General Conference.\nUNIDO was established in 1966 by the UN General Assembly to promote and accelerate the industrialization of developing countries, which were emerging from decolonization in record numbers and with little to no industrial base. In 1979 it became one of the 15 specialized agencies of the UN, with its new constitution coming into force in 1985. Since its founding, the organization has restructured and reformed several times; the 2013 Lima Declaration expanded its mission to include promoting \"inclusive and sustainable industrial development\" (ISID), defined as benefiting greater numbers of people while safeguarding the environment. UNIDO is a member of the United Nations Development Group, a coalition of UN entities aimed at fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals.\nOn 25 July 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/70/293, proclaiming the period 2016\u20132025 as the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA III). UNIDO was called upon to lead the initiative in collaboration with a range of partners. These include the African Union Commission, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the Economic Commission for Africa, etc.\nFrom 2018 to 2021, UNIDO's strategic priorities include creating shared prosperity; advancing economic competitiveness; safeguarding the environment; and strengthening knowledge and institutions. Each of these goals is to be achieved through technical cooperation, policy advice, analysis and research, the development of uniform standards and quality control, and partnerships for knowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation.\nUNIDO employs some 670 staff and draws on the services of some 2,800 international and national experts\u2014approximately half from developing countries\u2014annually, who work in project assignments throughout the world.\nOverview.\nThe relevance of ISID as an integrated approach to all three pillars of sustainable development is recognized by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will frame United Nations and country efforts towards sustainable development in the next fifteen years. UNIDO's mandate is fully recognized in SDG-9, which calls to \"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\". The relevance of ISID, however, applies in greater or lesser extent to all SDGs.\nAccordingly, the Organization's programmatic focus is structured, as detailed in the Organization's Medium-Term Programme Framework 2018\u20132021, in four strategic priorities:\nEach of these programmatic fields of activity contains a number of individual programmes, which are implemented in a holistic manner to achieve effective outcomes and impacts through UNIDO's four enabling functions: \nIn carrying out the core requirements of its mission, UNIDO has considerably increased its technical services over the past ten years. At the same time, it has also substantially increased its mobilization of financial resources, testifying to the growing international recognition of the Organization as an effective provider of catalytic industrial development services.\nUNIDO was established as a UN programme in 1966 with headquarters in Vienna, Austria, and became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1985.\nIn 2004, UNIDO established the UNIDO Goodwill Ambassador programme.\nIn 2009, UNIDO created a new flagship publication, http:// .\nFacts and figures.\nUNIDO's headquarters are located at the Vienna International Centre, the UN campus that also hosts the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, among others.\nStrategic priorities.\nCreating shared prosperity.\nUNIDO concentrates its efforts on the development of agro-industries, increasing the participation of women and youth in productive activities, and human security in post-crisis situations. The Organization's services for the development of agro-industries focus on adding value to agricultural production by strengthening linkages between agriculture, industry and markets.\nUNIDO supports the transformation of enterprises from the informal sector to the formal sector, with a special focus on simplifying and improving access to administrative company registration services. It also strives to improve women's participation in entrepreneurial activities. Based on its experience in post-crisis and human security programmes and projects, UNIDO responds to complex emergencies through activities that contribute to socio-economic as well as environmental and energy security both at national and local level.\nAdvancing economic competitiveness.\nUNIDO supports programmes towards investment and technology promotion, SME development, trade capacity building, and entrepreneurship development.\nUNIDO provides advisory services to improve the business and policy environment for the private sector, assisting with the creation of productive capacities. Its programmes support investment and technology opportunities to help enterprises, especially SMEs, improve productivity and innovation, and achieve systemic competitive advantages. Building on a robust global network aimed at fostering investment, technology and other partnership opportunities, UNIDO seeks to enable SMEs to capitalize on their unique dynamism and flexibility by strengthening synergies among enterprises and with support institutions.\nIn the context of trade capacity-building programmes, UNIDO strengthens international trade norms and standards by assisting developing countries and transition economies in upgrading production and processing systems to enhance the quality of local products, in particular through the adoption of improved technologies, and help them conform to the standards required by international markets. UNIDO builds capacities in both public and private institutions to formulate trade policies and strategies based on economic and statistical analysis, as well as benchmarking competitive performance at sectoral and product levels and supporting the establishment of trade-related databases such as inventories of technical barriers to trade (TBT), which are designed to expand exports from the industrial sector.\nSafeguarding the environment.\nUNIDO supports countries in their environmental management efforts, including the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and the provision of sustainable energy. It helps create new green industries, establishing national road maps for greening the supply chain, determining benchmarks and indicators, disseminating and sharing best practices, running clean technology programmes, undertaking various capacity-building exercises and contributing to international forums with the necessary research and expertise.\nThe Organization's services include capacity building, direct technical support to enterprises and assistance to government institutions on Cleaner Production (CP) policy matters, as well as the promotion, adaptation and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the implementation of advanced CP business models, such as chemical leasing.\nStrengthening knowledge and institutions.\nStrengthening knowledge and institutions is a prioritized outcome that is elevated over other high-level results. It describes the organization's strategic direction towards strengthening the knowledge base for ISID at the project, programme, country and international level, as well as the institutional capacity at the technical, policy and normative level.\nHistorical background.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) can be traced to a series of studies on a programme of rapid industrialization of developing countries that the United Nations Secretariat carried out during the early 1950s at the request of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). These studies culminated in a programme of work on industrialization and productivity prepared by the United Nations Secretary-General in 1956 and endorsed the next year by ECOSOC and the General Assembly. At that time, it was first suggested that a special body to deal with the problems of industrialization be established, whose political organs could relieve ECOSOC and the General Assembly of the detailed consideration of those questions and whose secretariat could carry out more substantive work than the existing Industry Section of the Bureau of Economic Affairs within the Secretariat. The Industry Section of the Secretariat became a branch in 1959, and in 1962 it became the \"Industrial Development Centre\", headed by a \"Commissioner for Industrial Development\".\nSpecial organ of the United Nations.\nIn the aftermath, proposals for further institutionalizing industrial development-related issues within the UN were considered by various advisory groups and inter-organizational organs. Subsequently, the United Nations General Assembly created the UNIDO in November 1966 as a special organ of the United Nations. In January 1967, the Organization was formally established with headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Compared to the Industrial Development Centre, UNIDO's creation was intended to broaden the work of its predecessor. Besides normative activities, such as acting as a forum for discussions, analytical functions and information dissemination, UNIDO became involved in operational activities, i.e. in technical co-operation activities.\nConversion into a specialized agency.\nThe setting up of UNIDO as a special organ had nonetheless been a compromise solution. The developing countries (the Group of 77) had in the first instance promoted the idea of a specialized agency with its own political decision-making governing bodies and autonomy in budgetary matters. The same position was advocated by several high-level expert groups and intergovernmental committees during the following years. In the context of the General Assembly's adoption of the \"Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States\", UNIDO's second General Conference, held in 1975 in Lima, Peru, adopted the \"Lima Declaration on Industrial Development and Cooperation\". For the first time, industrial development objectives were quantified internationally \u2013 the Lima Target anticipated the developing countries to attain a twenty-five per cent share of world industrial production by the year of 2000. As part of the institutional arrangements of the Lima Plan of Action, and with a view to assisting in the establishment of a New International Economic Order, it was recommended to the General Assembly that UNIDO be converted into a specialized agency.\nAn intergovernmental committee prepared a draft constitution, which was adopted in Vienna in 1979. However, the objections and doubts of industrialized countries as to the necessity of a specialized agency contributed to delaying the ratification process. In order to ensure that the new organization would start up with a membership including substantially all significant States, the General Assembly, by resolutions adopted in 1982 and 1984, called for a series of formal consultations among prospective Member States, which eventually led to a general agreement that the new UNIDO Constitution should enter into force. All necessary formal requirements were fulfilled in 1985, and in December of the same year, UNIDO finally became the sixteenth Specialized Agency of the United Nations with headquarters in Vienna.\nCrisis and reform during the 1990s.\nDuring the subsequent years, UNIDO continuously expanded particularly its operational activities. However, several developments outside and inside the Organization led to a crisis, which reached a breaking point in 1997 when UNIDO faced the risk of closure: After the end of the Cold War and the triumph of the market economic system over the command economic system, and in view of the Washington Consensus that limited the role of industrial policy in economic development processes, some Member States felt that industrial development could be supported more effectively and efficiently by the private sector. As a result, Canada, the United States (UNIDO's then largest donor), and Australia subsequently withdrew from the Organization between 1993 and 1997. Simultaneously, the continued slowdown in the economies of some major industrialized countries as well as the financial turmoil of the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused multilateral development assistance to decline. In addition, a weak management structure and lack of focus and integration of UNIDO's activities contributed to aggravating the crisis.\nUNIDO's Member States responded by adopting a stringent Business Plan on the Future Role and Functions of the Organization in June 1997. Activities laid out in the Business Plan are based on the clear comparative advantages of UNIDO, while avoiding overlap and duplication with other multilateral institutions. A key point was that activities should be integrated into packages of services, rather than being provided on a stand-alone basis. The Organization radically reformed itself on the basis of this business plan and streamlined its services, human and financial resources as well as internal processes during the following years.\nPost-reform role.\nOn the basis of sound finances and in a second wave of programmatic reforms in 2004, UNIDO further focused its activities and technical services directly responding to international development priorities. In an independent assessment of 23 international organizations against a large numbers of criteria, UNIDO was assessed 6th best overall and as best in the group of specialized agencies. In regard of the current UN Reform debate, it can be observed that UNIDO is actively contributing to UN system-wide coherence and cost efficiency.\nGovernance.\nMembership.\nMembers of the UN, or of UN specialized agencies, or of the IAEA, are eligible for membership with UNIDO. The process of becoming a Member of the Organization is achieved by becoming a party to the Constitution. Observer status is open, upon request, to those enjoying such status in the General Assembly of the United Nations, unless the UNIDO General Conference decides otherwise. The Conference has the authority to invite other observers to participate in the work of the Organization in accordance with the relevant rules of procedure and the provisions of the Constitution.\nAs of 4 October 2024, 173 States are Members of UNIDO, all except State of Palestine of them being UN members. UNIDO Members are divided into four lists. List A consists of all UNIDO countries in the African + Asian Groups of UN (along with Israel, while excluding Cyprus and Japan). List B consists of all UNIDO countries in WEOG group of UN (along with Cyprus and Japan, and excluding Israel). List C consists of all UNIDO countries in GRULAC group of UN. List D consists of all UNIDO countries in the Eastern European group of UN.\nThe lists, originally defined in http:// and the http:// serve to balance geographical distribution of member states' representation on the Industrial Development Board and the Programme and Budget Committee.\nUNIDO is one of the two UN specialized agencies where members are separated into groups while the other is IFAD. UNIDO List B, is similar to IFAD List A \u2013 which comprises primarily developed countries, while the set of the rest of UNIDO members is similar to the set of the rest of IFAD members \u2013 which comprise primarily developing countries.\nThe full lists are as follows:\nList A (100 members): Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo, Ivory Coast, DR Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, North Korea, South Korea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, State of Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\nList B (21 members): Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey.\nList C (32 members): Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela.\nList D (20 members): Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine.\nFormer UNIDO members are Australia (1985\u201397, List B), Belgium (1985\u20132015, List B), Canada (1985\u201393, List B), Denmark (1985\u20132016, List B), France (1985\u20132014, List B), Greece (1985\u20132016, List B), Lithuania (1991\u20132012, List D), New Zealand (1985\u20132013, List B), Portugal (1985\u20132014, List B), Slovakia (1993\u20132017), United Kingdom (1985\u20132012, List B), and the United States (1985\u201396, List B).\nOther UN member states that have never signed, ratified, or denounced the constitution are Andorra, Brunei, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Nauru, San Marino, and Singapore.\nThe Holy See and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta have observer status with UNIDO.\nPolicy-making organs.\nThe policy-making organs (or governing bodies) of UNIDO are based on their predecessors that were effective prior to UNIDO becoming a specialized agency. Thus, the General Conference, the Industrial Development Board (IDB) and the Programme and Budget Committee (PBC) are anchored in the Constitution.\nSubstantive decisions of the policy-making organs are generally taken by consensus. A vote takes place when no consensus can be reached or on specific request of a member of the policy-making organ\nGeneral Conference.\nThe Conference is the highest policy-making organ of the Organization and consists of all Member States of UNIDO. It meets every two years and approves the programme and budgets, establishes the scale assessments for regular budget expenditures for the forthcoming biennium and, every second time, appoints the Director-General for a period of four years.\nIndustrial Development Board (IDB).\nThe Board meets once in Conference years and twice in other years, and consists of 53 Member States of the Organization that are elected for a four-year term. It acts as a preparatory body for the Conference and reviews the implementation of the approved programme of work and of the corresponding regular and operational budgets for the forthcoming biennium. Among its other main functions, the Board recommends to the Conference a scale of assessments, as well as a candidate for the post of Director-General.\nProgramme and Budget Committee (PBC).\nThe Committee consists of 27 Member States of the Organization that are elected for a two-year term and meets at least once a year to consider, inter alia, the proposals of the Director-General for the programme of work and corresponding estimates for the regular and operational budgets.\nSecretariat.\nThe Secretariat of UNIDO is based in Vienna (Austria) and maintains representative offices in Brussels (Belgium), Geneva (Switzerland) and New York City (USA). As of 2013, UNIDO's organizational structure comprises The Office of the Director-General (ODG), the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation Division (PTC), the Office of the Deputy to the Director General (DDG), the Programme Support and General Management Division (PSM) as well as offices of Internal Oversight and Legal Services.\nThe current Director-General of UNIDO is Gerd M\u00fcller (since December 2021).\nCountry level representation.\nField representation.\nUNIDO's system of field representation includes four categories of offices:\nTechnical offices at country level.\nIn order to provide additional support to UNIDO's technical activities, different types of technical offices have been established.

Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... are represented in unary as 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, ...\nUnary is a bijective numeral system. However, although it has sometimes been described as \"base 1\", it differs in some important ways from positional notations, in which the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. For instance, the unary form of a number can be exponentially longer than its representation in other bases.\nThe use of tally marks in counting is an application of the unary numeral system. For example, using the tally mark | (\ud834\udf77), the number 3 is represented as |||. In East Asian cultures, the number 3 is represented as \u4e09, a character drawn with three strokes. (One and two are represented similarly.) In China and Japan, the character \u6b63, drawn with 5 strokes, is sometimes used to represent 5 as a tally.\nUnary numbers should be distinguished from repunits, which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation.\nOperations.\nAddition and subtraction are particularly simple in the unary system, as they involve little more than string concatenation. The Hamming weight or population count operation that counts the number of nonzero bits in a sequence of binary values may also be interpreted as a conversion from unary to binary numbers. However, multiplication is more cumbersome and has often been used as a test case for the design of Turing machines.\nComplexity.\nCompared to standard positional numeral systems, the unary system is inconvenient and hence is not used in practice for large calculations. It occurs in some decision problem descriptions in theoretical computer science (e.g. some P-complete problems), where it is used to \"artificially\" decrease the run-time or space requirements of a problem. For instance, the problem of integer factorization is suspected to require more than a polynomial function of the length of the input as run-time if the input is given in binary, but it only needs linear runtime if the input is presented in unary. However, this is potentially misleading. Using a unary input is slower for any given number, not faster; the distinction is that a binary (or larger base) input is proportional to the base 2 (or larger base) logarithm of the number while unary input is proportional to the number itself. Therefore, while the run-time and space requirement in unary looks better as function of the input size, it does not represent a more efficient solution.\nIn computational complexity theory, unary numbering is used to distinguish strongly NP-complete problems from problems that are NP-complete but not strongly NP-complete. A problem in which the input includes some numerical parameters is strongly NP-complete if it remains NP-complete even when the size of the input is made artificially larger by representing the parameters in unary. For such a problem, there exist hard instances for which all parameter values are at most polynomially large.\nApplications.\nIn addition to the application in tally marks, unary numbering is used as part of some data compression algorithms such as Golomb coding. It also forms the basis for the Peano axioms for formalizing arithmetic within mathematical logic.\nA form of unary notation called Church encoding is used to represent numbers within lambda calculus.\nSome email spam filters tag messages with a number of asterisks in an e-mail header such as \"X-Spam-Bar\" or \"X-SPAM-LEVEL\". The larger the number, the more likely the email is considered spam. Using a unary representation instead of a decimal number lets the user search for messages with a given rating or higher. For example, searching for **** yield messages with a rating of at least 4.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can be used as a pivot language in interlingual machine translation systems or as a knowledge representation language in information retrieval applications. \nStructure.\nIn UNL, the information conveyed by the natural language is represented sentence by sentence as a hypergraph composed of a set of directed binary labeled links between nodes or hypernodes. As an example, the English sentence \"The sky was blue?!\" can be represented in UNL as follows: \nIn the example above, codice_1 and codice_2, which represent individual concepts, are UW's attributes of an object directed to linking the semantic relation between the two UWs; \"@def\", \"@interrogative\", \"@past\", \"@exclamation\" and \"@entry\" are attributes modifying UWs.\nUWs are expressed in natural language to be humanly readable. They consist of a \"headword\" (the UW root) and a \"constraint list\" (the UW suffix between parentheses), where the constraints are used to disambiguate the general concept conveyed by the headword. The set of UWs is organized in the UNL Ontology. \nRelations are intended to represent semantic links between words in every existing language. They can be ontological (such as \"icl\" and \"iof\"), logical (such as \"and\" and \"or\"), or thematic (such as \"agt\" = \"agent\", \"ins\" = \"instrument\", \"tim\" = \"time\", \"plc\" = \"place\", etc.). There are currently 46 relations in the UNL Specs that jointly define the UNL syntax.\nWithin the UNL program, the process of representing natural language sentences in UNL graphs is called \"UNLization\", and the process of generating natural language sentences out of UNL graphs is called \"NLization\". UNLization is intended to be carried out semi-automatically (i.e., by humans with computer aids), and NLization is intended to be carried out automatically.\nHistory.\nThe UNL program started in 1996 as an initiative of the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) of the United Nations University (UNU) in Tokyo, Japan. In January 2001, the United Nations University set up an autonomous and non-profit organization, the UNDL Foundation, to be responsible for the development and management of the UNL program. It inherited from the UNU/IAS the mandate of implementing the UNL program.\nThe overall architecture of the UNL System has been developed with a set of basic software and tools. \nIt was recognized by the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for the \"industrial applicability\" of the UNL, which was obtained in May 2002 through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO); the UNL acquired the US patents 6,704,700 and 7,107,206."}

It is based upon the ability of \"H. pylori\" to convert urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Urea breath tests are recommended in leading society guidelines as a preferred non-invasive choice for detecting \"H. pylori\" before and after treatment.\nPrinciples and mechanism.\nPatients swallow urea labelled with an uncommon isotope, either radioactive carbon-14 (nowadays preferred in many countries) or non-radioactive carbon-13. In the subsequent 10\u201330 minutes, the detection of isotope-labelled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath indicates that the urea was split; this indicates that urease (the enzyme that \"H. pylori\" uses to metabolize urea to produce ammonia) is present in the stomach, and hence that \"H. pylori\" bacteria are present.\nFor the two different forms of urea, different instrumentation is required. Carbon-14 is normally measured by scintillation, whereas carbon-13 can be detected by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) or simpler by nondispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometry. For each of these methods, a baseline breath sample is required before taking the isotope-labeled urea, for comparison with the post-urea sample, with a 15- to 30-minute duration between them. Samples may be sent to a reference laboratory for analysis. Alternatively, NDIR spectrometry can be performed by a table-top instrument as an office-based test, and results are provided immediately within minutes.\nThe difference between the pre- and post urea measurements is used to determine infection. This value is compared to a cut-off value. Results below the value are assumed to be negative, those above positive. The cut-off value itself is determined by comparing the results of patients with two or more different detection methods. The value is chosen that gives the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. Both carbon-14 and carbon-13 urea breath tests have high sensitivity and specificity, though the carbon-13 test is preferred in certain populations due to its non-radioactive nature.\nThe test measures active \"H. pylori\" infection. If antibiotics are depressing the amount of \"H. pylori\" present, or the stomach conditions are less acidic than normal, the amount of urease present will be lessened.\nAccordingly, the test should only be performed 14 days after stopping acid reducing medication (proton pump inhibitors, PPI) or 28 days after stopping antibiotic treatment. Some clinicians believe that a reservoir of \"H. pylori\" in dental plaque can affect the result.\nThe test is especially done accompanying an eradication therapy by antibiotics (to avoid overdosing) or to check the success of an ulcer operation. In both cases, immunological tests can give false positive results.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such naval nuclear reactors have a complete power plant associated with them. All commissioned U.S. Navy submarines and supercarriers built since 1975 are nuclear powered, with the last conventional carrier, , being decommissioned in May 2009. The U.S. Navy also had nine nuclear-powered cruisers with such reactors, but they have since been decommissioned also. \nReactors are designed by a number of contractors, then developed and tested at one of several Department of Energy-owned and prime contractor-operated facilities: Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania and its associated Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho, and Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, New York and its associated Kesselring site in West Milton, New York, all under the management of the office of Naval Reactors. Sometimes there were full-scale nuclear-powered prototype plants built at the Naval Reactors Facility, Kesselring, and Windsor (in Connecticut) to test the nuclear plants, which were operated for years to train nuclear-qualified sailors.\nReactor designations.\nEach reactor design is given a three-character designation consisting of:\nFor example, a S9G reactor represents a submarine (S), ninth-generation (9), General Electric designed reactor (G).\nHistory.\nConceptual analysis of nuclear marine propulsion started in the 1940s. Research on developing nuclear reactors for the Navy was done at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania starting in 1948. Under the long-term leadership of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the first test reactor plant, a prototype referred to as S1W, started up in U.S. in 1953 at the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho. Bettis Laboratory and Naval Reactors Facility were operated initially and for many decades afterwards by Westinghouse. The first nuclear-powered vessel, the submarine , put to sea in 1955. USS \"Nautilus\" marked the beginning of the transition of submarines from relatively slow and short-ranged conventional submarines to ones capable of sustaining submerged for weeks on end.\nMuch of the early development work on naval reactors was done at the Naval Reactors Facility on the campus of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL, previously INEL). USS \"Nautilus\" was powered by the S2W reactor, and crew were trained on the land-based S1W reactor at INL.\nThe second nuclear submarine was , which was initially powered by a sodium-cooled S2G reactor, and supported by the land-based S1G reactor at the Kesselring site under Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory operated by General Electric. A spare S2G was also built but never used.\nUSS \"Seawolf\" was plagued by superheater problems, with the result that USS \"Nautilus\" delivered far superior performance. This and the risks posed by liquid sodium in the event of an accident at sea led Admiral Rickover to select the pressurized water reactor (PWR) as the standard U.S. naval reactor type. The S2G was removed from USS \"Seawolf\" and replaced by the S2Wa reactor, using components from the spare S2W that was part of the USS \"Nautilus\" program. All subsequent U.S. naval reactors have been PWRs, while the Soviet Navy used mainly PWRs, but also used lead-bismuth cooled liquid metal cooled reactors (LMFR) of three types in eight submarines: and the seven-member .\nExperience with USS \"Nautilus\" led to the parallel development of further () submarines, powered by single reactors, and an aircraft carrier, , powered by eight A2W reactor units in 1960. A cruiser, , followed in 1961 and was powered by two C1W reactor units. USS \"Enterprise\" remained in service for over 50 years, and was inactivated in 2012.\nFull-scale land-based prototype plants in Idaho, New York, and Connecticut preceded development of several types (generations) of U.S. naval nuclear reactors, although not all of them. After initial construction, some engineering testing was done and the prototypes were used to train nuclear-qualified sailors for many years afterwards. For example, the A1W prototype at Naval Reactors Facility led to development of A2W reactors used in USS \"Enterprise\". By 1962, the US Navy had 26 nuclear submarines operational and 30 under construction. Nuclear power had revolutionized the U.S. Navy.\nThe technology was shared with the United Kingdom, while technological development in France, China and the Soviet Union proceeded separately.\nAfter the \"Skate\"-class vessels, reactor development proceeded and in the U.S. a single series of standardized designs was built by both Westinghouse and General Electric, with one reactor powering each vessel. Rolls-Royce built similar units as the PWR1 for Royal Navy submarines and then developed the design further to the PWR2. Numerous submarines with an S5W reactor plant were built.\nAt the end of the Cold War in 1989, there were over 400 nuclear-powered submarines operational or being built. Some 250 of these submarines have now been scrapped and some on order canceled, due to weapons reduction programs. The Russian Navy and United States Navy had over one hundred each, with the United Kingdom and France less than twenty each and China six. The total today is about 160.\nThe United States is the main navy with nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (10), while Russia has nuclear-powered cruisers. Russia has eight nuclear icebreakers in service or building. Since its inception in 1948, the U.S. Navy nuclear program has developed 27 different plant designs, installed them in 210 nuclear-powered ships, taken 500 reactor cores into operation, and accumulated over 5,400 reactor years of operation and 128,000,000 miles safely steamed. Additionally, 98 nuclear submarines and six nuclear cruisers have been recycled. The U.S. Navy has never disclosed a reactor accident, but has suffered at least one coolant loss accident, on the USS Guardfish.\nAll nine of the U.S. Navy nuclear-powered cruisers (CGN) have now been stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and those not already scrapped by recycling are scheduled to be recycled. While reactor accidents have not sunk any U.S. Navy ships or submarines, two nuclear-powered submarines, and were lost at sea. The condition of these reactors has not been publicly released, although both wrecks have been investigated by Robert Ballard on behalf of the Navy using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).\nCongress has mandated that the U.S. Navy consider nuclear power as an option on all large surface combatants (cruisers, destroyers) and amphibious assault ships. If proven cost-effective in a life cycle cost analysis during the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) phase of preliminary ship design, new ship classes (e.g. CG(X)) could proceed with nuclear propulsion.\nPower plants.\nCurrent U.S. naval reactors are all pressurized water reactors, which are identical to PWR commercial reactors producing electricity, except that:\nLong core life is enabled by high uranium enrichment and by incorporating a \"burnable neutron poison\", which is progressively depleted as non-burnable poisons like fission products and actinides accumulate. The loss of burnable poison counterbalances the creation of non-burnable poisons and result in stable long term fuel efficiency.\nLong-term integrity of the compact reactor pressure vessel is maintained by providing an internal neutron shield. (This is in contrast to early Soviet civil PWR designs where embrittlement occurs due to neutron bombardment of a very narrow pressure vessel.)\nReactor sizes range up to ~500\u00a0MWt (about 165\u00a0MWe) in the larger submarines and surface ships. The French s have a 48\u00a0MW reactor that needs no refueling for 30\u00a0years.\nThe nuclear navies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation rely on steam turbine propulsion. Those of the French and Chinese use the turbine to generate electricity for propulsion. Most Russian submarines as well as all U.S. surface ships since \"Enterprise\" are powered by two or more reactors. U.S., British, French, Chinese and Indian submarines are powered by one.\nDecommissioning nuclear-powered submarines has become a major task for American and Russian navies. After defuelling, U.S. practice is to cut the reactor section from the vessel for disposal in shallow land burial as low-level waste (see the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lipscomb\" (SSN-685) was a unique nuclear-powered attack submarine of the United States Navy.\nThe submarine was named after Glenard P. Lipscomb, who served as a representative from California's 24th congressional district from 1953 until his death in 1970.\nDesign.\n\"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was developed under project SCB 302.68. She was the U.S. Navy's second submarine design using a turbo-electric transmission; the first was the smaller . \"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was intended to test the potential advantages of this propulsion system for providing quieter and safer operation for a full sized attack submarine (safer because reverse thrust would be instantaneous with reversal of the direct current engine's electric polarity). The \"Tullibee\" plant had to be scaled up by a factor of six, which resulted in a displacement of 6,400 tons and a length of . \"Glenard P. Lipscomb \" was thus larger than similar vessels with conventional drive trains, which resulted in slower speeds due to the greater displacement and wetted area. Her unique turbo-electric drive system was unreliable due to the decision to adopt a direct-current main motor. Subsequent U.S. submarine designs did not incorporate turbo-electric drive until the s. Other than the engine room, \"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was generally similar to the , and although serving as a test platform she was a fully combat-capable attack submarine.\nConstruction.\nConstruction of \"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" began on 5 June 1971 at the Electric Boat Company shipyard in Groton, Connecticut. Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird, a long-time colleague and friend of Glenard Lipscomb, spoke at the keel-laying ceremony. \"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was launched on 4 August 1973, sponsored by Mrs. Glenard P. Lipscomb, and was commissioned on 21 December 1974.\nCareer.\n\"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" deployed to the North Atlantic in the fall of 1976, followed immediately by a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in the winter and spring of 1977. The boat was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.\nThe submarine deployed to the North Atlantic in the winter and spring of 1978. \"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in the winter and spring of 1979.\n\"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was awarded the Commander, Submarine Development Squadron Twelve, Battle Efficiency [White] \"E\" and Engineering Excellence [Red] \"E\" for Fiscal Years 1977, 1978 under the command of Commander Robert B. Wilkinson and 1979, and 1980 under the command of Commander Thomas Robertson.\nIn 1987, she was involved in a collision with a tugboat in the Cooper River at Naval Weapons Station Charleston. Suffering slight damage to her towed array housing and propeller, she was required to spend an extra week in drydock to facilitate repairs. There were no injuries aboard the submarine; however, the tugboat sank as a result of the collision.\n\"Glenard P. Lipscomb\" was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 July 1990 and disposed of under the submarine recycling program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 1 December 1997. Her active duty career of less than 16 years is one of the shortest for a nuclear submarine in the US Navy.\nSee also.\nOther submarines with unique silencing features\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It governs football, futsal and beach football in Europe and the transcontinental countries of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan, as well as the West Asian countries of Cyprus, Armenia and Israel. UEFA consists of 55 national association members. Since 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA and UEFA suspended all Russian national teams and clubs from any FIFA and UEFA competitions.\nUEFA consists of the national football associations of Europe, and runs national and club competitions including the European Championship, Nations League, Champions League, Europa League, Conference League, and Super Cup, and also controls the prize money, regulations, as well as media rights to those competitions.\nHenri Delaunay acted as the first general secretary and Ebbe Schwartz as the first president. The current president is Aleksander \u010ceferin, a former Football Association of Slovenia president, who was elected as UEFA's seventh president at the 12th Extraordinary UEFA Congress in Athens in September 2016, and automatically became a vice-president of the world body FIFA.\nHistory and membership.\nUEFA was officially inaugurated on 15 June 1954 in Basel, Switzerland, after consultation between the Italian, French, and Belgian associations. At the founding meeting, 25 members were present. However, six other associations which were not present were still recognised as founding members, bringing the total of founding associations to 31. UEFA grew to more than 50 members by the mid-1990s, as new associations were born out of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia into their constituent states. UEFA's main headquarters after its foundation were located in Paris, but moved to Bern in 1960. Finally, they moved to Nyon, Switzerland, in 1995, opening the organisation's current headquarters in 1999.\nCurrent members.\nUEFA membership coincides for the most part with recognition as a sovereign country in Europe (48 out of 55 members are sovereign UN member states), although there are some exceptions. One UN member state (Monaco) and one UN General Assembly non-member observer state (Vatican City) are not members. Some UEFA members are not sovereign states, but form part of a larger recognised sovereign state in the context of international law. These include England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (UK constituent countries), Gibraltar (UK overseas territory), Faroe Islands (Danish Realm), and Kosovo (state with limited recognition), however, in the context of these countries, government functions concerning sport tend to be carried at the territorial level coterminous with the UEFA member entity. UEFA have previously declined membership to those deemed as non-sovereign countries like Jersey.\nSome UEFA members are transcontinental states (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) and others are considered part of Europe both culturally and politically (Turkey, Cyprus and Armenia). Countries which had been members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) were also admitted to the European football association, such as Israel (because it had been banned from the AFC group in 1974) and Kazakhstan. Involving clubs, some UEFA member associations allow teams from outside their association's main territory to take part in their \"domestic\" competition, for example, AS Monaco in the French League, various Welsh clubs in the English leagues, or Derry City, situated in Northern Ireland, plays in the Republic of Ireland-based League of Ireland.\nOn 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and in accordance with a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the UEFA suspended the participation of Russia. The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the UEFA ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the ban. On 26 September 2023 the ban was lifted for the Russia U-17 team enabling them to complete in the 2024 Euro U-17 with UEFA saying \"by banning children from our competitions, we not only fail to recognise and uphold a fundamental right for their holistic development but we directly discriminate against them\". The lifting of the ban also applied to all teams, men and women, of underage players. This was rejected by the FA of Ukraine, England, and Sweden, with all three threatening to boycott matches against Russia.\nEurope's Big Five.\nFive of the UEFA national teams, Germany, Italy, France, England and Spain, have won 12 out of 22 FIFA World Cups for Europe. These five nations also make up the so-called \"Europe's Big Five\", consisting of Spain's La Liga, England's Premier League, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1.\nExecutive committee.\nUEFA executive committee is composed of;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCompetitions.\nUEFA continental competitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDefunct\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUEFA runs official international competitions in Europe and some countries of Northern, Southwestern and Central Asia for national teams and professional clubs, known as \"UEFA competitions\", some of which are regarded as the world's most prestigious tournaments.\nUEFA is the organiser of two of the most prestigious competitions in international football: The UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. The main competition for men's national teams is the UEFA European Championship (also known as the Euro), which started in 1958, with the first finals in 1960, and was known as the European Nations Cup until 1964. The UEFA Nations League is the second tournament of UEFA and was introduced in 2018. The tournament largely replaced the international friendly matches previously played on the FIFA International Match Calendar. It will be played every two years.\nUEFA also runs national competitions at Under-21, Under-19 and Under-17 levels. For women's national teams, UEFA operates the UEFA Women's Championship for senior national sides as well as Women's Under-19 and Women's Under-17 Championships.\nWorld, Olympic and intercontinental competitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBeside continental European competitions for national and their junior teams, the UEFA organizes various qualification male and female tournaments among European national and their junior teams for World Cups (organized by FIFA) and Olympics (organized by IOC).\nUEFA also organised the UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup with CAF for youth teams in an effort to boost youth football. UEFA launched the UEFA Regions' Cup, for semi-professional teams representing their local region, in 1999. In futsal there is the UEFA Futsal Championship and UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship. Despite the existence of UEFA's Futsal \"and\" Beach soccer committee, UEFA does not organise any beach soccer competitions. International and club beach soccer competitions for UEFA members are organised externally by Beach Soccer Worldwide.\nThe Italian, German, Spanish, French and Russian men's national teams are the only teams to have won the European football championship in all categories.\nClub.\nThe top-ranked UEFA competition is the UEFA Champions League, which started in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (or simply the European Cup) and initially only gathered the top team of each country; this competition has since been expanded to gather the top 1\u20134 teams of each country's league (the number of teams depend on that country's ranking and can be upgraded or downgraded).\nA second, lower-ranked competition is the UEFA Europa League. This competition, for national knockout cup winners and high-placed league teams, was launched by UEFA in 1971 as a successor of both the former UEFA Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (also began in 1955). A third competition, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which started in 1960, was absorbed into the UEFA Cup (now UEFA Europa League) in 1999.\nIn December 2018, UEFA announced the creation of a third club competition, later named the UEFA Europa Conference League. The competition features 32 teams in 8 groups of 4, with a knockout round between the second placed teams in Europa Conference League and the third placed teams in the Europa League, leading to a final 16 knockout stage featuring the eight group winners. The first edition of the competition was played in 2021\u20132022.\nIn women's football UEFA also conducts the UEFA Women's Champions League for club teams. The competition was first held in 2001, and was known as the UEFA Women's Cup until 2009.\nThe UEFA Super Cup pits the winners of the Champions League against the winners of the Europa League (previously the winners of the Cup Winners' Cup), and came into being in 1973.\nThe UEFA Intertoto Cup was a summer competition, previously operated by several Central European football associations, which was relaunched and recognised as official UEFA club competition by UEFA in 1995. The last Intertoto Cup took place in 2008.\nThe European/South American Cup was jointly organised with CONMEBOL between the Champions League and the Copa Libertadores winners.\nOnly five teams (Juventus, Ajax, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea) have won each of the three main competitions (European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners' Cup/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League), a feat that is no longer possible for any team that did not win the Cup Winners' Cup. There are currently eight teams throughout Europe that have won two of the three trophies; all but one have won the Cup Winners' Cup, four require a win in the Champions League and four require a UEFA Europa League win.\nUntil the first staging of the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2022, Juventus of Italy was the only team in Europe to win all UEFA's official championships and cups and, in commemoration of achieving that feat, have received \"The UEFA Plaque\" by the Union of European Football Associations on 12 July 1988.\nUEFA's premier futsal competition is the UEFA Futsal Cup, a tournament started in 2001 which replaced the former Futsal European Clubs Championship. This event, despite enjoying a long and well-established tradition in the European futsal community, dating back to 1984, was never recognised as official by UEFA.\nThere was an attempt to create a Europa League-style second tier women's club competition, which had been in discussion since 2021. In December 2023, the attempt came into a fruition, with the first edition of the competition to be played in 2025\u201326. In December 2024, the name of the competition, \"UEFA Women's Europa Cup\", was announced.\nSponsors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNote: The UEFA Champions League sponsors are also sponsors of the UEFA Super Cup and the UEFA Youth League.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNote: The UEFA Europa League sponsors are also sponsors of the UEFA Conference League.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFIFA World Rankings.\nOverview.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTeam of the Year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor tournament records.\nLegend\nFor each tournament, the flag of the host country and the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\nCorruption and controversy.\nDissatisfied fans across Europe have referred to the organisation as \"UEFA mafia\", including in Russia's top league, in Bulgaria's top league, and in a Champions League group stage match held in Sweden. The term has also been covered for its use outside of stadiums, for example during a protest in Kosovo outside an EU building following the Serbia v Albania (UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying) match. F.C. Copenhagen supporters displayed banners around the city, with slogans such as \"UEFA MAFIA \u2013 THE PANDEMIC OF FOOTBALL\", when UEFA ordered their 2019\u201320 Europa League round of 16 return leg be played behind closed doors, despite reduced capacity being allowed by the Danish government.\nFollowing the 2015 FIFA corruption case, the then-president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was also involved in the case. Swiss prosecutors accused FIFA president Sepp Blatter of making a \"disloyal payment\" of $2m (\u00a31.6m) to Mr Platini. Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, stated: \"We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person\". Both Platini and Sepp Blatter were banned from football-related activity. Platini appealed to Court of Arbitration for Sports, which lowered the six-year ban to four years. He further appealed to Swiss courts and the European Court of Human Rights but the courts rejected his appeals.\nIn 2019 UEFA's decision to host Europa League Cup final in Baku, Azerbaijan left one of the finalists, Arsenal, with a decision to withdraw their Armenian player Henrikh Mkhitaryan out of the competition due to safety concerns, and there has been long-standing debates about the extent to which the elite clubs or UEFA itself should exert the most influence on the game. UEFA's decision to partner with blockchain company Chiliz in February 2022 was criticised and described as 'incomprehensible' by fan groups across Europe.\nIn July 2025, UEFA sanctioned Crystal Palace F.C. and Olympique Lyonnais for breaching its multi-club ownership rules, due to overlapping ownership by John Textor\u2019s Eagle Football Group. Palace, who had qualified for the UEFA Europa League as FA Cup winners, were instead placed in the UEFA Europa Conference League, while Lyon retained the Europa League spot. The Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected Palace\u2019s appeal in August 2025.\nSee also.\nResolutions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

New coins have been produced annually and they comprise a significant aspect of the United States currency system. Circulating coins exist in denominations of 1\u00a2 (i.e. 1 cent or $0.01), 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2, 50\u00a2, and $1.00. Also minted are bullion, including gold, silver and platinum, and commemorative coins. All of these are produced by the United States Mint. The coins are then sold to Federal Reserve Banks which in turn put coins into circulation and withdraw them as demanded by the United States economy.\nCurrent coinage.\nFour mints currently operate in the United States, producing billions of coins each year. The main mint is the Philadelphia Mint, which produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemorative coins. The Denver Mint also produces circulating coinage, mint sets and commemoratives. The San Francisco Mint produces regular and silver proof coinage, and produced circulating coinage until the 1970s. The West Point Mint produces bullion coinage (including proofs). Philadelphia and Denver produce the dies used at all of the mints. The proof and mint sets are manufactured each year and contain examples of all of the year's circulating coins.\nThe producing mint of each coin may be easily identified, as most coins bear a mint mark. The identifying letter of the mint can be found on the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins bear a letter P. Denver coins bear a letter D, San Francisco coins bear a letter S, and West Point coins bear a letter W. S and W coins are rarely found in general circulation, although S coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods from the mid-19th century until the early 20th century by temporary mints in Carson City, Nevada; New Orleans, Louisiana; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dahlonega, Georgia. Most such coins that still exist are now in the hands of collectors and museums.\nBullion coins.\nNon-circulating bullion coins have been produced each year since 1986. They can be found in gold, silver, platinum (since 1997), and palladium (since 2017). The face value of these coins is legal as tender, but does not actually reflect the value of the precious metal contained therein. On May 11, 2011, Utah became the first state to accept these coins as the value of the precious metal in common transactions. The Utah State Treasurer assigns a numerical precious metal value to these coins each week based on the spot metal prices. The bullion coin types include \"S\" (San Francisco, 1986\u20131992), \"P\" (Philadelphia, 1993 \u2013 2000), and \"W\" (West Point, New York, 2001\u2013present).\nCommemorative coins.\nModern commemoratives have been minted since 1982. A list is available here.\nMint marks.\nList of current and past United States Mint branches and mint marks found on their coins:\nObsolete and canceled coins.\nThe law governing obsolete, mutilated, and worn coins and currency, including types which are no longer in production (e.g. Indian cents), can be found in \u00a0https://.\nNote: It is a common misconception that \"eagle\"-based nomenclature for gold U.S. coinage was merely slang. The \"eagle,\" \"half-eagle\" and \"quarter-eagle\" were specifically given these names in the Coinage Act of 1792. Likewise, the double eagle was specifically created as such by name (\"An Act to authorize the Coinage of Gold Dollars and Double Eagles\", title and section 1, March 3, 1849).\nMill coins.\nAlthough the term mill (also mil or mille) was defined in the eighteenth century as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20441,000 of a dollar or 0.1\u00a2, no coin smaller than 0.5\u00a2 has ever been officially minted in the U.S. However, unofficial mill coins, also called \"tenth cent\" or \"tax-help coins\", made of diverse materials\u2014plastic, wood, tin, and others\u2014were produced as late as the 1960s by some states, localities, and private businesses for tax payments and to render change for small purchases.\nLegal protections.\nThe alteration or lightening of U.S. coins for fraudulent purposes is illegal. It is generally legal to melt down coins for the use of their constituent metals, but the Treasury Department has occasionally prohibited melting down and mass exportation when the value of the metal exceeds the face value of the coin. This has happened from 1967 to 1969 for silver coins, from 1974 to 1978 for pennies, and since 2006 for pennies and nickels. The use of elongated coin presses is considered legal because it is not for fraudulent purposes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The IOC country code was EUN, after the French name, \u00c9quipe unifi\u00e9e. The Unified Team was sometimes informally called the CIS Team (Commonwealth of Independent States, as a counterpart of CIS national football team taking part in Euro 1992 of the same year), although Georgia did not join the CIS until 1993.\nThe team finished second in the medal table at the 1992 Winter Games, and first at the 1992 Summer Games, edging its old rival the US in the latter.\nCeremonies procedures.\nAt the 1992 Winter Olympics, the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the IOC due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union having only taken place little more than two months prior. During the opening ceremony, the team's placard displayed \"\u00c9quipe unifi\u00e9e\" in large print, with the names of the five participating countries displayed in smaller print below, and both the French and English announcers announced only the names of the participating countries without announcing the name \"Unified Team\". Russian flagbearer Valeriy Medvedtsev followed, carrying the Olympic Flag, followed by the team's athletes in no particular order, each carrying a small flag representing their individual country.\nBy the time of the 1992 Summer Olympics, the NOCs had affiliated separately, though they fielded a joint team with a standard uniform as Olympic qualifying rounds had been completed before the final demise of the Soviet Union. During the opening ceremony, the team's four-sided placard displayed \"Unified Team\" in the four official languages (French, English, Spanish, and Catalan), followed by Russian flagbearer Aleksandr Karelin carrying the Olympic Flag, followed by three more four-sided placards displaying the 12 constituent countries in English, followed by 12 flagbearers carrying the national flags of the 12 countries, followed by the athletes, all in no particular order. The announcers announced the name \"Unified Team\" in multiple languages, followed by the Spanish announcer announcing all 12 countries. During medals ceremonies, where an EUN individual won a medal, the national flag of the medalist's nation was raised rather than the Olympic flag, and a gold medalist's national anthem was played rather than the Olympic Hymn. In team events, the EUN team continued to use the Olympic flag and the Olympic Hymn, as team members represented different nations.\nParticipating countries.\nWhile only five of the EUN countries took part in the 1992 Winter Olympics, all twelve participated in the 1992 Summer Olympics. At the 1994 Winter Olympics and the 1996 Summer Olympics, the nations that were part of the Unified Team started to make their Olympic debuts as independent countries.\nMedal tables.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32337", "revid": "48116510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32337", "title": "Uniform continuity", "text": "Uniform restraint of the change in functions\nIn mathematics, a real function formula_1 of real numbers is said to be uniformly continuous if there is a positive real number formula_2 such that function values over any function domain interval of the size formula_2 are as close to each other as we want. In other words, for a uniformly continuous real function of real numbers, if we want function value differences to be less than any positive real number formula_4, then there is a positive real number formula_2 such that formula_6 for any formula_7 and formula_8 in any interval of length formula_2 within the domain of formula_1. \nThe difference between uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is that in uniform continuity there is a \"globally applicable\" formula_2 (the size of a function domain interval over which function value differences are less than formula_4) that depends on only formula_4, while in (ordinary) continuity there is a \"locally applicable\" formula_2 that depends on both formula_4 and formula_7. So uniform continuity is a stronger continuity condition than continuity; a function that is uniformly continuous is continuous but a function that is continuous is not necessarily uniformly continuous. The concepts of uniform continuity and continuity can be expanded to functions defined between metric spaces. \nContinuous functions can fail to be uniformly continuous if they are unbounded on a bounded domain, such as formula_17 on formula_18, or if their slopes become unbounded on an infinite domain, such as formula_19 on the real (number) line. However, any Lipschitz map between metric spaces is uniformly continuous, in particular any isometry (distance-preserving map). \nAlthough continuity can be defined for functions between general topological spaces, defining uniform continuity requires more structure. The concept relies on comparing the sizes of neighbourhoods of distinct points, so it requires a metric space, or more generally a uniform space.\nDefinition for functions on metric spaces.\nFor a function formula_20 with metric spaces formula_21 and formula_22, the following definitions of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity hold.\nLocal continuity versus global uniform continuity.\nIn the definitions, the difference between uniform continuity and continuity is that, in uniform continuity there is a globally applicable formula_2 (the size of a neighbourhood in formula_35 over which values of the metric for function values in formula_36 are less than formula_4) that depends on only formula_4 while in continuity there is a locally applicable formula_2 that depends on the both formula_4 and formula_7. Continuity is a \"local\" property of a function \u2014 that is, a function formula_1 is continuous, or not, at a particular point formula_7 of the function domain formula_85, and this can be determined by looking at only the values of the function in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of that point. When we speak of a function being continuous on an interval, we mean that the function is continuous at every point of the interval. In contrast, uniform continuity is a \"global\" property of formula_1, in the sense that the standard definition of uniform continuity refers to every point of formula_85. On the other hand, it is possible to give a definition that is \"local\" in terms of the natural extension formula_88(the characteristics of which at nonstandard points are determined by the global properties of formula_1), although it is not possible to give a local definition of uniform continuity for an arbitrary hyperreal-valued function, see below.\nA mathematical definition that a function formula_1 is continuous on an interval formula_91 and a definition that formula_1 is uniformly continuous on formula_91 are structurally similar as shown in the following.\nContinuity of a function formula_94 for metric spaces formula_21 and formula_22 at every point \"formula_7\" of an interval formula_98 (i.e., continuity of formula_1 on the interval formula_91) is expressed by a formula starting with quantifications\n formula_101,\n(metrics formula_102 and formula_103 are formula_104 and formula_105 for formula_106 for the set of real numbers formula_107).\nFor uniform continuity, the order of the first, second, and third quantifications (formula_108, formula_109, and formula_110) are rotated:\n formula_111.\nThus for continuity on the interval, one takes an arbitrary point formula_7 of the interval\",\" and then there must exist a distance formula_2,\n formula_114\nwhile for uniform continuity, a single formula_2 must work uniformly for all points formula_7 of the interval,\n formula_117\nProperties.\nEvery uniformly continuous function is continuous, but the converse does not hold. Consider for instance the continuous function formula_118 where formula_119 is the set of real numbers. Given a positive real number formula_4, uniform continuity requires the existence of a positive real number formula_2 such that for all formula_122 with formula_123, we have formula_124. But\n formula_125\nand as formula_7 goes to be a higher and higher value, formula_2 needs to be lower and lower to satisfy formula_128 for positive real numbers formula_129 and the given formula_4. This means that there is no specifiable (no matter how small it is) positive real number formula_2 to satisfy the condition for formula_1 to be uniformly continuous so formula_1 is not uniformly continuous.\nAny absolutely continuous function (over a compact interval) is uniformly continuous. On the other hand, the Cantor function is uniformly continuous but not absolutely continuous.\nThe image of a totally bounded subset under a uniformly continuous function is totally bounded. However, the image of a bounded subset of an arbitrary metric space under a uniformly continuous function need not be bounded: as a counterexample, consider the identity function from the integers endowed with the discrete metric to the integers endowed with the usual Euclidean metric.\nThe Heine\u2013Cantor theorem asserts that \"every continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous\". In particular, \"if a function is continuous on a closed bounded interval of the real line, it is uniformly continuous on that interval\". The Darboux integrability of continuous functions follows almost immediately from this theorem.\nIf a real-valued function formula_1 is continuous on formula_135 and formula_136 exists (and is finite), then formula_1 is uniformly continuous. In particular, every element of formula_138, the space of continuous functions on formula_119 that vanish at infinity, is uniformly continuous. This is a generalization of the Heine-Cantor theorem mentioned above, since formula_140.\nVisualization.\nFor a uniformly continuous function, for every positive real number formula_152 there is a positive real number formula_153 such that two function values formula_154 and formula_155 have the maximum distance formula_4 whenever formula_7 and formula_8 are within the maximum distance formula_2. Thus at each point formula_160 of the graph, if we draw a rectangle with a height slightly less than formula_161 and width a slightly less than formula_162 around that point, then the graph lies completely within the height of the rectangle, i.e., the graph do not pass through the top or the bottom side of the rectangle. For functions that are not uniformly continuous, this isn't possible; for these functions, the graph might lie inside the height of the rectangle at some point on the graph but there is a point on the graph where the graph lies above or below the rectangle. (the graph penetrates the top or bottom side of the rectangle.)\nHistory.\nThe first published definition of uniform continuity was by Heine in 1870, and in 1872 he published a proof that a continuous function on an open interval need not be uniformly continuous. The proofs are almost verbatim given by Dirichlet in his lectures on definite integrals in 1854. The definition of uniform continuity appears earlier in the work of Bolzano where he also proved that continuous functions on an open interval do not need to be uniformly continuous. In addition he also states that a continuous function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous, but he does not give a complete proof.\nOther characterizations.\nNon-standard analysis.\nIn non-standard analysis, a real-valued function \"formula_1\" of a real variable is microcontinuous at a point \"formula_164\" precisely if the difference formula_165 is infinitesimal whenever \"formula_2\" is infinitesimal. Thus \"formula_1\" is continuous on a set \"formula_168\" in formula_119 precisely if formula_88 is microcontinuous at every real point formula_171. Uniform continuity can be expressed as the condition that (the natural extension of) formula_1 is microcontinuous not only at real points in formula_168, but at all points in its non-standard counterpart (natural extension) formula_174 in formula_175. Note that there exist hyperreal-valued functions which meet this criterion but are not uniformly continuous, as well as uniformly continuous hyperreal-valued functions which do not meet this criterion, however, such functions cannot be expressed in the form formula_88 for any real-valued function formula_1. (see non-standard calculus for more details and examples).\nCauchy continuity.\nFor a function between metric spaces, uniform continuity implies Cauchy continuity . More specifically, let formula_168 be a subset of formula_179. If a function formula_180 is uniformly continuous then for every pair of sequences formula_181 and formula_182 such that\nformula_183\nwe have\nformula_184\nRelations with the extension problem.\nLet formula_85 be a metric space, formula_186 a subset of formula_85\",\" formula_188 a complete metric space, and formula_189 a continuous function. A question to answer: \"When can formula_1 be extended to a continuous function on all of formula_85?\"\nIf \"formula_186\" is closed in formula_85, the answer is given by the Tietze extension theorem. So it is necessary and sufficient to extend \"formula_1\" to the closure of formula_186 in formula_85: that is, we may assume without loss of generality that \"formula_186\" is dense in formula_85, and this has the further pleasant consequence that if the extension exists, it is unique. A sufficient condition for formula_1 to extend to a continuous function formula_200 is that it is Cauchy-continuous, i.e., the image under \"formula_1\" of a Cauchy sequence remains Cauchy. If formula_85 is complete (and thus the completion of \"formula_186\"), then every continuous function from \"formula_85\" to a metric space \"formula_205\" is Cauchy-continuous. Therefore when \"formula_85\" is complete, \"formula_1\" extends to a continuous function formula_200 if and only if \"formula_1\" is Cauchy-continuous.\nIt is easy to see that every uniformly continuous function is Cauchy-continuous and thus extends to \"formula_85\". The converse does not hold, since the function formula_211 is, as seen above, not uniformly continuous, but it is continuous and thus Cauchy continuous. In general, for functions defined on unbounded spaces like \"formula_188\", uniform continuity is a rather strong condition. It is desirable to have a weaker condition from which to deduce extendability.\nFor example, suppose formula_213 is a real number. At the precalculus level, the function formula_214 can be given a precise definition only for rational values of \"formula_7\" (assuming the existence of qth roots of positive real numbers, an application of the Intermediate Value Theorem). One would like to extend formula_1 to a function defined on all of formula_188. The identity\n formula_218\nshows that \"formula_1\" is not uniformly continuous on the set \"formula_220\" of all rational numbers; however for any bounded interval \"formula_91\" the restriction of \"formula_1\" to formula_223 is uniformly continuous, hence Cauchy-continuous, hence formula_1 extends to a continuous function on \"formula_91\". But since this holds for every \"formula_91\", there is then a unique extension of \"formula_1\" to a continuous function on all of \"formula_188\".\nMore generally, a continuous function formula_189 whose restriction to every bounded subset of \"formula_186\" is uniformly continuous is extendable to \"formula_85\", and the converse holds if \"formula_85\" is locally compact.\nA typical application of the extendability of a uniformly continuous function is the proof of the inverse Fourier transformation formula. We first prove that the formula is true for test functions, there are densely many of them. We then extend the inverse map to the whole space using the fact that linear map is continuous; thus, uniformly continuous.\nGeneralization to topological vector spaces.\nIn the special case of two topological vector spaces formula_233 and formula_234, the notion of uniform continuity of a map formula_235 becomes: for any neighborhood formula_236 of zero in formula_234, there exists a neighborhood formula_168 of zero in formula_233 such that formula_240 implies formula_241\nFor linear transformations formula_235, uniform continuity is equivalent to continuity. This fact is frequently used implicitly in functional analysis to extend a linear map off a dense subspace of a Banach space.\nGeneralization to uniform spaces.\nJust as the most natural and general setting for continuity is topological spaces, the most natural and general setting for the study of \"uniform\" continuity are the uniform spaces. A function formula_94 between uniform spaces is called \"uniformly continuous\" if for every entourage \"formula_233\" in \"formula_205\" there exists an entourage \"formula_246\" in \"formula_85\" such that for every formula_248 in formula_246 we have formula_250 in formula_233.\nIn this setting, it is also true that uniformly continuous maps transform Cauchy sequences into Cauchy sequences.\nEach compact Hausdorff space possesses exactly one uniform structure compatible with the topology. A consequence is a generalization of the Heine-Cantor theorem: each continuous function from a compact Hausdorff space to a uniform space is uniformly continuous.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Uniform spaces generalize metric spaces and topological groups, but the concept is designed to formulate the weakest axioms needed for most proofs in analysis.\nIn addition to the usual properties of a topological structure, in a uniform space one formalizes the notions of relative closeness and closeness of points. In other words, ideas like \"\"x\" is closer to \"a\" than \"y\" is to \"b\"\" make sense in uniform spaces. By comparison, in a general topological space, given sets \"A,B\" it is meaningful to say that a point \"x\" is \"arbitrarily close\" to \"A\" (i.e., in the closure of \"A\"), or perhaps that \"A\" is a \"smaller neighborhood\" of \"x\" than \"B\", but notions of closeness of points and relative closeness are not described well by topological structure alone.\nDefinition.\nThere are three equivalent definitions for a uniform space. They all consist of a space equipped with a uniform structure.\nEntourage definition.\nThis definition adapts the presentation of a topological space in terms of neighborhood systems. A nonempty collection formula_1 of subsets of formula_2 is a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;uniform structure (or a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;uniformity) if it satisfies the following axioms:\nThe non-emptiness of formula_1 taken together with (2) and (3) states that formula_1 is a filter on formula_6 If the last property is omitted we call the space &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;quasiuniform. An element formula_19 of formula_1 is called a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;vicinity or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;entourage from the French word for \"surroundings\".\nOne usually writes formula_31 where formula_32 is the vertical cross section of formula_19 and formula_34 is the canonical projection onto the second coordinate. On a graph, a typical entourage is drawn as a blob surrounding the \"formula_35\" diagonal; all the different formula_36's form the vertical cross-sections. If formula_37 then one says that formula_38 and formula_39 are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;formula_19-close. Similarly, if all pairs of points in a subset formula_41 of formula_42 are formula_19-close (that is, if formula_44 is contained in formula_19), formula_41 is called \"formula_19-small\". An entourage formula_19 is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;symmetric if formula_37 precisely when formula_50, or equivalently, if formula_51. The first axiom states that each point is formula_19-close to itself for each entourage formula_25 The third axiom guarantees that being \"both formula_19-close and formula_17-close\" is also a closeness relation in the uniformity. The fourth axiom states that for each entourage formula_19 there is an entourage formula_17 that is \"not more than half as large\". Finally, the last axiom states that the property \"closeness\" with respect to a uniform structure is symmetric in formula_38 and formula_59\nA &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;base of entourages or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;fundamental system of entourages (or vicinities) of a uniformity formula_1 is any set formula_61 of entourages of formula_1 such that every entourage of formula_1 contains a set belonging to formula_64 Thus, by property 2 above, a fundamental systems of entourages formula_61 is enough to specify the uniformity formula_1 unambiguously: formula_1 is the set of subsets of formula_2 that contain a set of formula_64 Every uniform space has a fundamental system of entourages consisting of symmetric entourages.\nIntuition about uniformities is provided by the example of metric spaces: if formula_70 is a metric space, the sets\nformula_71\nform a fundamental system of entourages for the standard uniform structure of formula_72 Then formula_38 and formula_39 are formula_75-close precisely when the distance between formula_38 and formula_39 is at most formula_78\nA uniformity formula_1 is \"finer\" than another uniformity formula_80 on the same set if formula_81 in that case formula_80 is said to be \"coarser\" than formula_83\nPseudometrics definition.\nUniform spaces may be defined alternatively and equivalently using systems of pseudometrics, an approach that is particularly useful in functional analysis (with pseudometrics provided by seminorms). More precisely, let formula_84 be a pseudometric on a set formula_72 The inverse images formula_86 for formula_87 can be shown to form a fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity. The uniformity generated by the formula_75 is the uniformity defined by the single pseudometric formula_89 Certain authors call spaces the topology of which is defined in terms of pseudometrics \"gauge spaces\".\nFor a \"family\" formula_90 of pseudometrics on formula_91 the uniform structure defined by the family is the \"least upper bound\" of the uniform structures defined by the individual pseudometrics formula_92 A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the set of \"finite\" intersections of entourages of the uniformities defined by the individual pseudometrics formula_92 If the family of pseudometrics is \"finite\", it can be seen that the same uniform structure is defined by a \"single\" pseudometric, namely the upper envelope formula_94 of the family.\nLess trivially, it can be shown that a uniform structure that admits a countable fundamental system of entourages (hence in particular a uniformity defined by a countable family of pseudometrics) can be defined by a single pseudometric. A consequence is that \"any\" uniform structure can be defined as above by a (possibly uncountable) family of pseudometrics (see Bourbaki: General Topology Chapter IX \u00a71 no. 4).\nUniform cover definition.\nA uniform space formula_95 is a set formula_42 equipped with a distinguished family of coverings formula_97 called \"uniform covers\", drawn from the set of coverings of formula_91 that form a when ordered by star refinement. One says that a cover formula_99 is a \"star refinement\" of cover formula_100 written formula_101 if for every formula_102 there is a formula_103 such that if formula_104 then formula_105 Axiomatically, the condition of being a filter reduces to:\nGiven a point formula_38 and a uniform cover formula_119 one can consider the union of the members of formula_99 that contain formula_38 as a typical neighbourhood of formula_38 of \"size\" formula_119 and this intuitive measure applies uniformly over the space.\nGiven a uniform space in the entourage sense, define a cover formula_99 to be uniform if there is some entourage formula_19 such that for each formula_126 there is an formula_127 such that formula_128 These uniform covers form a uniform space as in the second definition. Conversely, given a uniform space in the uniform cover sense, the supersets of formula_129 as formula_99 ranges over the uniform covers, are the entourages for a uniform space as in the first definition. Moreover, these two transformations are inverses of each other. \nTopology of uniform spaces.\nEvery uniform space formula_42 becomes a topological space by defining a nonempty subset formula_132 to be open if and only if for every formula_133 there exists an entourage formula_17 such that formula_135 is a subset of formula_136 In this topology, the neighbourhood filter of a point formula_38 is formula_138 This can be proved with a recursive use of the existence of a \"half-size\" entourage. Compared to a general topological space the existence of the uniform structure makes possible the comparison of sizes of neighbourhoods: formula_135 and formula_140 are considered to be of the \"same size\".\nThe topology defined by a uniform structure is said to be &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;induced by the uniformity. A uniform structure on a topological space is \"compatible\" with the topology if the topology defined by the uniform structure coincides with the original topology. In general several different uniform structures can be compatible with a given topology on formula_72\nUniformizable spaces.\nA topological space is called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;uniformizable if there is a uniform structure compatible with the topology.\nEvery uniformizable space is a completely regular topological space. Moreover, for a uniformizable space formula_42 the following are equivalent: \nSome authors (e.g. Engelking) add this last condition directly in the definition of a uniformizable space.\nThe topology of a uniformizable space is always a symmetric topology; that is, the space is an R0-space.\nConversely, each completely regular space is uniformizable. A uniformity compatible with the topology of a completely regular space formula_42 can be defined as the coarsest uniformity that makes all continuous real-valued functions on formula_42 uniformly continuous. A fundamental system of entourages for this uniformity is provided by all finite intersections of sets formula_149 where formula_150 is a continuous real-valued function on formula_42 and formula_17 is an entourage of the uniform space formula_153 This uniformity defines a topology, which is clearly coarser than the original topology of formula_154 that it is also finer than the original topology (hence coincides with it) is a simple consequence of complete regularity: for any formula_155 and a neighbourhood formula_42 of formula_157 there is a continuous real-valued function formula_150 with formula_159 and equal to 1 in the complement of formula_160\nIn particular, a compact Hausdorff space is uniformizable. In fact, for a compact Hausdorff space formula_42 the set of all neighbourhoods of the diagonal in formula_2 form the \"unique\" uniformity compatible with the topology.\nA Hausdorff uniform space is metrizable if its uniformity can be defined by a \"countable\" family of pseudometrics. Indeed, as discussed above, such a uniformity can be defined by a \"single\" pseudometric, which is necessarily a metric if the space is Hausdorff. In particular, if the topology of a vector space is Hausdorff and definable by a countable family of seminorms, it is metrizable.\nUniform continuity.\nSimilar to continuous functions between topological spaces, which preserve topological properties, are the uniformly continuous functions between uniform spaces, which preserve uniform properties. \nA uniformly continuous function is defined as one where inverse images of entourages are again entourages, or equivalently, one where the inverse images of uniform covers are again uniform covers. Explicitly, a function formula_163 between uniform spaces is called if for every entourage formula_17 in formula_165 there exists an entourage formula_19 in formula_42 such that if formula_168 then formula_169 or in other words, whenever formula_17 is an entourage in formula_165 then formula_172 is an entourage in formula_42, where formula_174 is defined by formula_175\nAll uniformly continuous functions are continuous with respect to the induced topologies. \nUniform spaces with uniform maps form a category. An isomorphism between uniform spaces is called a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;uniform isomorphism; explicitly, it is a uniformly continuous bijection whose inverse is also uniformly continuous. \nA is an injective uniformly continuous map formula_176 between uniform spaces whose inverse formula_177 is also uniformly continuous, where the image formula_178 has the subspace uniformity inherited from formula_179\nCompleteness.\nGeneralizing the notion of complete metric space, one can also define completeness for uniform spaces. Instead of working with Cauchy sequences, one works with Cauchy filters (or Cauchy nets).\nA (respectively, a ) on a uniform space formula_42 is a filter (respectively, a prefilter) formula_181 such that for every entourage formula_182 there exists formula_183 with formula_184 In other words, a filter is Cauchy if it contains \"arbitrarily small\" sets. It follows from the definitions that each filter that converges (with respect to the topology defined by the uniform structure) is a Cauchy filter.\nA is a Cauchy filter that does not contain any smaller (that is, coarser) Cauchy filter (other than itself). It can be shown that every Cauchy filter contains a unique minimal Cauchy filter. The neighbourhood filter of each point (the filter consisting of all neighbourhoods of the point) is a minimal Cauchy filter.\nConversely, a uniform space is called if every Cauchy filter converges. Any compact Hausdorff space is a complete uniform space with respect to the unique uniformity compatible with the topology.\nComplete uniform spaces enjoy the following important property: if formula_185 is a \"uniformly continuous\" function from a \"dense\" subset formula_41 of a uniform space formula_42 into a \"complete\" uniform space formula_188 then formula_150 can be extended (uniquely) into a uniformly continuous function on all of formula_72\nA topological space that can be made into a complete uniform space, whose uniformity induces the original topology, is called a completely uniformizable space.\nA &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;completion of a uniform space formula_42 is a pair formula_192 consisting of a complete uniform space formula_193 and a uniform embedding formula_194 whose image formula_178 is a dense subset of formula_196 \nHausdorff completion of a uniform space.\nAs with metric spaces, every uniform space formula_42 has a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Hausdorff completion: that is, there exists a complete Hausdorff uniform space formula_165 and a uniformly continuous map formula_176 (if formula_42 is a Hausdorff uniform space then formula_201 is a topological embedding) with the following property:\n for any uniformly continuous mapping formula_150 of formula_42 into a complete Hausdorff uniform space formula_204 there is a unique uniformly continuous map formula_205 such that formula_206\nThe Hausdorff completion formula_165 is unique up to isomorphism. As a set, formula_165 can be taken to consist of the minimal Cauchy filters on formula_72 As the neighbourhood filter formula_210 of each point formula_38 in formula_42 is a minimal Cauchy filter, the map formula_201 can be defined by mapping formula_38 to formula_215 The map formula_201 thus defined is in general not injective; in fact, the graph of the equivalence relation formula_217 is the intersection of all entourages of formula_91 and thus formula_201 is injective precisely when formula_42 is Hausdorff.\nThe uniform structure on formula_165 is defined as follows: for each &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;\"symmetric\" entourage formula_17 (that is, such that formula_223 implies formula_224), let formula_225 be the set of all pairs formula_226 of minimal Cauchy filters \"which have in common at least one formula_17-small set\". The sets formula_225 can be shown to form a fundamental system of entourages; formula_165 is equipped with the uniform structure thus defined.\nThe set formula_178 is then a dense subset of formula_179 If formula_42 is Hausdorff, then formula_201 is an isomorphism onto formula_234 and thus formula_42 can be identified with a dense subset of its completion. Moreover, formula_178 is always Hausdorff; it is called the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Hausdorff uniform space associated with formula_72 If formula_238 denotes the equivalence relation formula_239 then the quotient space formula_240 is homeomorphic to formula_241\nHistory.\nBefore Andr\u00e9 Weil gave the first explicit definition of a uniform structure in 1937, uniform concepts, like completeness, were discussed using metric spaces. Nicolas Bourbaki provided the definition of uniform structure in terms of entourages in the book \"Topologie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\" and John Tukey gave the uniform cover definition. Weil also characterized uniform spaces in terms of a family of pseudometrics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, or formula_5.\nAn advantage of variance as a measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation; for example, the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances. A disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that, unlike the standard deviation, its units differ from the random variable, which is why the standard deviation is more commonly reported as a measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished. Another disadvantage is that the variance is not finite for many distributions.\nThere are two distinct concepts that are both called \"variance\". One, as discussed above, is part of a theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation. The other variance is a characteristic of a set of observations. When variance is calculated from observations, those observations are typically measured from a real-world system. If all possible observations of the system are present, then the calculated variance is called the population variance. Normally, however, only a subset is available, and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance. The variance calculated from a sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance. There are multiple ways to estimate the population variance on the basis of the sample variance, as discussed in the section below.\nThe two kinds of variance are closely related. To see how, consider that a theoretical probability distribution can be used as a generator of hypothetical observations. If an infinite number of observations are generated using a distribution, then the sample variance calculated from that infinite set will match the value calculated using the distribution's equation for variance. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition.\nThe variance of a random variable formula_6 is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of formula_6, formula_8:\nformula_9\nThis definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete, continuous, neither, or mixed. The variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself:\nformula_10 \nThe variance is also equivalent to the second cumulant of a probability distribution that generates formula_6. The variance is typically designated as formula_3, or sometimes as formula_4 or formula_5, or symbolically as formula_15 or simply formula_1 (pronounced \"sigma squared\"). The expression for the variance can be expanded as follows:\nformula_17\nIn other words, the variance of X is equal to the mean of the square of X minus the square of the mean of X. This equation should not be used for computations using floating-point arithmetic, because it suffers from catastrophic cancellation if the two components of the equation are similar in magnitude. For other numerically stable alternatives, see algorithms for calculating variance.\nDiscrete random variable.\nIf the generator of random variable formula_6 is discrete with probability mass function formula_19, then\nformula_20\nwhere formula_21 is the expected value. That is,\nformula_22\nThe variance of a collection of formula_23 equally likely values can be written as\nformula_24\nwhere formula_21 is the average value. That is,\nformula_26\nThe variance of a set of formula_23 equally likely values can be equivalently expressed, without directly referring to the mean, in terms of squared deviations of all pairwise squared distances of points from each other:\nformula_28\nAbsolutely continuous random variable.\nIf the random variable formula_6 has a probability density function formula_30, and formula_31 is the corresponding cumulative distribution function, then\nformula_32\nor equivalently,\nformula_33\nwhere formula_21 is the expected value of formula_6 given by\nformula_36\nIn these formulas, the integrals with respect to formula_37 and formula_38\nare Lebesgue and Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integrals, respectively.\nIf the function formula_39 is Riemann-integrable on every finite interval formula_40 then\nformula_41\nwhere the integral is an improper Riemann integral.\nExamples.\nExponential distribution.\nThe exponential distribution with parameter \u03bb &gt; 0 is a continuous distribution whose probability density function is given by\nformula_42\non the interval [0, \u221e). Its mean can be shown to be\nformula_43\nUsing integration by parts and making use of the expected value already calculated, we have:\nformula_44\nThus, the variance of X is given by\nformula_45\nFair die.\nA fair six-sided die can be modeled as a discrete random variable, X, with outcomes 1 through 6, each with equal probability 1/6. The expected value of X is formula_46 Therefore, the variance of X is\nformula_47\nThe general formula for the variance of the outcome, X, of an die is\nformula_48\nCommonly used probability distributions.\nThe following table lists the variance for some commonly used probability distributions.\nProperties.\nBasic properties.\nVariance is non-negative because the squares are positive or zero:\nformula_49\nThe variance of a constant is zero.\nformula_50\nConversely, if the variance of a random variable is 0, then it is almost surely a constant. That is, it always has the same value:\nformula_51\nIssues of finiteness.\nIf a distribution does not have a finite expected value, as is the case for the Cauchy distribution, then the variance cannot be finite either. However, some distributions may not have a finite variance, despite their expected value being finite. An example is a Pareto distribution whose index formula_52 satisfies formula_53\nDecomposition.\nThe general formula for variance decomposition or the law of total variance is: If formula_6 and formula_55 are two random variables, and the variance of formula_6 exists, then\nformula_57\nThe conditional expectation formula_58 of formula_6 given formula_55, and the conditional variance formula_61 may be understood as follows. Given any particular value \"y\" of\u00a0the random variable\u00a0\"Y\", there is a conditional expectation formula_62 given the event\u00a0\"Y\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"y\". This quantity depends on the particular value\u00a0\"y\"; it is a function formula_63. That same function evaluated at the random variable \"Y\" is the conditional expectation formula_64\nIn particular, if formula_55 is a discrete random variable assuming possible values formula_66 with corresponding probabilities formula_67, then in the formula for total variance, the first term on the right-hand side becomes\nformula_68\nwhere formula_69. Similarly, the second term on the right-hand side becomes\nformula_70\nwhere formula_71 and formula_72. Thus the total variance is given by\nformula_73\nA similar formula is applied in analysis of variance, where the corresponding formula is\nformula_74\nhere formula_75 refers to the Mean of the Squares. In linear regression analysis the corresponding formula is\nformula_76\nThis can also be derived from the additivity of variances, since the total (observed) score is the sum of the predicted score and the error score, where the latter two are uncorrelated.\nSimilar decompositions are possible for the sum of squared deviations (sum of squares, formula_77):\nformula_78\nformula_79\nCalculation from the CDF.\nThe population variance for a non-negative random variable can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function \"F\" using\nformula_80\nThis expression can be used to calculate the variance in situations where the CDF, but not the density, can be conveniently expressed.\nCharacteristic property.\nThe second moment of a random variable attains the minimum value when taken around the first moment (i.e., mean) of the random variable, i.e. formula_81. Conversely, if a continuous function formula_82 satisfies formula_83 for all random variables \"X\", then it is necessarily of the form formula_84, where \"a\" &gt; 0. This also holds in the multidimensional case.\nUnits of measurement.\nUnlike the expected absolute deviation, the variance of a variable has units that are the square of the units of the variable itself. For example, a variable measured in meters will have a variance measured in meters squared. For this reason, describing data sets via their standard deviation or root mean square deviation is often preferred over using the variance. In the dice example the standard deviation is , slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of\u00a01.5.\nThe standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the \"spread\" of a distribution. The standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization covariance, is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly heavy-tailed distribution.\nPropagation.\nAddition and multiplication by a constant.\nVariance is invariant with respect to changes in a location parameter. That is, if a constant is added to all values of the variable, the variance is unchanged:\nformula_85\nIf all values are scaled by a constant, the variance is scaled by the square of that constant:\nformula_86\nThe variance of a sum of two random variables is given by\nformula_87\nwhere formula_88 is the covariance.\nLinear combinations.\nIn general, for the sum of formula_89 random variables formula_90, the variance becomes:\nformula_91 \nsee also general Bienaym\u00e9's identity.\nThese results lead to the variance of a linear combination as:\nformula_92\nIf the random variables formula_93 are such that\nformula_94\nthen they are said to be uncorrelated. It follows immediately from the expression given earlier that if the random variables formula_93 are uncorrelated, then the variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their variances, or, expressed symbolically:\nformula_96\nSince independent random variables are always uncorrelated (see ), the equation above holds in particular when the random variables formula_97 are independent. Thus, independence is sufficient but not necessary for the variance of the sum to equal the sum of the variances.\nMatrix notation for the variance of a linear combination.\nDefine formula_6 as a column vector of formula_23 random variables formula_100, and formula_101 as a column vector of formula_23 scalars formula_103. Therefore, formula_104 is a linear combination of these random variables, where formula_105 denotes the transpose of formula_101. Also let formula_107 be the covariance matrix of formula_6. The variance of formula_109 is then given by:\nformula_110\nThis implies that the variance of the mean can be written as (with a column vector of ones)\nformula_111\nSum of variables.\nSum of uncorrelated variables.\nOne reason for the use of the variance in preference to other measures of dispersion is that the variance of the sum (or the difference) of uncorrelated random variables is the sum of their variances:\nformula_112\nThis statement is called the Bienaym\u00e9 formula and was discovered in 1853. It is often made with the stronger condition that the variables are independent, but being uncorrelated suffices. So if all the variables have the same variance \u03c32, then, since division by \"n\" is a linear transformation, this formula immediately implies that the variance of their mean is\nformula_113\nThat is, the variance of the mean decreases when \"n\" increases. This formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the standard error of the sample mean, which is used in the central limit theorem.\nTo prove the initial statement, it suffices to show that\nformula_114\nThe general result then follows by induction. Starting with the definition,\nformula_115\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator and the assumption of independence (or uncorrelatedness) of \"X\" and \"Y\", this further simplifies as follows:\nformula_116\nSum of correlated variables.\nSum of correlated variables with fixed sample size.\nIn general, the variance of the sum of n variables is the sum of their covariances:\nformula_117\nHere, formula_118 is the covariance, which is zero for independent random variables (if it exists). The formula states that the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components. The next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements (or its lower triangular elements); this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric. This formula is used in the theory of Cronbach's alpha in classical test theory.\nSo, if the variables have equal variance \"\u03c3\"2 and the average correlation of distinct variables is \"\u03c1\", then the variance of their mean is\nformula_119\nThis implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations. In other words, additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the uncertainty of the mean. Moreover, if the variables have unit variance, for example if they are standardized, then this simplifies to\nformula_120\nThis formula is used in the Spearman\u2013Brown prediction formula of classical test theory. This converges to \"\u03c1\" if \"n\" goes to infinity, provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too. So for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have\nformula_121\nTherefore, the variance of the mean of a large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.\nSum of uncorrelated variables with random sample size.\nThere are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion. In such cases, the sample size N is a random variable whose variation adds to the variation of X, such that,\nformula_122\nwhich follows from the law of total variance.\nIf N has a Poisson distribution, then formula_123 with estimator n = N. So, the estimator of formula_124 becomes formula_125, giving formula_126\n(see standard error of the sample mean).\nWeighted sum of variables.\nThe scaling property and the Bienaym\u00e9 formula, along with the property of the covariance Cov(\"aX\",\u00a0\"bY\") \n \"ab\" Cov(\"X\",\u00a0\"Y\") jointly imply that\nformula_127\nThis implies that in a weighted sum of variables, the variable with the largest weight will have a disproportionally large weight in the variance of the total. For example, if \"X\" and \"Y\" are uncorrelated and the weight of \"X\" is two times the weight of \"Y\", then the weight of the variance of \"X\" will be four times the weight of the variance of \"Y\".\nThe expression above can be extended to a weighted sum of multiple variables:\nformula_128\nProduct of variables.\nProduct of independent variables.\nIf two variables X and Y are independent, the variance of their product is given by\nformula_129\nEquivalently, using the basic properties of expectation, it is given by\nformula_130\nProduct of statistically dependent variables.\nIn general, if two variables are statistically dependent, then the variance of their product is given by:\nformula_131\nArbitrary functions.\nThe delta method uses second-order Taylor expansions to approximate the variance of a function of one or more random variables: see Taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables. For example, the approximate variance of a function of one variable is given by\nformula_132\nprovided that \"f\" is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of \"X\" are finite.\nPopulation variance and sample variance.\nReal-world observations such as the measurements of yesterday's rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made. As such, the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations. This means that one estimates the mean and variance from a limited set of observations by using an estimator equation. The estimator is a function of the sample of \"n\" observations drawn without observational bias from the whole population of potential observations. In this example, the sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday's rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest.\nThe simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample, the sample mean and (uncorrected) sample variance \u2013 these are consistent estimators (they converge to the value of the whole population as the number of samples increases) but can be improved. Most simply, the sample variance is computed as the sum of squared deviations about the (sample) mean, divided by \"n\" as the number of samples\".\" However, using values other than \"n\" improves the estimator in various ways. Four common values for the denominator are \"n,\" \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01, and \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.5: \"n\" is the simplest (the variance of the sample), \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 eliminates bias, \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 minimizes mean squared error for the normal distribution, and \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.5 mostly eliminates bias in unbiased estimation of standard deviation for the normal distribution.\nFirstly, if the true population mean is unknown, then the sample variance (which uses the sample mean in place of the true mean) is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance by a factor of (\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) / \"n\"; correcting this factor, resulting in the sum of squared deviations about the sample mean divided by \"n\" -1 instead of \"n\", is called \"Bessel's correction\". The resulting estimator is unbiased and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance, then this bias does not arise, and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.\nSecondly, the sample variance does not generally minimize mean squared error between sample variance and population variance. Correcting for bias often makes this worse: one can always choose a scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance, though the optimal scale factor depends on the excess kurtosis of the population (see mean squared error: variance) and introduces bias. This always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator (dividing by a number larger than \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) and is a simple example of a shrinkage estimator: one \"shrinks\" the unbiased estimator towards zero. For the normal distribution, dividing by \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 (instead of \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 or \"n\") minimizes mean squared error. The resulting estimator is biased, however, and is known as the biased sample variation.\nPopulation variance.\nIn general, the population variance of a \"finite\" population of size N with values \"x\"\"i\" is given by\nformula_133\nwhere the population mean is formula_134 and formula_135, where formula_136 is the expectation value operator.\nThe population variance can also be computed using\nformula_137\n(The right side has duplicate terms in the sum while the middle side has only unique terms to sum.) This is true because\nformula_138\nThe population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution. In this sense, the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations.\nSample variance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Biased sample variance.\nIn many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known \"a priori\" and must be computed somehow. When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population, so the computation must be performed on a sample of the population. This is generally referred to as sample variance or empirical variance. Sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of a continuous distribution from a sample of that distribution.\nWe take a sample with replacement of n values \"Y\"1, ..., \"Y\"\"n\" from the population of size N, where \"n\" &lt; \"N\", and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample. Directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the squared deviations:\nformula_139\n(See the section Population variance for the derivation of this formula.) Here, formula_140 denotes the sample mean: \nformula_141\nSince the \"Y\"\"i\" are selected randomly, both formula_140 and formula_143 are random variables. Their expected values can be evaluated by averaging over the ensemble of all possible samples {\"Y\"\"i\"} of size n from the population. For formula_143 this gives:\nformula_145\nHere formula_146 derived in the section is population variance and formula_147 due to independency of formula_148 and formula_149.\nHence formula_150 gives an estimate of the population variance formula_151 that is biased by a factor of formula_152 because the expectation value of formula_150 is smaller than the population variance (true variance) by that factor. For this reason, formula_150 is referred to as the \"biased sample variance\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Unbiased sample variance.\nCorrecting for this bias yields the \"unbiased sample variance\", denoted formula_155:\nformula_156\nEither estimator may be simply referred to as the \"sample variance\" when the version can be determined by context. The same proof is also applicable for samples taken from a continuous probability distribution.\nThe use of the term \"n\" \u2212 1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample covariance and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term \"n\" \u2212 1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.\nThe unbiased sample variance is a U-statistic for the function \"f\"(\"y\"1, \"y\"2) = (\"y\"1 \u2212 \"y\"2)2/2, meaning that it is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.\nExample.\nFor a set of numbers {10, 15, 30, 45, 57, 52, 63, 72, 81, 93, 102, 105}, if this set is the whole data population for some measurement, then variance is the population variance 932.743 as the sum of the squared deviations about the mean of this set, divided by 12 as the number of the set members. If the set is a sample from the whole population, then the unbiased sample variance can be calculated as 1017.538 that is the sum of the squared deviations about the mean of the sample, divided by 11 instead of 12. A function VAR.S in Microsoft Excel gives the unbiased sample variance while VAR.P is for population variance.\nDistribution of the sample variance.\nBeing a function of random variables, the sample variance is itself a random variable, and it is natural to study its distribution. In the case that \"Y\"\"i\" are independent observations from a normal distribution, Cochran's theorem shows that the unbiased sample variance \"S\"2 follows a scaled chi-squared distribution (see also: asymptotic properties and an elementary proof):\nformula_157\nwhere \"\u03c3\"2 is the population variance. As a direct consequence, it follows that \nformula_158\nand\nformula_159 where formula_160 and formula_161 is the transpose of X, and so is a row vector. The result is a positive semi-definite square matrix, commonly referred to as the variance-covariance matrix (or simply as the \"covariance matrix\").\nIf formula_6 is a vector- and complex-valued random variable, with values in formula_163 then the covariance matrix is formula_164 where formula_165 is the conjugate transpose of formula_166 This matrix is also positive semi-definite and square.\nAs a scalar.\nAnother generalization of variance for vector-valued random variables formula_6, which results in a scalar value rather than in a matrix, is the generalized variance formula_168, the determinant of the covariance matrix. The generalized variance can be shown to be related to the multidimensional scatter of points around their mean.\nA different generalization is obtained by considering the equation for the scalar variance, formula_169, and reinterpreting formula_170 as the squared Euclidean distance between the random variable and its mean, or, simply as the scalar product of the vector formula_171 with itself. This results in formula_172 which is the trace of the covariance matrix.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Vacuoles are essentially enclosed compartments which are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes in solution, though in certain cases they may contain solids which have been engulfed. Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and are effectively just larger forms of these. The organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the requirements of the cell.\nDiscovery.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek described the plant vacuole in 1676. Contractile vacuoles (\"stars\") were first observed by Spallanzani (1776) in protozoa, although mistaken for respiratory organs. Dujardin (1841) named these \"stars\" as \"vacuoles\". In 1842, Schleiden applied the term for plant cells, to distinguish the structure with cell sap from the rest of the protoplasm. In 1885, de Vries named the vacuole membrane as tonoplast.\nChristian de Duve, discovered mammalian lysosomes using biochemical methods in the mid 1970\u2019s. de Duve named lysosomes based on their biochemical properties (from the Greek \"lysis\" \u2013 digestive and \"soma\" \u2013 body). Their physical form was confirmed shortly later by electron microscopy. Because the lysosome shares many properties with vacuoles across taxonomical kingdoms, the notion that vacuoles and lysosomes are distinctly different organelles is more historical than functional.\nFunction.\nThe function and significance of vacuoles varies greatly according to the type of cell in which they are present, having much greater prominence in the cells of plants, fungi and certain protists than those of animals and bacteria. In general, the functions of the vacuole include:\nVacuoles also play a major role in autophagy, maintaining a balance between biogenesis (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and cell structures in certain organisms. They also aid in the lysis and recycling of misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell. Thomas Boller and others proposed that the vacuole participates in the destruction of invading bacteria and Robert B. Mellor proposed organ-specific forms have a role in 'housing' symbiotic bacteria. In protists, vacuoles have the additional function of storing food which has been absorbed by the organism and assisting in the digestive and waste management process for the cell.\nIn animal cells, vacuoles perform mostly subordinate roles, assisting in larger processes of exocytosis and endocytosis.\nAnimal vacuoles are smaller than their plant counterparts but also usually greater in number. There are also animal cells that do not have any vacuoles.\nExocytosis is the extrusion process of proteins and lipids from the cell. These materials are absorbed into secretory granules within the Golgi apparatus before being transported to the cell membrane and secreted into the extracellular environment. In this capacity, vacuoles are simply storage vesicles which allow for the containment, transport and disposal of selected proteins and lipids to the extracellular environment of the cell.\nEndocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis and can occur in a variety of forms. Phagocytosis (\"cell eating\") is the process by which bacteria, dead tissue, or other bits of material visible under the microscope are engulfed by cells. The material makes contact with the cell membrane, which then invaginates. The invagination is pinched off, leaving the engulfed material in the membrane-enclosed vacuole and the cell membrane intact. Pinocytosis (\"cell drinking\") is essentially the same process, the difference being that the substances ingested are in solution and not visible under the microscope. Phagocytosis and pinocytosis are both undertaken in association with lysosomes which complete the breakdown of the material which has been engulfed.\n\"Salmonella\" is able to survive and reproduce in the vacuoles of several mammal species after being engulfed.\nThe vacuole probably evolved several times independently, even within the Viridiplantae.\nTypes.\nCentral.\nMost mature plant cells have one large vacuole that typically occupies more than 30% of the cell's volume, and that can occupy as much as 80% of the volume for certain cell types and conditions. Strands of cytoplasm often run through the vacuole.\nA vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast (word origin: Gk t\u00f3n(os) + -o-, meaning \u201cstretching\u201d, \u201ctension\u201d, \u201ctone\u201d + comb. form repr. Gk plast\u00f3s formed, molded) and filled with cell sap. Also called the vacuolar membrane, the tonoplast is the cytoplasmic membrane surrounding a vacuole, separating the vacuolar contents from the cell's cytoplasm. As a membrane, it is mainly involved in regulating the movements of ions around the cell, and isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell.\nTransport of protons from the cytosol to the vacuole stabilizes cytoplasmic pH, while making the vacuolar interior more acidic creating a proton motive force which the cell can use to transport nutrients into or out of the vacuole. The low pH of the vacuole also allows degradative enzymes to act. Although single large vacuoles are most common, the size and number of vacuoles may vary in different tissues and stages of development. For example, developing cells in the meristems contain small provacuoles and cells of the vascular cambium have many small vacuoles in the winter and one large one in the summer.\nAside from storage, the main role of the central vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the tonoplast (aquaporins) control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole through active transport, pumping potassium (K+) ions into and out of the vacuolar interior. Due to osmosis, water will diffuse into the vacuole, placing pressure on the cell wall. If water loss leads to a significant decline in turgor pressure, the cell will plasmolyze. Turgor pressure exerted by vacuoles is also required for cellular elongation: as the cell wall is partially degraded by the action of expansins, the less rigid wall is expanded by the pressure coming from within the vacuole. Turgor pressure exerted by the vacuole is also essential in supporting plants in an upright position. Another function of a central vacuole is that it pushes all contents of the cell's cytoplasm against the cellular membrane, and thus keeps the chloroplasts closer to light. Most plants store chemicals in the vacuole that react with chemicals in the cytosol. If the cell is broken, for example by a herbivore, then the two chemicals can react forming toxic chemicals. In garlic, alliin and the enzyme alliinase are normally separated but form allicin if the vacuole is broken. A similar reaction is responsible for the production of syn-propanethial-S-oxide when onions are cut.\nVacuoles in fungal cells perform similar functions to those in plants and there can be more than one vacuole per cell. In yeast cells the vacuole (Vac7) is a dynamic structure that can rapidly modify its morphology. They are involved in many processes including the homeostasis of cell pH and the concentration of ions, osmoregulation, storing amino acids and polyphosphate and degradative processes. Toxic ions, such as strontium (Sr2+), cobalt(II) (Co2+), and lead(II) (Pb2+) are transported into the vacuole to isolate them from the rest of the cell.\nContractile.\nA contractile vacuole is a specialized osmoregulatory organelle that is present in many free-living protists. The contractile vacuole is part of the contractile vacuole complex which includes radial arms and a spongiome. The contractile vacuole complex works periodically contracts to remove excess water and ions from the cell to balance water flow into the cell. When the contractile vacuole is slowly taking water in, the contractile vacuole enlarges, this is called diastole and when it reaches its threshold, the central vacuole contracts then contracts (systole) periodically to release water.\nDigestive.\nFood vacuoles (also called digestive vacuole) are organelles found in certain protists, such as ciliates, amoeboids and \"Plasmodium falciparum\", a protozoan parasite that causes malaria.\nIn \"Paramecium\", the food vacuoles can show variation in size and shape based on their contents, solute balance and timing of ingestion in the cellular pharynx. The vacuoles of \"Ophrydium versatile\" undergo discoidal vesicle membrane recycling to the cytostome, condensing in the process, then associate with rough endoplasmic reticulum, receive protein coating on their cytosolic or exterior face from fusion with cup-shaped coated vesicles and condense again while producing cup-shaped coated vesicles, possibly for the purpose of enzyme recycling, prior to cytoproct egestion of residues mediated by vacuole fusion.\nThe food vacuoles of \"Plasmodium falciparum\" have been found to have calcium storage properties mediated by active transport and associated with vacuole acidification that are important for \"P. falciparum\" asexual reproduction.\nHistopathology.\nIn histopathology, vacuolization is the formation of vacuoles or vacuole-like structures, within or adjacent to cells. It is an unspecific sign of disease.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words. The word itself is an example of verlan (making it an autological word). It is derived from inverting the sounds of the syllables in \"l'envers\" (, \"the inverse\", frequently used in the sense of \"back-to-front\"). The first documented use of verlan dates back to the 19th century, among robbers.\nWord formation.\nWords in verlan are formed by switching the order in which syllables from the original word are pronounced. For example, becomes .\nVerlan generally retains the pronunciation of the original syllables. However, French words that end in a (such as ) and words that end in a pronounced consonant (such as ) gain the sound once reversed. In addition, verlan often drops the final vowel sound after the word is inverted, so and become ( \u2013 in full form) and ( \u2013 in full form), respectively.\nThe study of written verlan is difficult as it is primarily passed down orally, without standardized spelling. While some still argue that the letters should be held over from the original word, in the case of verlan, most experts agree that words should be spelled as to best approximate pronunciation. For example, is preferred to .\nThe French author Auguste Le Breton uses numerous examples of verlan, for instance in .\nDifferent rules apply for one-syllable words, and words with more than two syllables may be verlan-ised in more than one way. For example, may yield or .\nVocabulary.\nSome verlan words, such as , have become so commonplace that they have been included in the . The purpose of verlan is to create a somewhat secret language that only its speakers can understand. Words becoming mainstream is counterproductive. As a result, such newly common words may be reversed a second time &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nSome verlan words, which are now well incorporated in common French language, have taken on their own significance, or at least certain connotations that have changed their meaning. For example, the word , which can still be used to refer to any woman, also refers to the speaker's girlfriend when used in the possessive form ( \u2192 my girl); while the original word would refer to the speaker's wife when used in the same way ( \u2192 my wife). Such words retain a cultural significance from the time at which they appeared in common language. Widespread in the second half of the 20th century, and (from ) refer to people of northern African descent who live in France. The word (a double verlan) is much more recent, and evolved to refer more generally to people of Arab descent who live in France.\nIn theory, any word can be made into a verlan, but only a few expressions are used in everyday speech. Verbs translated into verlan cannot be conjugated easily. There is no such thing as a verlan grammar, so generally verbs are used in the infinitive, past participle or progressive form. For example:\nHere are some examples of French words that have been made into a verlan and their English meanings:\nDouble verlan.\nCreating verlans often brings up words that are verlan of a verlan. This is sometimes called or . One can find the order of the consonants of the original word, but the vowels have been modified.\nFor example, (verlan of ) becomes .

Many verlan words refer either to sex or drugs, related to the original purpose of keeping communication secret from institutions of social control. Verlan is generally limited to one or two key words per sentence. Verlan words and expressions are mixed within a more general language.\nVerlan is used by people to mark their membership in, or exclusion from, a particular group (generally young people in the cities and , although some French upper-class youth have also started using it as their slang); it is a tool for marking and delineating group identity. Speakers rarely create a verlan word on the fly; rather, their ability to use and understand words from an accepted set of known verlan terms allows them to be identified as part of a verlan-speaking group. Lefkowitz claims that the best speakers of the language are often the worst students, those most needing to hide from authority.\nSome verlan words have gained mainstream currency. Examples of verlan in cultural mainstream include the 1984 comedy (\"My New Partner\") ( is verlan for , or rotten, and refers to a corrupt policeman); and the 1977 hit \"Laisse b\u00e9ton\" by singer Renaud ( is verlan for and the phrase means \"drop it\").\nVerlan is popular as a form of expression in French hip-hop.

Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.\nVirtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:\nSome virtual machine emulators, such as QEMU and video game console emulators, are designed to also emulate (or \"virtually imitate\") different system architectures, thus allowing execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. OS-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel. The terms are not universally interchangeable.\nDefinitions.\nSystem virtual machines.\nA 'virtual machine' was originally defined by Popek and Goldberg as \"an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine.\" Current use includes virtual machines that have no direct correspondence to any real hardware. The physical, \"real-world\" hardware running the VM is generally referred to as the 'host', and the virtual machine emulated on that machine is generally referred to as the 'guest'. A host can emulate several guests, each of which can emulate different operating systems and hardware platforms.\nThe desire to run multiple operating systems was the initial motive for virtual machines, so as to allow time-sharing among several single-tasking operating systems. In some respects, a system virtual machine can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory that historically preceded it. IBM's CP/CMS, the first systems to allow full virtualization, implemented time sharing by providing each user with a single-user operating system, the Conversational Monitor System (CMS). Unlike virtual memory, a system virtual machine entitled the user to write privileged instructions in their code. This approach had certain advantages, such as adding input/output devices not allowed by the standard system.\nAs technology evolves virtual memory for purposes of virtualization, new systems of memory overcommitment may be applied to manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machines on one computer operating system. It may be possible to share \"memory pages\" that have identical contents among multiple virtual machines that run on the same physical machine, what may result in mapping them to the same physical page by a technique termed kernel same-page merging (KSM). This is especially useful for read-only pages, such as those holding code segments, which is the case for multiple virtual machines running the same or similar software, software libraries, web servers, middleware components, etc. The guest operating systems do not need to be compliant with the host hardware, thus making it possible to run different operating systems on the same computer (e.g., Windows, Linux, or prior versions of an operating system) to support future software.\nThe use of virtual machines to support separate guest operating systems is popular in regard to embedded systems. A typical use would be to run a real-time operating system simultaneously with a preferred complex operating system, such as Linux or Windows. Another use would be for novel and unproven software still in the developmental stage, so it runs inside a sandbox. Virtual machines have other advantages for operating system development and may include improved debugging access and faster reboots.\nMultiple VMs running their own guest operating system are frequently engaged for server consolidation.\nProcess virtual machines.\nA process virtual machine, sometimes called an \"application virtual machine\", or \"Managed Runtime Environment\" (MRE), runs as a normal application inside a host OS and supports a single process. It is created when that process is started and deleted when it is closed. Its purpose is to provide a platform-independent programming environment that abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or operating system and allows a program to execute in the same way on any platform.\nA process VM provides a high-level abstraction\u00a0\u2013 that of a high-level programming language (compared to the low-level ISA abstraction of the system VM). Process VMs are implemented using an interpreter; performance comparable to compiled programming languages can be achieved by the use of just-in-time compilation.\nThis type of VM has become popular with the Java programming language, which is implemented using the Java virtual machine. Other examples include the Parrot virtual machine and the .NET Framework, which runs on a VM called the Common Language Runtime. All of them can serve as an abstraction layer for any computer language.\nA special case of process VMs are systems that abstract over the communication mechanisms of a (potentially heterogeneous) computer cluster. Such a VM does not consist of a single process, but one process per physical machine in the cluster. They are designed to ease the task of programming concurrent applications by letting the programmer focus on algorithms rather than the communication mechanisms provided by the interconnect and the OS. They do not hide the fact that communication takes place, and as such do not attempt to present the cluster as a single machine.\nUnlike other process VMs, these systems do not provide a specific programming language, but are embedded in an existing language; typically such a system provides bindings for several languages (e.g., C and Fortran). Examples are Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and Message Passing Interface (MPI).\nHistory.\nBoth system virtual machines and process virtual machines date to the 1960s and remain areas of active development.\n\"System virtual machines\" grew out of time-sharing, as notably implemented in the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). Time-sharing allowed multiple users to use a computer concurrently: each program appeared to have full access to the machine, but only one program was executed at the time, with the system switching between programs in time slices, saving and restoring state each time. This evolved into virtual machines, notably via IBM's research systems: the M44/44X, which used partial virtualization, and the CP-40 and SIMMON, which used full virtualization, and were early examples of hypervisors. The first widely available virtual machine architecture was the CP-67/CMS (see History of CP/CMS for details). An important distinction was between using multiple virtual machines on one host system for time-sharing, as in M44/44X and CP-40, and using one virtual machine on a host system for prototyping, as in SIMMON. Emulators, with hardware emulation of earlier systems for compatibility, date back to the IBM System/360 in 1963, while the software emulation (then-called \"simulation\") predates it.\n\"Process virtual machines\" arose originally as abstract platforms for an intermediate language used as the intermediate representation of a program by a compiler; early examples date to around 1964 with the META II compiler-writing system using it for both syntax description and target code generation. A notable 1966 example was the O-code machine, a virtual machine that executes O-code (object code) emitted by the front end of the BCPL compiler. This abstraction allowed the compiler to be easily ported to a new architecture by implementing a new back end that took the existing O-code and compiled it to machine code for the underlying physical machine. The Euler language used a similar design, with the intermediate language named \"P\" (portable). This was popularized around 1970 by Pascal, notably in the Pascal-P system (1973) and Pascal-S compiler (1975), in which it was termed p-code and the resulting machine as a p-code machine. This has been influential, and virtual machines in this sense have been often generally called p-code machines. In addition to being an intermediate language, Pascal p-code was also executed directly by an interpreter implementing the virtual machine, notably in UCSD Pascal (1978); this influenced later interpreters, notably the Java virtual machine (JVM). Another early example was SNOBOL4 (1967), which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language (SIL), an assembly language for a virtual machine, which was then targeted to physical machines by transpiling to their native assembler via a macro assembler. Macros have since fallen out of favor, however, so this approach has been less influential. Process virtual machines were a popular approach to implementing early microcomputer software, including Tiny BASIC and adventure games, from one-off implementations such as Pyramid 2000 to a general-purpose engine like Infocom's z-machine, which Graham Nelson argues is \"possibly the most portable virtual machine ever created\".\nSignificant advances occurred in the implementation of Smalltalk-80,\nparticularly the Deutsch/Schiffmann implementation\nwhich pushed just-in-time (JIT) compilation forward as an implementation approach that uses process virtual machine.\nLater notable Smalltalk VMs were VisualWorks, the Squeak Virtual Machine,\nand Strongtalk.\nA related language that produced a lot of virtual machine innovation was the Self programming language, which pioneered adaptive optimization and generational garbage collection. These techniques proved commercially successful in 1999 in the HotSpot Java virtual machine. Other innovations include a register-based virtual machine, to better match the underlying hardware, rather than a stack-based virtual machine, which is a closer match for the programming language; in 1995, this was pioneered by the Dis virtual machine for the Limbo language.\nVirtualization techniques.\nFull virtualization.\nIn full virtualization, the virtual machine simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified \"guest\" OS (one designed for the same instruction set) to be run in isolation. This approach was pioneered in 1966 with the IBM CP-40 and CP-67, predecessors of the VM family.\nExamples outside the mainframe field include Parallels Workstation, Parallels Desktop for Mac, VirtualBox, Virtual Iron, Oracle VM, Virtual PC, Virtual Server, Hyper-V, VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, VMware Server (discontinued, formerly called GSX Server), VMware ESXi, QEMU, Adeos, Mac-on-Linux, Win4BSD, Win4Lin Pro, and Egenera vBlade technology.\nHardware-assisted virtualization.\nIn hardware-assisted virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation.\nHardware-assisted virtualization was first introduced on the IBM System/370 in 1972, for use with VM/370, the first virtual machine operating system offered by IBM as an official product.\nIn 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD provided additional hardware to support virtualization. Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation) added similar features in their UltraSPARC T-Series processors in 2005. Examples of virtualization platforms adapted to such hardware include KVM, VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, Hyper-V, Windows Virtual PC, Xen, Parallels Desktop for Mac, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, VirtualBox and Parallels Workstation.\nIn 2006, first-generation 32- and 64-bit x86 hardware support was found to rarely offer performance advantages over software virtualization.\nOS-level virtualization.\nIn OS-level virtualization, a physical server is virtualized at the operating system level, enabling multiple isolated and secure virtualized servers to run on a single physical server. The \"guest\" operating system environments share the same running instance of the operating system as the host system. Thus, the same operating system kernel is also used to implement the \"guest\" environments, and applications running in a given \"guest\" environment view it as a stand-alone system. The pioneer implementation was FreeBSD jails; other examples include Docker, Solaris Containers, OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, LXC, AIX Workload Partitions, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers, and iCore Virtual Accounts.\nSnapshots.\nA \"snapshot\" is a state of a virtual machine, and generally its storage devices, at an exact point in time. A snapshot enables the virtual machine's state at the time of the snapshot to be restored later, effectively undoing any changes that occurred afterwards. This capability is useful as a backup technique, for example, prior to performing a risky operation.\nVirtual machines frequently use virtual disks for their storage; in a very simple example, a 10-gigabyte hard disk drive is simulated with a 10-gigabyte flat file. Any requests by the VM for a location on its physical disk are transparently translated into an operation on the corresponding file. Once such a translation layer is present, however, it is possible to intercept the operations and send them to different files, depending on various criteria. Every time a snapshot is taken, a new file is created, and used as an overlay for its predecessors. New data is written to the topmost overlay; reading existing data, however, needs the overlay hierarchy to be scanned, resulting in accessing the most recent version. Thus, the entire stack of snapshots is virtually a single coherent disk; in that sense, creating snapshots works similarly to the incremental backup technique.\nOther components of a virtual machine can also be included in a snapshot, such as the contents of its random-access memory (RAM), BIOS settings, or its configuration settings. \"Save state\" feature in video game console emulators is an example of such snapshots.\nRestoring a snapshot consists of discarding or disregarding all overlay layers that are added after that snapshot, and directing all new changes to a new overlay.\nMigration.\nThe snapshots described above can be moved to another host machine with its own hypervisor; when the VM is temporarily stopped, snapshotted, moved, and then resumed on the new host, this is known as migration. If the older snapshots are kept in sync regularly, this operation can be quite fast, and allow the VM to provide uninterrupted service while its prior physical host is, for example, taken down for physical maintenance.\nFailover.\nSimilar to the migration mechanism described above, failover allows the VM to continue operations if the host fails. Generally it occurs if the migration has stopped working. However, in this case, the VM continues operation from the \"last-known\" coherent state, rather than the \"current\" state, based on whatever materials the backup server was last provided with.\nNested virtualization.\nNested virtualization refers to the ability of running a virtual machine within another, having this general concept extendable to an arbitrary depth. In other words, nested virtualization refers to running one or more hypervisors inside another hypervisor. The nature of a nested guest virtual machine does not need to be homogeneous with its host virtual machine; for example, application virtualization can be deployed within a virtual machine created by using hardware virtualization.\nNested virtualization becomes more necessary as widespread operating systems gain built-in hypervisor functionality, which in a virtualized environment can be used only if the surrounding hypervisor supports nested virtualization; for example, Windows 7 is capable of running Windows XP applications inside a built-in virtual machine. Furthermore, moving already existing virtualized environments into a cloud, following the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach, is much more complicated if the destination IaaS platform does not support nested virtualization.\nThe way nested virtualization can be implemented on a particular computer architecture depends on supported hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities. If a particular architecture does not provide hardware support required for nested virtualization, various software techniques are employed to enable it. Over time, more architectures gain required hardware support; for example, since the Haswell microarchitecture (announced in 2013), Intel started to include VMCS shadowing as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization.\nSecurity.\nVirtual machines are frequently used to isolate applications from one another for security.\nThis architectural design (used by Qubes OS, Whonix, KickSecure, and Dangerzone) can prevent the spread of malware from one compromised system (e.g. an email client opening an infected document) to another system (e.g. a password manager).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Main storage, as seen by a process or task, appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management unit (MMU), automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Software within the operating system may extend these capabilities, utilizing, e.g., disk storage, to provide a virtual address space that can exceed the capacity of real memory and thus reference more memory than is physically present in the computer.\nThe primary benefits of virtual memory include freeing applications from having to manage a shared memory space, ability to share memory used by libraries between processes, increased security due to memory isolation, and being able to conceptually use more memory than might be physically available, using the technique of paging or segmentation.\nProperties.\nVirtual memory makes application programming easier by hiding fragmentation of physical memory; by delegating to the kernel the burden of managing the memory hierarchy (eliminating the need for the program to handle overlays explicitly); and, when each process is run in its own dedicated address space, by obviating the need to relocate program code or to access memory with relative addressing.\nMemory virtualization can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory.\nUsage.\nVirtual memory is an integral part of a modern computer architecture; implementations usually require hardware support, typically in the form of a memory management unit built into the CPU. While not necessary, emulators and virtual machines can employ hardware support to increase performance of their virtual memory implementations.\nMost modern operating systems that support virtual memory also run each process in its own dedicated address space. Each program thus appears to have sole access to the virtual memory. Some older operating systems (such as OS/VS1 and OS/VS2 SVS) and even later ones (such as IBM i) are single address space operating systems that run all processes in a single address space composed of virtualized memory.\nEmbedded systems and other special-purpose computer systems that require very fast and/or very consistent response times may opt not to use virtual memory due to decreased determinism; virtual memory systems trigger unpredictable traps that may produce unwanted and unpredictable delays in response to input, especially if the trap requires that data be read into main memory from secondary memory. The hardware to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses typically requires a significant chip area to implement, and not all chips used in embedded systems include that hardware, which is another reason some of those systems do not use virtual memory.\nHistory.\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, computer memory was very expensive. Larger programs for which the available memory was not large enough to hold all the code and data had to contain logic for managing primary and secondary storage, such as overlaying. Virtual memory was therefore introduced not only to extend primary memory, but to make such an extension as easy as possible for programmers to use.\nThe first true virtual memory system was that implemented at the University of Manchester to create a one-level storage system as part of the Atlas Computer. It used a paging mechanism to map the virtual addresses available to the programmer onto the real memory that consisted of 16,384 words of primary core memory with an additional 98,304 words of secondary drum memory. The addition of virtual memory into the Atlas also eliminated a looming programming problem: planning and scheduling data transfers between main and secondary memory and recompiling programs for each change of size of main memory. The first Atlas was commissioned in 1962 but working prototypes of paging had been developed by 1959.2\nTo allow for multiprogramming and multitasking, some systems in the 1960s divided memory between multiple programs without virtual memory, such as the UNIVAC 1107, PDP-6 and early models of the PDP-10, via base and bounds registers.\nA claim that the concept of virtual memory was first developed by German physicist Fritz-Rudolf G\u00fcntsch at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin in 1956 in his doctoral thesis, \"Logical Design of a Digital Computer with Multiple Asynchronous Rotating Drums and Automatic High Speed Memory Operation\", does not stand up to careful scrutiny. The computer proposed by G\u00fcntsch (but never built) had an address space of 105 words which mapped exactly onto the 105 words of the drums, i.e. the addresses were real addresses and there was no form of indirect mapping, a key feature of virtual memory. What G\u00fcntsch did invent was a form of cache memory, since his high-speed memory was intended to contain a copy of some blocks of code or data taken from the drums. Indeed, he wrote (as quoted in translation): \"The programmer need not respect the existence of the primary memory (he need not even know that it exists), for there is only one sort of addresses [\"sic\"] by which one can program as if there were only one storage.\" This is exactly the situation in computers with cache memory, one of the earliest commercial examples of which was the IBM System/360 Model 85. In the Model 85 all addresses were real addresses referring to the main core store. A semiconductor cache store, invisible to the user, held the contents of parts of the main store in use by the currently executing program. This is exactly analogous to G\u00fcntsch's system, designed as a means to improve performance, rather than to solve the problems involved in multi-programming.\nAs early as 1958, Robert S. Barton, working at Shell Research, suggested that main storage should be allocated automatically rather than have the programmer being concerned with overlays from secondary memory, in effect virtual memory. By 1960 Barton was lead architect on the Burroughs B5000 project. From 1959 to 1961, W. R. Lonergan was manager of the Burroughs Product Planning Group which included Barton, Donald Knuth as consultant, and Paul King. In May 1960, UCLA ran a two-week seminar \"Using and Exploiting Giant Computers\" to which Paul King and two others were sent. Stan Gill gave a presentation on virtual memory in the Atlas I computer. Paul King took the ideas back to Burroughs and it was determined that virtual memory should be designed into the core of the B5000.3. Burroughs Corporation released the B5000 in 1964 as the first commercial computer with virtual memory.\nIBM developed the concept of hypervisors in their CP-40 and CP-67, and in 1972 provided it for the S/370 as Virtual Machine Facility/370. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction as part of 370-XA on the 3081, and VM/XA versions of VM to exploit it.\nBefore virtual memory could be implemented in mainstream operating systems, many problems had to be addressed. Dynamic address translation required expensive and difficult-to-build specialized hardware; initial implementations slowed down access to memory slightly. There were worries that new system-wide algorithms utilizing secondary storage would be less effective than previously used application-specific algorithms. By 1969, the debate over virtual memory for commercial computers was over; an IBM research team led by David Sayre showed that their virtual memory overlay system consistently worked better than the best manually controlled systems.\nOperating systems supporting virtual memory on mainframes of the 1960s include:\nThe introduction of virtual memory provided an ability for software systems with large memory demands to run on computers with less real memory. The savings from this provided a strong incentive to switch to virtual memory for all systems. The additional capability of providing virtual address spaces added another level of security and reliability, thus making virtual memory even more attractive to the marketplace.\nThroughout the 1970s, the IBM System/370 series running their virtual-storage based operating systems provided a means for business users to migrate multiple older systems into fewer, more powerful, mainframes that had improved price/performance. The first minicomputer to introduce virtual memory was the Norwegian NORD-1; during the 1970s, other minicomputers implemented virtual memory, notably VAX models running VMS.\nVirtual memory was introduced to the x86 architecture with the protected mode of the Intel 80286 processor, but its segment swapping technique scaled poorly to larger segment sizes. The Intel 80386 introduced paging support underneath the existing segmentation layer, enabling the page fault exception to chain with other exceptions without double fault. However, loading segment descriptors was an expensive operation, causing operating system designers to rely strictly on paging rather than a combination of paging and segmentation.\nPaged virtual memory.\nNearly all current implementations of virtual memory divide a virtual address space into pages, blocks of contiguous virtual memory addresses. Pages on contemporary systems are usually at least 4 kilobytes in size; systems with large virtual address ranges or amounts of real memory generally use larger page sizes.\nPage tables.\nPage tables are used to translate the virtual addresses seen by the application into physical addresses used by the hardware to process instructions; such hardware that handles this specific translation is often known as the memory management unit. Each entry in the page table holds a flag indicating whether the corresponding page is in real memory or not. If it is in real memory, the page table entry will contain the real memory address at which the page is stored. When a reference is made to a page by the hardware, if the page table entry for the page indicates that it is not currently in real memory, the hardware raises a page fault exception, invoking the paging supervisor component of the operating system.\nSystems can have, e.g., one page table for the whole system, separate page tables for each address space or process, separate page tables for each segment; similarly, systems can have, e.g., no segment table, one segment table for the whole system, separate segment tables for each address space or process, separate segment tables for each \"region\" in a tree of region tables for each address space or process. If there is only one page table, different applications running at the same time use different parts of a single range of virtual addresses. If there are multiple page or segment tables, there are multiple virtual address spaces and concurrent applications with separate page tables redirect to different real addresses.\nSome earlier systems with smaller real memory sizes, such as the SDS 940, used \"page registers\" instead of page tables in memory for address translation.\nPaging supervisor.\nThis part of the operating system creates and manages page tables and lists of free page frames. In order to ensure that there will be enough free page frames to quickly resolve page faults, the system may periodically steal allocated page frames, using a page replacement algorithm, e.g., a least recently used (LRU) algorithm. Stolen page frames that have been modified are written back to auxiliary storage before they are added to the free queue. On some systems the paging supervisor is also responsible for managing translation registers that are not automatically loaded from page tables.\nTypically, a page fault that cannot be resolved results in an abnormal termination of the application. However, some systems allow the application to have exception handlers for such errors. The paging supervisor may handle a page fault exception in several different ways, depending on the details:\nIn most cases, there will be an update to the page table, possibly followed by purging the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and the system restarts the instruction that causes the exception.\nIf the free page frame queue is empty then the paging supervisor must free a page frame using the same page replacement algorithm for page stealing.\nPinned pages.\nOperating systems have memory areas that are \"pinned\" (never swapped to secondary storage). Other terms used are \"locked\", \"fixed\", or \"wired\" pages. For example, interrupt mechanisms rely on an array of pointers to their handlers, such as I/O completion and page fault. If the pages containing these pointers or the code that they invoke were pageable, interrupt-handling would become far more complex and time-consuming, particularly in the case of page fault interruptions. Hence, some part of the page table structures is not pageable.\nSome pages may be pinned for short periods of time, others may be pinned for long periods of time, and still others may need to be permanently pinned. For example:\nIn IBM's operating systems for System/370 and successor systems, the term is \"fixed\", and such pages may be long-term fixed, or may be short-term fixed, or may be unfixed (i.e., pageable). System control structures are often long-term fixed (measured in wall-clock time, i.e., time measured in seconds, rather than time measured in fractions of one second) whereas I/O buffers are usually short-term fixed (usually measured in significantly less than wall-clock time, possibly for tens of milliseconds). Indeed, the OS has a special facility for \"fast fixing\" these short-term fixed data buffers (fixing which is performed without resorting to a time-consuming Supervisor Call instruction).\nMultics used the term \"wired\". OpenVMS and Windows refer to pages temporarily made nonpageable (as for I/O buffers) as \"locked\", and simply \"nonpageable\" for those that are never pageable. The Single UNIX Specification also uses the term \"locked\" in the specification for , as do the man pages on many Unix-like systems.\nVirtual-real operation.\nIn OS/VS1 and similar OSes, some parts of systems memory are managed in \"virtual-real\" mode, called \"V=R\". In this mode every virtual address corresponds to the same real address. This mode is used for interrupt mechanisms, for the paging supervisor and page tables in older systems, and for application programs using non-standard I/O management. For example, IBM's z/OS has 3 modes (virtual-virtual, virtual-real and virtual-fixed).\nThrashing.\nWhen paging and page stealing are used, a problem called \"thrashing\" can occur, in which the computer spends an unsuitably large amount of time transferring pages to and from a backing store, hence slowing down useful work. A task's working set is the minimum set of pages that should be in memory in order for it to make useful progress. Thrashing occurs when there is insufficient memory available to store the working sets of all active programs. Adding real memory is the simplest response, but improving application design, scheduling, and memory usage can help. Another solution is to reduce the number of active tasks on the system. This reduces demand on real memory by swapping out the entire working set of one or more processes.\nA system thrashing is often a result of a sudden spike in page demand from a small number of running programs. Swap-token is a lightweight and dynamic thrashing protection mechanism. The basic idea is to set a token in the system, which is randomly given to a process that has page faults when thrashing happens. The process that has the token is given a privilege to allocate more physical memory pages to build its working set, which is expected to quickly finish its execution and to release the memory pages to other processes. A time stamp is used to handover the token one by one. The first version of swap-token was implemented in Linux 2.6. The second version is called preempt swap-token and is also in Linux 2.6. In this updated swap-token implementation, a priority counter is set for each process to track the number of swap-out pages. The token is always given to the process with a high priority, which has a high number of swap-out pages. The length of the time stamp is not a constant but is determined by the priority: the higher the number of swap-out pages of a process, the longer the time stamp for it will be.\nSegmented virtual memory.\nSome systems, such as the Burroughs B5500, and the current Unisys MCP systems use segmentation instead of paging, dividing virtual address spaces into variable-length segments. Using segmentation matches the allocated memory blocks to the logical needs and requests of the programs, rather than the physical view of a computer, although pages themselves are an artificial division in memory. The designers of the B5000 would have found the artificial size of pages to be Procrustean in nature, a story they would later use for the exact data sizes in the B1700.\nIn the Burroughs and Unisys systems, each memory segment is described by a master descriptor which is a single absolute descriptor which may be referenced by other relative (copy) descriptors, effecting sharing either within a process or between processes. Descriptors are central to the working of virtual memory in MCP systems. Descriptors contain not only the address of a segment, but the segment length and status in virtual memory indicated by the 'p-bit' or 'presence bit' which indicates if the address is to a segment in main memory or to a secondary-storage block. When a non-resident segment (p-bit is off) is accessed, an interrupt occurs to load the segment from secondary storage at the given address, or if the address itself is 0 then allocate a new block. In the latter case, the length field in the descriptor is used to allocate a segment of that length.\nA further problem to thrashing in using a segmented scheme is checkerboarding, where all free segments become too small to satisfy requests for new segments. The solution is to perform memory compaction to pack all used segments together and create a large free block from which further segments may be allocated. Since there is a single master descriptor for each segment the new block address only needs to be updated in a single descriptor, since all copies refer to the master descriptor.\nPaging is not free from fragmentation \u2013 the fragmentation is internal to pages (internal fragmentation). If a requested block is smaller than a page, then some space in the page will be wasted. If a block requires larger than a page, a small area in another page is required resulting in large wasted space. The fragmentation thus becomes a problem passed to programmers who may well distort their program to match certain page sizes. With segmentation, the fragmentation is external to segments (external fragmentation) and thus a system problem, which was the aim of virtual memory in the first place, to relieve programmers of such memory considerations. In multi-processing systems, optimal operation of the system depends on the mix of independent processes at any time. Hybrid schemes of segmentation and paging may be used.\nThe Intel 80286 supports a similar segmentation scheme as an option, but it is rarely used.\nSegmentation and paging can be used together by dividing each segment into pages; systems with this memory structure, such as Multics and IBM System/38, are usually paging-predominant, segmentation providing memory protection.\nIn the Intel 80386 and later IA-32 processors, the segments reside in a 32-bit linear, paged address space. Segments can be moved in and out of that space; pages there can \"page\" in and out of main memory, providing two levels of virtual memory; few if any operating systems do so, instead using only paging. Early non-hardware-assisted x86 virtualization solutions combined paging and segmentation because x86 paging offers only two protection domains whereas a VMM, guest OS or guest application stack needs three. The difference between paging and segmentation systems is not only about memory division; segmentation is visible to user processes, as part of memory model semantics. Hence, instead of memory that looks like a single large space, it is structured into multiple spaces.\nThis difference has important consequences; a segment is not a page with variable length or a simple way to lengthen the address space. Segmentation that can provide a single-level memory model in which there is no differentiation between process memory and file system consists of only a list of segments (files) mapped into the process's potential address space.\nThis is not the same as the mechanisms provided by calls such as mmap and Win32's MapViewOfFile, because inter-file pointers do not work when mapping files into semi-arbitrary places. In Multics, a file (or a segment from a multi-segment file) is mapped into a segment in the address space, so files are always mapped at a segment boundary. A file's linkage section can contain pointers for which an attempt to load the pointer into a register or make an indirect reference through it causes a trap. The unresolved pointer contains an indication of the name of the segment to which the pointer refers and an offset within the segment; the handler for the trap maps the segment into the address space, puts the segment number into the pointer, changes the tag field in the pointer so that it no longer causes a trap, and returns to the code where the trap occurred, re-executing the instruction that caused the trap. This eliminates the need for a linker completely and works when different processes map the same file into different places in their private address spaces.\nAddress space swapping.\nSome operating systems provide for swapping entire address spaces, in addition to whatever facilities they have for paging and segmentation. When this occurs, the OS writes those pages and segments currently in real memory to swap files. In a swap-in, the OS reads back the data from the swap files but does not automatically read back pages that had been paged out at the time of the swap out operation.\nIBM's MVS, from OS/VS2 Release 2 through z/OS, provides for marking an address space as unswappable; doing so does not pin any pages in the address space. This can be done for the duration of a job by entering the name of an eligible main program in the Program Properties Table with an unswappable flag. In addition, privileged code can temporarily make an address space unswappable using a SYSEVENT Supervisor Call instruction (SVC); certain changes in the address space properties require that the OS swap it out and then swap it back in, using SYSEVENT TRANSWAP.\nSwapping does not necessarily require memory management hardware, if, for example, multiple jobs are swapped in and out of the same area of storage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It may take the form of a primary frivolous lawsuit or may be the repetitive, burdensome, and unwarranted filing of meritless motions in a matter which is otherwise a meritorious cause of action. Filing vexatious litigation is considered an abuse of the judicial process and may result in sanctions against the offender.\nA single action, even a frivolous one, is usually not enough to raise a litigant to the level of being declared vexatious. Rather, a pattern of frivolous legal actions is typically required to rise to the level of vexatious. Repeated and severe instances by a single lawyer or firm can result in eventual disbarment.\nSome jurisdictions have a list of vexatious litigants: people who have repeatedly abused the legal system. Because lawyers could be disbarred for participating in this abuse of the legal process, vexatious litigants are often unable to retain legal counsel, and such litigants, therefore, represent themselves in court. Those on the vexatious litigant list are usually either forbidden from any further legal action or are required to obtain prior permission from a senior judge before taking any legal action. The process by which a person is added to the list varies among jurisdictions. In liberal democratic jurisdictions, declaring someone a vexatious litigant is considered to be a serious measure and rarely occurs, as judges and officials are reluctant to curtail a person's access to the courts.\nThese legal actions occur in some countries of the former British Empire, where the common law system still remains: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, UK, and US, which are specified below. Civil (codified/continental) law systems typically do not have a prohibition against vexatious litigation.\nHistory of legislation against vexatious litigation.\nThe concept of vexatious litigation entered into law in 1896 with the Vexatious Actions Act, enacted in England and soon extended to Scotland and Ireland. This was primarily a response to the actions of Alexander Chaffers, a solicitor who filed numerous actions against leading members of Victorian society. When costs were awarded against him, he failed to pay.\nThe first such law outside the British Isles, the Supreme Court Act, 1927 was passed in Australia nearly thirty years later. This too was prompted by the behaviour of an individual, Rupert Millane. The first vexatious litigant law in the United States was enacted in California in 1963. By 2007 four more US states had passed similar legislation: Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas.\nLaws by country.\nAustralia.\nQueensland.\nIn Queensland, the process for having someone declared a vexatious litigant is governed by the \"Vexatious Proceedings Act 2005\", which supplanted an earlier Act. The Act defines a vexatious proceeding to include a proceeding brought without merit or any prospect of success, with the consequence that it is not necessary to prove the existence of any improper motive in order to obtain relief under the Act. As of June\u00a02019[ [update]] there were 26 people found to be vexatious litigants.\nSouth Australia.\nIn South Australia, vexatious litigation laws were enacted in the mid-1930s with the \"Supreme Court Act 1935-1936\", following similar laws enacted in Victoria. In 2010 the Rann government acted to strengthen the ability of the courts to act against vexatious litigants by \"increasing the range of courts and tribunals that can declare people as vexatious\". Prior to that date, few people had been banned from bringing litigation to South Australian courts \u2013 by 2005, only two people were listed as having been declared as vexatious litigants, the first in 1997 and the second declared during that year. As of June\u00a02019[ [update]] there were 7 people found to be vexatious litigants.\nStatistics.\nAs of June\u00a02019[ [update]], 21 people in Victoria had been declared vexatious litigants since the law was introduced in 1930.\nThe High Court of Australia declared only four people to be vexatious litigants in its 116 years in existence as of June\u00a02019[ [update]], whereas the Australian Federal Court system, established in 1976, has at least 49 names on its barred registry.\nIn New South Wales, as of June\u00a02019[ [update]] there were 43 people on the New South Wales Supreme Court's vexatious litigants register.\nAs of June\u00a02019[ [update]] there were 22 people found to be vexatious litigants in Western Australia.\nCanada.\nUnder the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", section 92(14), each province is vested with the power to enact and apply laws relating to the administration of justice within its own territory.\nIn Canada, Section 40 of the \"Federal Court Act\"\n and in Ontario Section 140 of the \"Courts of Justice Act\", restrict the ability to introduce or continue proceedings for those who have instituted vexatious proceedings or conducted proceedings in a vexatious manner.\nQuebec.\nIn Quebec, the Code of Civil Procedure is the principal legislation that sets rules related to civil procedure. Under section 46 of the Code of Civil Procedure, all judicial courts and judges in Quebec are vested with \"all the powers necessary for the exercise of their jurisdiction\". Furthermore, they may:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;at any time and in all matters, whether in first instance or in appeal, issue orders to safeguard the rights of the parties, for such time and on such conditions as they may determine. As well, they may, in the matters brought before them, even on their own initiative, issue injunctions or reprimands, suppress writings or declare them libellous, and make such orders as are appropriate to deal with cases for which no specific remedy is provided by law.\nSection 46 vests a very broad power on judicial courts and judges to ensure that the administration of justice is conducted according to decorum and according to the remedial nature of justice. As the courts's decisions have shown it, the authority to declare a litigant as vexatious is directly tributary to the power conferred by section 46. Cases illustrating the application of section 46 are numerous. Among them, there are: \"Nguiagain v. Commission de la fonction publique\", in which the judge rejected the plaintiff's motion for a \"mandamus\" to enjoin his union to revise the grievance that he had filed on the grounds that the motion was groundless and abusive; \"De Niverville c. Desc\u00f4teaux\", where an injunction was rendered declaring the respondent, disbarred lawyer Desc\u00f4teaux, as a vexatious litigant due to the multiple unfounded and frivolous actions that he had sought against the plaintiff De Niverville; and in \"Fabrikant v. Corbin\", a motion to declare the plaintiff Valery Fabrikant as a vexatious litigant was granted to the defendant, Corbin. In all of the above cited cases, a litigant was only declared vexatious following a proceeding instated by the opposite party. Moreover, section 46's scope is limited to judicial courts and judges. Administrative tribunals are legislative creations and they can only exist and function within the limits that are imposed by law. Administrative tribunals in Quebec cannot declare a person a vexatious litigant.\nAs per section 90 of the \"Rules of Practice of the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec in Civil Matters\", such litigants are now indexed in a registry kept by the Chief Justice in the judiciary district of Montreal. Lawyer and author Claude Duchesnay has reported in May 2003 that a document on the Quebec attorney general's intranet contains the name of 58 persons who must obtain permission prior to instating proceedings before the courts.\nIndia.\nThere is not a specific law titled \"Vexatious Litigation Law\" in India, the concept is primarily addressed through provisions in the Civil Procedure Code and through judicial decisions. The Indian legal system empowers courts to deal with vexatious litigation through several mechanisms. One common tool is the imposition of costs on the litigant who files frivolous suits. Courts have the discretion to order costs to be paid to the opposing party as a means of discouraging such behavior. These costs can include legal fees and compensation for the wasted time and resources of the other party. Also under Section 35A of the Civil Procedure Code, courts have the authority to declare a litigant a \"vexatious litigant.\" This declaration prohibits the person from filing any further lawsuits in a particular court without obtaining prior permission. This provision is designed to deter individuals from repeatedly abusing the legal system. Courts have the authority to dismiss frivolous cases at the preliminary stage and even initiate contempt of court proceedings against those who persistently file baseless lawsuits.\nIreland.\nIn Ireland, a court may, of its own motion or on application, order that no proceedings, either of a certain type or at all, may be issued by a certain person without leave of that court or some other court, for a specified time, or indefinitely. Such an order is referred to in legal circles as an Isaac Wunder order after Isaac Wunder who made several claims against the Hospitals Trust claiming sweepstakes prizes, but the claims were found to be groundless and the case deemed frivolous or vexatious. He was prohibited from taking further High Court proceedings in the action without leave of the court.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand a person may be declared a vexatious litigant by a High Court Judge on the application of the Attorney-General. A vexatious litigant must then apply to a High Court Judge for leave to commence any action. A decision by the High Court whether or not to grant leave cannot be appealed.\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn England and Wales there are two methods to control vexatious litigants: \nHis Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service maintains a list of vexatious litigants and those subject to a civil restraint order.\nCivil restraint orders.\nCourts in England and Wales have the means of escalating the sanctions against a litigant who makes applications to the court that are \"totally without merit\". Civil restraint orders allow courts to forbid applications for court hearings without the permission of a judge. There are three types of CRO: limited, extended and general, with different scopes of application. Further applications totally without merit can lead to the withdrawal of the right of appeal. Harassment of the court and court officials can lead to a penal prohibition notice, prohibiting the litigant from contacting or approaching the court without permission.\nVexatious litigant orders.\nSection 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 provides the High Court with the power to make an order restricting the ability of a person to undertake litigation without leave of the High Court. The High Court may make a civil proceedings order, a criminal proceedings order or an all proceedings order.\nA person subject to a civil proceedings order may not institute or continue civil proceedings in any court (which includes tribunals of a judicial function) without leave of the High Court. A person subject to a criminal proceeding order may not lay information before a justice of the peace or prefer a bill of indictment without leave of the High Court. A person subject to an all proceedings order is subject to the restriction in both a civil proceedings order and a criminal proceedings order.\nWhere the High Court makes an order under this section it is published in \"The London Gazette\".\nSuch an order can only be made on the application of HM Attorney-General and where the High Court is satisfied that the person has habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground\u2014\nIn relation to the civil proceedings, the High Court will only grant leave to initiate or continue the proceedings or application where it is satisfied it is not an abuse of the process of the court in question and that there are reasonable grounds for the proceedings or application.\nIn relation to criminal proceedings, the High Court will only grant leave for the laying of an information or for an application for leave to prefer a bill of indictment where it is satisfied that the institution of the prosecution is not an abuse of the criminal process and that there are reasonable grounds for the institution of the prosecution by the applicant.\nScotland.\nThe Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service holds a published list of members of the public who have habitually and persistently instituted vexatious legal proceedings without reasonable ground, and have been declared vexatious litigants under the Vexatious Actions (Scotland) Act 1898. This piece of legislation has been repealed, and replaced by incorporation into section 100 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. Under this legislation, the Inner House of the Court of Session can make an order to prevent a person accused of vexatious litigation from raising or progressing any civil legal proceedings without permission from a judge of the Outer House of the Court of Session. Such an Order may have a specified time period, or may run indefinitely. The published list of such individuals, as of December 2024, contains thirteen names.\nUnited States.\nThe American Rule regarding attorneys' fees, a unique practice among developed countries, is sometimes cited as a contributing factor to vexatious litigation in the United States.\nAs of 2007, several states have vexatious litigant laws \u2014 California, Florida, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas.\nCalifornia.\nThe Judicial Council of California maintains an online monthly Vexatious Litigant List containing the names of several thousand vexatious individuals and companies. Orders filed from 1991 to the present are included on the list. Unless represented by an attorney, persons on the list may not file any new litigation in California without first obtaining permission from the presiding judge of the court. Under http://, any vexatious litigant who disobeys the prefiling order may be punished for contempt of court.\nUnder California law a vexatious litigant is someone who does any of the following, most of which require that the litigant be proceeding \"pro se\", i.e., representing himself:\nThe threshold for \"repeated\" frivolous motions or litigations is quite high. \u201cMost cases affirming the vexatious litigant designation involve situations where litigants have filed dozens of motions either during the pendency of an action or relating to the same judgment.\" Evidence that a litigant is a frequent plaintiff or defendant alone is insufficient to support a vexatious litigant designation.\nRepeated motions must be \"so devoid of merit and be so frivolous that they can be described as a flagrant abuse of the system, have no reasonable probability of success, lack reasonable or probable cause or excuse, and are clearly meant to abuse the processes of the courts and to harass the adverse party than other litigants.\" The moving party, in addition to demonstrating that the plaintiff is vexatious, must show that the case has little chance of prevailing on the merits. If the plaintiff is so determined, a bond may be required, and if the plaintiff does not meet the bond requirement, the case is dismissed.\nHabeas petitions do not count towards vexatious litigant determination. Vexatiousness in probate actions have a lower standard.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32359", "revid": "47768208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32359", "title": "Virgil", "text": "1st-century-BC Roman poet\nPublius Vergilius Maro (; 15 October 70 BC\u00a0\u2013 21 September 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil ( ) in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He composed three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the \"Eclogues\" (or \"Bucolics\"), the \"Georgics\", and the epic \"Aeneid\". Some minor poems, collected in the \"Appendix Vergiliana\", were attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars regard these as spurious, with the possible exception of some short pieces.\nAlready acclaimed in his lifetime as a classic author, Virgil rapidly replaced Ennius and other earlier authors as a standard school text, and stood as the most popular Latin poet through late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and early modernity, exerting major influence on Western literature. Geoffrey Chaucer assigned Virgil a uniquely prominent position in history in \"The House of Fame\" (1374\u201385), describing him as standing \"on a pilere / that was of tinned yren clere\" (\"on a pillar that was of bright tin-plated iron\"), and in the \"Divine Comedy\", in which Virgil appears as the author's guide through Hell and Purgatory, Dante pays tribute to Virgil with the words (\"Inf.\" I.86\u20137) (\"thou art alone the one from whom I took the beautiful style that has done honour to me\"). In the 20th Century, T. S. Eliot famously began a lecture on the subject \"What Is a Classic?\" by asserting as self-evidently true that \"whatever the definition we arrive at, it cannot be one which excludes Virgil \u2013 we may say confidently that it must be one which will expressly reckon with him.\"\nTraditional biography.\nBiographical sources.\nBiographical information about Virgil is transmitted chiefly in (\"lives\") of the poet, prefixed to commentaries on his work by Probus, Donatus, and Servius. The life given by Donatus is considered to closely reproduce the life of Virgil from a lost work of Suetonius on the lives of famous authors, just as Donatus used it for the poet's life in his commentary on Terence, where Suetonius is explicitly credited. The far shorter life given by Servius likewise seems to be an abridgement of Suetonius except for one or two statements. Varius is said to have written a memoir of his friend Virgil, and Suetonius likely drew on this lost work and other sources contemporary with the poet. A life written in verse by the grammarian Phocas (probably active in the 4th to 5th centuries AD) differs in some details from Donatus and Servius. Henry Nettleship believed the life attributed to Probus may have drawn independently from the same sources as Suetonius, but it is attributed by other authorities to an anonymous author of the 5th or 6th century AD who drew on Donatus, Servius, and Phocas. The Servian life was the principal source of Virgil's biography for medieval readers, while the Donatian life enjoyed a more limited circulation, and the lives of Phocas and Probus remained largely unknown.\nAlthough the commentaries record much factual information about Virgil, some of their evidence can be shown to rely on allegorizing and on inferences drawn from his poetry. For this reason, details regarding Virgil's life story are considered somewhat problematic.\nFamily and birth.\nAccording to the ancient , Publius Vergilius Maro was born on the Ides of October during the consulship of Pompey and Crassus (15 October 70 BC) in the village of Andes, near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy, added to Italy proper during his lifetime). The Donatian life reports that some say Virgil's father was a potter, but most say he was an employee of an apparitor named Magius, whose daughter he married. According to Phocas and Probus, the name of Virgil's mother was Magia Polla. The cognomen of Virgil's maternal family, \"Magius,\" and failure to distinguish the genitive form of this rare name (\"Magi\") in Servius' life, from the genitive \"magi\" of the noun \"magus\" (\"magician\"), probably contributed to the rise of the medieval legend that Virgil's father was employed by a certain itinerant magician, and that Virgil was a magician.\nAnalysis of his name has led some to believe he descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation is not supported by narrative evidence from his writings or later biographers.\nSite of Andes.\nA tradition of obscure origin, which was accepted by Dante, identifies Andes with modern Pietole, two or three miles southeast of Mantua. The ancient biography attributed to Probus records that Andes was thirty Roman miles (about ) from Mantua. There are eight or nine references to the \"gens\" to which Vergil belonged, \"gens Vergilia\", in inscriptions from Northern Italy. Out of these, four are from townships remote from Mantua, three appear in inscriptions from Verona, and one in an inscription from Calvisano, a votive offering to the Matronae (a group of deities) by a woman called Vergilia, asking the goddesses to deliver from danger another woman, called Munatia. A tomb erected by a member of the \"gens Magia\", to which Virgil's mother belonged, is found at Casalpoglio, just from Calvisano. In 1915, G. E. K. Braunholtz drew attention to the proximity of these inscriptions to each other, and the fact that Calvisano is exactly 30 Roman miles from Mantua, which led Robert Seymour Conway to theorize that these inscriptions have to do with relatives of Virgil, and Calvisano or Carpenedolo, not Pietole, is the site of Andes. E. K. Rand defended the traditional site at Pietole, noting that Egnazio's 1507 edition of Probus's commentary, supposedly based on a \"very ancient codex\" from Bobbio Abbey which can no longer be found, says that Andes was three miles from Mantua, and arguing this is the correct reading. Conway replied that Egnazio's manuscript cannot be trusted to have been as ancient as Egnazio claimed it was, nor can we be sure that the reading \"three\" is not Egnazio's conjectural correction of his manuscript to harmonize it with the Pietole tradition, and all other evidence strongly favours the unanimous reading of the other witnesses of \"thirty miles.\" Other studies claim that today's consideration for ancient \"Andes\" should be sought in the Casalpoglio area of Castel Goffredo.\nSpelling of name.\nBy the fourth or fifth century AD the original spelling \"Vergilius\" had been changed to \"Virgilius\", and the latter spelling spread to modern European languages. This latter spelling persisted even though, as early as the 15th century, the classical scholar Poliziano had shown \"Vergilius\" to be the original spelling. Today, the anglicisations \"Vergil\" and \"Virgil\" are both considered acceptable.\nThere is speculation that the spelling \"Virgilius\" might have arisen due to a pun, since \"virg-\" carries an echo of the Latin word for \"wand\" (\"uirga\"), Virgil being particularly associated with magic in the Middle Ages. There is also a possibility that \"virg-\" is meant to evoke the Latin \"virgo\" (\"virgin\"); this would be a reference to the fourth \"Eclogue\", which has a history of Christian, and specifically Messianic, interpretations.\nChildhood and education.\nVirgil spent his boyhood in Cremona until his 15th year (55 BC), when he is said to have received the \"toga virilis\" on the very day Lucretius died. From Cremona, he moved to Milan, and shortly afterwards to Rome. After briefly considering a career in rhetoric and law, Virgil turned his talents to poetry. Despite the biographers' statements that Virgil's family was of modest means, these accounts of his education, as well as of his ceremonial assumption of the \"toga virilis\", suggest his father was a wealthy equestrian landowner.\nHe is said to have been tall and stout, with a swarthy complexion and a rustic appearance. Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid. Schoolmates considered Virgil shy and reserved, and he was nicknamed \"Parthenias\" (\"virgin\") because of his aloofness.\nPoetic career.\nThe biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter \"Eclogues\" (or \"Bucolics\") in 42 BC and it is thought the collection was published around 39\u201338 BC, although this is controversial. After defeating the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar in the Battle of Philippi (42 BC), Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, which\u2014according to tradition\u2014included an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of Virgil's family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property, were seen as his motives in the composition of the \"Eclogues\". This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the \"Eclogues\". In \"Eclogues\" 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident.\nSometime after the publication of the \"Eclogues\", probably before 37 BC, Virgil became part of the circle of Gaius Maecenas, Octavian's capable political adviser, who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian's side. Virgil came to know many other leading literary figures of the time, including Horace, in whose poetry he is often mentioned, and Varius Rufus, who later helped finish the \"Aeneid\". At Maecenas's insistence, according to the tradition, Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37\u201329 BC) on the long dactylic hexameter poem called the \"Georgics\" (from Greek, \"On Working the Earth\"), which he dedicated to Maecenas.\nVirgil worked on the \"Aeneid\" during the last eleven years of his life (29\u201319 BC), commissioned, according to Propertius, by Augustus. According to the tradition, Virgil traveled to the senatorial province of Achaea in Greece, in about 19 BC, to revise the \"Aeneid\". After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in Apulia on 21 September 19 BC. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Virgil's wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.\nBurial and tomb.\nAfter his death at Brundisium according to Donatus, or Taranto according to late manuscripts of Servius, Virgil's remains were transported to Naples, where his tomb was engraved with an epitaph he had composed: \"\"; \"Mantua gave me life, the Calabrians took it away, Naples holds me now; I sang of pastures, farms, and commanders.\" (transl. Bernard Knox) Martial reports that Silius Italicus annexed the site to his estate (11.48, 11.50), and Pliny the Younger says that Silius \"would visit Virgil's tomb as if it were a temple\" (\"Epistulae\" 3.7.8).\nThe structure known as Virgil's tomb is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel () in Piedigrotta, a district from the centre of Naples, near the Mergellina harbour, on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli. While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death, in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers, and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration. A famous medieval legend that Paul the Apostle had visited Virgil's tomb and wept that so great a poet had died without the Christian faith is referenced in a liturgical hymn said to have been used on Paul's feast day at Mantua:\nHowever, Johann Friedrich Heinrich Schlosser was unable to find a manuscript of this hymn, and reported that he had only heard these verses recited from memory by a brother who had lived at Mantua.\nThrough the nineteenth century, the supposed tomb attracted travellers on the Grand Tour, and still draws visitors.\nWorks.\nEarly works.\nAccording to the commentators, Virgil received his first education when he was five and later went to Cremona, Milan, and finally Rome to study rhetoric, medicine, and astronomy, which he would abandon for philosophy. From Virgil's admiring references to the neoteric writers Asinius Pollio and Cinna, it has been inferred that he was, for a time, associated with Catullus's neoteric circle. According to the \"Catalepton\", he began to write poetry while in the Epicurean school of Siro in Naples. A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title \"Appendix Vergiliana\", but are considered spurious by scholars. One, the \"Catalepton\", consists of fourteen short poems, some of which may be Virgil's, and a short narrative poem \"Culex\" (\"The Gnat\"), was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD.\n\"Eclogues\".\nThe \"Eclogues\" (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic (\"pastoral\" or \"rural\") poetry of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus, which were written in dactylic hexameter. While some readers have identified Virgil with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (\"Ecl\". 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, \"Ecl\". 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (\"Ecl\". 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought.\nThe ten \"Eclogues\" present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing homosexual love (\"Ecl\". 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (\"Ecl\". 3). \"Eclogue\" 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\", uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (the child's identity has been debated). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil in his \"Eclogues\" is credited with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in literature and visual arts and with setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus and later writers.\n\"Georgics\".\nThe ostensible theme of the \"Georgics\" is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this, Virgil follows in the didactic (\"how to\") tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" and works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the \"Georgics\" focus respectively on:\nWell-known passages include the beloved \"Laus Italiae\" of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an \"epyllion\", which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus, and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld. Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by Augustus, and committed suicide in 26 BC.\nThe tone of the \"Georgics\" wavers between optimism and pessimism, sparking critical debate on the poet's intentions, but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry. Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the \"Georgics\" to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.\n\"Aeneid\".\nThe \"Aeneid\" is widely considered Virgil's finest work, and one of the most important poems in the history of literature (T. S. Eliot referred to it as \"the classic of all Europe\"). The work, modelled after Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", chronicles the journey of a warrior and refugee of the Trojan War, named Aeneas, as he struggles to fulfill his destiny. After fleeing the sack of Troy, he travels to Italy, where he battles with Turnus, and his descendants Romulus and Remus found the city of Rome.\nThe epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse. The \"Aeneid\"'s first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic; Homer, the pre-eminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes, among other writers to whom he alludes. Although the \"Aeneid\" casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often expands the genre by including elements of other genres, such as tragedy and aetiological poetry. Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the \"Aeneid\" into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the \"Odyssey\" as a model while the last six were connected to the \"Iliad\".\nBook 1, at the head of the Odyssean section, opens with a storm which Juno, Aeneas's enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet. The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book 5, funeral games are celebrated for Aeneas's father Anchises, who had died a year before. On reaching Cumae, in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl, who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome's destiny to his son.\nBook 7, beginning the Iliadic half, opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas's arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus. Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto and Amata, Lavinia's mother. In Book 8, Aeneas allies with King Evander, who occupies the future site of Rome, and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history. Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians; Book 10, the death of Evander's young son Pallas; and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus. The \"Aeneid\" ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus's city, the death of Amata, and Aeneas's defeat and killing of Turnus, whose pleas for mercy are spurned. The final book ends with the image of Turnus's soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld.\nReception of the \"Aeneid\".\nCritics of the \"Aeneid\" focus on a variety of issues. The tone as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected. The \"Aeneid\" is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus's victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist, Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas's emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the \"pious\" and \"righteous\" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus.\nThe \"Aeneid\" appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4, and 6 to Augustus; and Book 6 apparently caused the emperor's sister Octavia to faint. Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly skepticism, it has served as a basis for art, such as Jean-Baptiste Wicar's \"Virgil Reading the Aeneid\".\nSome lines of the poem were left unfinished, and the whole was unedited, at Virgil's death in 19 BC. As a result, the text of the \"Aeneid\" that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished, i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter. Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these incomplete for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to debate.\nLegacy and reception.\nAntiquity.\nThe works of Virgil, almost from the moment of their publication, revolutionized Latin poetry. The \"Eclogues\", \"Georgics\", and above all the \"Aeneid\" became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the \"Aeneid\" in \"Amores\" 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the \"Metamorphoses\", the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as an important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the \"Bellum Civile\", has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing of the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian-era poet Statius in his 12-book epic \"Thebaid\" engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine \"Aeneid\", but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers in Silius Italicus. With almost every line of his epic \"Punica\", Silius references Virgil.\nVirgil also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius's commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.\nLate antiquity.\nEven as the Western Roman Empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet; Augustine of Hippo confessed how he had wept at reading the death of Dido. The best-known surviving manuscripts of Virgil's works include manuscripts from late antiquity, such as the \"Vergilius Augusteus\", the \"Vergilius Vaticanus\" and the \"Vergilius Romanus\".\nMiddle Ages.\nGregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with other Latin poets, though he cautions that \"we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death\". In the Renaissance of the 12th century, Alexander Neckham placed the \"divine\" \"Aeneid\" on his standard arts curriculum, and Dido became the romantic heroine of the age. Monks like Maiolus of Cluny might repudiate what they called \"the luxurious eloquence of Virgil\", but they could not deny the power of his appeal.\nDante presents Virgil as his guide through Hell and the greater part of Purgatory in the \"Divine Comedy\". He also mentions Virgil in \"De vulgari eloquentia\", as one of the four \"regulati poetae\" along with Ovid, Lucan and Statius (ii, vi, 7).\nRenaissance and early modernity.\nThe Renaissance saw several authors inspired to write epic in Virgil's wake: Edmund Spenser called himself the English Virgil; \"Paradise Lost\" was influenced by the \"Aeneid\"; and later artists influenced include Berlioz and Hermann Broch.\nLegends.\nThe legend of \"Virgil in his basket\" arose in the Middle Ages, and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos, demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men. In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman, sometimes described as the emperor's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia. She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house, which he was to sneak into at night, by climbing into a large basket let down from a window. When he did so he was hoisted only halfway up the wall and left trapped there into the next day, exposed to public ridicule. The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle. Among other artists depicting the scene, Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving.\nPartially as a result of his so-called \"Messianic\" Eclogue 4\u00a0\u2013 interpreted from the 3rd century by Christian thinkers to have predicted the birth of Jesus\u00a0\u2013 Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer. Eclogue 4 describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age. In consequence, Virgil came to be seen on a similar level to the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity. \"The Jewish Encyclopedia\" argues that medieval legends about the golem may have been inspired by Virgilian legends about the poet's apocryphal power to bring inanimate objects to life.\nPossibly as early as the second century AD, and into the Middle Ages, Virgil's works were seen as having magical properties and used for divination. In what became known as the \"Sortes Vergilianae\" (\"Virgilian Lots\"), passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions. In a similar vein, Macrobius in the \"Saturnalia\" credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. In the 12th century, starting around Naples but eventually spreading throughout Europe, a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician. Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years, arguably becoming as prominent as his writings. In medieval Wales, the Welsh version of his name, \"Fferyllt\" or \"Pheryllt\", became a generic term for magic-worker, and survives in its word for pharmacist, \"fferyllydd\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nCollected works\nBiography\nCommentary\nBibliographies"}
{"id": "32361", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32361", "title": "Value theory", "text": "Systematic study of values\nValue theory, also called axiology, studies the nature, sources, and types of values. It is a branch of philosophy and an interdisciplinary field closely associated with social sciences such as economics, sociology, anthropology, and psychology.\nValue is the worth of something, usually understood as covering both positive and negative degrees corresponding to the terms \"good\" and \"bad\". Values influence many human endeavors related to emotion, decision-making, and action. Value theorists distinguish various types of values, like the contrast between intrinsic and instrumental value. An entity has intrinsic value if it is good in itself, independent of external factors. An entity has instrumental value if it is useful as a means leading to other good things. Other classifications focus on the type of benefit, including economic, moral, political, aesthetic, and religious values. Further categorizations distinguish absolute values from values that are relative to something else.\nDiverse schools of thought debate the nature and origins of values. Value realists state that values exist as objective features of reality. Anti-realists reject this, with some seeing values as subjective human creations and others viewing value statements as meaningless. Regarding the sources of value, hedonists argue that only pleasure has intrinsic value, whereas desire theorists discuss desires as the ultimate source of value. Perfectionism, another approach, emphasizes the cultivation of characteristic human abilities. Value pluralism identifies diverse sources of intrinsic value, raising the issue of whether values belonging to different types are comparable. Value theorists employ various methods of inquiry, ranging from reliance on intuitions and thought experiments to the analysis of language, description of first-person experience, observation of behavior, and surveys.\nValue theory is related to various fields. Ethics focuses primarily on normative concepts of right behavior, whereas value theory explores evaluative concepts about what is good. In economics, theories of value are frameworks to assess and explain the economic value of commodities. Sociology and anthropology examine values as aspects of societies and cultures, reflecting dominant preferences and beliefs. In psychology, values are typically understood as abstract motivational goals that shape an individual's personality. The roots of value theory lie in antiquity as reflections on the highest good that humans should pursue. Diverse traditions contributed to this area of thought during the medieval and early modern periods, but it was only established as a distinct discipline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nDefinition.\nValue theory, also known as \"axiology\" and \"theory of values\", is the systematic study of values. As a branch of philosophy, it examines which things are good and what it means for something to be good. It distinguishes different types of values and explores how they can be measured and compared. This field also studies whether values are a fundamental aspect of reality and how they influence phenomena such as emotion, desire, decision, and action. Value theory is relevant to many human endeavors because values are guiding principles that underlie the political, economic, scientific, and personal spheres. It analyzes and evaluates phenomena such as well-being, utility, beauty, human life, knowledge, wisdom, freedom, love, and justice.\nThe precise definition of value theory is debated and some theorists rely on alternative characterizations. In a broad sense, \"value theory\" is a catch-all label that encompasses all philosophical disciplines studying evaluative and normative topics. According to this view, value theory is one of the main branches of philosophy and includes ethics, aesthetics, social philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion. A similar broad characterization sees value theory as a multidisciplinary area of inquiry that integrates research from fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics alongside philosophy. In a narrow sense, value theory is a subdiscipline of ethics that is particularly relevant to the school of consequentialism since it determines how to assess the value of consequences.\nThe word \"axiology\" has its origin in the ancient Greek terms (, meaning 'worthy' or 'of value') and (, meaning 'study' or 'theory of'). Even though the roots of value theory reach back to the ancient period, this area of thought was only conceived as a distinct discipline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the term \"axiology\" was coined. The terms \"value theory\" and \"axiology\" are usually used as synonyms, but some philosophers distinguish between them. According to one characterization, axiology is a subfield of value theory that limits itself to theories about which things are valuable and how valuable they are. The term \"timology\" is an older and less common synonym.\nValue.\nValue is the worth, usefulness, or merit of something. Value theorists examine the expressions used to describe and compare values, called \"evaluative terms\". They are further interested in the types or categories of values. The proposed classifications overlap and are based on factors like the source, beneficiary, and function of the value.\nEvaluative terms.\nValues are expressed through evaluative terms. For example, the words \"good\", \"best\", \"great\", and \"excellent\" convey positive values, whereas words like \"bad\" and \"terrible\" indicate negative values. Value theorists distinguish between thin and thick evaluative terms. Thin evaluative terms, like \"good\" and \"bad\", express pure evaluations without any additional descriptive content. They contrast with thick evaluative terms, like \"courageous\" and \"cruel\", which provide more information by expressing other qualities, such as character traits, in addition to the evaluation. Values are often understood as degrees that cover positive and negative magnitudes corresponding to good and bad. The term \"value\" is sometimes restricted to positive degrees to contrast with the term \"disvalue\" for negative degrees. The words \"better\" and \"worse\" are used to compare degrees, but it is controversial whether a quantitative comparison is always possible. Evaluation is the assessment or measurement of value, often employed to compare the benefits of different options to find the most advantageous choice.\nEvaluative terms are sometimes distinguished from normative or deontic terms. Normative or deontic terms, like \"right\", \"wrong\", and \"obligation\", prescribe actions or other states by expressing what ought to be done or what is required. Evaluative terms have a wider scope because they are not limited to what people can control or are responsible for. For instance, involuntary events like digestion and earthquakes can have a positive or negative value even if they are not right or wrong in a strict sense. Despite the distinction, evaluative and normative concepts are closely related. For example, the value of the consequences of an action may influence its normative status\u2014whether the action is right or wrong.\nTypes.\nIntrinsic and instrumental.\nA thing has intrinsic or final value if it is good in itself or good for its own sake, independent of external factors or outcomes. A thing has extrinsic or instrumental value if it is useful or leads to other good things, serving as a means to bring about a desirable end. For example, tools like microwaves or money have instrumental value due to the useful functions they perform. In some cases, the thing produced this way has itself instrumental value, like when using money to buy a microwave. This can result in a chain of instrumentally valuable things in which each link gets its value by causing the following link. Intrinsically valuable things stand at the endpoint of these chains and ground the value of all the preceding links. \nOne suggestion to distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental value, proposed by G. E. Moore, relies on a thought experiment that imagines the valuable thing in isolation from everything else. In such a situation, purely instrumentally valuable things lose their value since they serve no purpose while purely intrinsically valuable things remain valuable. According to a common view, pleasure is one of the sources of intrinsic value. Other suggested sources include desire satisfaction, virtue, life, health, beauty, freedom, and knowledge.\nIntrinsic and instrumental value are not exclusive categories. As a result, a thing can have both intrinsic and instrumental value if it is both good in itself while also leading to other good things. In a similar sense, a thing can have different instrumental values at the same time, both positive and negative ones. This is the case if some of its consequences are good while others are bad. The total instrumental value of a thing is the value balance of all its consequences.\nBecause instrumental value depends on other values, it is an open question whether it should be understood as a value in a strict sense. For example, the overall value of a chain of causes leading to an intrinsically valuable thing remains the same if instrumentally valuable links are added or removed without affecting the intrinsically valuable thing. The observation that the overall value does not change is sometimes used as an argument that the things added or removed do not have value.\nTraditionally, value theorists have used the terms \"intrinsic value\" and \"final value\" interchangeably, just like the terms \"extrinsic value\" and \"instrumental value\". This practice has been questioned in the 20th century based on the idea that they are similar but not identical concepts. According to this view, a thing has intrinsic value if the source of its value is an intrinsic property, meaning that the value does not depend on how the thing is related to other objects. Extrinsic value, by contrast, depends on external relations. This view sees instrumental value as one type of extrinsic value based on external causal relations. At the same time, it allows that there are other types of non-instrumental extrinsic value that result from external non-causal relations. Final value is understood as what is valued for its own sake, independent of whether intrinsic or extrinsic properties are responsible.\nAbsolute and relative.\nAnother distinction relies on the contrast between absolute and relative value. Absolute value, also called \"value \", is a form of unconditional value. A thing has relative value if its value is relative to other things or limited to certain considerations or viewpoints.\nOne form of relative value is restricted to the type of an entity, expressed in sentences like \"That is a good knife\" or \"Jack is a good thief\". This form is known as \"attributive goodness\" since the word \"good\" modifies the meaning of another term. To be attributively good as a certain type means to possess qualities characteristic of that type. For instance, a good knife is sharp and a good thief has the skill of stealing without getting caught. Attributive goodness contrasts with predicative goodness. The sentence \"Pleasure is good\" is an example since the word \"good\" is used as a predicate to talk about the unqualified value of pleasure. Attributive and predicative goodness can accompany each other, but this is not always the case. For instance, being a good thief is not necessarily a good thing.\nAnother type of relative value restricts goodness to a specific person. Known as \"personal value\", it expresses what benefits a particular person, promotes their welfare, or is in their interest. For example, a poem written by a child may have personal value for the parents even if the poem lacks value for others. Impersonal value, by contrast, is good in general without restriction to any specific person or viewpoint. Some philosophers, like Moore, reject the existence of personal values, holding that all values are impersonal. Others have proposed theories about the relation between personal and impersonal value. The agglomerative theory says that impersonal value is nothing but the sum of all personal values. Another view understands impersonal value as a specific type of personal value taken from the perspective of the universe as a whole.\nAgent-relative value is sometimes contrasted with personal value as another person-specific limitation of the evaluative outlook. Agent-relative values affect moral considerations about what a person is responsible for or guilty of. For example, if Mei promises to pick Pedro up from the airport then an agent-relative value obligates Mei to drive to the airport. This obligation is in place even if it does not benefit Mei, in which case there is an agent-relative value without a personal value. In consequentialism, agent-relative values are often discussed in relation to ethical dilemmas. One dilemma revolves around the question of whether an individual should murder an innocent person if this prevents the murder of two innocent people by a different perpetrator. The agent-neutral perspective tends to affirm this idea since one murder is preferable to two. The agent-relative perspective tends to reject this conclusion, arguing that the initial murder should be avoided since it negatively impacts the agent-relative value of the individual committing it.\nTraditionally, most value theorists see absolute value as the main topic of value theory and focus their attention on this type. Nonetheless, some philosophers, like Peter Geach and Philippa Foot, have argued that the concept of absolute value by itself is meaningless and should be understood as one form of relative value.\nOther distinctions.\nOther categorizations of values have been proposed following diverse classification principles without a single approach widely accepted by all theorists. Some focus on the types of entities that have value. They include distinct categories for entities like individuals, groups, society, the environment, and inert things. Another subdivision pays attention to the type of benefit involved and encompasses material, economic, moral, social, political, aesthetic, and religious values. Classifications by the beneficiary of the value distinguish between self- and other-oriented values.\nA historically influential approach identifies three spheres of value: truth, goodness, and beauty. For example, the neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband characterizes them as the highest goals of consciousness, with thought aiming at truth, will aiming at goodness, and emotion aiming at beauty. A similar view, proposed by the Chinese philosopher Zhang Dainian, says that the value of truth belongs to knowledge, the value of goodness belongs to behavior, and the value of beauty belongs to art. This three-fold distinction also plays a central role in the philosophies of Franz Brentano and J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Other suggested types of values include objective, subjective, potential, actual, contingent, necessary, inherent, and constitutive values.\nSchools of thought.\nRealism and anti-realism.\nValue realism is the view that values have mind-independent existence. This means that objective facts determine what has value, irrespective of subjective beliefs and preferences. According to this view, the evaluative statement \"That act is bad\" is as objectively true or false as the empirical statement \"That act causes distress\".\nRealists often analyze values as properties of valuable things. For example, stating that kindness is good asserts that kindness possesses the property of goodness. Value realists disagree about what type of property is involved. Naturalists say that value is a natural property. Natural properties, like size and shape, can be known through empirical observation and are studied by the natural sciences. Non-naturalists reject this view but agree that values are real. They say that values differ significantly from empirical properties and belong to another domain of reality. According to one view, they are known through rational or emotional intuition rather than empirical observation.\nAnother disagreement among realists is about whether the entity carrying the value is a concrete individual or a state of affairs. For instance, the name \"Bill\" refers to an individual while the sentence \"Bill is pleased\" refers to a state of affairs, which combines the individual \"Bill\" with the property \"pleased\". Some value theorists hold that the value is a property directly of Bill while others contend that it is a property of the state of affairs that Bill is pleased. This distinction affects various disputes in value theory. In some cases, a value is intrinsic according to one view and extrinsic according to the other.\nValue realism contrasts with anti-realism, which comes in various forms. In its strongest version, anti-realism rejects the existence of values in any form, claiming that value statements are meaningless. There are various intermediate views between this position and realism. Some anti-realists accept that value claims have meaning but deny that they have a truth value, a position known as \"non-cognitivism\". For example, emotivists say that value claims express emotional attitudes, similar to how exclamations like \"Yay!\" or \"Boo!\" express emotions rather than stating facts.\nCognitivists contend that value statements have a truth value, meaning that sentences like \"knowledge is intrinsically good\" are either true or false. Following this view, error theorists defend anti-realism by stating that all value statements are false because there are no values. Another view accepts the existence of values but denies that they are mind-independent. According to this view, the mental states of individuals determine whether an object has value, for instance, because individuals desire it. A similar view is defended by existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre, who argued that values are human creations that endow the world with meaning. Subjectivist theories say that values are relative to each subject, whereas more objectivist outlooks hold that values depend on mind in general rather than on the individual mind.\nA different position accepts that values are mind-independent but holds that they are reducible to other facts, meaning that they are not a fundamental part of reality. One form of reductionism maintains that a thing is good if it is fitting to favor this thing, regardless of whether people actually favor it, a position known as the \"fitting-attitude theory of value\". The buck-passing account, a closely related reductive view, argues that a thing is valuable if people have reasons to treat the thing in certain ways. These reasons come from other features of the valuable thing. According to some views, reductionism is a form of realism, but the strongest form of realism says that value is a fundamental part of reality and cannot be reduced to other aspects.\nSources of value.\nVarious theories about the sources of value have been proposed. They aim to clarify what kinds of things are intrinsically good. The historically influential theory of hedonism states that how people feel is the only source of value. More specifically, it says that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and pain is the only intrinsic evil. According to this view, everything else only has instrumental value to the extent that it leads to pleasure or pain, including knowledge, health, and justice. Hedonists usually understand the term \"pleasure\" in a broad sense that covers all kinds of enjoyable experiences, including bodily pleasures of food and sex as well as more intellectual or abstract pleasures, like the joy of reading a book or happiness about a friend's promotion. Pleasurable experiences come in degrees, and hedonists usually associate their intensity and duration with the magnitude of value they have.\nMany hedonists identify pleasure and pain as symmetric opposites, meaning that the value of pleasure balances out the disvalue of pain if they have the same intensity. However, some hedonists reject this symmetry and give more weight to avoiding pain than to experiencing pleasure. Although it is widely accepted that pleasure is valuable, the hedonist claim that it is the only source of value is controversial. Welfarism, a closely related theory, understands well-being as the only source of value. Well-being is what is ultimately good for a person, which can include other aspects besides pleasure, such as health, personal growth, meaningful relationships, and a sense of purpose in life.\nDesire theories offer a slightly different account, stating that desire satisfaction is the only source of value. This theory overlaps with hedonism because many people desire pleasure and because desire satisfaction is often accompanied by pleasure. Nonetheless, there are important differences: people desire a variety of other things as well, like knowledge, achievement, and respect; additionally, desire satisfaction may not always result in pleasure. Some desire theorists hold that value is a property of desire satisfaction itself, while others say that it is a property of the objects that satisfy a desire. One debate in desire theory concerns whether every desire is a source of value. For example, if a person has a false belief that money makes them happy, it is questionable whether the satisfaction of their desire for money is a source of value. To address this consideration, some desire theorists say that a desire can only provide value if a fully informed and rational person would have it, thereby excluding misguided desires from being a source of value.\nPerfectionism identifies the realization of human nature and the cultivation of characteristic human abilities as the source of intrinsic goodness. It covers capacities and character traits belonging to the bodily, emotional, volitional, cognitive, social, artistic, and religious fields. Perfectionists disagree about which human excellences are the most important. Many are pluralistic in recognizing a diverse array of human excellences, such as knowledge, creativity, health, beauty, free agency, and moral virtues like benevolence and courage. According to one suggestion, there are two main fields of human goods: theoretical abilities responsible for understanding the world and practical abilities responsible for interacting with it. Some perfectionists provide an ideal characterization of human nature as the goal of human flourishing, holding that human excellences are those aspects that promote the realization of this goal. This view is exemplified in Aristotle's focus on rationality as the nature and ideal state of human beings. Non-humanistic versions extend perfectionism to the natural world in general, arguing that excellence as a source of intrinsic value is not limited to the human realm.\nMonism and pluralism.\nMonist theories of value assert that there is only a single source of intrinsic value. They agree that various things have value but maintain that all fundamentally good things belong to the same type. For example, hedonists hold that nothing but pleasure has intrinsic value, while desire theorists argue that desire satisfaction is the only source of fundamental goodness. Pluralists reject this view, contending that a simple single-value system is too crude to capture the complexity of the sphere of values. They say that diverse sources of value exist independently of one another, each contributing to the overall value of the world.\nOne motivation for value pluralism is the observation that people value diverse types of things, including happiness, friendship, success, and knowledge. This diversity becomes particularly prominent when people face difficult decisions between competing values, such as choosing between friendship and career success. In such cases, value pluralists can argue that the different items have different types of values. Since monists accept only one source of intrinsic value, they may provide a different explanation by proposing that some of the valuable items only have instrumental value but lack intrinsic value.\nPluralists have proposed various accounts of how their view affects practical decisions. Rational decisions often rely on value comparisons to determine which course of action should be pursued. Some pluralists discuss a hierarchy of values reflecting the relative importance and weight of different value types to help people promote higher values when faced with difficult choices. For example, philosopher Max Scheler ranks values based on how enduring and fulfilling they are into the levels of pleasure, utility, vitality, culture, and holiness. He asserts that people should not promote lower values, like pleasure, if this comes at the expense of higher values.\nRadical pluralists reject this approach, putting more emphasis on diversity by holding that different types of values are not comparable with each other. This means that each value type is unique, making it impossible to determine which one is superior. Some value theorists use radical pluralism to argue that value conflicts are inevitable, that the gain of one value cannot always compensate for the loss of another, and that some ethical dilemmas are irresolvable. For example, philosopher Isaiah Berlin applied this idea to the values of liberty and equality, arguing that a gain in one cannot make up for a loss in the other. Similarly, philosopher Joseph Raz said that it is often impossible to compare the values of career paths, like when choosing between becoming a lawyer or a clarinetist. The terms \"incomparability\" and \"incommensurability\" are often used as synonyms in this context. However, philosophers like Ruth Chang distinguish them. According to this view, incommensurability means that there is no common measure to quantify values of different types. Incommensurable values may or may not be comparable. If they are, it is possible to say that one value is better than another, but it is not possible to quantify how much better it is.\nOthers.\nSeveral controversies surround the question of how the intrinsic value of a whole is determined by the intrinsic values of its parts. According to the additivity principle, the intrinsic value of a whole is simply the sum of the intrinsic values of its parts. For example, if a virtuous person becomes happy then the intrinsic value of the happiness is simply added to the intrinsic value of the virtue, thereby increasing the overall value.\nVarious counterexamples to the additivity principle have been proposed, suggesting that the relation between parts and wholes is more complex. For instance, Immanuel Kant argued that if a vicious person becomes happy, this happiness, though good in itself, does not increase the overall value. On the contrary, it makes things worse, according to Kant, since viciousness should not be rewarded with happiness. This situation is known as an \"organic unity\"\u2014a whole whose intrinsic value differs from the sum of the intrinsic values of its parts. Another perspective, called \"holism about value\", asserts that the intrinsic value of a thing depends on its context. Holists can argue that happiness has positive intrinsic value in the context of virtue and negative intrinsic value in the context of vice. Atomists reject this view, saying that intrinsic value is context-independent.\nTheories of value aggregation provide concrete principles for calculating the overall value of an outcome based on how positively or negatively each individual is affected by it. For example, if a government implements a new policy that affects some people positively and others negatively, theories of value aggregation can be used to determine whether the overall value of the policy is positive or negative. Axiological utilitarianism accepts the additivity principle, saying that the total value is simply the sum of all individual values. Axiological egalitarians are not only interested in the sum total of value but also in how the values are distributed. They argue that an outcome with a balanced advantage distribution is better than an outcome where some benefit a lot while others benefit little, even if the two outcomes have the same sum total. Axiological prioritarians are particularly concerned with the benefits of individuals who are worse off. They say that providing advantages to people in need has more value than providing the same advantages to others.\nAnother debate addresses the meaning of life, investigating whether life or existence as a whole has a higher meaning or purpose. Naturalist views argue that the meaning of life is found within the physical world, either as objective values that are true for everyone or as subjective values that vary according to individual preferences. Suggested fields where humans find meaning include exercising freedom, committing oneself to a cause, practicing altruism, engaging in positive social relationships, or pursuing personal happiness. Supernaturalists, by contrast, propose that meaning lies beyond the natural world. For example, various religions teach that God created the world for a higher purpose, imbuing existence with meaning. A related outlook argues that immortal souls serve as sources of meaning by being connected to a transcendent reality and evolving spiritually. Existential nihilists reject both naturalist and supernaturalist explanations by asserting that there is no higher purpose. They suggest that life is meaningless, with the consequence that there is no higher reason to continue living and that all efforts, achievements, happiness, and suffering are ultimately pointless.\nFormal axiology is a theory of value initially developed by philosopher Robert S. Hartman. This approach treats axiology as a formal science, akin to logic and mathematics. It uses axioms to give an abstract definition of value, understanding it not as a property of things but as a property of concepts. Value measures the extent to which an entity fulfills its concept. For example, a good car has all the desirable qualities of cars, like a reliable engine and effective brakes, whereas a bad car lacks many. Formal axiology distinguishes between three fundamental value types: intrinsic values apply to people; extrinsic values apply to things, actions, and social roles; systemic values apply to conceptual constructs. Formal axiology examines how these value types form a hierarchy and how they can be measured.\nMethods.\nValue theorists employ various methods to conduct their inquiries, justify theories, and measure values. Intuitionists rely on intuitions to assess evaluative claims. In this context, an intuition is an immediate apprehension or understanding of a self-evident claim, meaning that its truth can be assessed without inferring it from another observation. Value theorists often rely on thought experiments to gain this type of understanding. Thought experiments are imagined scenarios that exemplify philosophical problems. Philosophers use counterfactual reasoning to evaluate possible consequences and gain insight into underlying problems. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick imagines an experience machine that can virtually simulate an ideal life. Based on his contention that people would not want to spend the rest of their lives in this pleasurable simulation, Nozick argues against the hedonist claim that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value. According to him, the thought experiment shows that the value of an authentic connection to reality is not reducible to pleasure.\nPhenomenologists provide a detailed first-person description of the experience of values. They closely examine emotional experiences, ranging from desire, interest, and preference to feelings in the form of love and hate. However, they do not limit their inquiry to these phenomena, asserting that values permeate experience at large. A key aspect of the phenomenological method is to suspend preconceived ideas and judgments to understand the essence of experiences as they present themselves to consciousness.\nThe analysis of concepts and ordinary language is another method of inquiry. By examining terms and sentences used to talk about values, value theorists aim to clarify their meanings, uncover crucial distinctions, and formulate arguments for and against axiological theories. For instance, a prominent dispute between naturalists and non-naturalists hinges on the conceptual analysis of the term \"good\", in particular, whether its meaning can be analyzed through natural terms, like \"pleasure\".\nIn the social sciences, value theorists face the challenge of measuring the evaluative outlook of individuals and groups. Specifically, they aim to determine personal value hierarchies, for example, whether a person gives more weight to truth than to moral goodness or beauty. They distinguish between direct and indirect measurement methods. Direct methods involve asking people straightforward questions about what things they value and which value priorities they have. This approach assumes that people are aware of their evaluative outlook and able to articulate it accurately. Indirect methods do not share this assumption, asserting instead that values guide behavior and choices on an unconscious level. Consequently, they observe how people decide and act, seeking to infer the underlying value attitudes responsible for picking one course of action rather than another.\nVarious catalogs or scales of values have been proposed in psychology and related social sciences to measure value priorities. The Rokeach Value Survey considers a total of 36 values divided into two groups: instrumental values, like honesty and capability, which serve as means to promote terminal values, such as freedom and family security. It asks participants to rank the values based on their impact on the participants' lives, aiming to understand the relative importance assigned to each of them. The Schwartz theory of basic human values is a modification of the Rokeach Value Survey that seeks to provide a more cross-cultural and universal assessment. It arranges the values in a circular manner to reflect that neighboring values are compatible with each other, such as openness to change and self-enhancement, while values on opposing sides may conflict with each other, such as openness to change and conservation.\nIn various fields.\nEthics.\nEthics and value theory are overlapping fields of inquiry. Ethics studies moral phenomena, focusing on how people should act or which behaviors are morally right. Value theory investigates the nature, sources, and types of values in general. Some philosophers understand value theory as a subdiscipline of ethics. This is based on the idea that what people should do is affected by value considerations but not necessarily limited to them. Another view sees ethics as a subdiscipline of value theory. This outlook follows the idea that ethics is concerned with moral values affecting what people can control, whereas value theory examines a broader range of values, including those beyond anyone's control. Some perspectives contrast ethics and value theory, asserting that the normative concepts examined by ethics are distinct from the evaluative concepts examined by value theory. Axiological ethics is a subfield of ethics examining the nature and role of values from a moral perspective, with particular interest in determining which ends are worth pursuing.\nThe ethical theory of consequentialism combines the perspectives of ethics and value theory, asserting that the rightness of an action depends on the value of its consequences. Consequentialists compare possible courses of action, saying that people should follow the one leading to the best overall consequences. The overall consequences of an action are the totality of its effects, or how it impacts the world by starting a causal chain of events that would not have occurred otherwise. Distinct versions of consequentialism rely on different theories of the sources of value. Classical utilitarianism, a prominent form of consequentialism, says that moral actions produce the greatest amount of pleasure for the greatest number of people. It combines a consequentialist outlook on right action with a hedonist outlook on pleasure as the only source of intrinsic value.\nEconomics.\nEconomics is a social science studying how goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed, both from the perspective of individual agents and societal systems. Economists view evaluations as a driving force underlying economic activity. They use the notion of economic value and related evaluative concepts to understand decision-making processes, resource allocation, and the impact of policies. The economic value or benefit of a commodity is the advantage it provides to an economic agent, often measured in terms of what people are willing to pay for it.\nEconomic theories of value are frameworks to explain how economic value arises and which factors influence it. Prominent frameworks include the classical labor theory of value and the neo-classical marginal theory of value. The labor theory, initially developed by the economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo, distinguishes between use value\u2014the utility or satisfaction a commodity provides\u2014and exchange value\u2014the proportion at which one commodity can be exchanged with another. It focuses on exchange value, which it says is determined by the amount of labor required to produce the commodity. In its simplest form, it directly correlates exchange value to labor time. For example, if the time needed to hunt a deer is twice the time needed to hunt a beaver then one deer is worth two beavers. The philosopher Karl Marx extended the labor theory of value in various ways. He introduced the concept of surplus value, which goes beyond the time and resources invested to explain how capitalists can profit from the labor of their employees.\nThe marginal theory of value focuses on consumption rather than production. It says that the utility of a commodity is the source of its value. Specifically, it is interested in marginal utility, the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of the commodity. Marginal utility often diminishes if many units have already been consumed, leading to a decrease in the exchange value of commodities that are abundantly available. Both the labor theory and the marginal theory were later challenged by the Sraffian theory of value, which considers diverse forms of production costs, including but not limited to the quantity of labor.\nSociology.\nSociology studies social behavior, relationships, institutions, and society at large. In their analyses and explanations of these phenomena, some sociologists use the concept of values to understand issues like social cohesion and conflict, the norms and practices people follow, and collective action. They usually understand values as subjective attitudes possessed by individuals and shared in social groups. According to this view, values are beliefs or priorities about goals worth pursuing that guide people to act in certain ways. For example, societies that value education may invest substantial resources to ensure high-quality schooling. This subjective conception of values as aspects of individuals and social groups contrasts with the objective conceptions of values more prominent in economics, which understand values as aspects of commodities.\nShared values can help unite people in the pursuit of a common cause, fostering social cohesion. Value differences, by contrast, may divide people into antagonistic groups that promote conflicting projects. Some sociologists employ value research to predict how people will behave. Given the observation that someone values the environment, they may conclude that this person is more likely to recycle or support pro-environmental legislation. One approach to this type of research uses value scales, such as the Rokeach Value Survey and the Schwartz theory of basic human values, to measure the value outlook of individuals and groups.\nAnthropology.\nAnthropology also studies human behavior and societies but does not limit itself to contemporary social structures, extending its focus to humanity both past and present. Similar to sociologists, many anthropologists understand values as social representations of goals worth pursuing. For them, values are embedded in mental structures associated with culture and ideology about what is desirable. A slightly different approach in anthropology focuses on the practical side of values, holding that values are constantly created through human activity.\nAnthropological value theorists use values to compare cultures. They can be employed to examine similarities as universal concerns present in every society. For example, anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn and sociologist Fred Strodtbeck proposed a set of value orientations found in every culture. These orientations are centered on the topics of human nature, human activity, social organization, relation to nature, and a focus on past, present, or future. Values can also be used to analyze differences between cultures and value changes within a culture. Anthropologist Louis Dumont followed this idea, suggesting that the cultural meaning systems in distinct societies differ in their value priorities. He argued that values are ordered hierarchically around a set of paramount values that trump all other values. For example, Dumont analyzed the traditional Indian caste system as a cultural hierarchy based on the value of purity, extending from the pure Brahmins to the \"untouchable\" Dalits.\nThe contrast between individualism and collectivism is an influential topic in cross-cultural value research. Individualism promotes values associated with the autonomy of individuals, such as self-directedness, independence, and the fulfillment of personal goals. Collectivism gives priority to group-related values, like cooperation, conformity, and foregoing personal advantages for the sake of collective benefits. As a rough simplification, it is often suggested that individualism is more prominent in Western cultures, whereas collectivism is more commonly observed in Eastern cultures.\nPsychology.\nAs the study of mental phenomena and behavior, psychology contrasts with sociology and anthropology by focusing more on the perspective of individuals than the broader social and cultural contexts. Psychologists tend to understand values as abstract motivational goals or general principles about what matters. From this perspective, values differ from specific plans and intentions since they are stable evaluative tendencies not bound to concrete situations.\nVarious psychological theories of values establish a close link between an individual's evaluative outlook and their personality. An early theory, formulated by psychologists Philip E. Vernon and Gordon Allport, understands personality as a collection of aspects unified by a coherent value system. It distinguishes between six personality types corresponding to the value spheres of theory, economy, aesthetics, society, politics, and religion. For example, people with theoretical personalities place special importance on the value of knowledge and the discovery of truth. Influenced by Vernon and Allport, psychologist Milton Rokeach conceptualized values as enduring beliefs about what goals and conduct are preferable. He divided values into the categories of instrumental and terminal values. He thought that a central aspect of personality lies in how people prioritize the values within each category. Psychologist Shalom Schwartz refined this approach by linking values to emotion and motivation. He explored how value rankings affect decisions in which the values of different options conflict.\nHistory.\nThe origin of value theory lies in the ancient period, with early reflections on the good life and the ends worth pursuing. Socrates (c.\u2009469\u2013399 BCE) identified the highest good as the right combination of knowledge, pleasure, and virtue, holding that active inquiry is associated with pleasure while knowledge of the Good leads to virtuous action. Plato (c.\u2009428\u2013347 BCE) conceived the Good as a universal and changeless idea. It is the highest form in his theory of forms, acting as the source of all other forms and the foundation of reality and knowledge. Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) saw eudaimonia as the highest good and ultimate goal of human life. He understood eudaimonia as a form of happiness or flourishing achieved through the exercise of virtues in accordance with reason, leading to the full realization of human potential. Epicurus (c.\u2009341\u2013271 BCE) proposed a nuanced egoistic hedonism, stating that personal pleasure is the greatest good while recommending moderation to avoid the negative effects of excessive desires and anxiety about the future. According to the Stoics, a virtuous life following nature and reason is the highest good. They thought that self-mastery and rationality lead to a pleasant equanimity independent of external circumstances. Influenced by Plato, Plotinus (c.\u2009204/5\u2013270 CE) held that the Good is the ultimate principle of reality from which everything emanates. For him, evil is not a distinct opposing principle but merely a deficiency or absence of being resulting from a missing connection to the Good.\nIn ancient Indian philosophy, the idea that people are trapped in a cycle of rebirths arose around 600 BCE. Many traditions adopted it, arguing that liberation from this cycle is the highest good. Hindu philosophy distinguishes the four fundamental values of duty, economic wealth, sensory pleasure, and liberation. Many Hindu schools of thought prioritize the value of liberation. A similar outlook is found in ancient Buddhist philosophy, starting between the sixth and the fifth centuries BCE, where the cessation of suffering through the attainment of Nirvana is considered the ultimate goal. In ancient China, Confucius (c.\u2009551\u2013479 BCE) explored the role of self-cultivation in leading a virtuous life, viewing general benevolence towards humanity as the supreme virtue. In comparing the highest virtue to water, Laozi (6th century BCE) emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the natural order of the universe.\nReligious teachings influenced value theory in the medieval period. Early Christian thinkers, such as Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430 CE), adapted the theories of Plato and Plotinus into a religious framework. They identified God as the ultimate source of existence and goodness, seeing evil as a mere lack or privation of good. Drawing on Aristotelianism, Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas (1224\u20131274 CE) said that communion with the divine, achieved through a beatific vision of God, is the highest end of humans. In Arabic\u2013Persian philosophy, Avicenna (980\u20131037 CE) regarded the intellect as the highest human faculty. He thought that a contemplative life prepares humans for the greatest good, which is only attained in the afterlife when humans are free from bodily distractions. In Chinese thought, the early neo-Confucian philosopher Han Yu (768\u2013824 CE) identified the sage as an ideal role model who, through self-cultivation, achieves personal integrity expressed in harmony between theory and action in daily life.\nIn the early modern period, Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) understood values as subjective phenomena that depend on a person's interests and examined mutual interests and benefits as a key principle of political decisions. David Hume (1711\u20131776) agreed with Hobbes's subjectivism, exploring how values differ from objective facts. Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) asserted that the highest good is happiness in proportion to moral virtue. He emphasized the primacy of virtue by respecting the moral law and the inherent value of people, adding that moral virtue is ideally, but not always, accompanied by personal happiness. Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832) and John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) formulated classical utilitarianism, combining a hedonist theory about value with a consequentialist theory about right action. Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) developed a philosophy of values, holding that values make the world meaningful as an ordered whole centered around goodness. Influenced by Lotze, the neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) understood philosophy as a theory of values, claiming that universal values determine the principles that all subjects should follow, including the norms of knowledge and action. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) held that values are human creations. He criticized traditional values in general and Christian values in particular, calling for a revaluation of all values centered on life-affirmation, power, and excellence.\nIn the early 20th century, Pragmatist philosopher John Dewey (1859\u20131952) defended axiological naturalism. He distinguished values from value judgments, adding that the skill of correct value assessment must be learned through experience. G. E. Moore (1873\u20131958) developed and refined various axiological concepts, such as organic unity and the contrast between intrinsic and extrinsic value. He defended non-naturalism about the nature of values and intuitionism about the knowledge of values. W. D. Ross (1877\u20131971) accepted and further elaborated on Moore's intuitionism, using it to formulate an axiological pluralism. R. B. Perry (1876\u20131957) and D. W. Prall (1886\u20131940) articulated systematic theories of value based on the idea that values originate in affective states such as interest and liking. Robert S. Hartman (1910\u20131973) developed formal axiology, saying that values measure the level to which a thing embodies its ideal concept. A. J. Ayer (1910\u20131989) proposed anti-realism about values, arguing that value statements merely express the speaker's approval or disapproval. A different type of anti-realism, introduced by J. L. Mackie (1917\u20131981), suggests that all value assertions are false since no values exist. G. H. von Wright (1916\u20132003) provided a conceptual analysis of the term \"good\" by distinguishing different meanings or varieties of goodness, such as the technical goodness of a good driver and the hedonic goodness of a good meal.\nIn continental philosophy, Franz Brentano (1838\u20131917) formulated an early version of the fitting-attitude theory of value, saying that a thing is good if it is fitting to have a positive attitude towards it, such as love. In the 1890s, his students Alexius Meinong (1853\u20131920) and Christian von Ehrenfels (1859\u20131932) conceived the idea of a general theory of values. Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938), another of Brentano's students, developed phenomenology and applied this approach to the study of values. Following Husserl's approach, Max Scheler (1874\u20131928) and Nicolai Hartmann (1882\u20131950) each proposed a comprehensive system of axiological ethics. Asserting that values have objective reality, they explored how different value types form a hierarchy and examined the problems of value conflicts and right decisions from this hierarchical perspective. Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) criticized value theory, claiming that it rests on a mistaken metaphysical perspective by understanding values as aspects of things. Existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980) suggested that values do not exist by themselves but are actively created, emphasizing the role of human freedom, responsibility, and authenticity in the process.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In European folklore, vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.\nVampiric entities have been recorded in cultures around the world, but the term \"vampire\" was first popularized in Western Europe following reports of an 18th-century mass hysteria drawing on a pre-existing folk belief in Southeastern and Eastern Europe. This delusion led, in certain cases, not only to individuals being accused of vampirism, but also to the corpses of such suspected vampires being pierced with stakes.\nLocal variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as \"shtriga\" in Albania, \"vrykolakas\" in Greece and \"strigoi\" in Romania, cognate with Italian \"strega\", meaning 'witch'.\nIn modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the \"chupacabra\") still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.\nThe charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of \"The Vampyre\" by the English writer John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel \"Dracula\" is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 novel \"Carmilla\". The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.\nEtymology and word distribution.\nThe exact etymology is unclear. The term \"vampire\" finds its earliest records in English, Latin and French, and references to vampirism were found in Russia, Poland and North Macedonia. The English term was derived (possibly via French ) from the German , in turn derived in the early 18th century from the Serbian (). Despite this being a popular explanation, it may be noted that a pagan worship of \"upyri\" was already attested in Old Russian in the 11\u201313th century. Some claim an origin from Lithuanian. Oxford and others maintain a Turkish origin (from Turkish \"uber,\" meaning \"witch\"), which passed to English via Hungarian and French derivation. It is, however, almost universally accepted that the modern word \"Vampire\" is derived from the Old Slavic languages form \"\u043e\u043d\u043f\u044b\u0440 (onpyr)\", with the addition of the \"v\" sound in front of the large nasal vowel (on), characteristic of Old Bulgarian. Parallels are found in virtually all Slavic and Turkic languages: Bulgarian and Macedonian (), Turkish: , Tatar language: (), Chuvash language: (), Bosnian: (), Croatian , Czech and Slovak , Polish , and (perhaps East Slavic-influenced) , Ukrainian (), Russian (), Belarusian (), from Old East Slavic () (many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as \"vampir/wampir\" subsequently from the West; these are distinct from the original local words for the creature). In Albanian the words and are used; the latter seems to be derived from the Gheg Albanian words 'tooth' and 'to drink'. The origin of the modern word Vampire (Upi\u00f3r means Hortdan, Vampire or witch in Turkic and Slavic myths.) comes from the term Ubir-Upi\u00f3r, the origin of the word Ubir or Upi\u00f3r is based on the regions around the Volga (Itil) River and Pontic steppes. Upi\u00f3r myth is through the migrations of the Kipchak-Cuman people to the Eurasian steppes allegedly spread. The Bulgarian format is \u0432\u043f\u0438\u0440 (vpir, other names: onpyr, vopir, vpir, upir, upierz).\nCzech linguist V\u00e1clav Machek proposes Slovak verb 'stick to, thrust into', or its hypothetical anagram (in Czech, the archaic verb means 'to thrust violently') as an etymological background, and thus translates as 'someone who thrusts, bites'. The term was introduced to German readers by the Polish Jesuit priest Gabriel Rz\u0105czy\u0144ski in 1721.\nThe word \"vampire\" (as \"vampyre\") first appeared in English in 1732, in news reports about vampire \"epidemics\" in eastern Europe. After Austria gained control of northern Serbia and Oltenia with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, officials noted the local practice of exhuming bodies and \"killing vampires\". These reports, prepared between 1725 and 1732, received widespread publicity.\nFolk beliefs.\nThe notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, Ancient Greeks, Manipuri and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampiric creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe, when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.\nDescription and common attributes.\nIt is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood, which was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin, and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Chewing sounds were reported emanating from graves.\nCreating vampires.\nThe causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.\nIn Albanian folklore, the dhampir is the hybrid child of the (a lycanthropic creature with an iron mail shirt) or the (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a \"karkanxholl\" has the unique ability to discern the \"karkanxholl\"; from this derives the expression \"the dhampir knows the lugat\". The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who themself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. is also an Albanian surname.\nPrevention.\nCultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles, near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse's mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld. The coin may have also been intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the \"vrykolakas\", in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription \"Jesus Christ conquers\" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.\nOther methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampiric being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.\nIdentifying vampires.\nMany rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion\u2014the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question. Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.\nCorpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-styled activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.\nProtection.\nApotropaics\u2014items able to ward off revenants\u2014are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example; a branch of wild rose and hawthorn are sometimes associated with causing harm to vampires, and in Europe, mustard seeds would be sprinkled on the roof of a house to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, such as crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Some folklore also states that vampires are unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.\nAlthough not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic, mirrors have been used to ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul or their weakness to silver). This attribute is not universal (the Greek \"vrykolakas/tympanios\" was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in \"Dracula\" and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.\nSome traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please. Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight.\nReports in 1693 and 1694 concerning citings of vampires in Poland and Russia claimed that when a vampire's grave was recognized, eating bread baked with its blood mixed into the flour, or simply drinking it, granted the possibility of protection. Other stories (primarily the Arnold Paole case) claimed the eating of dirt from the vampire's grave would have the same effect.\nMethods of destruction.\nMethods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in South Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, with a record of oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia. Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of \"deflating\" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of \"anti-vampire burial\": burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.\nDecapitation was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.\nRomani people drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near Venice, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006. In Bulgaria, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as plough bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.\nFurther measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In Southeastern Europe, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.\nAncient beliefs.\nTales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. The term \"vampire\" did not exist in ancient times. Blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every culture associates blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India tales of vet\u0101las, ghoulish beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the \"Bait\u0101l Pac\u012bs\u012b\"; a prominent story in the \"Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara\" tells of King Vikram\u0101ditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. \"Pi\u015b\u0101ca\", the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.\nThe Persians were one of the first civilizations to have tales of blood-drinking demons: creatures attempting to drink blood from men were depicted on excavated pottery shards. Ancient Babylonia and Assyria had tales of the mythical Lilitu, synonymous with and giving rise to Lilith (Hebrew \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea) and her daughters the Lilu from Hebrew demonology. Lilitu was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies, and estries, female shapeshifting, blood-drinking demons, were said to roam the night among the population, seeking victims. According to \"Sefer Hasidim\", estries were creatures created in the twilight hours before . An injured estrie could be healed by eating bread and salt given to her by her attacker.\nGreco-Roman mythology described the Empusae, the Lamia, the Mormo and the striges. Over time the first two terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa was the daughter of the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the \"gelloudes\" or Gello. Like the Lamia, the \"striges\" feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as \"strix\", a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.\nIn Turkic mythology, an \"ub\u0131r\" is a vampiric creature characterized by various regional depictions. According to legends, individuals heavily steeped in sin and practitioners of black magic transform into ub\u0131rs upon their death, taking on a bestial form within their graves. Ub\u0131rs possess the ability to shape-shift, assuming the forms of both humans and various animals. Furthermore, they can seize the soul of a living being and exert control over its body. Someone inhabited by a vampire constantly experiences hunger, becoming increasingly aggressive when unable to find sustenance, ultimately resorting to drinking human blood.\nMedieval and later European folklore.\nMany myths surrounding vampires originated during the medieval period. With the arrival of Christianity in Greece, and other parts of Europe, the vampire \"began to take on decidedly Christian characteristics.\" As various regions of the continent converted to Christianity, the vampire was viewed as \"a dead person who retained a semblance of life and could leave its grave-much in the same way that Jesus had risen after His death and burial and appeared before His followers.\" In the Middle Ages, the Christian Churches reinterpreted vampires from their previous folk existence into minions of Satan, and used an allegory to communicate a doctrine to Christians: \"Just as a vampire takes a sinner's very spirit into itself by drinking his blood, so also can a righteous Christian by drinking Christ's blood take the divine spirit into himself.\" The interpretation of vampires under the Christian Churches established connotations that are still associated in the vampire genre today. For example, the \"ability of the cross to hurt and ward off vampires is distinctly due to its Christian association.\"\nThe 12th-century British historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse \"draugr\" is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampiric beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event to the lack of a \"shmirah\" (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.\nIn 1645, the Greek librarian of the Vatican, Leo Allatius, produced the first methodological description of the Balkan beliefs in vampires (Greek: vrykolakas) in his work \"De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus\" (\"On certain modern opinions among the Greeks\"). Vampires properly originating in folklore were widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularized. An early recording of the time came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia, in 1672; Local reports described a panic among the villagers inspired by the belief that Jure Grando had become a vampire after dying in 1656, drinking blood from victims and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart. Later, his corpse was also beheaded.\nFrom 1679, Philippe Rohr devotes an essay to the dead who chew their shrouds in their graves, a subject resumed by Otto in 1732, and then by Michael Ranft in 1734. The subject was based on the observation that when digging up graves, it was discovered that some corpses had at some point either devoured the interior fabric of their coffin or their own limbs. Ranft described in his treatise of a tradition in some parts of Germany, that to prevent the dead from masticating they placed a mound of dirt under their chin in the coffin, placed a piece of money and a stone in the mouth, or tied a handkerchief tightly around the throat. In 1732 an anonymous writer writing as \"the doctor Weimar\" discusses the non-putrefaction of these creatures, from a theological point of view. In 1733, Johann Christoph Harenberg wrote a general treatise on vampirism and the Marquis d'Argens cites local cases. Theologians and clergymen also address the topic.\nSome theological disputes arose. The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Indeed, vampires were traditionally considered highly problematic within Christianity, as their apparent immortal existence ran against the Christian belief that all true believers may look forward to an eternal existence with body and soul as they were resurrected, but only at the end of time when Jesus returns to judge the living and the dead. Those who are resurrected as immortal before this are thus in no way part of the divine plan of salvation. The imperfect state of the vampire body and how they, in spite of their immortal nature, still needed to feed of the blood of the living, further reflected the problematic aspect of the vampires. Contrary to how the incorruptible saints foreshadowed the immortality promised all true Christians at the end of time, the immortality of the undead vampires was thus not a sign of salvation, but of perdition. The unholy dimension of vampirism may also be reflected in how, in parts of Russia, the very word heretic, \"eretik\", was synonymous with a vampire. Whoever denied God or his commandments became an \"eretik\" after his death, the improperly immortal figure that wandered the night in search of people to feed on. A paragraph on vampires was included in the second edition (1749) of \"De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione\", On the beatification of the servants of God and on canonization of the blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini (Pope Benedict XIV). In his opinion, while the incorruption of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of \"imagination, terror and fear\". In other words, vampires did not exist.\n18th-century vampire controversy.\nIn the early 18th century, despite the decline of many popular folkloric beliefs during the Age of Enlightenment, there was a dramatic increase in the popular belief in vampires, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout much of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. The first infamous vampire case involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevi\u0107 from Serbia. Blagojevi\u0107 was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevi\u0107 supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.\nIn the second case, Milo\u0161 \u010ce\u010dar, an ex-soldier-turned-farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area; it was widely believed that Milo\u0161 had returned to prey on the neighbours.\nThe Blagojevi\u0107 and \u010ce\u010dar incidents were well-documented. Government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-called vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires.\nThe hysteria, commonly referred to as the \"vampire controversy,\" continued for a generation. At least sixteen contemporary treatises discussed the theological and philosophical implications of the vampire epidemic.\nDom Augustine Calmet, a French theologian and scholar, published a comprehensive treatise in 1751 titled \"Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants\" which investigated and analysed the evidence for vampirism. Numerous readers, including both Voltaire (critical) and numerous demonologists (supportive), interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.\nThe controversy in Austria ceased when Empress Maria Theresa sent her personal physician, Gerard van Swieten, to investigate the claims of vampiric entities. Van Swieten concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and the desecration of bodies, thus ending the vampire epidemic. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local folklore.\nNon-European beliefs.\nBeings having many of the attributes of European vampires appear in the folklore of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.\nAfrica.\nVarious regions of Africa have folktales featuring beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling \"asanbosam\", and the Ewe people of the \"adze,\" which can take the form of a firefly and hunts children. The eastern Cape region has the \"impundulu,\" which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the \"ramanga\", an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles. In colonial East Africa, rumors circulated to the effect that employees of the state such as firemen and nurses were vampires, known in Swahili as \"wazimamoto\".\nAmericas.\nThe \"Rougarou\" is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo. The term \"Rougarou\" possibly comes from the French (meaning \"werewolf\") and is common in the culture of Mauritius. The stories of the \"Rougarou\" are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States. Similar female monsters are the \"Soucouyant\" of Trinidad, and the \"Tunda\" and \"Patasola\" of Colombian folklore, while the Mapuche of southern Chile have the bloodsucking snake known as the \"Peuchen\". \"Aloe vera\" hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American folklore. Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo, skull-faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.\nDuring the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was widespread in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term \"vampire\" was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or \"consumption\" as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island, in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.\nSarah Roberts (1872\u20131913) was an Englishwoman who died and was buried in Pisco, Peru. After her death, a legend evolved that she was a vampire and bride of Dracula. On June 9, 1993, the 80th anniversary of her death, locals in Pisco feared she would come back to life and take her revenge.\nAsia.\nVampires have appeared in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampiric beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. There are two main vampiric creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog \"Mandurugo\" (\"blood-sucker\") and the Visayan \"Manananggal\" (\"self-segmenter\"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, threadlike tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim. The \"manananggal\" is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge batlike wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people.\nThe Malaysian \"Penanggalan\" is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung \"jeruju\" (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the \"Penanggalan\" would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A \"Kuntilanak\" or \"Matianak\" in Indonesia, or \"Pontianak\" or \"Langsuir\" in Malaysia, is a woman who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming \"langsuir.\" This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.\nIn Vietnam, the word used to translate Western vampires, \"ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng\", originally referred to a type of demon that haunts modern-day Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd Province, within the communities of the Tai Dam ethnic minority. The word was first mentioned in the chronicles of 18th-century Confucian scholar L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n, who spoke of a creature that lives among humans, but stuffs its toes into its nostrils at night and flies by its ears into houses with pregnant women to suck their blood. Having fed on these women, the \"ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng\" then returns to its house and cleans itself by dipping its toes into barrels of sappanwood water. This allows the \"ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng\" to live undetected among humans during the day, before heading out to attack again by night.\nJiangshi, sometimes called \"Chinese vampires\" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence (q\u00ec) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person's soul (\u9b44 \"p\u00f2\") fails to leave the deceased's body. \"Jiangshi\" are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought. This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like \"Encounters of the Spooky Kind\" and \"Mr. Vampire\" were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.\nModern beliefs.\nIn modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic villain. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks swept through Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor Eric Chiwaya, based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires. Fears and violence recurred in late 2017, with 6 people accused of being vampires killed.\nIn early 1970, local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted Highgate Cemetery in London. Amateur vampire hunters flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the \"Highgate Vampire\" and who later claimed to have exorcised and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area. In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in Birmingham, England, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets. Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an urban legend.\nThe \"chupacabra\" (\"goat-sucker\") of Puerto Rico and Mexico is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of domesticated animals, leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The \"chupacabra hysteria\" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s.\nIn Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.\nOrigins of vampire beliefs.\nCommentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs and related mass hysteria. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body's decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.\nPathology.\nDecomposition.\nAuthor Paul Barber stated that belief in vampires resulted from people of pre-industrial societies attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition. People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.\nCorpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look \"plump\", \"well-fed\", and \"ruddy\"\u2014changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the Arnold Paole case, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life. The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity. Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition. The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of flatulence when they passed through the anus. The official reporting on the Petar Blagojevich case speaks of \"other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect\". After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Blagojevich case\u2014the dermis and nail beds emerging underneath were interpreted as \"new skin\" and \"new nails\".\nPremature burial.\nVampire legends may have also been influenced by individuals being buried alive because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and it would appear that they had been \"feeding\". A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies. Another likely cause of disordered tombs is grave robbery.\nDisease.\nFolkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.\nIn 1985, biochemist David Dolphin proposed a link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.\nThe theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.\nJuan G\u00f3mez-Alonso, a neurologist, examined the possible link of rabies with vampire folklore. The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. It can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.\nPsychodynamic theories.\nIn his 1931 treatise \"On the Nightmare\", Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones asserted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.\nIn cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked with the development of morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect may or may not be present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.\nJones linked the innate sexuality of bloodsucking with cannibalism, with a folkloric connection with incubus-like behaviour. He added that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.\nPolitical interpretations.\nThe reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones. The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic \"ancien r\u00e9gime\". In his entry for \"Vampires\" in the \"Dictionnaire philosophique\" (1764), Voltaire notices how the mid-18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now \"there were stock-jobbers, brokers, and men of business, who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight; but they were not dead, though corrupted. These true suckers lived not in cemeteries, but in very agreeable palaces\".\nKarl Marx defined capital as \"dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks\". Werner Herzog, in his \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\", gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist Jonathan Harker, a middle-class solicitor, becomes the next vampire; in this way the capitalist bourgeois becomes the next parasitic class.\nPsychopathology.\nA number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. Serial killers Peter K\u00fcrten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called \"vampires\" in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. In 1932, an unsolved murder case in Stockholm, Sweden, was nicknamed the \"Vampire murder\", because of the circumstances of the victim's death. The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer Elizabeth B\u00e1thory became infamous in later centuries' works, which depicted her bathing in her victims' blood to retain beauty or youth.\nVampire bats.\nAlthough many cultures have stories about them, vampire bats have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore. Vampire bats were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century. There are no vampire bats in Europe, but bats and owls have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits.\nThe three species of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The danger of rabies infection aside, the vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.\nThe literary Dracula transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of \"Dracula\" followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the film, where B\u00e9la Lugosi would transform into a bat. The bat transformation scene was used again by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1943's \"Son of Dracula\".\nIn modern culture.\nThe vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was John Polidori's \"The Vampyre\" (1819), featuring the vampire Lord Ruthven. Lord Ruthven's exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the antihero. The vampire theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as \"Varney the Vampire\" (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.\nOver time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Count Orlok of Murnau's \"Nosferatu\" (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire films and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for the blood of former equals.\nLiterature.\nThe vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as \"The Vampire\" (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, \"Lenore\" (1773) by Gottfried August B\u00fcrger, \"Die Braut von Corinth\" (\"The Bride of Corinth\") (1797) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Robert Southey's \"Thalaba the Destroyer\" (1801), John Stagg's \"The Vampyre\" (1810), Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"The Spectral Horseman\" (1810) (\"Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore\") and \"Ballad\" in \"St. Irvyne\" (1811) about a reanimated corpse, Sister Rosa, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's unfinished \"Christabel\" and Lord Byron's \"The Giaour\".\nByron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires: \"The Vampyre\" (1819). This was in reality authored by Byron's personal physician, John Polidori, who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient, \"Fragment of a Novel\" (1819), also known as \"The Burial: A Fragment\". Byron's own dominating personality, mediated by his lover Lady Caroline Lamb in her unflattering \"roman-a-clef\" \"Glenarvon\" (a Gothic fantasia based on Byron's wild life), was used as a model for Polidori's undead protagonist Lord Ruthven. \"The Vampyre\" was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.\n\"Varney the Vampire\" was a popular mid-Victorian era gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as \"penny dreadfuls\" because of their low price and gruesome contents. Published in book form in 1847, the story runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney. Another important addition to the genre was Sheridan Le Fanu's lesbian vampire story \"Carmilla\" (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampiress Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.\nNo effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.\nDrawing on past works such as \"The Vampyre\" and \"Carmilla\", Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as \"The Land Beyond the Forest\" (1888) by Emily Gerard and other books about Transylvania and vampires. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219, the \"real-life Dracula\", and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as \"Dracula's Guest\".\nThe latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics as well as a renewed interest in the subject in books. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross's \"Barnabas Collins\" series (1966\u201371), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series \"Dark Shadows\". It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular \"Vampire Chronicles\" (1976\u20132003), and Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series (2005\u20132008). In the 2006 Peter Watts's novel \"Blindsight\", vampires are depicted as a subspecies of homo sapiens that predated on humanity until the dawn of civilization. The various supernatural characteristics and abilities traditionally assigned to vampires by folklore are justified on naturalistic and scientific basis.\nFilm and television.\nConsidered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film, television, and gaming industries. Dracula is a major character in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either based on the novel \"Dracula\" or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 silent German Expressionist horror film \"Nosferatu\", directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula\u2014although names and characters were intended to mimic \"Dracula\"'s. Universal's \"Dracula\" (1931), starring B\u00e9la Lugosi as the Count and directed by Tod Browning, was the first talking film to portray Dracula. Both Lugosi's performance and the film overall were influential in the blossoming horror film genre, now able to use sound and special effects much more efficiently than in the Silent Film Era. The influence of this 1931 film lasted throughout the rest of the 20th century and up through the present day. Stephen King, Francis Ford Coppola, Hammer Horror, and Philip Saville each have at one time or another derived inspiration from this film directly either through staging or even through directly quoting the film, particularly how Stoker's line \"Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!\" is delivered by Lugosi; for example Coppola paid homage to this moment with Gary Oldman in his interpretation of the tale in 1992 and King has credited this film as an inspiration for his character Kurt Barlow repeatedly in interviews. It is for these reasons that the film was selected by the US Library of Congress to be in the National Film Registry in 2000.\nThe legend of the vampire continued through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent Hammer Horror series of films, starring Christopher Lee as the Count. The successful 1958 \"Dracula\" starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role. By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as \"Count Yorga, Vampire\" (1970), an African Count in 1972's \"Blacula\", the BBC's \"Count Dracula\" featuring French actor Louis Jourdan as Dracula and Frank Finlay as Abraham Van Helsing, and a Nosferatu-like vampire in 1979's \"Salem's Lot\", and a remake of \"Nosferatu\" itself, titled Nosferatu the Vampyre with Klaus Kinski the same year. Several films featured the characterization of a female, often lesbian, vampire such as Hammer Horror's \"The Vampire Lovers\" (1970), based on \"Carmilla\", though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character.\nThe Gothic soap opera \"Dark Shadows\", on American television from 1966 to 1971, featured the vampire character Barnabas Collins, portrayed by Jonathan Frid, which proved partly responsible for making the series one of the most popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later 1972 television series \"\" revolved around a reporter hunting a vampire on the Las Vegas Strip. Later films showed more diversity in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as Blade in the Marvel Comics' \"Blade\" films and the film \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". \"Buffy\", released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with its adaptation to a series of the same name and its spin-off \"Angel\". Others showed the vampire as a protagonist, such as 1983's \"The Hunger\", 1994's \"Interview with the Vampire\" and its indirect sequel \"Queen of the Damned\", and the 2007 series \"Moonlight\". The 1992 film \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" by Francis Ford Coppola became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.\nThis increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as \"Underworld\" and \"Van Helsing\", the Russian \"Night Watch\" and a TV miniseries remake of \"Salem's Lot\", both from 2004. The series \"Blood Ties\" premiered on Lifetime Television in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, an illegitimate-son-of-Henry-VIII-of-England-turned-vampire, in modern-day Toronto, with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled \"True Blood\", gives a Southern Gothic take on the vampire theme, while taking on the discussion on what the actual existence of vampires would mean to for instance equality before the law and religious beliefs. In 2008 \"Being Human\" premiered in Britain and featured a vampire that shared a flat with a werewolf and a ghost. The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.\nVideo games.\nThe role-playing game \"\" has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as \"embrace\" and \"sire\", appear in contemporary fiction. Popular video games about vampires include \"Castlevania\", which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel \"Dracula\", and \"Legacy of Kain\". The role-playing game \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" features vampires.\nModern vampire subcultures.\n\"Vampire lifestyle\" is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the Goth subculture, who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, horror films, the fiction of Anne Rice, and the styles of Victorian England. Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as \"sanguine vampirism\", and \"psychic vampirism\", or supposed feeding from pranic energy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited texts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32363", "revid": "50914951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32363", "title": "Vostok 1", "text": "First human spaceflight in history\nVostok 1 (, lit.\u2009'East' or 'Orient') was the first spaceflight of the Vostok programme and the first human orbital spaceflight in history. The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 12 April 1961, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, making him the first human to reach orbital velocity around the Earth and to complete a full orbit around the Earth.\nThe orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at altitude.\nBackground.\nThe Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States, the two Cold War superpowers, began just before the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957. Both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly, particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight. The Soviet Union secretly pursued the Vostok programme in competition with the United States' Project Mercury. Vostok launched several precursor uncrewed missions between May 1960 and March 1961, to test and develop the Vostok rocket family and space capsule. These missions had varied degrees of success, but the final two\u2014Korabl-Sputnik 4 and Korabl-Sputnik 5\u2014were complete successes, allowing the first crewed flight.\nPilot.\nThe Vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut. Yuri Gagarin was chosen as the prime pilot of Vostok 1, with Gherman Titov and Grigori Nelyubov as backups. These assignments were formally made on April 8, four days before the mission, but Gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.\nThe final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training, Nikolai Kamanin. In an April 5 diary entry, Kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between Gagarin and Titov. \"The only thing that keeps me from picking [Titov] is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight.\" Kamanin was referring to the second mission, Vostok 2, compared to the relatively short single-orbit mission of Vostok 1. When Gagarin and Titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on April 9, Gagarin was very happy, and Titov was disappointed. On 10 April, this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras, so there would be official footage of the event. This included an acceptance speech by Gagarin. As an indication of the level of secrecy involved, one of the other cosmonaut candidates, Alexei Leonov, later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun.\nPreparations.\nUnlike later Vostok missions, there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead they relied on the network of ground stations, also called Command Points, to communicate with the spacecraft; all of these Command Points were located within the Soviet Union.\nBecause of weight constraints, there was no backup retrorocket engine. The spacecraft carried 13 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed. The provisions included food for Gagarin. As focus was made on food that would not form crumbs, Gagarin was provided with liver meat puree and chocolate sauce, packed in metal toothpaste-style tubes.\nThe letters \"\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420\" were hand-painted onto Gagarin's helmet by engineer Gherman Lebedev during transfer to the launch site. As it had been less than a year since U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down, Lebedev reasoned that without some country identification, there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing.\nAutomatic control.\nThe entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot's manual controls. In an unusual move, a code to unlock the controls was placed in an onboard envelope, for Gagarin's use in case of emergency.278 Prior to the flight, Kamanin and others told Gagarin the code (1-2-5) anyway.\n11 April 1961.\nAt Baikonur Cosmodrome on the morning of 11 April 1961, the Vostok-K rocket, together with the attached \"Vostok 3KA\" space capsule, were transported several kilometers to the launch pad, in a horizontal position. Once they arrived at the launch pad, a quick examination of the booster was conducted by technicians to make sure everything was in order. When no visible problems were found, the booster was erected on LC-1. At 10:00 (Moscow Time), Gagarin and Titov were given a final review of the flight plan. They were informed that launch was scheduled to occur the following day, at 09:07 Moscow Time. This time was chosen so that when the capsule started to fly over Africa, which was when the retrorockets would need to fire for reentry, the solar illumination would be ideal for the orientation system's sensors.273\nAt 18:00, once various physiological readings had been taken, the doctors instructed the cosmonauts not to discuss the upcoming missions. That evening Gagarin and Titov relaxed by listening to music, playing pool, and chatting about their childhoods. At 21:50, both men were offered sleeping pills, to ensure a good night's sleep, but they both declined. Physicians had attached sensors to the cosmonauts, to monitor their condition throughout the night, and they believed that both had slept well. Gagarin's biographers Doran and Bizony say that neither Gagarin nor Titov slept that night. Chief Designer Sergei Korolev did not sleep that night, due to anxiety caused by the imminent spaceflight.273\nGagarin statement before the mission.\nBefore the mission, Gagarin made a statement to the press, addressed to the Soviet Union and to the whole world:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dear friends, both known and unknown to me, fellow countrymen, men and women of all lands and continents!&lt;br&gt;In a few minutes a mighty spaceship will take me into the far-away expanses of the Universe. What can I say to you in these last minutes before the start? I see my whole past life as one wonderful moment. Everything I have experienced and done till now has been in preparation for this moment. You must realise that it is hard to express my feelings now that the test for which we have been training ardently and long is at hand. I don't have to tell you what I felt when it was suggested that I should make this flight, the first in history. Was it joy? No, it was something more than that. Pride? No, it was not just pride. I felt very happy - to be the first in space, to engage in an unprecedented duel with Nature - could one dream of anything greater than that?&lt;br&gt;But then I thought of the tremendous responsibility of being the first to accomplish what generations of people had dreamed of, the first to show man the way into space... Can you think of a task more difficult than the one assigned to me. It is not responsibility to a single person, or dozens of people, or even a collective. It is responsibility to all Soviet people, to all mankind, to its present and its future. And if I am nevertheless venturing on this flight, it is because I am a Communist, because I draw strength from unexampled exploits performed by my compatriots, Soviet men and women. I know that I shall muster all my will power the better to do the job. Realising its importance, I will do all I can to carry out the assignment of the Communist Party and the Soviet people.&lt;br&gt;Am I happy to be starting on a space flight? Of course I am. In all times and all eras man's greatest joy has been to take part in new discoveries.&lt;br&gt;I would like to dedicate this first space flight to the people of communism, a society which our Soviet people are already entering, and which, I am confident, all men on earth will enter.&lt;br&gt;It is a matter of minutes now before the start. I say to you good-bye, dear friends, just as people say to each other when setting out on a long journey. I would like very much to embrace you all - people known and unknown to me, close friends and strangers alike.&lt;br&gt;See you soon!\u2014\u200a\nIn his autobiography, Gagarin recalled that, looking at the spacecraft before start, he was \"seized with an unprecedented rise of all mental strength &lt;...&gt; some extraordinary words were born that I had never used before in everyday speech.\" This was not true; according to historian Asif Siddiqi, Gagarin \"was essentially forced to utter a stream of banalities prepared by anonymous speechwriters\" taped much earlier in Moscow.274\nFlight.\nAt 05:30 Moscow time, on the morning of 12 April 1961, both Gagarin and his backup Titov were woken. They were given breakfast, assisted into their spacesuits, and then were transported to the launch pad. Gagarin entered the \"Vostok 1\" spacecraft, and at 07:10 local time (04:10 UTC), the radio communication system was turned on. Once Gagarin was in the spacecraft, his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera. Launch would not occur for another two hours, and during the time Gagarin chatted with the mission's main CapCom, as well as Chief Designer Sergei Korolev, Nikolai Kamanin, and a few others,274 periodically joking and singing songs. Following a series of tests and checks, about forty minutes after Gagarin entered the spacecraft, its hatch was closed. Gagarin, however, reported that the hatch was not sealed properly, and technicians spent about 15 minutes removing all the screws and sealing the hatch again. According to a 2014 obituary, Vostok's chief designer, Oleg Ivanovsky, personally helped rebolt the hatch. There is some disagreement over whether the hatch was in fact not sealed correctly, as a more recent account stated the indication was false.\nDuring this time Gagarin requested some music to be played over the radio. Korolev was reportedly suffering from chest pains and anxiety, as up to this point the Soviet space launch rate was 50% (12 out of 24 launches had failed). Two Vostoks had failed to reach orbit due to launch vehicle malfunctions and another two malfunctioned in orbit. Korolev was given a pill to calm him down. Gagarin, on the other hand, was described as calm; about half an hour before launch his pulse was recorded at 64 beats per minute.276\nTime in orbit.\nThe automatic orientation system brought Vostok 1 into alignment for retrofire about 1 hour into the flight.\nReentry and landing.\nAt 07:25 UTC, the spacecraft's automatic systems brought it into the required attitude (orientation) for the retrorocket firing, and shortly afterwards, the liquid-fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over the west coast of Africa, near Angola, about uprange of the landing point. The orbit's perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 13 days (the limit of the life support system function) in the event of retrorocket malfunction. However, the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.\nTen seconds after retrofire, commands were sent to separate the Vostok service module from the reentry module (code name \"little ball\" ()), but the equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires. At around 07:35 UTC, the two parts of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong gyrations as Vostok 1 neared Egypt. At this point the wires broke, the two modules separated, and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude. Gagarin telegraphed \"Everything is OK\" despite continuing gyrations; he later reported that he did not want to \"make noise\" as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module). As Gagarin continued his descent, he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 g during reentry. (Gagarin's own report states \"over 10 g\".)\nAt 07:55 UTC, when Vostok 1 was still from the ground, the hatch of the spacecraft was released, and two seconds later Gagarin was ejected. At altitude, the main parachute was deployed from the Vostok spacecraft.\nGagarin's parachute opened almost immediately, and about ten minutes later, at 08:05 UTC, Gagarin landed. Both he and the spacecraft landed via parachute south west of Engels, in the Saratov region at .\nA kolkhoz woman Annihayat Nurskanova and her granddaughter, Rita, observed the strange scene of a figure in a bright orange suit with a large white helmet landing near them by parachute. Gagarin later recalled, \"When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear. I told them, don't be afraid, I am a Soviet citizen like you, who has descended from space and I must find a telephone to call Moscow!\"\nReactions and legacy.\nSoviet reaction.\nGagarin's flight was announced while Gagarin was still in orbit, by Yuri Levitan, the leading Soviet radio personality since the 1930s. Although news of Soviet rocket launches would normally be aired only after the fact, Sergei Korolev wrote a note to the Party Central Committee to convince them that the announcement should be made as early as possible:\n\"We consider it advisable to publish the first TASS report immediately after the satellite-spacecraft enters orbit, for the following reasons:\n(a) if a rescue becomes necessary, it will facilitate rapid organization of a rescue;\n(b) it precludes any foreign government declaring that the cosmonaut is a military scout.\"\nThe flight was celebrated as a great triumph of Soviet science and technology, demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was comparable to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. He also became an international celebrity, receiving numerous awards and honours.\nApril 12 was declared Cosmonautics Day in the USSR, and is celebrated today in Russia as one of the official \"Commemorative Dates of Russia.\" In 2011, it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.\nGagarin's informal reply \"Poyekhali!\" (\"Let's go!\") became a historical phrase used to refer to the arrival of the Space Age in human history. Later it was included in the refrain of a Soviet song Do You Know What Kind of Guy He Was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov (\"He said \"Let's go!\" He waved his hand\") which was dedicated to the memory of Gagarin.\nAmerican reaction.\nOfficially, the U.S. congratulated the Soviet Union on its accomplishments. Writing for \"The New York Times\" shortly after the flight, however, journalist Arthur Krock described mixed feelings in the United States due to fears of the spaceflight's potential military implications for the Cold War, and the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that \"the people of Washington, London, Paris and all points between might have been dancing in the streets\" if it were not for \"doubts and suspicions\" about Soviet intentions. Other US writers were concerned that the spaceflight had gained a propaganda victory on behalf of communism. President John F. Kennedy was quoted as saying that it would be \"some time\" before the US could match the Soviet launch vehicle technology, and that \"the news will be worse before it's better.\" Kennedy also sent congratulations to the Soviet Union for their \"outstanding technical achievement.\" Opinion pages of many US newspapers urged renewed efforts to overtake the Soviet scientific accomplishments.\nAdlai Stevenson, then the US ambassador to the United Nations, was quoted as saying, \"Now that the Soviet scientists have put a man into space and brought him back alive, I hope they will also help to bring the United Nations back alive,\" and on a more serious note urged international agreements covering the use of space (which did not occur until the Outer Space Treaty of 1967).\nAstronaut Alan Shepard, who was originally scheduled to become the first person in space but had his mission delayed six times due to preparatory work, was infuriated by the news and slammed his fist down on a table.\nOther world reactions.\nPrime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India praised the Soviet Union for \"a great victory of man over the forces of nature\" and urged that it be \"considered as a victory for peace.\" \"The Economist\" voiced worries that orbital platforms might be used for surprise nuclear attacks. The \"Svenska Dagbladet\" in Sweden chided \"free countries\" for \"splitting up and frittering away\" their resources, while West Germany's \"Die Welt\" argued that America had the resources to have sent a man into space first but was beaten by Soviet purposefulness.

The Soviet Union did not admit until 1971 that Gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the Vostok descent module.283 Gagarin's spaceflight records were nonetheless certified and reaffirmed by the FAI, which revised its rules, and acknowledged that the crucial steps of the safe launch, orbit, and return of the pilot had been accomplished.

{"id": "32369", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32369", "title": "Vagueness", "text": "Property of predicates in linguistics and philosophy\nIn linguistics and philosophy, a vague predicate is one which gives rise to borderline cases. For example, the English adjective \"tall\" is vague since it is not clearly true or false for someone of middling height. By contrast, the word \"prime\" is not vague since every number is definitively either prime or not. Vagueness is commonly diagnosed by a predicate's ability to give rise to the sorites paradox. Vagueness is separate from ambiguity, in which an expression has multiple denotations. For instance the word \"bank\" is ambiguous since it can refer either to a river bank or to a financial institution, but there are no borderline cases between both interpretations.\nVagueness is a major topic of research in philosophical logic, where it serves as a potential challenge to classical logic. Work in formal semantics has sought to provide a compositional semantics for vague expressions in natural language. Work in philosophy of language has addressed implications of vagueness for the theory of meaning, while metaphysicists have considered whether reality itself is vague.\nImportance.\nThe concept of vagueness has philosophical importance. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of \"right\" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances precising definitions.\nIn law.\nVagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases, judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept. Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc. Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as biological sex can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from transsexuals' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see intersex).\nIn the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations. The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be \"void for vagueness\" and unenforceable. This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid \"explicit\" or \"objectionable\" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.\nIn science.\nMany scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance species in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as ring species. Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases. As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is \"vague\" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding huskies and wolves: are they dogs? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.\nApproaches.\nThe philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is\u2014which is closely related to the problem of the paradox of the heap, a.k.a. sorites paradox\u2014has been the subject of much philosophical debate.\nFuzzy logic.\nOne theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between \"perfect falsity\", for example, the statement \"Bill Clinton is bald\", to \"perfect truth\", for, say, \"Patrick Stewart is bald\". In ordinary logics, there are only two truth-values: \"true\" and \"false\". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing \"an infinite number of truth-values\" along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by \"1\", and perfect falsity by \"0\". Borderline cases are thought of as having a \"truth-value\" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) and Dorothy Edgington (1993).\nSupervaluationism.\nAnother theoretical approach is known as \"supervaluationism\". This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of \"truth value gaps\". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be \"made precise\" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.\nGiven a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate \"supertrue\" as meaning \"true on all precisifications\". This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. \"Frank is bald\", where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the tautologies of sentential logic, such as \"Frank is bald or Frank is not bald\", will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either \"Frank is bald\" or \"Frank is not bald\" will be true. Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can \"rescue\" them is seen as a virtue.\nSubvaluationism.\nSubvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or \"true on at least some precisifications\".\nSubvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has \"truth-value gluts\". According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon. Of a borderline case of \"bald man\" it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.\nEpistemicist view.\nA fourth approach, known as \"the epistemicist view\", has been defended by Timothy Williamson (1994), R. A. Sorensen (1988) and (2001), and Nicholas Rescher (2009). They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is due to one's ignorance. For example, in the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old; some people are ignorant of this fact.\nAs a property of objects.\nOne possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague. Consider Peter Unger's example of a cloud (from his famous 1980 paper, \"The Problem of the Many\"): it is not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it is part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one will not know how to answer. Hence, perhaps such a term as 'cloud' is not itself vague, but rather precisely denotes a vague \"object.\" \nThis strategy has occasionally been poorly received; most notably, in Gareth Evans' short paper \"Can There Be Vague Objects?\" (1978), wherein an argument is examined which appears to show that vague identity-statements are impossible (i.e., result in logical incoherence). David Lewis explains that the reader is intended to conclude, with Evans, that\u2014since there clearly \"are,\" in fact, meaningful vague identities\u2014any purported proof to the contrary cannot be right; and as the proof relies upon the premise that vague terms precisely denote vague objects, but fails under the view that vague terms reflect a merely semantic indeterminacy, it follows that vagueness cannot be a property of objects themselves.\nStill, by\u2014for instance\u2014proposing alternative deduction rules involving Leibniz's law, \"vel sim.,\" some philosophers are willing to defend ontological vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon; for example, Peter van Inwagen (1990), Trenton Merricks, and Terence Parsons (2000). Others, such as Richard Heck, defend vague objects as\u2014at least\u2014logically coherent, \"contra\" Evans, by \"biting the bullet\" and accepting that identity-statements involving vague objects are unsatisfiable, but denying that this therefore means that the same objects admit of any definite identity-statement.\nEssence and functioning.\nVagueness is primarily a filter of natural human cognition, other tasks of vagueness are derived from that, and they are secondary. The ability to cognition is the basic natural equipment of human (and other creatures) allowing him to orient and survive in the real (material) world. The task of cognition is to obtain from the epistemologically incalculable (immensely vast and deep) reality to a human its cognitive (knowledge) model, containing an only finite amount of information. For this purpose, there must be a filter performing selection and thus reduction of information. It is the vagueness with which man perceive and then remember information about the real (material) world. Some information gained with less vagueness, others with greater one, according to the distance from the center (focus) of attention occupied by man during his act of cognition. Human is unable to acquire information other than vague one by his natural vague cognition. It is necessary to distinguish the internal cognitive model, i.e. the intrapsychic, stored and processed in human consciousness (and probably also in the unconscious), in hypothetical intrapsychic languages: imaginary, emotional and natural and in their mixture, and then the external model, represented in a suitable external language of communication.\nVagueness internal and external.\nCognition and language (Law of maintaining accuracy of information): Communication language should have the same amount of vagueness, as have information gained by cognition (source of the information). That means, language must be tuned to appropriate cognition considering vagueness. This is one of secondary tasks of vagueness.\nA person is able to speak about his inherently vague knowledge (contained in the intrapsychic cognitive model represented in hypothetical intrapsychic languages) in natural (generally informal language, e.g. Esperanto), of course only vaguely. The vagueness of knowledge caused by the \"filter of knowledge\" is primary, we call it internal vagueness (i.e. intrapsychic). The vagueness of a person's subsequent utterance is secondary vagueness. This utterance (transformation from intrapsychic languages to external communicative languages - it is called a \"formulation\", see the semantic triangle) cannot reveal all the content of the personal intrapsychic cognitive model with all its inherent vagueness. The vagueness contained in the linguistic utterance (of external communication language) is called external vagueness.\nLinguistically, only external vagueness can be grasped (modeled). We cannot model internal vagueness; it is part of the intrapsychic model, and this vagueness is contained in (vague, emotional, subjective and variable during time) interpretation of constructs (words, sentences) of informal language. This vagueness is hidden for the other human, he can only guess the amount of it. Informal languages, such as natural language, do not make it possible to distinguish between internal and external vagueness strictly, but only with a vague boundary.\nFortunately, however, informal languages use appropriate language constructs making meaning a little uncertain (e.g. \"indeterminate quantifiers\" POSSIBLY, SEVERAL, MAYBE, etc.). Such quantifiers allow natural language to use external vagueness more strongly and explicitly, thus allowing internal vagueness to be partially shifted up to external vagueness. It is a way to draw the addressee's attention to the vagueness of the message more explicitly and to quantify the vagueness, thus improving understanding in communication using natural language. But the main vagueness of informal languages is the internal vagueness, and the external vagueness serves only as an auxiliary tool.\nFormal languages, mathematics, formal logic, programming languages (in principle, they must have \"zero\" internal vagueness of interpretation of all language constructs, i.e. they have exact interpretation) can model external vagueness by tools of vagueness and uncertainty representation: fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, or by stochastic quantities and stochastic functions, as the exact sciences do. Principle is: If we admit more vagueness (uncertainty), we can gain more information during cognition. See e.g. possibilities of deterministic and stochastic physic. In other cases cognitive model of certain part of real world may be simplified, such a way, that certain amount of deterministic information is possible to replace by fuzzy or stochastic one.\nReducing internal vagueness.\nThe internal vagueness of one person's message is hidden from another person, he can only guess that. We either have to accept internal vagueness, which is human, or we can try to reduce it, or completely eliminate it, which is scientific.\nDemands on the accuracy of the formulation of scientific knowledge and its communication require minimizing the internal vagueness with which one connotes (vaguely, emotionally and subjectively interprets) linguistic constructs of the communication language, and thus improve the accuracy of the message. Various scientific procedures aim to improve the credibility and accuracy of the scientific knowledge obtained.\nTo formulate them, however, it is necessary to build a more precise language, with less (internal) vagueness of message than is common in daily life. This is done by purposefully (branch) constructed terminology allowing to more accurately describe the researched reality and the acquired knowledge about it. People properly educated in the field of terminology know it with little internal vagueness, so they know accurately what the individual terms mean. Basic concepts are always formed on the basis of consensus, the other derived from them by definition, to avoid to Circular definition. To improve the accuracy of research and communication (reducing the internal vagueness of connotation), tools such as classification schemes are used, such as the taxonomy of organisms by Carl von Linn\u00e9.\nThis is how descriptive (non-exact) sciences do it. Thus, they use natural human cognition (with the Russell\u2019s filter of vagueness) and refined natural language.\nThere is another continuation of the reduction of internal vagueness. The method of reducing internal vagueness to the extreme, that is zero, was realized by I. Newton. It is an epochal idea, and it needs to be explained how it can be realized.\nIt follows from the above-mentioned Law of maintaining accuracy of information (optimization of the truthfulness of the message) saying, if we require to eliminate the internal vagueness in the knowledge completely (to zero) then of course it must first be completely eliminated in cognition (the source of information). This means that one (Newton) must avoid the intrusion of internal vagueness, that is, to choose some filter of cognition other than vagueness. Thus we pass from the natural human world to the artificial one. We call it the exact world and we will explain why.\nIn the case of natural language, it is not possible to completely remove (nullify) the internal vagueness, but it is possible to build artificial formal languages (mathematics, formal logics, programming languages) that have zero internal vagueness of connotation (so they have an exact interpretation) and cannot have another in principle. (Newton for this purpose has created formal language \u2013 theory of flux - theory of flowing \u2013 infinitesimal calculus). Languages with zero internal vagueness of their interpretation, i.e. the meaning of their linguistic constructions, have the property that all these constructions are understood by every appropriately educated person with absolutely precise, i.e. exact meaning. That is why they are part of the exact world. Thus, we have some language that is able to represent knowledge with zero internal vagueness. But these must first be acquired by adequate cognition, providing cognition also with zero internal vagueness, i.e. also from the exact world. And it is already evident that we are on the way to the creation of the scientific method that creates science belonging to the exact world, that is, an exact science is born.\nIt is still necessary to explain how to realize Newton`s exact cognition, that is, the cognition when the knowledge obtained from the real world is part of the exact world. The miraculous bridge between the real and exact worlds that makes this possible is called a quantity (e.g. electric field intensity, velocity, nitric acid concentration, etc.). It is common to both worlds, because in the exact world it is precisely delineated (every knowing person knows them with no doubts, so exactly), and in the real world it is an elemental measurable probe into that, and thus its elemental measurable representative. The quantity is the elementary building block of exact science. In exact sciences, it is always precisely defined, either consensually (basic set) or the other derived - International System of Units.\nAnd what about the artificial filter that allows Newton to avoid internal vagueness? For every problem of the real world that is to be grasped by Newton\u2019s method of the exact science, it is necessary to choose a group of suitable quantities, find the natural laws that apply in the real world between them, and describe them in mathematical language. We get a mathematical knowledge (cognitive) model of a given part of the real world. A group of selected quantities forms a discrete Newtonian filter (sieve) through which man \u2018\u2019look\u2019\u2019 at a given part of the real world. Thus, in exact science, a given part of the real world is represented by a group of suitably chosen quantities and mathematically (programming language) described relations between them (more precisely between their names \u2013 symbols denoting them).\nExact science \"is a method that allows knowledge about the real world to be acquired and recorded so that it is part of the exact world. That is the method of modeling the real world by means of exact world, in other words, a method to mathematize the science.\"\nEven exact science needs to have a tool, with which it can describe the uncertainty of the results (obtained \u2013 knowledge), whether out of necessity or the need to abandon excessive precision. Since that cannot (must not) be an internal vagueness, it can only use linguistically graspable uncertainty (external vagueness). For this purpose it has for its disposal a description of fuzzy or stochastic values of quantities, and fuzzy or stochastic relations (represented by mathematical functions) between quantities.\nThe difference between the non-exact sciences (called descriptive) and the exact sciences is that the former use natural human cognition (with the Russell\u2019s filter of vagueness) and refined natural language, and the exact sciences use cognition based on the use of Newtonian discrete filter and thus the use of quantities, and artificial formal language. Artificial formal language also brings a powerful tool to exact science, which is formal inference (information formal processing) known from mathematics.\nThe above-mentioned tools of exact and non-exact science are general principles, and different branches of science use them in combination with both. They have their parts exact and inexact. Purely exact sciences, such as theoretical physics or mathematics, use natural language as meta-language.\nExact science provides most trustworthy knowledge. The question can certainly be raised as to whether all science can be transformed into an exact science. The answer is not. The condition for the establishment of an exact science is to find suitable quantities, and this is possible only for a small part of the real world and for specific views of it. In other words, the filter of vagueness makes it possible to vaguely know many; Newton's discrete filter makes it possible to know only little but exactly.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called \"vector axioms\". Real vector spaces and complex vector spaces are kinds of vector spaces based on different kinds of scalars: real numbers and complex numbers. Scalars can also be, more generally, elements of any field.\nVector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities (such as forces and velocity) that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrices, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.\nVector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that for two vector spaces over a given field and with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically, the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is \"finite-dimensional\" if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is \"infinite-dimensional\", and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.\nMany vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures. This is the case of algebras, which include field extensions, polynomial rings, associative algebras and Lie algebras. This is also the case of topological vector spaces, which include function spaces, inner product spaces, normed spaces, Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.\nDefinition and basic properties.\nIn this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.\nA vector space over a field F is a non-empty set\u00a0V together with a binary operation and a binary function that satisfy the eight axioms listed below. In this context, the elements of V are commonly called \"vectors\", and the elements of\u00a0F are called \"scalars\".\nTo have a vector space, the eight following axioms must be satisfied for every u, v and w in V, and a and b in F.\nWhen the scalar field is the real numbers, the vector space is called a \"real vector space\", and when the scalar field is the complex numbers, the vector space is called a \"complex vector space\". These two cases are the most common ones, but vector spaces with scalars in an arbitrary field F are also commonly considered. Such a vector space is called an F-\"vector space\" or a \"vector space over F\".\nAn equivalent definition of a vector space can be given, which is much more concise but less elementary: the first four axioms (related to vector addition) say that a vector space is an abelian group under addition, and the four remaining axioms (related to the scalar multiplication) say that this operation defines a ring homomorphism from the field \"F\" into the endomorphism ring of this group. Specifically, the distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition means that multiplication by a scalar \"a\" is an endomorphism of the group. The remaining three axiom establish that the function that maps a scalar \"a\" to the multiplication by \"a\" is a ring homomorphism from the field to the endomorphism ring of the group.\nSubtraction of two vectors can be defined as\nformula_1\nDirect consequences of the axioms include that, for every formula_2 and formula_3 one has\nEven more concisely, a vector space is a module over a field.\n Given a set G of elements of a F-vector space V, a linear combination of elements of G is an element of V of the form formula_10 where formula_11 and formula_12 The scalars formula_13 are called the \"coefficients\" of the linear combination.\nThe elements of a subset G of a F-vector space V are said to be \"linearly independent\" if no element of G can be written as a linear combination of the other elements of G. Equivalently, they are linearly independent if two linear combinations of elements of G define the same element of V if and only if they have the same coefficients. Also equivalently, they are linearly independent if a linear combination results in the zero vector if and only if all its coefficients are zero.\nA \"linear subspace\" or \"vector subspace\" W of a vector space V is a non-empty subset of V that is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, the sum of two elements of W and the product of an element of W by a scalar belong to W. This implies that every linear combination of elements of W belongs to W. A linear subspace is a vector space for the induced addition and scalar multiplication; this means that the closure property implies that the axioms of a vector space are satisfied.&lt;br&gt;The closure property also implies that \"every intersection of linear subspaces is a linear subspace.\"\nGiven a subset G of a vector space V, the \"linear span\" or simply the \"span\" of G is the smallest linear subspace of V that contains G, in the sense that it is the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain G. The span of G is also the set of all linear combinations of elements of G.&lt;br&gt; If W is the span of G, one says that G \"spans\" or \"generates\" W, and that G is a \"spanning set\" or a \"generating set\" of W.\nA subset of a vector space is a \"basis\" if its elements are linearly independent and span the vector space. Every vector space has at least one basis, or many in general (see ). Moreover, all bases of a vector space have the same cardinality, which is called the \"dimension\" of the vector space (see Dimension theorem for vector spaces). This is a fundamental property of vector spaces, which is detailed in the remainder of the section.\nBases, vector coordinates, and subspaces.\n\"Bases\" are a fundamental tool for the study of vector spaces, especially when the dimension is finite. In the infinite-dimensional case, the existence of infinite bases, often called Hamel bases, depends on the axiom of choice. It follows that, in general, no base can be explicitly described. For example, the real numbers form an infinite-dimensional vector space over the rational numbers, for which no specific basis is known. \nConsider a basis formula_14 of a vector space V of dimension n over a field F. The definition of a basis implies that every formula_15 may be written \nformula_16 \nwith formula_17 in F, and that this decomposition is unique. The scalars formula_18 are called the \"coordinates\" of v on the basis. They are also said to be the \"coefficients\" of the decomposition of v on the basis. One also says that the n-tuple of the coordinates is the coordinate vector of v on the basis, since the set formula_19 of the n-tuples of elements of F is a vector space for componentwise addition and scalar multiplication, whose dimension is n.\nThe one-to-one correspondence between vectors and their coordinate vectors maps vector addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication to scalar multiplication. It is thus a vector space isomorphism, which allows translating reasonings and computations on vectors into reasonings and computations on their coordinates.\nHistory.\nVector spaces stem from affine geometry, via the introduction of coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, French mathematicians Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Pierre de Fermat founded analytic geometry by identifying solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. To achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced, in 1804, certain operations on points, lines, and planes, which are predecessors of vectors. introduced the notion of barycentric coordinates. introduced an equivalence relation on directed line segments that share the same length and direction which he called equipollence. A Euclidean vector is then an equivalence class of that relation. \nVectors were reconsidered with the presentation of complex numbers by Argand and Hamilton and the inception of quaternions by the latter. They are elements in R2 and R4; treating them using linear combinations goes back to Laguerre in 1867, who also defined systems of linear equations.\nIn 1857, Cayley introduced the matrix notation which allows for harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by M\u00f6bius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products are present. Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces as well since his considering multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Italian mathematician Peano was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888, although he called them \"linear systems\". Peano's axiomatization allowed for vector spaces with infinite dimension, but Peano did not develop that theory further. In 1897, Salvatore Pincherle adopted Peano's axioms and made initial inroads into the theory of infinite-dimensional vector spaces. \nAn important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of function spaces by Henri Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of \"p\"-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces.\nExamples.\nArrows in the plane.\nThe first example of a vector space consists of arrows in a fixed plane, starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe forces or velocities. Given any two such arrows, v and w, the parallelogram spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the \"sum\" of the two arrows, and is denoted v + w. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive real number \"a\", the arrow that has the same direction as v, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by \"a\", is called \"multiplication\" of v by \"a\". It is denoted \"av. When \"a\" is negative, \"av is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction instead.\nThe following shows a few examples: if \"a\" = 2, the resulting vector \"a\"w has the same direction as w, but is stretched to the double length of w (the second image). Equivalently, 2w is the sum w + w. Moreover, (\u22121)v = \u2212v has the opposite direction and the same length as v (blue vector pointing down in the second image).\nOrdered pairs of numbers.\nA second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers x and y. The order of the components x and y is significant, so such a pair is also called an ordered pair. Such a pair is written as (\"x\", \"y\"). The sum of two such pairs and the multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:\nformula_20\nThe first example above reduces to this example if an arrow is represented by a pair of Cartesian coordinates of its endpoint.\nCoordinate space.\nThe simplest example of a vector space over a field \"F\" is the field \"F\" itself with its addition viewed as vector addition and its multiplication viewed as scalar multiplication. More generally, all \"n\"-tuples (sequences of length \"n\") \nformula_21\nof elements \"a\"\"i\" of \"F\" form a vector space that is usually denoted \"F\"\"n\" and called a coordinate space. \nThe case \"n\" = 1 is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field \"F\" is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case \"F\" = R and \"n\" = 2 (so R2) reduces to the previous example.\nComplex numbers and other field extensions.\nThe set of complex numbers C, numbers that can be written in the form \"x\" + \"iy\" for real numbers \"x\" and \"y\" where \"i\" is the imaginary unit, form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: (\"x\" + \"iy\") + (\"a\" + \"ib\") = (\"x\" + \"a\") + \"i\"(\"y\" + \"b\") and \"c\" \u22c5 (\"x\" + \"iy\") = (\"c\" \u22c5 \"x\") + \"i\"(\"c\" \u22c5 \"y\") for real numbers \"x\", \"y\", \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\". The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic. The example of complex numbers is essentially the same as (that is, it is \"isomorphic\" to) the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number \"x\" + \"i\" \"y\" as representing the ordered pair (\"x\", \"y\") in the complex plane then we see that the rules for addition and scalar multiplication correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.\nMore generally, field extensions provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and algebraic number theory: a field \"F\" containing a smaller field \"E\" is an \"E\"-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of \"F\". For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over R, and the field extension formula_22 is a vector space over Q. \nFunction spaces.\nFunctions from any fixed set \u03a9 to a field \"F\" also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions \"f\" and \"g\" is the function formula_23 given by\nformula_24\nand similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when \u03a9 is the real line or an interval, or other subsets of R. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as continuity, integrability or differentiability are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property. Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces, whose study belongs to functional analysis.\nLinear equations.\nSystems of homogeneous linear equations are closely tied to vector spaces. For example, the solutions of \nformula_25\nare given by triples with arbitrary formula_26 formula_27 and formula_28 They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. Matrices can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely\nformula_29\nwhere formula_30 is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, formula_31 is the vector formula_32 formula_33 denotes the matrix product, and formula_34 is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous \"linear differential equations\" form vector spaces. For example,\nformula_35\nyields formula_36 where formula_37 and formula_38 are arbitrary constants, and formula_39 is the natural exponential function.\nLinear maps and matrices.\nThe relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by \"linear map\" or \"linear transformation\". They are functions that reflect the vector space structure, that is, they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:\nformula_40 \nfor all formula_41 and formula_42 in formula_43 all formula_37 in formula_45\nAn \"isomorphism\" is a linear map \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"W\" such that there exists an inverse map \"g\" : \"W\" \u2192 \"V\", which is a map such that the two possible compositions \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" : \"W\" \u2192 \"W\" and \"g\" \u2218 \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"V\" are identity maps. Equivalently, \"f\" is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective). If there exists an isomorphism between \"V\" and \"W\", the two spaces are said to be \"isomorphic\"; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in \"V\" are, via \"f\", transported to similar ones in \"W\", and vice versa via \"g\".\nFor example, the arrows in the plane and the ordered pairs of numbers vector spaces in the introduction above (see ) are isomorphic: a planar arrow v departing at the origin of some (fixed) coordinate system can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the \"x\"- and \"y\"-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (\"x\", \"y\"), the arrow going by \"x\" to the right (or to the left, if \"x\" is negative), and \"y\" up (down, if \"y\" is negative) turns back the arrow v.\nLinear maps \"V\" \u2192 \"W\" between two vector spaces form a vector space Hom\"F\"(\"V\", \"W\"), also denoted L(\"V\", \"W\"), or \ud835\udcdb(\"V\", \"W\"). The space of linear maps from \"V\" to \"F\" is called the \"dual vector space\", denoted \"V\"\u2217. Via the injective natural map \"V\" \u2192 \"V\"\u2217\u2217, any vector space can be embedded into its \"bidual\"; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.\nOnce a basis of \"V\" is chosen, linear maps \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"W\" are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of \"V\" is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them. If dim \"V\" = dim \"W\", a 1-to-1 correspondence between fixed bases of \"V\" and \"W\" gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of \"V\" to the corresponding basis element of \"W\". It is an isomorphism, by its very definition. Therefore, two vector spaces over a given field are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space over a given field is \"completely classified\" (up to isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any \"n\"-dimensional \"F\"-vector space \"V\" is isomorphic to \"F\"\"n\". However, there is no \"canonical\" or preferred isomorphism; an isomorphism \"\u03c6\" : \"F\"\"n\" \u2192 \"V\" is equivalent to the choice of a basis of \"V\", by mapping the standard basis of \"F\"\"n\" to \"V\", via \"\u03c6\". \nMatrices.\n\"Matrices\" are a useful notion to encode linear maps. They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any \"m\"-by-\"n\" matrix formula_46 gives rise to a linear map from \"F\"\"n\" to \"F\"\"m\", by the following\nformula_47 \nwhere formula_48 denotes summation, or by using the matrix multiplication of the matrix formula_46 with the coordinate vector formula_31:\nformula_51\nMoreover, after choosing bases of \"V\" and \"W\", \"any\" linear map \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"W\" is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.\nThe determinant det (\"A\") of a square matrix \"A\" is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero. The linear transformation of R\"n\" corresponding to a real \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrix is orientation preserving if and only if its determinant is positive.\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nEndomorphisms, linear maps \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"V\", are particularly important since in this case vectors v can be compared with their image under \"f\", \"f\"(v). Any nonzero vector v satisfying \"\u03bb\"v = \"f\"(v), where \"\u03bb\" is a scalar, is called an \"eigenvector\" of \"f\" with \"eigenvalue\" \"\u03bb\". Equivalently, v is an element of the kernel of the difference \"f\" \u2212 \"\u03bb\" \u00b7 Id (where Id is the identity map \"V\" \u2192 \"V\"). If \"V\" is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: \"f\" having eigenvalue \"\u03bb\" is equivalent to\nformula_52\nBy spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in \"\u03bb\", called the characteristic polynomial of \"f\". If the field \"F\" is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for \"F\" algebraically closed, such as \"F\" = C) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space \"V\" may or may not possess an eigenbasis, a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the Jordan canonical form of the map. The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of \"f\" forms a vector space known as the \"eigenspace\" corresponding to the eigenvalue (and \"f\") in question.\nBasic constructions.\nIn addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. \nSubspaces and quotient spaces.\nA nonempty subset formula_53 of a vector space formula_54 that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the formula_55-vector of formula_54) is called a \"linear subspace\" of formula_57, or simply a \"subspace\" of formula_57, when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space. Subspaces of formula_54 are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set formula_60 of vectors is called its span, and it is the smallest subspace of formula_54 containing the set formula_60. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of formula_60.\nLinear subspace of dimension 1 and 2 are referred to as a \"line\" (also \"vector line\"), and a \"plane\" respectively. If \"W\" is an \"n\"-dimensional vector space, any subspace of dimension 1 less, i.e., of dimension formula_64 is called a \"hyperplane\".\nThe counterpart to subspaces are \"quotient vector spaces\". Given any subspace formula_65, the quotient space formula_66 (\"formula_54 modulo formula_53\") is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of\nformula_69\nwhere formula_41 is an arbitrary vector in formula_54. The sum of two such elements formula_72 and formula_73 is formula_74, and scalar multiplication is given by formula_75. The key point in this definition is that formula_76 if and only if the difference of formula_77 and formula_78 lies in formula_53. This way, the quotient space \"forgets\" information that is contained in the subspace formula_53.\nThe kernel formula_81 of a linear map formula_82 consists of vectors formula_41 that are mapped to formula_55 in formula_53. The kernel and the image formula_86 are subspaces of formula_54 and formula_53, respectively. \nAn important example is the kernel of a linear map formula_89 for some fixed matrix formula_46. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors formula_31 such that formula_92, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to formula_46. This concept also extends to linear differential equations\nformula_94\nwhere the coefficients formula_95 are functions in formula_96 too.\nIn the corresponding map\nformula_97\nthe derivatives of the function formula_98 appear linearly (as opposed to formula_99, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (that is, formula_100 and formula_101 for a constant formula_102) this assignment is linear, called a linear differential operator. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation formula_103 form a vector space (over R or C).\nThe existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the category of vector spaces (over a fixed field formula_104) is an abelian category, that is, a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a category) that behaves much like the category of abelian groups. Because of this, many statements such as the first isomorphism theorem (also called rank\u2013nullity theorem in matrix-related terms)\nformula_105\nand the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for groups.\nDirect product and direct sum.\nThe \"direct product\" of vector spaces and the \"direct sum\" of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.\nThe \"direct product\" formula_106 of a family of vector spaces formula_107 consists of the set of all tuples formula_108, which specify for each index formula_109 in some index set formula_110 an element formula_111 of formula_107. Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the \"direct sum\" formula_113 (also called coproduct and denoted formula_114), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set formula_110 is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.\nTensor product.\nThe \"tensor product\" formula_116 or simply formula_117 of two vector spaces formula_54 and formula_53 is one of the central notions of multilinear algebra which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map formula_120 from the Cartesian product formula_121 is called bilinear if formula_122 is linear in both variables formula_41 and formula_124 That is to say, for fixed formula_42 the map formula_126 is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed formula_127\nThe tensor product is a particular vector space that is a \"universal\" recipient of bilinear maps formula_128 as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called tensors\nformula_129\nsubject to the rules\nformula_130\nThese rules ensure that the map formula_98 from the formula_121 to formula_133 that maps a tuple formula_134 to formula_135 is bilinear. The universality states that given \"any\" vector space formula_136 and \"any\" bilinear map formula_137 there exists a unique map formula_138 shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose composition with formula_98 equals formula_140 formula_141 This is called the universal property of the tensor product, an instance of the method\u2014much used in advanced abstract algebra\u2014to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.\nVector spaces with additional structure.\nFrom the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space over a given field is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces \"per se\" do not offer a framework to deal with the question\u2014crucial to analysis\u2014whether a sequence of functions converges to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with infinite series, since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. Therefore, the needs of functional analysis require considering additional structures.\nA vector space may be given a partial order formula_142 under which some vectors can be compared. For example, formula_143-dimensional real space formula_144 can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. Ordered vector spaces, for example Riesz spaces, are fundamental to Lebesgue integration, which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions\nformula_145\nwhere formula_146 denotes the positive part of formula_98 and formula_148 the negative part.\nNormed vector spaces and inner product spaces.\n\"Measuring\" vectors is done by specifying a norm, a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an inner product, which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted formula_149 and formula_150 respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm \\mathbf v Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as \"normed vector spaces\" and \"inner product spaces\", respectively.\nCoordinate space formula_19 can be equipped with the standard dot product:\nformula_152\nIn formula_153 this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors formula_31 and formula_155 by the law of cosines:\nformula_156\nBecause of this, two vectors satisfying formula_157 are called orthogonal. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in Minkowski space: formula_158 endowed with the Lorentz product\nformula_159\nIn contrast to the standard dot product, it is not positive definite: formula_160 also takes negative values, for example, for formula_161 Singling out the fourth coordinate\u2014corresponding to time, as opposed to three space-dimensions\u2014makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of special relativity. Note that in other conventions time is often written as the first, or \"zeroeth\" component so that the Lorentz product is written formula_162\nTopological vector spaces.\nConvergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces formula_54 carrying a compatible topology, a structure that allows one to talk about elements being close to each other. Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be continuous maps. Roughly, if formula_31 and formula_165 in formula_54, and formula_37 in formula_104 vary by a bounded amount, then so do formula_169 and formula_170 To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field formula_104 also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice is the reals or the complex numbers.\nIn such \"topological vector spaces\" one can consider series of vectors. The infinite sum\nformula_172\ndenotes the limit of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence formula_173 of elements of formula_174 For example, the formula_175 could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some function space formula_43 in which case the series is a function series. The mode of convergence of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, pointwise convergence and uniform convergence are two prominent examples.\nA way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any Cauchy sequence has a limit; such a vector space is called complete. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval formula_177 equipped with the topology of uniform convergence is not complete because any continuous function on formula_178 can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem. In contrast, the space of \"all\" continuous functions on formula_178 with the same topology is complete. A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors formula_180 converges to formula_41 if and only if\nformula_182\nBanach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study\u2014a key piece of functional analysis\u2014focuses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence. The image at the right shows the equivalence of the formula_183-norm and formula_184-norm on formula_185 as the unit \"balls\" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.\nFrom a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called functionals) formula_186 maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous. In particular, the (topological) dual space formula_187 consists of continuous functionals formula_188 (or to formula_189). The fundamental Hahn\u2013Banach theorem is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.\nBanach spaces.\n\"Banach spaces\", introduced by Stefan Banach, are complete normed vector spaces.\nA first example is the vector space formula_190 consisting of infinite vectors with real entries formula_191\nwhose formula_192-norm formula_193 given by \nformula_194\nformula_195\nThe topologies on the infinite-dimensional space formula_190 are inequivalent for different formula_197 For example, the sequence of vectors formula_198 in which the first formula_199 components are formula_200 and the following ones are formula_201 converges to the zero vector for formula_202 but does not for formula_203\nformula_204 \nbut \nformula_205\nMore generally than sequences of real numbers, functions formula_206 are endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the Lebesgue integral \nformula_207\nThe space of integrable functions on a given domain formula_208 (for example an interval) satisfying formula_209 and equipped with this norm are called Lebesgue spaces, denoted formula_210\nThese spaces are complete. (If one uses the Riemann integral instead, the space is not complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory.) Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions formula_211 with formula_212 satisfying the condition\nformula_213\nthere exists a function formula_214 belonging to the vector space formula_215 such that\nformula_216\nImposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its derivatives leads to Sobolev spaces.\nHilbert spaces.\nComplete inner product spaces are known as \"Hilbert spaces\", in honor of David Hilbert. The Hilbert space formula_217 with inner product given by\nformula_218\nwhere formula_219 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_220 is a key case.\nBy definition, in a Hilbert space, any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions formula_221 with desirable properties that approximate a given limit function is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the Taylor approximation, established an approximation of differentiable functions formula_98 by polynomials. By the Stone\u2013Weierstrass theorem, every continuous function on formula_223 can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial. A similar approximation technique by trigonometric functions is commonly called Fourier expansion, and is much applied in engineering. More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what \"basic functions\", or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space formula_224 in the sense that the \"closure\" of their span (that is, finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space. Such a set of functions is called a \"basis\" of formula_224 its cardinality is known as the Hilbert space dimension. Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but also together with the Gram\u2013Schmidt process, it enables one to construct a basis of orthogonal vectors. Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional Euclidean space.\nThe solutions to various differential equations can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations, and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal. As an example from physics, the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a partial differential equation, whose solutions are called wavefunctions. Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to eigenvalues of a certain (linear) differential operator and the associated wavefunctions are called eigenstates. The spectral theorem decomposes a linear compact operator acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.\nAlgebras over fields.\nGeneral vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an \"algebra over a field\" (or \"F\"-algebra if the field \"F\" is specified).\nFor example, the set of all polynomials formula_226 forms an algebra known as the polynomial ring: using that the sum of two polynomials is a polynomial, they form a vector space; they form an algebra since the product of two polynomials is again a polynomial. Rings of polynomials (in several variables) and their quotients form the basis of algebraic geometry, because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects.\nAnother crucial example are \"Lie algebras\", which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints (formula_227 denotes the product of formula_228 and formula_229):\nExamples include the vector space of formula_143-by-formula_143 matrices, with formula_234 the commutator of two matrices, and formula_235 endowed with the cross product.\nThe tensor algebra formula_236 is a formal way of adding products to any vector space formula_54 to obtain an algebra. As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple tensors\nformula_238\nwhere the degree formula_143 varies.\nThe multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the distributive law under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product \u2297, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced in the above section on tensor products. In general, there are no relations between formula_240 and formula_241 Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the symmetric algebra, whereas forcing formula_242 yields the exterior algebra.\nRelated structures.\nVector bundles.\nA \"vector bundle\" is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a topological space \"X\". More precisely, a vector bundle over \"X\" is a topological space \"E\" equipped with a continuous map \nformula_243\nsuch that for every \"x\" in \"X\", the fiber \u03c0\u22121(\"x\") is a vector space. The case dim \"V\" = 1 is called a line bundle. For any vector space \"V\", the projection \"X\" \u00d7 \"V\" \u2192 \"X\" makes the product \"X\" \u00d7 \"V\" into a \"trivial\" vector bundle. Vector bundles over \"X\" are required to be locally a product of \"X\" and some (fixed) vector space \"V\": for every \"x\" in \"X\", there is a neighborhood \"U\" of \"x\" such that the restriction of \u03c0 to \u03c0\u22121(\"U\") is isomorphic to the trivial bundle \"U\" \u00d7 \"V\" \u2192 \"U\". Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space \"X\") be \"twisted\" in the large (that is, the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle \"X\" \u00d7 \"V\"). For example, the M\u00f6bius strip can be seen as a line bundle over the circle \"S\"1 (by identifying open intervals with the real line). It is, however, different from the cylinder \"S\"1 \u00d7 R, because the latter is orientable whereas the former is not.\nProperties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the tangent bundle consists of the collection of tangent spaces parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle \"S\"1 is globally isomorphic to \"S\"1 \u00d7 R, since there is a global nonzero vector field on \"S\"1. In contrast, by the hairy ball theorem, there is no (tangent) vector field on the 2-sphere \"S\"2 which is everywhere nonzero. K-theory studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space. In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real division algebras: R, C, the quaternions H and the octonions O.\nThe cotangent bundle of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the cotangent space. Sections of that bundle are known as differential one-forms.\nModules.\n\"Modules\" are to rings what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring \"R\" instead of a field \"F\", yield modules. The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have multiplicative inverses. For example, modules need not have bases, as the Z-module (that is, abelian group) Z/2Z shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as free modules. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a module over a ring which is a field, with the elements being called vectors. Some authors use the term \"vector space\" to mean modules over a division ring. The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their spectrum allows the development of concepts such as locally free modules, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.\nAffine and projective spaces.\nRoughly, \"affine spaces\" are vector spaces whose origins are not specified. More precisely, an affine space is a set with a free transitive vector space action. In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map\nformula_244\nIf \"W\" is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of \"W\" obtained by translating a linear subspace \"V\" by a fixed vector x \u2208 \"W\"; this space is denoted by x + \"V\" (it is a coset of \"V\" in \"W\") and consists of all vectors of the form x + v for v \u2208 \"V\". An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations\nformula_245\ngeneralizing the homogeneous case discussed in the above section on linear equations, which can be found by setting formula_246 in this equation. The space of solutions is the affine subspace x + \"V\" where x is a particular solution of the equation, and \"V\" is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the nullspace of \"A\").\nThe set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space \"V\" is known as \"projective space\"; it may be used to formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity. Grassmannians and flag manifolds generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension \"k\" and flags of subspaces, respectively.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAlgebra.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnalysis.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32374", "revid": "25708940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32374", "title": "Venezuela", "text": "Country in South America\nVenezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. It comprises an area of , and its population was estimated at 29 million in 2022. The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas. The continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. Venezuela consists of 23 states, the Capital District, and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.\nThe territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522, amid resistance from Indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part of the first federal Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. From 1958, the country had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity.\nEconomic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a president for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was written and ratified. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. However, poverty began to rapidly increase in the 2010s. The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. \nVenezuela is officially a federal presidential republic, but has experienced democratic backsliding under the Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro administrations, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks poorly on international measurements of freedom of the press, civil liberties, and control of corruption. Venezuela is a developing country, has the world's largest known oil reserves, and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. Venezuela struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, environmental issues, severe crime, and widespread corruption. US sanctions and the seizure of Venezuelan assets overseas have cost the country $24\u201330 billion. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan refugee crisis in which more than 7.9 million people had fled the country by May 2025. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation.\nEtymology.\nAccording to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda visited the Venezuelan coast. The stilt houses in the area of Lake Maracaibo reminded the Italian navigator, Amerigo Vespucci, of the city of Venice, Italy, so he named the region \"Veneziola\", or \"Little Venice\". The Spanish version of \"Veneziola\" is .\nMart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave a different account. In his work , he states that the crew found Indigenous peoples who called themselves the \"Veneciuela.\" Thus, the name \"Venezuela\" may have evolved from the native word.\nPreviously, the official name was (1830\u20131856), (1856\u20131864), (1864\u20131953), and again (1953\u20131999).\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian history.\nEvidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela. Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela; according to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.\nIt is unknown how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at one million. In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the Kalina (Caribs), Auak\u00e9, Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto\u2013Cuicas. The Timoto\u2013Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos. They left behind art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the arepa, a staple in Venezuelan cuisine.\nAfter the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe. Two main north\u2013south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the \"llanos\" were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture.\nColonization.\nIn 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus sailed near the Orinoco Delta and landed in the Gulf of Paria. Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Great signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise... for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world.\nSpain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the present-day[ [update]] city of Cuman\u00e1.\nGerman colonization.\nIn the 16th century, the king of Spain granted a concession to the German Welser family. Klein-Venedig became the most extensive initiative in the German colonization of the Americas from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who was King of Spain and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his Imperial election.\nIn 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of El Dorado. The first expedition was led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who established Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then Nikolaus Federmann, and Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint a governor. \nOn Hutten's return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the Spanish governor Juan de Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus VI. Welser executed. Subsequently, Charles V revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African slaves to plant sugar cane plantations. Many German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no immunity, or through wars with the Indigenous inhabitants.\nLate 15th century to early 17th century.\nNative \"caciques\" (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro (c.\u20091530\u20131568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.\nIn the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to Roman Catholicism. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, Chacao and Los Teques. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast, but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the Orinoco River. Here, the Ye'kuana organized resistance in 1775\u201376.\nSpain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into New Andalusia Province. Administered by the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of La Guaira and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate.\nIndependence and 19th century.\nAfter unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the American and French Revolutions, declared independence as the First Republic of Venezuela on 5 July 1811. This began the Venezuelan War of Independence. A devastating 1812 Caracas earthquake, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan \"llaneros\", helped bring down the republic. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, new leader of the independentist forces, launched his Admirable Campaign in 1813 from New Granada, retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as \"El Libertador\" (\"The Liberator\"). A Second Republic of Venezuela was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by royalist caudillo Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves and his personal army of \"llaneros\".\nThe end of the French invasion of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general Pablo Morillo, with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bol\u00edvar reestablished the Third Republic of Venezuela on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the Guayana and Llanos regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the Congress of Angostura of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Colombia. \nThe war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. On 24 July 1823, Jos\u00e9 Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo. New Granada's congress gave Bol\u00edvar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia).\nSucre went on to liberate Ecuador and become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela, on 22 September; P\u00e1ez became the first president of the new State of Venezuela. Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of war (including about half the Venezuelans of European descent), which by 1830, was estimated at 800,000. In the Flag of Venezuela, the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.\nSlavery in Venezuela was abolished in 1854. Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal War (1859\u201363). In the latter half of the century, Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco, another \"caudillo\", served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.\nIn 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist, William L. Scruggs, sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States' Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere. Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.\nIn 1899, Cipriano Castro, assisted by his friend Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's civil wars. This led to the Venezuela Crisis of 1902\u20131903, in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new Permanent Court of Arbitration was agreed. In 1908, another dispute broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez (1908\u201335).\n20th century.\nThe discovery of massive oil deposits in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved pivotal for Venezuela and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest. G\u00f3mez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority.\nG\u00f3mez remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935. The \"gomecista\" dictatorship (1935\u20131945) system largely continued under Eleazar L\u00f3pez Contreras, but from 1941, under Isa\u00edas Medina Angarita, was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.\nIn 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in a period of democratic rule (1945\u20131948) under the mass membership party Democratic Action, initially under R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, until R\u00f3mulo Gallegos won the 1947 Venezuelan presidential election (the first free and fair elections in Venezuela). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate Luis Felipe Llovera P\u00e1ez, Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, and Gallegos' Defense Minister, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, in the 1948 Venezuelan \"coup d'\u00e9tat\".\nThe most powerful man in the military \"junta\" (1948\u201358) was P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the 1952 presidential election, it ignored the results and Jim\u00e9nez was installed as president. Jim\u00e9nez was forced out on 23 January 1958. In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties (Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica (AD), COPEI and Uni\u00f3n Republicana Democr\u00e1tica (URD), with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Venezuela), signed the Puntofijo Pact power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades.\nDuring the presidencies of R\u00f3mulo Betancourt (1959\u201364, his second term) and Ra\u00fal Leoni (1964\u201369), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under Rafael Caldera's first presidency (1969\u201374). Caldera had won the 1968 election for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the Betancourt Doctrine, in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.\nThe 1973 Venezuelan presidential election of Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez coincided with an oil crisis, in which Venezuela's income exploded as oil prices soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.\nIn the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.\nEconomic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the \"Caracazo\" riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez (1989\u20131993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a coup attempt in February 1992; a second coup d'\u00e9tat attempt occurred in November. \nPresident Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1squez (1993\u20131994). Coup leader Ch\u00e1vez was pardoned in March 1994 by president Rafael Caldera (1994\u20131999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Ch\u00e1vez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Ch\u00e1vez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004.\nBolivarian government under Ch\u00e1vez: 1999\u20132013.\nA collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 constituent assembly to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a left-wing populism social movement and political process led by Ch\u00e1vez, who founded the Fifth Republic Movement in 1997 and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007. The \"Bolivarian Revolution\" is named after Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. \nAccording to Ch\u00e1vez and other supporters, the \"Bolivarian Revolution\" sought to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism\u2014popular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bol\u00edvar's ideas from a populist perspective, using socialist rhetoric. This led to formation of the Fifth Republic of Venezuela, commonly known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that continues to the present day. Venezuela has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new Constitution of 1999. \nFollowing Ch\u00e1vez's election, Venezuela developed into a dominant-party system, dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. In April 2002, Ch\u00e1vez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt following popular demonstrations by his opponents, but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Ch\u00e1vez supporters and actions by the military. Ch\u00e1vez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA. \nCapital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations. These devaluations did not improve the situation of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports. The profits of the oil industry were lost to \"social engineering\" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.\nCh\u00e1vez survived further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum. He was elected for another term in December 2006 and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.\nBolivarian government under Maduro: 2013\u2013present.\nThe presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Ch\u00e1vez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.\nUnder the Bolivarian government, Venezuela went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's socioeconomic policies of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to corruption in Venezuela and culminated into a crisis in Venezuela. As a result, the Venezuelan refugee crisis, the largest emigration of people in Latin America's history, occurred, with over 7 million \u2013 about 20% of the country's population \u2013 emigrating. Ch\u00e1vez initiated Bolivarian missions, programs aimed at helping the poor.\nPoverty began to increase into the 2010s. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.\nMaduro has been president of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, when he won the presidential election after Chavez' death, with 51% of the vote, against Henrique Capriles on 49%. The Democratic Unity Roundtable contested Maduro's election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies, and the Supreme Court of Venezuela ruled Maduro was the legitimate president. Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro's government a dictatorship. \nSince February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies. Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters and opposition leaders, including Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and Antonio Ledezma were arrested. Human rights groups condemned the arrest of L\u00f3pez. In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the opposition gained a majority.\nVenezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages, which included milk and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children. The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports, and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the price of oil plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from PDVSA, the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly per day. \nIn 2014, Venezuela entered a recession, and in 2015, had the world's highest inflation, surpassing 100%. In 2017, Donald Trump's administration imposed more economic sanctions against PDVSA and Venezuelan officials. Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the 2014\u2013present Venezuelan protests. Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have fled Venezuela.\nIn January 2016, Maduro decreed an \"economic emergency\", revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers. In July 2016, Colombian border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic health items. In September 2016, a study indicated 15% of Venezuelans were eating \"food waste discarded by commercial establishments\". 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.\nThe Maduro-aligned Supreme Tribunal, which had been overturning National Assembly decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis. In August 2017, the 2017 Constituent National Assembly was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers. The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship. In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.\nMaduro won the 2018 election with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, France and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as president. Other countries continued to recognize Maduro, although China, facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties. In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against Venezuela. In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and Venezuelan officials, on charges of drug trafficking, narcoterrorism, and corruption.\nIn June 2020, a report documented enforced disappearances that occurred in 2018\u201319. 724 enforced disappearances of political detainees were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to torture. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.\nMaduro ran for a third consecutive term in the 2024 presidential election, while former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia represented the Unitary Platform (; PUD), the main opposition political alliance. Polls conducted before the election indicated that Gonz\u00e1lez would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results and did not recognize the CNE claims with only some exceptions. \nBoth Gonz\u00e1lez and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the Carter Center and Organization of American States due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by poll watchers from a majority of polling centers as proof.\nIn the aftermath of the announcement of results by the election authorities, protests broke out across the country.\nGeography.\nVenezuela is located in the north of South America. Geologically, its mainland rests on the South American Plate. It has a total area of and a land area of , making Venezuela the 33rd largest country in the world. The territory it controls lies between latitudes 0\u00b0 and 16\u00b0N and longitudes 59\u00b0 and 74\u00b0W.\nShaped roughly like a triangle, Venezuela has a coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined topographical regions: the Maracaibo lowlands in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east\u2013west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the Guiana Highlands in the southeast.\nThe northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. Pico Bol\u00edvar, the nation's highest point at , lies in this region. To the south, the dissected Guiana Highlands contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall, as well as \"tepuis\", large table-like mountains. Venezuela's center is characterized by the \"llanos\", which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River delta in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich alluvial soils, binds the largest and most important river system of Venezuela. It originates in one of the largest watersheds in Latin America. The Caron\u00ed and the Apure are other major rivers.\nVenezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba, and the Leeward Antilles lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the Essequibo area, and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a \"neutral\" commission, composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative, which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.\nClimate.\nVenezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 12\u00b0 N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average annual temperatures range as high as , to glaciers and highlands (the \"p\u00e1ramos\") with an average yearly temperature of . Annual rainfall varies from in the semiarid portions of the northwest to over in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the Amazonian Jungle in the south.\nThe precipitation level is lower from August to April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout Venezuela by the existence of a mountain range called \"Cordillera de la Costa\" which crosses Venezuela from east to west. The majority of the population lives in these mountains.\nVenezuela falls into four horizontal temperature zones based primarily on elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with dry winters, and polar (alpine tundra) climates, amongst others. In the tropical zone\u2014below \u2014temperatures are hot, with yearly averages ranging between . The temperate zone ranges between with averages from ; many of Venezuela's cities, including the capital, lie in this region. Colder conditions with temperatures from are found in the cool zone between , especially in the Venezuelan Andes, where pastureland and permanent snowfield with yearly averages below cover land above in the \"p\u00e1ramos\".\nThe highest temperature recorded was in Machiques. The lowest temperature recorded was , reported from an uninhabited high altitude at P\u00e1ramo de Piedras Blancas (M\u00e9rida state).\nBiodiversity and conservation.\nVenezuela lies within the Neotropical realm. Large portions of Venezuela were originally covered by moist broadleaf forests. One of 17 megadiverse countries, Venezuela's habitats range from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive \"llanos\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. They include xeric scrublands in the extreme northwest and coastal mangrove forests in the northeast. Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.\nAnimals of Venezuela are diverse and include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and Orinoco Crocodiles, which have been reported to reach up to in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic. Important birds include ibises, ospreys, kingfishers, and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.\nFor the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G. Dennis which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database. That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.\nAmong plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems. These include the \"flor de mayo\" orchid (\"Cattleya mossiae\"), the national flower. Venezuela's national tree is the araguaney. The tops of the tepuis are also home to several carnivorous plants including the marsh pitcher plant, Heliamphora, and the insectivorous bromeliad, Brocchinia reducta.\nVenezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism. Among its animals, 23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species, including the Trinidad poison frog, are endemic. Although the available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Venezuela: 1334 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possibly endemic. Some 38% of the over 21,000 plant species known from Venezuela are unique to the country.\nVenezuela is one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares of forest are permanently destroyed, and other areas are degraded by mining, oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3\u00a0million ha. In response, federal protections for critical habitat were implemented. For example, 20% to 33% of forested land is protected. Venezuela's biosphere reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention. \nIn 2003, 70% of Venezuela's land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 43 national parks. Venezuela's 43 national parks include Canaima National Park, Morrocoy National Park, and Mochima National Park. In the far south is a reserve for the country's Yanomami tribes. Covering , the area is off-limits to farmers, miners, and all non-Yanomami settlers.\nVenezuela was one of the few countries that did not enter an INDC at COP21. Many terrestrial ecosystems are considered endangered, specially the dry forest in the northern regions of the country and the coral reefs in the Caribbean coast.\nThere are 105 protected areas in Venezuela, which cover around 26% of the country's continental, marine and insular surface.\nHydrography.\nVenezuela is made up of three river basins: the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Valencia, which forms an endorheic basin.\nOn the Atlantic side it drains most of Venezuela's river waters. The largest basin in this area is the extensive Orinoco basin whose surface area, close to one million km2, is greater than that of the whole of Venezuela, although it has a presence of 65% in the country.\nThe size of this basin - similar to that of the Danube - makes it the third largest in South America, and it gives rise to a flow of some 33,000 m3/s, making the Orinoco the third largest in the world, and also one of the most valuable from the point of view of renewable natural resources. The Rio or Brazo Casiquiare is unique in the world, as it is a natural derivation of the Orinoco that, after some 500\u00a0km in length, connects it to the Negro River, which in turn is a tributary of the Amazon. \nThe Orinoco receives directly or indirectly rivers such as the Ventuari, the Caura, the Caron\u00ed, the Meta, the Arauca, the Apure and many others. Other Venezuelan rivers that empty into the Atlantic are the waters of the San Juan and Cuyun\u00ed basins. Finally, there is the Amazon River, which receives the Guain\u00eda, the Negro and others. Other basins are the Gulf of Paria and the Esequibo River.\nThe second most important watershed is the Caribbean Sea. The rivers of this region are usually short and of scarce and irregular flow, with some exceptions such as the Catatumbo, which originates in Colombia and drains into the Maracaibo Lake basin. Among the rivers that reach the Maracaibo lake basin are the Chama, the Escalante, the Catatumbo, and the contributions of the smaller basins of the Tocuyo, Yaracuy, Never\u00ed and Manzanares rivers.\nA minimum drains to the Lake Valencia basin. Of the total extension of the rivers, a total of 5400\u00a0km are navigable. Other rivers worth mentioning are the Apure, Arauca, Caura, Meta, Barima, Portuguesa, Ventuari and Zulia, among others.\nVenezuela's main lakes are Lake Maracaibo -the largest in South America- open to the sea through the natural channel, but with fresh water, and Lake Valencia with its endorheic system. Other noteworthy bodies of water are the Guri reservoir, the Altagracia lagoon, the Camatagua reservoir and the Mucubaj\u00ed lagoon in the Andes.\nRelief.\nThe Venezuelan natural landscape is the product of the interaction of tectonic plates that since the Paleozoic have contributed to its current appearance. On the formed structures, seven physical-natural units have been modeled, differentiated in their relief and in their natural resources.\nThe relief of Venezuela has the following characteristics: coastline with several peninsulas and islands, adenas of the Andes mountain range (north and northwest), Lake Maracaibo (between the chains, on the coast); Orinoco river delta, region of peneplains and plateaus (tepui, east of the Orinoco) that together form the Guyanas massif (plateaus, southeast of the country).\nThe oldest rock formations in South America are found in the complex basement of the Guyanas highlands and in the crystalline line of the Maritime and Cordillera massifs in Venezuela. The Venezuelan part of the Guyanas Altiplano consists of a large granite block of gneiss and other crystalline Archean rocks, with underlying layers of sandstone and shale clay.\nThe core of granite and cordillera is, to a large extent, flanked by sedimentary layers from the Cretaceous, folded in an anticline structure. Between these orographic systems there are plains covered with tertiary and quaternary layers of gravel, sands and clayey marls. The depression contains lagoons and lakes, among which is that of Maracaibo, and presents, on the surface, alluvial deposits from the Quaternary.\nAlso known as the Cordillera de la Costa, stretches along Venezuela's northern coast. This region is known for its lush tropical rainforests, stunning coastal views, and a rich variety of flora and fauna. The intermountain depressions, or valleys, between the mountain ranges are often home to fertile agricultural land and vibrant communities. These valleys offer a stark contrast to the rugged mountains that rise dramatically from the coast.\nSituated in northwestern Venezuela, the Lara-Falc\u00f3n Highlands exhibit a terrain defined by plateaus and rolling hills. These highlands provide a significant contrast to the surrounding lowlands and coastal areas. The relief is characterized by gently sloping plateaus that support agriculture, including coffee and cacao cultivation. This region's semi-arid climate and picturesque landscapes make it an important agricultural and tourism center.\nEncompass the basin of Lake Maracaibo and the plains surrounding the Gulf of Venezuela. This region offers two distinct plains\u2014the northern one is relatively dry, while the southern one is humid and dotted with swamps. The relief here is primarily characterized by flat terrain, with the exception of some elevated areas near the lake. Lake Maracaibo itself sits in a depression, surrounded by oil-rich lands and productive agricultural areas.\nThe Venezuelan Andes, part of the broader Andes mountain range, offer a striking relief with towering peaks, deep valleys, and fertile intermontane basins. Dominated by these corpulent mountain ranges, including Venezuela's highest peak, Bol\u00edvar Peak, the region's rugged and picturesque landscapes are defined by its high-altitude terrain. \nThe unique relief of this area finds its origins in the Last Glacial Period, where the interplay of repeated glacier advances and retreats sculpted the landscape, shaped by the cold, high-altitude climate. This glacial heritage has left a lasting imprint, with glaciers carving deep valleys and polishing rugged peaks, while sheltered intramontane valleys offer fertile soils and temperate microclimates, creating ideal conditions for agriculture and human settlement.\nLos Llanos, or \"the plains\", are expansive sedimentary basins characterized by predominantly flat relief. However, the eastern Llanos feature low-plateaus and the Unare depression, created through mesa erosion, adding diversity to the terrain. This region is subject to seasonal flooding, transforming the flat plains into a vast wetland during the rainy season. The relief here influences the region's unique ecosystems, including extensive grasslands and abundant wildlife.\nThe Guiana Shield boasts a varied relief shaped by geological processes over millions of years. This region encompasses peneplains, rugged mountain ranges, foothills, and the iconic tepuis, or table-top mountains. The tepuis stand as isolated, flat-topped plateaus that rise dramatically from the surrounding terrain. This unique relief contributes to the region's remarkable biodiversity and scientific significance.\nThe Orinoco Delta's relief is characterized by a complex system of lands and waters. It consists of numerous channels, islands, and shifting sedimentary deposits. While the relief may appear relatively uniform, it conceals a dynamic environment influenced by seasonal flooding and sediment deposition. This complex deltaic relief supports diverse aquatic life and the livelihoods of Indigenous communities adapted to its ever-changing landscapes.\nValleys.\nThe valleys are undoubtedly the most important type of landscape in the Venezuelan territory, not because of their spatial extension, but because they are the environment where most of the country's population and economic activities are concentrated. On the other hand, there are valleys throughout almost all the national space, except in the great sedimentary basins of the Llanos and the depression of the Maracaibo Lake, except also in the Amazonian peneplains. By their modeling, the valleys of the Venezuelan territory belong mainly to two types: valleys of fluvial type and valleys of glacial type. Much more frequent, the former largely dominate the latter, which are restricted to the highest parts of the Andes. Moreover, most glacial valleys are relics of a past geologic epoch, which culminated some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.\nThe deep and narrow Andean valleys are very different from the wide depressions of Aragua and Carabobo, in the Cordillera de la Costa, or from the valleys nestled in the Mesas de Monagas. These examples indicate that the configuration of the local relief is decisive in identifying regional types of valleys. Likewise, due to their warm climate, the Guayana valleys are distinguished from the temperate or cold Andean valleys by their humid environment. Both are, in turn, different from the semi-arid depressions of the states of Lara and Falc\u00f3n.\nThe Andean valleys, essentially agricultural, precociously populated but nowadays in loss of speed, do not confront the same problems of space occupation as the strongly urbanized and industrialized valleys of the central section of the Cordillera de la Costa. On the other hand, the unpopulated and practically untouched Guiana valleys are another category this area is called the Lost World (\"Mundo Perdido\").\nThe Andean valleys are undoubtedly the most impressive of the Venezuelan territory because of the energy of the encasing reliefs, whose summits often dominate the valley bottoms by 3,000 to 3,500 meters of relative altitude. They are also the most picturesque in terms of their style of habitat, forms of land use, handicraft production and all the traditions linked to these activities.\nDeserts.\nVenezuela has a great diversity of landscapes and climates, including arid and dry areas. The main desert in the country is in the state of Falcon near the city of Coro. It is now a protected park, the M\u00e9danos de Coro National Park. The park is the largest of its kind in Venezuela, covering 91 square kilometres. The landscape is dotted with cacti and other xerophytic plants that can survive in humidity-free conditions near the desert.\nDesert wildlife includes mostly lizards, iguanas and other reptiles. Although less frequent, the desert is home to some foxes, giant anteaters and rabbits. There are also some native bird populations, such as the sparrowhawk, tropical mockingbird, scaly dove and crested quail.\nOther desert areas in the country include part of the Guajira Desert in the Guajira Municipality in the north of Zulia State and facing the Gulf of Venezuela, the M\u00e9danos de Capanaparo in the Santos Luzardo National Park in Apure State, the Medanos de la Isla de Zapara in Zulia State, the so-called Hundici\u00f3n de Yay in the Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco Municipality of Lara State, and the Urumaco Formation also in Falc\u00f3n State.\nGovernment and politics.\nTwo major blocs of political parties are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies Fatherland for All (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica. This includes A New Era (UNT) together with allied parties Project Venezuela, Justice First, Movement for Socialism (MAS) and others.\nThe Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and universal suffrage, and is both head of state and head of government. The term of office is six years. As of February 2009, a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.\nThe president may ask the National Assembly to pass an enabling act granting the ability to rule by decree in specified policy areas. This requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.\nThe unicameral Venezuelan parliament is the \"Asamblea Nacional\" (\"National Assembly\"). The number of members is variable \u2013 each state and the Capital district elect three representatives, plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the population of the country. Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's Indigenous peoples. For the 2011\u20132016 period the number of seats is 165. All deputies serve five-year terms.\nThe voting age in Venezuela is 18. Voting is not compulsory.\nThe legal system of Venezuela belongs to the Continental Law tradition. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Tribunal of Justice or \"Tribunal Supremo de Justicia\", whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single twelve-year term. The National Electoral Council (\"Consejo Nacional Electoral\", or \"CNE\") is in charge of electoral processes. It is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 2009 that Venezuela had moved away from \"a rigid division of powers\" toward a system characterized by \"intense coordination\" between the branches of government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent.\nIn 2006, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated Venezuela an hybrid regime and the third least democratic regime in Latin America on the Democracy Index. The Democracy Index downgraded Venezuela to an authoritarian regime in 2017, citing continued increasingly dictatorial behaviors by the Maduro government. The Regimes of the World index rated Venezuela as an electoral autocracy in 2024.\nAdministrative divisions.\nVenezuela is divided into 23 states (\"estados\"), a capital district (\"distrito capital\") for Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies (\"Dependencias Federales\", a special territory). Venezuela is subdivided into 335 municipalities (\"municipios\"). These are subdivided into over one thousand parishes (\"parroquias\"). The states are grouped into nine administrative regions (\"regiones administrativas\"), which were established in 1969 by presidential decree.\nVenezuela can be further divided into ten geographical areas, some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north are the Venezuelan Andes. The Coro region, a mountainous tract in the northwest, holds several sierras and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela.\nThe Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas. The Insular Region includes all of Venezuela's island possessions: Nueva Esparta and the various Federal Dependencies. The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.\nVenezuela maintains a claim on the territory it calls \"Guayana Esequiba\", the territory administered by Guyana west of the Esequibo River. In 1966, the British and Venezuelan governments signed the Geneva Agreement to resolve the conflict peacefully. The Port of Spain Protocol of 1970 set a deadline to try to resolve the issue, without success to date.\nSuspension of constitutional rights.\nThe 2015 parliamentary elections were held on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three Indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed to inflation, violence and shortages in Venezuela. The protests were largely peaceful. The government has accused the protest of being motivated by fascists, opposition leaders, capitalism and foreign influence, President Maduro acknowledged PSUV defeat but attributed the opposition's victory to an intensification of an economic war. Despite this, Maduro said, \"I will stop by hook or by crook the opposition coming to power, whatever the costs, in any way\". \nIn the following months, Maduro fulfilled his promise of preventing the elected National Assembly from legislating. The first steps taken by PSUV and government were the substitution of the entire Supreme Court a day after the parliamentary elections, contrary to the Constitution of Venezuela, acclaimed as a fraud by the majority of the Venezuelan and international press. The \"Financial Times\" described the function of the Supreme Court in Venezuela as \"rubber stamping executive whims and vetoing legislation\". The PSUV government used this violation to suspend several elected opponents. Maduro said that \"the Amnesty law (approved by the Parliament) will not be executed\" and asked the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional.\nOn 16 January 2016, Maduro approved an unconstitutional economic emergency decree, relegating to his own figure the legislative and executive powers, while also holding judiciary power through the fraudulent designation of judges the day after the election on 6 December 2015. From these events, Maduro effectively controls all three branches of government. On 14 May 2016, constitutional guarantees were suspended when Maduro decreed the extension of the economic emergency decree for another 60 days and declared a State of Emergency, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Venezuela in the Article 338th: \"The approval of the extension of States of emergency corresponds to the National Assembly.\" Thus, constitutional rights in Venezuela are considered suspended by many publications and public figures.\nOn 14 May 2016, the Organization of American States was considering the application of the Inter-American Democratic Charter sanctions for non-compliance to its own constitution.\nIn March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court took over law making powers from the National Assembly but reversed its decision the following day.\nForeign relations.\nThroughout most of the 20th century, Venezuela maintained friendly relations with most Latin American and Western nations. Relations between Venezuela and the United States government worsened in 2002, after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt during which the U.S. government recognized the short-lived interim presidency of Pedro Carmona. In 2015, Venezuela was declared a national security threat by U.S. president Barack Obama. Correspondingly, ties to various Latin American and Middle Eastern countries not allied to the U.S. have strengthened.\nVenezuela seeks alternative hemispheric integration via such proposals as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas trade proposal and the newly launched Latin American television network teleSUR. Venezuela is one of five nations in the world\u2014along with Russia, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria\u2014to have recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Venezuela was a proponent of OAS's decision to adopt its Anti-Corruption Convention and is actively working in the Mercosur trade bloc to push increased trade and energy integration. Globally, it seeks a \"multi-polar\" world based on strengthened ties among undeveloped countries.\nOn 26 April 2017, Venezuela announced its intention to withdraw from the OAS. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez said that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro plans to publicly renounce Venezuela's membership on 27 April 2017. It will take two years for the country to formally leave. During this period, the country does not plan on participating in the OAS.\nVenezuela is involved in a long-standing disagreement about the control of the Guayana Esequiba area.\nVenezuela may suffer a deterioration of its power in international affairs if the global transition to renewable energy is completed. It is ranked 151 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).\nVenezuela is a charter member of the United Nations (UN), Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI).\nMilitary.\nThe Bolivarian National Armed Forces (\"Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana\", FANB) are the unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in five components of ground, sea and air. The components of the FANB are: the Venezuelan Army, the Venezuelan Navy, the Venezuelan Air Force, the Venezuelan National Guard, and the Venezuelan National Militia. As of 2008[ [update]], a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as the Armed Reserve.\nThe president of Venezuela is the commander-in-chief of the FANB. Its main purposes are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military service at 18, which is the age of majority.\nLaw and crime.\nIn Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes. Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the government no longer produces the crime data. In 2013, the homicide rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world's highest, having quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered. By 2015, it had risen to 90 per 100,000. The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents. \nIn 2008, polls indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters. Attempts at fighting crime such as Operation Liberation of the People were implemented to crack down on gang-controlled areas but, of reported criminal acts, less than 2% are prosecuted. In 2017, the \"Financial Times\" noted that some of the arms procured by the government over the previous two decades had been diverted to paramilitary civilian groups and criminal syndicates.\nVenezuela is especially dangerous for foreign travelers and investors who are visiting. The United States Department of State and the Government of Canada have warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela. Visitors have been murdered during robberies.\nThere are approximately 33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates. Venezuela's prison system is heavily overcrowded; its facilities have capacity for only 14,000 prisoners.\nHuman rights.\nHuman rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have increasingly criticized Venezuela's human rights record, with the former organization noting in 2017 that the Chavez and subsequently the Maduro government have increasingly concentrated power in the executive branch, eroded constitutional human rights protections and allowed the government to persecute and repress its critics and opposition. Other persistent concerns as noted by the report included poor prison conditions, the continuous harassment of independent media and human rights defenders by the government.\nCorruption.\nCorruption in Venezuela is high by world standards and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil worsened political corruption. By the late 1970s, Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso's description of oil as \"the Devil's excrement\" had become a common expression in Venezuela. The Corruption Perceptions Index has ranked Venezuela as one of the most corrupt countries since the survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries in government transparency. By 2016, the rank had increased to 166 out of 178. The World Justice Project ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of Law Index.\nThis corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. In the period 2003\u20132008 Venezuelan authorities seized the fifth-largest total quantity of cocaine in the world, behind Colombia, the United States, Spain and Panama. In 2006, the government's agency for combating illegal drug trade in Venezuela, \"ONA\", was incorporated into the office of the vice-president. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking.\nEconomy.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt; Annual variation of real GDP according to the Central Bank of Venezuela (2016 preliminary)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The formerly rich petro-state has seen GDP fall by 80 percent in less than a decade, driving some seven million of its citizens to flee. Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in total disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel\" as of 2024, according to VOA (report from AFP).\nVenezuela has a market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues. Per capita GDP for 2016 was estimated to be US$15,100, ranking 109th in the world. Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized. The private sector controls two-thirds of Venezuela's economy.\nVenezuela was ranked 136th out of 139 ranks in the Global Innovation Index in 2025\nAt least 5% of Venezuela's economy, as of 2022, relied on remittances.\nThe Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar which is used as currency. The president of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund. The U.S.-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100. Expropriation without compensation is not uncommon.\nAs of 2011, more than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves was in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad was located in London. In November 2011, the first of US$11\u00a0billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas. Ch\u00e1vez called the repatriation of gold a \"sovereign\" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe. Government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank to reassure the international bond market.\nManufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.\nSince the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996. The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994.\nThe recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela initially made progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued by Ch\u00e1vez and his administration were jump-started by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000. The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned due to the Bolivarian state's overspending on public works and because the Ch\u00e1vez government did not save funds for future economic hardships, with economic issues and poverty rising as a result of their policies in the 2010s. \nIn 2003, the government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency. This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years. The Great Recession led to a renewed economic downturn. Despite controversial data shared by the Venezuelan government showing that the country had halved malnutrition following one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals, shortages of staple goods began to occur in Venezuela and malnutrition began to increase.\nIn early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to growing shortages in the country. The shortages included, and still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour. Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued plans to nationalize other industrial aspects like food distribution. \nVenezuela's bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions by the president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In 2016, consumer prices in Venezuela increased 800% and the economy declined by 18.6%, entering an economic depression. Venezuela's outlook was deemed negative by most bond-rating services in 2017. For 2018 an inflation rate of 1,000,000 percent was projected, putting Venezuela in a similar situation to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s.\nTourism.\nTourism has been developed considerably in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, the variety of landscapes, the richness of plant and wildlife, the culture and the tropical climate.\nMargarita Island is one of the top tourist destinations. It is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beaches suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches of great cultural value.\nLos Roques Archipelago is made up of a set of islands and keys that constitute one of the main tourist attractions in the country. With exotic crystalline beaches, Morrocoy is a national park, formed by small keys very close to the mainland, which have grown rapidly as one of the greatest tourist attractions in the Venezuelan Caribbean.\nCanaima National Park extends over 30,000\u00a0km2 to the border with Guyana and Brazil; due to its size it is considered the sixth largest national park in the world. Its steep cliffs and waterfalls (including Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world, at 1,002 m) form spectacular landscapes.\nThe state of M\u00e9rida is one of the main tourist centers of Venezuela. It has an extensive network of hotels not only in its capital city, but also throughout the state. Starting from the same city of M\u00e9rida is the longest and highest cable car in the world, which reaches the Pico Espejo of 4,765 m.\nShortages.\nShortages in Venezuela have been prevalent following the enactment of price controls and other policies during the economic policy of the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez government. Under the economic policy of the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the Venezuelan government's policy of withholding United States dollars from importers with price controls.\nShortages occur in regulated products, such as milk, various types of meat, coffee, rice, oil, flour, butter, and other goods including basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even medicine. As a result of the shortages, Venezuelans must search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes do without certain products.\nA drought, combined with a lack of planning and maintenance, has caused a hydroelectricity shortage. To deal with lack of power supply, in April 2016 the Maduro government announced rolling blackouts and reduced the government workweek to only Monday and Tuesday. A multi-university study found that, in 2016 alone, about 75% of Venezuelans lost weight due to hunger, with the average losing about 8.6\u00a0kg (19\u00a0lbs) due to the lack of food. In March 2017, Venezuela began having shortages of gasoline in some regions.\nPetroleum and other resources.\nVenezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world. Compared to 2009, another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type. Venezuela's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where Venezuela's largest reserve is located.\nBesides having the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits, in the form of extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands, approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, U.S. oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, initially interested only in purchasing concessions. In 1943, a new government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.\nIn 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe. In the 1990s, PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided over an \"apertura\" (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment. PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 \u2013 February 2003 national strike. As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce, around 18,000 workers, were dismissed.\nTransport.\nVenezuela's airports include the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport in Maiquet\u00eda, near Caracas and La Chinita International Airport near Maracaibo. Major seaports are at La Guaira, Maracaibo and Puerto Cabello. In the south and east, the Amazon rainforest region has limited cross-border transport. In the west, there is a mountainous border of over shared with Colombia. The Orinoco River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to inland and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean.\nVenezuela has a limited national railway system, which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela's rail project is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5\u00a0billion and owing China Railway nearly $500\u00a0million.\nSeveral major cities have metro systems. The Caracas Metro has been operating since 1983. The Maracaibo Metro and Valencia Metro were opened more recently. Venezuela has a road network of nearly , placing Venezuela around 45th in the world. Around a third of roads are paved.\nUtilities.\nThe electricity sector in Venezuela is heavily dependent on hydroelectricity, accounting for 64% of Venezuela's electricity generation in 2021.\nDemographics.\nVenezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America. About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela, especially in the capital Caracas, which is the largest city. 73% of people live less than from the coastline. Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there. The largest and most important city south of the Orinoco is Ciudad Guayana, which is the sixth most populous conurbation. Other major cities include Barquisimeto, Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo, Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz, M\u00e9rida and San Crist\u00f3bal.\nAccording to the total population was in . A 2014 study by sociologists of the Central University of Venezuela found over 1.5\u00a0million Venezuelans, or about 4% to 6% of the country's population, have left Venezuela since 1999.\nLargest cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnicity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It is estimated that the majority of the population is of pardo, or mixed, ethnic ancestry. In the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the term \"pardo\" was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be moreno or white\u201451.6% and 43.6%, respectively. Slightly more than half of the population claimed to be \"moreno\", a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means \"dark-skinned\" or \"brown-skinned\", as opposed to having a lighter skin.\nEthnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or Indigenous peoples. 2.8% identified themselves as \"black\" and 0.7% as \"afrodescendiente\" (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to Indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered \"other races\".\nAmong Indigenous people, 58% were Way\u00fau, 7% Warao, 5% Kari\u00f1a, 4% Pem\u00f3n, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% A\u00f1u, 3% Cuman\u00e1goto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other Indigenous nations.\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Bras\u00edlia, the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% European, 23% Indigenous, and 16.30% African.\nDuring the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands and Spain with a relevant amount of Galicians and Asturians. These immigrants from Spain had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela. These influences on Venezuela have led to the nation being called the 8th island of the Canaries. With the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them U.S. citizens. Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs and lenient immigration policies. During the 20th century, Venezuela, along with the rest of Latin America, received millions of immigrants from Europe. This was especially true post-World War II, as a consequence of war-ridden Europe. During the 1970s, while experiencing an oil-export boom, Venezuela received millions of immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. Due to the belief that this immigration influx depressed wages, some Venezuelans opposed European immigration. The Venezuelan government, however, were actively recruiting immigrants from Eastern Europe to fill a need for engineers. Millions of Colombians, as well as Middle Eastern and Haitian populations would continue immigrating to Venezuela into the early 21st century.\nAccording to the \"World Refugee Survey 2008\", published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Venezuela hosted a population of refugee and asylum seekers from Colombia numbering 252,200 in 2007. 10,600 new asylum seekers entered Venezuela in 2007. In 2011, between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants were estimated to be living in the country.\nIn 2012, Venezuela's Indigenous population was estimated at 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 Indigenous peoples. There are three uncontacted tribes living in Venezuela. The Constitution recognizes the multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual character of Venezuela and includes a chapter devoted to Indigenous peoples' rights, which opened up spaces for their political inclusion at national and local level in 1999.\nMost Indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia. Major groups are the Wayuu in the west, the Warao in the east, the Yanomami installed in the south, and the Pemon, who are mostly in the southeast of Venezuela.\nLanguages.\nAlthough most residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, many languages are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes more than thirty Indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pem\u00f3n, and many others for the official use of the Indigenous peoples, mostly with few speakers \u2013 less than 1% of the total population. Wayuu is the most spoken Indigenous language, with 170,000 speakers.\nImmigrants, in addition to Spanish, speak their own languages. Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000), and Italian (200,000) are the most-spoken languages in Venezuela after the official language of Spanish. Arabic is spoken by Lebanese and Syrian colonies on Isla de Margarita, Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Puerto la Cruz, El Tigre, Maracay, and Caracas. Portuguese is spoken by the Portuguese community in Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n and by much of the population, due to its proximity to Brazil. The German community speaks their native language, while the people of Colonia Tovar speak mostly an Alemannic dialect of German called \"alem\u00e1n coloniero\".\nEnglish is the most widely used foreign language in demand and is spoken by many professionals, academics, and members of the upper and middle classes as a result of the oil exploration by foreign companies, and its acceptance as a lingua franca. Culturally, English is common in southern towns like El Callao, and the native English-speaking (English-creole speaking) influence is evident in folk and calypso songs from the region.\nDialects of Eastern-Caribbean English-based creoles were brought to Venezuela by Trinidadian and other British West Indies immigrants. They are collectively referred to as Venezuelan English Creole. A variety of Antillean Creole is spoken by a small community in El Callao and Paria. Italian language teaching is delivered by private Venezuelan schools and institutions. Other languages spoken by large communities in the country are Basque and Galician, among others. \nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2011, 88% of the population was Christian, primarily Roman Catholic (71%). The remaining 17% were Protestant, primarily Evangelicals. In Latin America, Protestants are usually called \"evang\u00e9licos\". 8% of Venezuelans are irreligious. Almost 3% of the population follow another religion. 1% of the population practice Santer\u00eda.\nThere are small but influential Muslim, Druze, Buddhist, and Jewish communities. The Muslim community of more than 100,000 is concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent living in Nueva Esparta state, Punto Fijo and the Caracas area. Venezuela is home to the largest Druze communities outside the Middle East, estimated at around 60,000, and concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent. Buddhism is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist community is made up mainly of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people.\nThe Jewish community has shrunk in recent years from 22,000 in 1999 to less than 7,000 in 2015, due to rising economic pressures and allegedly, according to the US-based Anti-Defamation League, to antisemitism in Venezuela. \nHealth.\nVenezuela has a national universal health care system. The current government has created a program to expand access to health care known as Misi\u00f3n Barrio Adentro, although its efficiency and work conditions have been criticized. As of December 2014 an estimated 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments in Venezuela are abandoned.\nInfant mortality in Venezuela was 19 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014, which was lower than the South American average. To compare: The U.S. figure was 6 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013. In 2006, child malnutrition was 17%. Delta Amacuro and Amazonas had the nation's highest rates. In 2018, 32% of Venezuelans lacked adequate sanitation, primarily those living in rural areas. In 2006, diseases ranging from diphtheria, plague, malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis D were present in the country. In 2021, obesity was prevalent in approximately 30% of the adult population.\nIn 2004, Venezuela had 150 sewage treatment plants. 13% of the population lacked access to drinking water, but this number had been dropping.\nDuring the economic crisis observed under President Maduro's presidency, medical professionals were forced to perform outdated treatments on patients, and electricity blackouts also affect care.\nEducation.\nIn 2008, 95.2% of the adult population was literate. The net primary school enrollment rate was at 91% and the net secondary school enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005. Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela founded in 1721, the University of Zulia, the University of the Andes, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University, and the University of the East.\nCurrently, many Venezuelan graduates seek a future abroad because of the country's troubled economy and heavy crime rate. Over 1.35 million Venezuelan college graduates have left the country since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution. It is believed that nearly 12% of Venezuelans live abroad, with Ireland becoming a popular destination for students. According to Claudio Bifano, president of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, more than half of all medical graduates had left Venezuela in 2013.\nBy 2018, over half of all Venezuelan children had dropped out of school, with 58% of students quitting nationwide. Areas near bordering countries had more than 80% of their students leave. Nationwide, about 93% of schools do not meet the minimum requirements to operate and 77% do not have utilities such as food, water or electricity.\nCulture.\nThe culture of Venezuela is a melting pot made up of three main groups: The Indigenous Venezuelans, the Spanish, and the Africans.\nThe Spanish influence predominates due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created. Spanish influences can be seen in the country's architecture, music, religion, and language. The Africans brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum.\nVenezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has enriched the already complex cultural mosaic.\nArchitecture.\nCarlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitolio, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. In Venezuela, prehistoric man began to build useful architecture from approximately 1000 BC to the 15th century AD, in the period known as the \"Neo-Indian\". Neo-Indian architecture consisted of incipient constructions, such as agricultural terraces and vaults lined by stones, called mintoyes, which were used as tombs and silos for the storage of agricultural products. The Indo-Hispanic architecture is the one that begins to develop from the year 1498 AD. Venezuelan colonial architecture is built from the 16th century, when Venezuela began to be a dependent colony of the Spanish Empire, until 1810, when the process of Venezuelan independence began.\nThe architecture of this period is characterized by its discreet modesty, with the exception of some cities. The explanation lies in the socioeconomic conditions of the country. Venezuela did not offer then to the colonizers the immense riches kept by nature for later times. The simplification of technical problems, the renunciation of most of the decorative elements and variegated ostentations of fanciful baroque, the impossibility of using expensive materials and the consequent lack of craftsmen, contributed to establish a modest but well-defined physiognomy of the colonial architecture of Venezuela. During the colonial period, there were eventually confrontations between the Spanish conquerors and the barbarians and pirates that sailed along the Venezuelan coasts, in order to take over the provinces located on the coasts of the country.\nChristian temples from the colonial era were constituted by an almost invariable arrangement consisting of a rectangular plan, three naves separated by arches of alfarje roofing composed of religious architecture in colonial times. The Venezuelan society dedicated a great amount of resources to erect religious monuments comparable to those of other countries of the continent. The XVII century was of reconstruction of the Catholic churches that had been destroyed by the earthquake of 1641. In the 18th century, specifically between 1728 and 1785, the prosperity that Venezuela enjoyed due to the opening of the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guipuzcoana de Caracas was also reflected in the construction of new architecture, especially of a religious nature.\nArt.\nVenezuelan art was initially dominated by religious motifs. However, in the late 19th century, artists began emphasizing historical and heroic representations of the country's struggle for independence. This move was led by Mart\u00edn Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Crist\u00f3bal Rojas, Armando Rever\u00f3n, Manuel Cabr\u00e9; the kinetic artists Jes\u00fas Soto, Gego and Carlos Cruz-Diez; and contemporary artists such as Marisol and Yucef Merhi.\nLiterature.\nVenezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate Indigenous societies. It was originally dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco and Ferm\u00edn Toro.\nMajor writers and novelists include R\u00f3mulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano Gonz\u00e1lez Le\u00f3n, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Pic\u00f3n Salas. The great poet and humanist Andr\u00e9s Bello was also an educator and intellectual (He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar). Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and Jos\u00e9 Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism.\nMusic.\nThe Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by groups like Un Solo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument is the cuatro. Traditional musical styles and songs mainly emerged in and around the llanos region, including \"Alma llanera\" (by Pedro El\u00edas Guti\u00e9rrez and Rafael Bol\u00edvar Coronado), \"Florentino y el diablo\" (by Alberto Arvelo Torrealba), \"Concierto en la llanura\" by Juan Vicente Torrealba, and \"Caballo viejo\" (by Sim\u00f3n D\u00edaz).\nThe Zulian gaita is also a very popular genre, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the joropo. Venezuela has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness and variety of its musical styles and dances: calipso, bambuco, ful\u00eda, cantos de pilado de ma\u00edz, cantos de lavanderas, sebuc\u00e1n, and maremare. Teresa Carre\u00f1o was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso. Recently, great classical music performances have come out of Venezuela. The Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Youth Orchestra has hosted a number of excellent concerts in many European concert halls, most notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors. The orchestra is the pinnacle of El Sistema, a publicly financed, voluntary music education program now being emulated in other countries.\nIn the early 21st century, a movement known as \"Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana\" featured musicians trying to save some national traditions, creating their own original songs but using traditional instruments. Some groups following this movement are Tambor Urbano, Los Sinverguenzas, C4Tr\u00edo, and Orozco Jam.\nAfro-Venezuelan musical traditions are most intimately related to the festivals of the \"black folk saints\" San Juan and St. Benedict the Moor. Specific songs are related to the different stages of their festivals and processions, when the saints start their yearly \"paseo\" \u2013 stroll \u2013 through the community.\nSport.\nThe origins of baseball in Venezuela are unclear, although it is known that the sport was being played in the country by the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in the nation's oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela. During the 1930s, baseball's popularity continued to rise in the country, leading to the foundation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation's most popular.\nThe popularity of baseball in the country makes Venezuela a rarity among its South American neighbors\u2014association football is the dominant sport in the continent. However, football, as well as basketball, are among the more popular sports played in Venezuela. Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in the Poliedro de Caracas.\nAlthough not as popular in Venezuela as the rest of South America, football, spearheaded by the Venezuela national football team is gaining popularity as well. The sport is also noted for having an increased focus during the World Cup. Venezuela is scheduled to host the Copa Am\u00e9rica every 40 years.\nVenezuela is also home to former Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado. Maldonado has increased the reception of Formula 1 in Venezuela, helping to popularize the sport in the country.\nIn the 2012 Summer Olympics, Rub\u00e9n Limardo won a gold medal in fencing.\nIn the Winter Sports, Cesar Baena had represented the country since 2008 in Nordic Skiing, the first South American skier to compete in a FIS Cross Country Ski World Cup on D\u00fcsseldorf 2009.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTalks and interviews.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32375", "revid": "47362818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32375", "title": "Voltaire", "text": "French writer, historian, and philosopher (1694\u20131778)\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet (; 21 November 1694\u00a0\u2013 30 May 1778), known by his \"nom de plume\" Voltaire (, ; ), was a French Enlightenment writer, philosopher (\"philosophe\"), satirist, and historian. Famous for his wit and his criticism of Christianity (especially of the Catholic Church) and of slavery, Voltaire was an advocate of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and separation of church and state.\nVoltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, histories, and even scientific expositions. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and 2,000 books and pamphlets. Voltaire was one of the first authors to become renowned and commercially successful internationally. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties and was at constant risk from the strict censorship laws of the Catholic French monarchy. His polemics witheringly satirized intolerance and religious dogma, as well as the French institutions of his day. His best-known work and \"magnum opus\", \"Candide\", is a novella that comments on, criticizes, and ridicules many events, thinkers and philosophies of his time, most notably Gottfried Leibniz and his belief that our world is of necessity the \"best of all possible worlds\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of Fran\u00e7ois Arouet, a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard, whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility. Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Gu\u00e9rin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Two of his older brothers\u2014Armand-Fran\u00e7ois and Robert\u2014died in infancy. His surviving brother Armand and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively. \nNicknamed \"Zozo\" by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with Fran\u00e7ois de Castagn\u00e8re, abb\u00e9 de Ch\u00e2teauneuf, and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand (1704\u20131711), where he was taught Latin, theology, and rhetoric. Later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English.\nBy the time he left school, Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer, against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to become a lawyer. Voltaire, pretending to work in Paris as an assistant to a notary, spent much of his time writing poetry. When his father found out, he sent Voltaire to study law, this time in Caen, Normandy. But the young man continued to write, producing essays and historical studies. Voltaire's wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed.\nIn 1713, his father obtained a job for him as a secretary to the new French ambassador in the Netherlands, the marquis de Ch\u00e2teauneuf, the brother of Voltaire's godfather. At The Hague, Voltaire fell in love with a French Protestant refugee named Catherine Olympe Dunoyer (known as 'Pimpette'). Their affair, considered scandalous, was discovered by de Ch\u00e2teauneuf and Voltaire was forced to return to France by the end of the year.\nMost of Voltaire's early life revolved around Paris. From early on, Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government. As a result, he was twice sentenced to prison and once to temporary exile to England. One satirical verse, in which Voltaire accused the R\u00e9gent of incest with his daughter, resulted in an eleven-month imprisonment in the Bastille. The \"Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\" had agreed in January 1717 to stage his debut play, \"\u0152dipe\", and it opened in mid-November 1718, seven months after his release. Its immediate critical and financial success established his reputation. Both the R\u00e9gent and King George I of Great Britain presented Voltaire with medals as a mark of their appreciation.\nVoltaire mainly argued for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. He campaigned to eradicate priestly and aristo-monarchical authority, and supported a constitutional monarchy that protects people's rights.\nName.\nArouet adopted the name Voltaire in 1718, following his incarceration at the Bastille. Its origin is unclear. It is an anagram of \"AROVET LI\", the Latinized spelling of his surname, Arouet, and the initial letters of (\"the young\"). According to a family tradition among the descendants of his sister, he was known as (\"determined little thing\") as a child, and he resurrected a variant of the name in his adult life. The name also reverses the syllables of Airvault, his family's home town in the Poitou region.\nRichard Holmes supports the anagrammatic derivation of the name, but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey connotations of speed and daring. These come from associations with words such as (acrobatics on a trapeze or horse), \"volte-face\" (a spinning about to face one's enemies), and \"volatile\" (originally, any winged creature). \"Arouet\" was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation, especially given that name's resonance with (\"to be beaten up\") and (a \"d\u00e9bauch\u00e9\").\nIn a letter to Jean-Baptiste Rousseau in March 1719, Voltaire concludes by asking that, if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter, he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire. A postscript explains: \"\", (\"I was so unhappy under the name of Arouet that I have taken another, primarily so as to cease to be confused with the poet Roi.\") This probably refers to Adenes le Roi, and the 'oi' diphthong was then pronounced like modern 'ouai', so the similarity to 'Arouet' is clear, and thus, it could well have been part of his rationale. Voltaire is known also to have used at least 178 separate pen names during his lifetime.\nCareer.\nEarly fiction.\nVoltaire's next play, \"Art\u00e9mire\", set in ancient Macedonia, opened on 15 February 1720. It was a flop and only fragments of the text survive. He instead turned to an epic poem about Henry IV of France that he had begun in early 1717. Denied a licence to publish, in August 1722 Voltaire headed north to find a publisher outside France. On the journey, he was accompanied by his mistress, Marie-Marguerite de Rupelmonde, a young widow.\nAt Brussels, Voltaire and Rousseau met up for a few days, before Voltaire and his mistress continued northwards. A publisher was eventually secured in The Hague. In the Netherlands, Voltaire was struck and impressed by the openness and tolerance of Dutch society. On his return to France, he secured a second publisher in Rouen, who agreed to publish \"La Henriade\" clandestinely. After Voltaire's recovery from a month-long smallpox infection in November 1723, the first copies were smuggled into Paris and distributed. While the poem was an instant success, Voltaire's new play, \"Mariamne\", was a failure when it first opened in March 1724. Heavily reworked, it opened at the \"Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\" in April 1725 to a much-improved reception. It was among the entertainments provided at the wedding of Louis XV and Marie Leszczy\u0144ska in September 1725.\nExile in England.\nIn early 1726, Guy Auguste de Rohan-Chabot taunted Voltaire about his name change, who retorted that his name would win the esteem of the world, while Rohan would sully his own. A furious Rohan arranged for his servants to beat Voltaire a few days later. Seeking redress, Voltaire challenged Rohan to a duel, but the powerful Rohan family arranged for Voltaire to be arrested and imprisoned without trial in the Bastille on 17 April 1726. Fearing indefinite imprisonment, Voltaire asked to be exiled to England as an alternative punishment, which the French authorities accepted. On 2 May, he was escorted from the Bastille to Calais and embarked for England.\nIn England, Voltaire lived largely in Wandsworth, with acquaintances including Everard Fawkener, an English merchant whom he had met in Paris. In late 1726, he lived for a year in rented rooms on Durham Court, near today's John Adam Street, south of the Strand, in a house belonging to the former secretary of Lord Bolingbroke, which gave Voltaire an ideal location in the centre of the capital.\n From December 1727 to June 1728 he lodged above The White Peruke, a French barber/wig maker shop at 10 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, now commemorated by a green plaque, to be nearer to his British publisher, Peter Vaillant, a Huguenot printer and bookseller. The Huguenot printing community located in this area had numerous French \u00e9migr\u00e9s and a French church at the Savoy, making Voltaire feel at home.\nVoltaire circulated throughout English high society, meeting Alexander Pope, John Gay, Jonathan Swift, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and many other members of the nobility and royalty. Voltaire's exile in England greatly influenced his thinking. He was intrigued by Britain's constitutional monarchy in contrast to French absolutism and by the country's greater freedom of speech and religion. He was influenced by the writers of the time and developed an interest in English literature, especially Shakespeare, who was still little known in continental Europe. Despite pointing out Shakespeare's deviations from neoclassical standards, Voltaire saw him as an example for French drama, which, though more polished, lacked on-stage action. Later, as Shakespeare's influence began growing in France, Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays, decrying what he considered Shakespeare's barbarities.\nVoltaire may have been present at the funeral of Isaac Newton and met Newton's niece Catherine Conduitt. In 1727, Voltaire published two essays in English, \"Upon the Civil Wars of France, Extracted from Curious Manuscripts\" and \"Upon Epic Poetry of the European Nations, from Homer Down to Milton\". He also published a letter about the Quakers after attending one of their services.\nAfter two and a half years in exile, Voltaire returned to France, and after a few months in Dieppe, the authorities permitted him to return to Paris. At a dinner, French mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts, and Voltaire joined the consortium, earning perhaps a million livres. He invested the money cleverly and on this basis managed to convince the Court of Finances of his responsible conduct, allowing him to take control of a trust fund inherited from his father. He was now indisputably rich.\nFurther success followed in 1732 with his play \"Za\u00efre\", which when published in 1733 carried a dedication to Fawkener praising English liberty and commerce. He published his admiring essays on British government, literature, religion, and science in \"Letters Concerning the English Nation\" (London, 1733). In 1734, they were published in Rouen as \"Lettres philosophiques\", causing a huge scandal. Published without approval of the royal censor, the essays lauded British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights than its French counterpart, particularly regarding religious tolerance. The book was publicly burnt and banned, and Voltaire was again forced to flee Paris.\nCh\u00e2teau de Cirey.\nIn 1733, Voltaire met \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet (Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet), a mathematician and married mother of three, who was 12 years his junior and with whom he was to have an affair for 16 years. To avoid arrest after the publication of \"Lettres\", Voltaire took refuge at her husband's ch\u00e2teau at Cirey on the borders of Champagne and Lorraine. Voltaire paid for the building's renovation, and \u00c9milie's husband sometimes stayed at the ch\u00e2teau with his wife and her lover. The intellectual paramours collected around 21,000 books, an enormous number for the time. Together, they studied these books and performed scientific experiments at Cirey, including an attempt to determine the nature of fire.\nHaving learned from his previous brushes with the authorities, Voltaire began his habit of avoiding open confrontation with the authorities and denying any awkward responsibility. He continued to write plays, such as \"M\u00e9rope\" (or \"La M\u00e9rope fran\u00e7aise\") and began his long researches into science and history. Again, a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile, during which he had been strongly influenced by Newton's works. Voltaire strongly believed in Newton's theories; he performed experiments in optics at Cirey, and was one of the promulgators of the famous story of Newton's inspiration from the falling apple, which he had learned from Newton's niece in London and first mentioned in his \"Letters\".\nIn the fall of 1735, Voltaire was visited by Francesco Algarotti, who was preparing a book about Newton in Italian. Partly inspired by the visit, the Marquise translated Newton's Latin \"Principia\" into French, which remained the definitive French version into the 21st century. Both she and Voltaire were also curious about the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz, a contemporary and rival of Newton. While Voltaire remained a firm Newtonian, the Marquise adopted certain aspects of Leibniz's critiques. Voltaire's own book \"Elements of the Philosophy of Newton\" made the great scientist accessible to a far greater public, and the Marquise wrote a celebratory review in the . Voltaire's work was instrumental in bringing about general acceptance of Newton's optical and gravitational theories in France, in contrast to the theories of Descartes.\nVoltaire and the Marquise also studied history, particularly the great contributors to civilization. Voltaire's second essay in English had been \"Essay upon the Civil Wars in France\". It was followed by \"La Henriade\", an epic poem on the French King Henri IV, glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the Edict of Nantes, which established religious toleration. There followed a historical novel on King Charles XII of Sweden. These, along with his \"Letters on the English\", mark the beginning of Voltaire's open criticism of intolerance and established religions. Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy, particularly metaphysical questions concerning the existence of God and the soul. Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible and concluded that much of its content was dubious. Voltaire's critical views on religion led to his belief in separation of church and state and religious freedom, ideas that he had formed after his stay in England.\nIn August 1736, Frederick the Great, then Crown Prince of Prussia and a great admirer of Voltaire, initiated a correspondence with him. That December, Voltaire moved to Holland for two months and became acquainted with the scientists Herman Boerhaave and Willem 's Gravesande. From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels, at first with the Marquise, who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in Limburg. \nIn July 1740, he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher, van Duren, from printing without permission Frederick's \"Anti-Machiavel\". In September Voltaire and Frederick (now King) met for the first time in Moyland Castle near Cleves and in November Voltaire was Frederick's guest in Berlin for two weeks, followed by a meeting in September 1742 at Aix-la-Chapelle. Voltaire was sent to Frederick's court in 1743 by the French government as an envoy and spy to gauge Frederick's military intentions in the War of the Austrian Succession.\nThough deeply committed to the Marquise, Voltaire by 1744 found life at her ch\u00e2teau confining. On a visit to Paris that year, he found a new love\u2014his niece. At first, his attraction to Marie Louise Mignot was clearly sexual, as evidenced by his letters to her (only discovered in 1957). Much later, they lived together, perhaps platonically, and remained together until Voltaire's death. Meanwhile, the Marquise also took a lover, the Marquis de Saint-Lambert.\nPrussia.\nAfter the death of the Marquise in childbirth in September 1749, Voltaire briefly returned to Paris and in mid-1750 moved to Potsdam, Prussia, at the invitation of Frederick the Great. The Prussian king (with the permission of Louis XV) made him a chamberlain in his household, appointed him to the Order of Merit, and gave him a salary of 20,000 French livres a year. He had rooms at Sanssouci and Charlottenburg Palace. Life went well for Voltaire at first, and in 1751 he completed \"Microm\u00e9gas\", a piece of science fiction involving ambassadors from another planet witnessing the follies of humankind. However, his relationship with Frederick began to deteriorate after he was accused of theft and forgery by a Jewish financier, Abraham Hirschel, who had invested in Saxon government bonds on behalf of Voltaire at a time when Frederick was involved in sensitive diplomatic negotiations with Saxony.\nHe encountered other difficulties: an argument with Maupertuis, the president of the Berlin Academy of Science and a former rival for \u00c9milie's affections, provoked Voltaire's \"Diatribe du docteur Akakia\" (\"Diatribe of Doctor Akakia\"), which satirized some of Maupertuis's theories and his persecutions of a mutual acquaintance, Johann Samuel K\u00f6nig. This greatly angered Frederick, who ordered all copies of the document burned. On 1 January 1752, Voltaire offered to resign as chamberlain and return his insignia of the Order of Merit; at first, Frederick refused until eventually permitting Voltaire to leave in March. \nOn a slow journey back to France, Voltaire stayed at Leipzig and Gotha for a month each, and Kassel for two weeks, arriving at Frankfurt on 31 May. The following morning, he was detained at an inn by Frederick's agents, who held him in the city for over three weeks while Voltaire and Frederick argued by letter over the return of a satirical book of poetry Frederick had lent to Voltaire. Marie Louise joined him on 9 June. She and her uncle only left Frankfurt in July after she had defended herself from the unwanted advances of one of Frederick's agents, and Voltaire's luggage had been ransacked and valuable items taken.\nVoltaire's attempts to vilify Frederick for his agents' actions at Frankfurt were largely unsuccessful, including his \"M\u00e9moires pour Servir \u00e0 la Vie de M. de Voltaire,\" published posthumously, in which he also explicitly made mention of Frederick's homosexuality, when he described how the king regularly invited pages, young cadets or lieutenants from his regiment to have coffee with him and then withdrew with the favourite for a quickie. However, the correspondence between them continued, and though they never met in person again, after the Seven Years' War they largely reconciled.\nGeneva and Ferney.\nVoltaire's slow progress toward Paris continued through Mainz, Mannheim, Strasbourg, and Colmar, but in January 1754 Louis XV banned him from Paris, and he turned for Geneva, near which he bought a large estate (\"Les D\u00e9lices\") in early 1755. Though he was received openly at first, the law in Geneva, which banned theatrical performances, and the publication of \"The Maid of Orleans\" against his will soured his relationship with Calvinist Genevans. In late 1758, he bought an even larger estate at Ferney, on the French side of the Franco-Swiss border. The town would adopt his name, calling itself Ferney-Voltaire, and this became its official name in 1878.\nEarly in 1759, Voltaire completed and published \"Candide, ou l'Optimisme\" (\"Candide, or Optimism\"). This satire on Leibniz's philosophy of optimistic determinism remains Voltaire's best-known work. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life, frequently entertaining distinguished guests, such as James Boswell (who recorded their conversations in his journal and memoranda), Adam Smith, Giacomo Casanova, and Edward Gibbon. In 1764, he published one of his best-known philosophical works, the \"Dictionnaire philosophique\", a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas, a few of which were originally written in Berlin.\nFrom 1762, as an unmatched intellectual celebrity, he began to champion unjustly persecuted individuals, most famously the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas. Calas had been tortured to death in 1763, supposedly because he had murdered his eldest son for wanting to convert to Catholicism. His possessions were confiscated, and his two daughters were taken from his widow and forced into Catholic convents. Voltaire, seeing this as a clear case of religious persecution, managed to overturn the conviction in 1765.\nVoltaire was initiated into Freemasonry a little over a month before his death. On 4 April 1778, he attended \"la Loge des Neuf S\u0153urs\" in Paris, and became an Entered Apprentice Freemason. According to some sources, \"Benjamin Franklin\u00a0... urged Voltaire to become a freemason; and Voltaire agreed, perhaps only to please Franklin.\" However, Franklin was merely a visitor at the time Voltaire was initiated, the two only met a month before Voltaire's death, and their interactions with each other were brief.\nDeath and burial.\nIn February 1778, Voltaire returned to Paris for the first time in over 25 years, partly to see the opening of his latest tragedy, \"Ir\u00e8ne\". The five-day journey was too much for the 83-year-old, and he believed he was about to die on 28 February, writing \"I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting superstition.\" He recovered, and in March he saw a performance of \"Ir\u00e8ne\", being treated by the audience as a returning hero.\nHe soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778. The accounts of his deathbed have been numerous and varying, and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites from a Catholic priest, or that he died in agony of body and soul, while his adherents told of his defiance to his last breath. According to one story of his last words, when the priest urged him to renounce Satan, he replied, \"This is no time to make new enemies.\"\nBecause of his well-known criticism of the Church, which he had refused to retract before his death, Voltaire was denied a Christian burial in Paris, but friends and relations managed to bury his body secretly at the Abbey of Scelli\u00e8res in Champagne, where Marie Louise's brother was \"abb\u00e9\". His heart and brain were embalmed separately.\nOn 11 July 1791, the National Assembly of France, regarding Voltaire as a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought back to Paris and enshrined in the Panth\u00e9on. An estimated million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, including music composed for the event by Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try.\nWritings.\nHistory.\nVoltaire had an enormous influence on the development of historiography, particularly of France, through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.\nVoltaire's best-known histories are \"History of Charles XII\" (1731), \"The Age of Louis XIV\" (1751), and his \"Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations\" (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. The \"Essay on Customs\" traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context, rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference. Influenced by Bossuet's \"Discourse on Universal History\" (1682), he was the first scholar to attempt seriously a history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. He treated Europe as a whole rather than a collection of nations. He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization, but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and expanding literacy would lead to progress.\nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's \"Encyclop\u00e9die\": \"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\" Voltaire's histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare. Yale professor Peter Gay says Voltaire wrote \"very good history\", citing his \"scrupulous concern for truths\", \"careful sifting of evidence\", \"intelligent selection of what is important\", \"keen sense of drama\", and \"grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study\".\nPoetry.\nFrom an early age, Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse, and his first published work was poetry. He wrote two book-long epic poems, including the first ever written in French, the \"Henriade\", and later, \"The Maid of Orleans\", besides many other smaller pieces.\nThe \"Henriade\" was written in imitation of Virgil, using the alexandrine couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century, with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages. The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes. \"La Pucelle\", on the other hand, is a burlesque on the legend of Joan of Arc.\nProse.\nMany of Voltaire's prose works and romances, usually composed as pamphlets, were written as polemics. \"Candide\" attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz's philosophy of optimism through the character Pangloss's frequent refrain that, because God created it, this is of necessity the \"best of all possible worlds\". \"L'Homme aux quarante ecus\" (\"The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver\") addresses social and political ways of the time; \"Zadig\" and others, the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible. In these works, Voltaire's ironic style, free of exaggeration, is apparent, particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment. \"Candide\" in particular is the best example of his style. Voltaire also has\u2014in common with Jonathan Swift\u2014the distinction of paving the way for science fiction's philosophical irony, particularly in his \"Microm\u00e9gas\" and the vignette \"Plato's Dream\" (1756).\nIn general, his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire's other works. Almost all of his more substantive works, whether in verse or prose, are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another, which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone. In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings, he displays his skills at journalism. In pure literary criticism his principal work is the \"Commentaire sur Corneille\", although he wrote many more similar works\u2014sometimes (as in his \"Life and Notices of Moli\u00e8re\") independently and sometimes as part of his \"Si\u00e8cles\".\nVoltaire's works, especially his private letters, frequently urge the reader: \"\", or \"crush the infamous\". The phrase refers to contemporaneous abuses of power by royal and religious authorities, and the superstition and intolerance fomented by the clergy. He had seen and felt these effects in his own exiles, the burnings of his books and those of many others, and in the atrocious persecution of Jean Calas and Fran\u00e7ois-Jean de la Barre. He stated in one of his most famous quotes that \"Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy quenches them\" ().\nThe most oft-cited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal. He is incorrectly credited with writing, \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" These were not his words, but rather those of Evelyn Beatrice Hall, written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book \"The Friends of Voltaire\". Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire's attitude towards Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius and his controversial book \"De l'esprit\", but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire's attitude towards Helv\u00e9tius; it had been said Hall's summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche, in which he was reported to have said, \"I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.\" Nevertheless, scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation, as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.\nVoltaire's first major philosophical work in his battle against \"\" was the \"Trait\u00e9 sur la tol\u00e9rance\" (\"Treatise on Tolerance\"), exposing the Calas affair, along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras (for example, by the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks and the Chinese). Then, in his \"Dictionnaire philosophique\", containing such articles as \"Abraham\", \"Genesis\", \"Church Council\", he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs, as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets, Voltaire criticized France's colonial policy in North America, dismissing the vast territory of New France as \"a few acres of snow\" (\"\").\nLetters.\nVoltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life, totalling over 20,000 letters. Theodore Besterman's collected edition of these letters, completed only in 1964, fills 102 volumes. One historian called the letters \"a feast not only of wit and eloquence but of warm friendship, humane feeling, and incisive thought.\"\nIn Voltaire's correspondence with Catherine the Great he derided democracy. He wrote, \"Almost nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius and firmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the multitude.\"\nReligious and philosophical views.\nLike other key Enlightenment thinkers, Voltaire was a deist. He challenged orthodoxy by asking: \"What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason.\"\nIn a 1763 essay, Voltaire supported the toleration of other religions and ethnicities: \"It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?\"\nIn one of his many denunciations of priests of every religious sect, Voltaire describes them as those who \"rise from an incestuous bed, manufacture a hundred versions of God, then eat and drink God, then piss and shit God.\"\nChristianity.\nHistorians have described Voltaire's description of the history of Christianity as \"propagandistic\". His \"Dictionnaire philosophique\" is responsible for the myth that the early Church had fifty gospels before settling on the standard canonical four as well as propagating the myth that the canon of the New Testament was decided at the First Council of Nicaea. Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression \"Credo quia absurdum\" to the Church Fathers. \nDespite the death of Hypatia being the result of finding herself in the crossfires of a mob (likely Christian) during a political feud in 4th-century Alexandria, Voltaire promoted the theory that she was stripped naked and murdered by the minions of the bishop Cyril of Alexandria, concluding by stating that \"when one finds a beautiful woman completely naked, it is not for the purpose of massacring her.\" Voltaire meant for this argument to bolster one of his anti-Catholic tracts. In a letter to Frederick the Great, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out.\"\nIn \"La bible enfin expliqu\u00e9e\", he expressed the following attitude to lay reading of the Bible: It is characteristic of fanatics who read the holy scriptures to tell themselves: God killed, so I must kill; Abraham lied, Jacob deceived, Rachel stole: so I must steal, deceive, lie. But, wretch, you are neither Rachel, nor Jacob, nor Abraham, nor God; you are just a mad fool, and the popes who forbade the reading of the Bible were extremely wise.\nVoltaire's opinion of the Bible was mixed. Although influenced by Socinian works such as the \"Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum\", Voltaire's skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like Fausto Sozzini or even Biblical-political writers like John Locke. His statements on religion also brought down on him the fury of the Jesuits and in particular Claude-Adrien Nonnotte. This did not hinder his religious practice, though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles. The deeply Christian Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote to his father the year of Voltaire's death, saying, \"The arch-scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket ...\" Voltaire was later deemed to influence Edward Gibbon in claiming that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire in his book \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\":As Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire\u2014arts, science, literature, decay\u2014barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph\u2014and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion\u2014the abominable Manicheism of \"Candide\", and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire's historic school\u2014viz., \"that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil.\"\nVoltaire acknowledged the self-sacrifice of Christians. He wrote: \"Perhaps there is nothing greater on earth than the sacrifice of youth and beauty, often of high birth, made by the gentle sex in order to work in hospitals for the relief of human misery, the sight of which is so revolting to our delicacy. Peoples separated from the Roman religion have imitated but imperfectly so generous a charity.\" Yet, according to Daniel-Rops, Voltaire's \"hatred of religion increased with the passage of years. The attack, launched at first against clericalism and theocracy, ended in a furious assault upon Holy Scripture, the dogmas of the Church, and even upon the person of Jesus Christ Himself, who [he] depicted now as a degenerate.\" Voltaire's reasoning may be summed up in his well-known saying, \".\"\nJudaism.\nAccording to Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin, the most significant Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire; 30 of the 118 articles in his \"Dictionnaire philosophique\" dealt with Jews or Judaism, describing them in consistently negative ways. For example, he wrote: \"In short, we find in them only an ignorant and barbarous people, who have long united the most sordid avarice with the most detestable superstition and the most invincible hatred for every people by whom they are tolerated and enriched.\" Telushkin states that Voltaire did not limit his attack to aspects of Judaism that Christianity used as a foundation, repeatedly making it clear that he despised Jews.\nOn the other hand, Peter Gay, a contemporary authority on the Enlightenment, points to Voltaire's remarks (for instance, that the Jews were more tolerant than the Christians) in the \"Trait\u00e9 sur la tol\u00e9rance\" and surmises that \"Voltaire struck at the Jews to strike at Christianity\". Whatever anti-semitism Voltaire may have felt, Gay suggests, derived from negative personal experience.\nArthur Hertzberg, a Conservative Rabbi, claims that Gay's second suggestion is untenable, as Voltaire himself denied its validity when he remarked that he had \"forgotten about much larger bankruptcies through Christians\". However, Bertram Schwarzbach's far more detailed studies of Voltaire's dealings with Jewish people throughout his life concluded that he was anti-biblical, not anti-semitic. His remarks on the Jews and their \"superstitions\" were essentially no different from his remarks on Christians.\nVoltaire said of the Jews that they \"have surpassed all nations in impertinent fables, in bad conduct and in barbarism. You deserve to be punished, for this is your destiny.\" He further said, \"They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.\"\nSome authors link Voltaire's anti-Judaism to his polygenism. According to Joxe Azurmendi this anti-Judaism has a relative importance in Voltaire's philosophy of history. However, Voltaire's anti-Judaism influenced later authors like Ernest Renan.\nVoltaire did have a Jewish friend, Daniel de Fonseca, whom he esteemed highly, and proclaimed him as \"the only philosopher, perhaps, among the Jews of his time\".\nVoltaire condemned the persecution of Jews on several occasions, including in \"Henriade\", and he never advocated violence or attacks against them. According to the historian Will Durant, Voltaire praised the simplicity, sobriety, regularity, and industry of Jews, but became strongly anti-Semitic after some personal financial transactions and quarrels with Jewish financiers. In his \"Essai sur les moeurs\" Voltaire denounced the ancient Hebrews in strong language. \nThe anti-Semitic passages in Voltaire's \"Dictionnaire philosophique\" were criticized by Isaac De Pinto in 1762. Voltaire agreed with the criticism of the anti-Semitic passages and stated that De Pinto's letter convinced him that there are \"highly intelligent and cultivated people\" among the Jews and that he had been \"wrong to attribute to a whole nation the vices of some individuals\". He also promised to revise the objectionable passages for forthcoming editions of the \"Dictionnaire philosophique\", but he failed to do so.\nIslam.\nVoltaire's views about Islam were generally negative, and he found its holy book, the Quran, to be ignorant of the laws of physics. In a 1740 letter to Frederick the Great, Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that \"is assuredly nothing any man can excuse\" and suggests that his following stemmed from superstition. Voltaire continued, \"But that a camel-merchant should stir up insurrection in his village; that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel; that he boasts of having been carried to heaven, where he received in part this unintelligible book, each page of which makes common sense shudder; that, to pay homage to this book, he delivers his country to iron and flame; that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters; that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death: this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse, at least if he was not born a Turk, or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him.\"\nIn 1748, after having read Henri de Boulainvilliers and George Sale, he wrote again about Mohammed and Islam in \"De l'Alcoran et de Mahomet\" (\"On the Quran and on Mohammed\"). In this essay, Voltaire maintained that Mohammed was a \"sublime charlatan\". Drawing on complementary information in Herbelot's \"Oriental Library\", Voltaire, according to Ren\u00e9 Pomeau, adjudged the Quran, with its \"contradictions, ... absurdities, ... anachronisms\", to be \"rhapsody, without connection, without order, and without art\". \nThus he \"henceforward conceded\" that \"if his book was bad for our times and for us, it was very good for his contemporaries, and his religion even more so. It must be admitted that he removed almost all of Asia from idolatry\" and that \"it was difficult for such a simple and wise religion, taught by a man who was constantly victorious, could hardly fail to subjugate a portion of the earth.\" He considered that \"its civil laws are good; its dogma is admirable which it has in common with ours\" but that \"his means are shocking; deception and murder\".\nIn his \"Essay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations\" (published 1756), Voltaire deals with the history of Europe before Charlemagne to the dawn of the age of Louis XIV, and that of the colonies and the East. As a historian, he devoted several chapters to Islam, He highlighted the Arabian, Turkish courts, and conducts. Here he called Mohammed a \"poet\", and stated that he was not an illiterate. As a \"legislator\", he \"changed the face of part of Europe [and] one half of Asia.\" \nIn chapter VI, Voltaire finds similarities between Arabs and ancient Hebrews, that they both kept running to battle in the name of God, and sharing a passion for the spoils of war. Voltaire continues that, \"It is to be believed that Mohammed, like all enthusiasts, violently struck by his ideas, first presented them in good faith, strengthened them with fantasy, fooled himself in fooling others, and supported through necessary deceptions a doctrine which he considered good.\" He thus compares \"the genius of the Arab people\" with \"the genius of the ancient Romans\".\nAccording to Malise Ruthven, as Voltaire learned more about Islam, his opinion of the faith became more positive. As a result, his play \"Mahomet\" inspired Goethe, who was attracted to Islam, to write a drama on this theme, though he completed only the poem \"Mahomets-Gesang\" (\"Mahomet's Singing\").\nDrama \"Mahomet\".\nThe tragedy \"Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet\" () was written in 1736 by Voltaire. The play is a study of religious fanaticism and self-serving manipulation. The character Muhammad orders the murder of his critics. Voltaire described the play as \"written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect.\"\nVoltaire described Muhammad as an \"impostor\", a \"false prophet\", a \"fanatic\" and a \"hypocrite\". Defending the play, he said that he \"tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism, led by an impostor, can plunge weak minds\". When Voltaire wrote in 1742 to C\u00e9sar de Missy, he described Muhammad as deceitful.\nIn his play, Muhammad is \"whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.\" After later having judged that he had made Muhammad in his play \"somewhat nastier than he really was\", Voltaire claimed that Muhammad stole the idea of an angel weighing both men and women from Zoroastrians, who are often referred to as \"Magi\". Voltaire continued about Islam, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nothing is more terrible than a people who, having nothing to lose, fight in the united spirit of rapine and of religion.\nIn a 1745 letter recommending the play to Pope Benedict XIV, Voltaire described Muhammad as \"the founder of a false and barbarous sect\" and \"a false prophet\". Voltaire wrote: \"Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet, than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy?\" His view was modified slightly for \"Essai sur les Moeurs et l'Esprit des Nations\", although it remained negative. In 1751, Voltaire performed his play \"Mohamet\" once again, with great success.\nHinduism.\nIn 1760, Voltaire received the book \"Ezourvedam\" for learning the \"true meaning\" of the Hindu Vedas. However, by 1761, Voltaire treated \"Ezourvedam\" to be a mere commentary on the Vedas.\nVoltaire, a supporter of animal rights and a vegetarian, used the antiquity of Hinduism to land what he saw as a devastating blow to the Bible's claims and acknowledged that the Hindus' treatment of animals showed a shaming alternative to the immorality of European imperialists.\nVoltaire received another text, \"Cormovedam\", which he regarded as a summary of opinions and rites found in the Vedas. He cited this text mainly for showing how the Brahmins and the Vedas had degenerated. He described it thus in 1761: \"[T]heir [i.e., the Brahmins'] ritual, is a bunch\u00a0of superstitious ceremonies that make anybody who is not born on the banks of the Ganges\u00a0or Indus laugh\u2014or rather, anyone who, not being a philosophe, is surprised about the\u00a0stupidities\u00a0of other peoples and not amazed at those of his own country\".\nConfucianism.\nWorks attributed to Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit missionaries stationed in China. Matteo Ricci was among the earliest to report on the teachings of Confucius, and father Prospero Intorcetta wrote about the life and works of Confucius in Latin in 1687.\nTranslations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period, particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who hoped to improve European morals and institutions by the serene doctrines of the East. Voltaire shared these hopes, seeing Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma. He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Confucius has no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; flattered not the emperor under whom he lived...\u2014\u200a\nWith the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" of Europe. Voltaire wrote favourably of the idea, claiming that the Chinese had \"perfected moral science\" and advocating an economic and political system after the Chinese model.\nViews on race and slavery.\nVoltaire rejected the biblical Adam and Eve story and was a polygenist who speculated that each race had entirely separate origins. According to William Cohen, like most other polygenists, Voltaire believed that because of their different origins, Black Africans did not entirely share the natural humanity of white Europeans. According to David Allen Harvey, Voltaire often invoked racial differences as a means to attack religious orthodoxy, and the Biblical account of creation. Other historians, instead, have suggested that Voltaire's support for polygenism was more heavily encouraged by his investments in the French Compagnie des Indes and other colonial enterprises that engaged in the slave trade.\nHis most famous remark on slavery is found in \"Candide\", where the hero is horrified to learn \"at what price we eat sugar in Europe\" after coming across a slave in French Guiana who has been mutilated for escaping, who opines that, if all human beings have common origins as the Bible taught, it makes them cousins, concluding that \"no one could treat their relatives more horribly\". Elsewhere, he wrote caustically about \"whites and Christians [who] proceed to purchase negroes cheaply, in order to sell them dear in America\". Voltaire has been accused of supporting the slave trade as per a letter attributed to him, although it has been suggested that this letter is a forgery \"since no satisfying source attests to the letter's existence.\"\nIn his \"Philosophical Dictionary\", Voltaire endorses Montesquieu's criticism of the slave trade: \"Montesquieu was almost always in error with the learned, because he was not learned, but he was almost always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery.\"\nZeev Sternhell argues that despite his shortcomings, Voltaire was a forerunner of liberal pluralism in his approach to history and non-European cultures. Voltaire wrote, \"We have slandered the Chinese because their metaphysics is not the same as ours\u00a0... This great misunderstanding about Chinese rituals has come about because we have judged their usages by ours, for we carry the prejudices of our contentious spirit to the end of the world.\" In speaking of Persia, he condemned Europe's \"ignorant audacity\" and \"ignorant credulity\". When writing about India, he declares, \"It is time for us to give up the shameful habit of slandering all sects and insulting all nations!\" In \"Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations\", he defended the integrity of the Native Americans and wrote favorably of the Inca Empire.\nAppreciation and influence.\nAccording to Victor Hugo: \"To name Voltaire is to characterize the entire eighteenth century.\" Goethe regarded Voltaire as the greatest literary figure of modern times, and possibly of all time. According to Diderot, Voltaire's influence would extend far into the future. Napoleon commented that till he was sixteen he \"would have fought for Rousseau against the friends of Voltaire, today it is the opposite\u00a0... The more I read Voltaire the more I love him. He is a man always reasonable, never a charlatan, never a fanatic\", though he later criticized Voltaire's work \"Mahomet\" during his captivity on Saint Helena. \nFrederick the Great commented on his good fortune for having lived in the age of Voltaire, and corresponded with him throughout his reign until Voltaire's death. On 12 May 1760, Frederick wrote: \"For my part I shall go to Hades and tell Virgil that a Frenchman has surpassed him in his own art. I shall say as much to Sophocles and Euripides; I shall speak to Thucydides of your histories, to Quintus Curtius of your \"Charles XII\"; and perhaps I shall be stoned by these jealous dead because a single man has united all their different merits in himself.\" In England, Voltaire's views influenced Godwin, Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Bentham, Byron and Shelley. Macaulay made note of the fear that Voltaire's very name incited in tyrants and fanatics.\nIn Russia, Catherine the Great had been reading Voltaire for sixteen years prior to becoming Empress in 1762. In October 1763, she began a correspondence with the philosopher that continued till his death. The content of these letters has been described as being akin to a student writing to a teacher. Upon Voltaire's death, the Empress purchased his library, which was then transported and placed in The Hermitage. Alexander Herzen remarked that \"The writings of the egoist Voltaire did more for liberation than those of the loving Rousseau did for brotherhood.\" In his famous letter to N. V. Gogol, Vissarion Belinsky wrote that Voltaire \"stamped out the fires of fanaticism and ignorance in Europe by ridicule.\"\nIn his native Paris, Voltaire was remembered as the defender of Jean Calas and Pierre Sirven. Although Voltaire's campaign had failed to secure the annulment of la Barre's execution for blasphemy against Christianity, the criminal code that sanctioned the execution was revised during Voltaire's lifetime. \nIn 1764, Voltaire successfully intervened and secured the release of Claude Chamont, arrested for attending Protestant services. When Comte de Lally was executed for treason in 1766, Voltaire wrote a 300-page document in his defense. Subsequently, in 1778, the judgment against de Lally was expunged just before Voltaire's death. The Genevan Protestant minister Pomaret once said to Voltaire, \"You seem to attack Christianity, and yet you do the work of a Christian.\" Frederick the Great noted the significance of a philosopher capable of influencing judges to change their unjust decisions, commenting that this alone is sufficient to ensure the prominence of Voltaire as a humanitarian.\nUnder the French Third Republic, anarchists and socialists often invoked Voltaire's writings in their struggles against militarism, nationalism, and the Catholic Church. The section condemning the futility and imbecility of war in the \"Dictionnaire philosophique\" was a frequent favorite, as were his arguments that nations can only grow at the expense of others. Following the liberation of France from the Vichy regime in 1944, Voltaire's 250th birthday was celebrated in both France and the Soviet Union, honoring him as \"one of the most feared opponents\" of the Nazi collaborators and someone \"whose name symbolizes freedom of thought, and hatred of prejudice, superstition, and injustice.\"\nJorge Luis Borges stated that \"not to admire Voltaire is one of the many forms of stupidity\" and included his short fiction such as \"Microm\u00e9gas\" in \"The Library of Babel\" and \"A Personal Library.\" Gustave Flaubert believed that France had erred gravely by not following the path forged by Voltaire instead of Rousseau. Most architects of modern America were adherents of Voltaire's views. According to Will Durant:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVoltaire and Rousseau.\nVoltaire's junior contemporary Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented on how Voltaire's book \"Letters on the English\" played a great role in his intellectual development. Having written some literary works and also some music, in December 1745 Rousseau wrote a letter introducing himself to Voltaire, who was by then the most prominent literary figure in France, to which Voltaire replied with a polite response. Subsequently, when Rousseau sent Voltaire a copy of his book \"Discourse on Inequality\", Voltaire replied, noting his disagreement with the views expressed in the book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No one has ever employed so much intellect to persuade men to be beasts. In reading your work one is seized with a desire to walk on all fours []. However, as it is more than sixty years since I lost that habit, I feel, unfortunately, that it is impossible for me to resume it.\nSubsequently, commenting on Rousseau's romantic novel \"Julie, or the New Heloise\", Voltaire stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No more about Jean-Jacques' romance if you please. I have read it, to my sorrow, and it would be to his if I had time to say what I think of this silly book.\nVoltaire quipped that the first half of \"Julie\" had been written in a brothel and the second half in a lunatic asylum. In his \"Lettres sur La Nouvelle Heloise\", written under a pseudonym, Voltaire criticized Rousseau's grammatical mistakes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Paris recognized Voltaire's hand and judged the patriarch to be bitten by jealousy.\nIn reviewing Rousseau's book \"Emile\", Voltaire dismissed it as \"a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity, among the boldest ever known.\" He expressed admiration for the section titled \"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\", calling it \"fifty good pages\u00a0... it is regrettable that they should have been written by\u00a0... such a knave.\" He went on to predict that \"Emile\" would be forgotten within a month.\nIn 1764, Rousseau published \"Lettres de la montagne\" on religion and politics. In the fifth letter he wondered why Voltaire had not been able to imbue the Genevan councilors, who frequently met him, \"with that spirit of tolerance which he preaches without cease, and of which he sometimes has need\". The letter continued with an imaginary speech in the voice of Voltaire, acknowledging authorship of the heretical book \"Sermon of the Fifty\", which the real Voltaire had repeatedly denied.\nIn 1772, when a priest sent Rousseau a pamphlet denouncing Voltaire, Rousseau responded by defending his rival:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He has said and done so many good things that we should draw the curtain over his irregularities.\nIn 1778, when Voltaire was given unprecedented honors at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, an acquaintance of Rousseau ridiculed the event. This was met by a sharp retort from Rousseau:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How dare you mock the honors rendered to Voltaire in the temple of which he is the god, and by the priests who for fifty years have been living off his masterpieces?\nOn 2 July 1778, Rousseau died one month after Voltaire. In October 1794, Rousseau's remains were moved to the Panth\u00e9on near the remains of Voltaire.\nLouis XVI, while incarcerated in the Temple, lamented that Rousseau and Voltaire had \"destroyed France\".\nLegacy.\nVoltaire perceived the French bourgeoisie to be too small and ineffective, the aristocracy to be parasitic and corrupt, the commoners as ignorant and superstitious, and the Church as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings, although all too often, even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy, which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses. Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change, given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy, and that it was in the king's rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects.\nHis disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works, his novella \"Candide, ou l'Optimisme\" (\"Candide, or Optimism,\" 1759), which ends with a new conclusion of quietism: \"It is up to us to cultivate our garden.\" His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. \"Candide\" was also burned, and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain 'Demad' in a letter, where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.\nHe is remembered and honored in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for civil rights (such as the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion) and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". The \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three Estates: clergy and nobles on one side, the commoners and middle class, who were burdened with most of the taxes, on the other. He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by the Chinese philosopher Confucius.\nVoltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms, such as \"\" (\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\"), contained in a verse epistle from 1768, addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on \"The Three Impostors\". But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for, it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as d'Holbach, Grimm, and others.\nHe has had his detractors among his later colleagues. The Scottish Victorian writer Thomas Carlyle argued that \"Voltaire read history, not with the eye of devout seer or even critic, but through a pair of mere anti-catholic spectacles.\"\nThe town of Ferney, where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life, was officially named Ferney-Voltaire in honor of its most famous resident, in 1878. His \"ch\u00e2teau\" is a museum. Voltaire's library is preserved intact in the National Library of Russia at Saint Petersburg. In the Z\u00fcrich of 1916, the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant-garde Dada movement named their theater the Cabaret Voltaire. A late-20th-century industrial music group later adopted the same name. Astronomers have bestowed his name on the Voltaire crater on Deimos and the asteroid 5676 Voltaire.\nVoltaire was also known to have been an advocate for coffee, drinking it at every turn: fifty times a day, according to Frederick the Great; three times a day, said Wagniere. It has been suggested that high amounts of caffeine stimulated his creativity. His great-grandniece was the mother of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Catholic philosopher and Jesuit priest. His book \"Candide\" was listed as one of The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written, by Martin Seymour-Smith.\nIn the 1950s, the bibliographer and translator Theodore Besterman started to collect, transcribe and publish all of Voltaire's writings. He founded the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva where he began publishing collected volumes of Voltaire's correspondence. On his death in 1976, he left his collection to the University of Oxford, where the Voltaire Foundation became established as a department. The Foundation has published the \"Complete Works of Voltaire\", a chronological series in 205 volumes completed in 2022, more than fifty years after the first volume appeared. It also publishes the series \"Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment\", begun by Bestermann as \"Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century\", which has reached more than 500 volumes.\nWorks.\nPlays.\nVoltaire wrote between fifty and sixty plays (tragedies), including a few unfinished ones. Among them are:\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32378", "revid": "9203640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32378", "title": "Geography of Vietnam", "text": "Vietnam is located on the eastern margin of the Indochinese peninsula and occupies about , of which about 25% was under cultivation in 1987. It borders the Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Thailand, and Pacific Ocean, along with China, Laos, and Cambodia. The elongated roughly \"S\" shaped country has a north-to-south distance of and is about wide at the narrowest point. With a coastline of , excluding islands, Vietnam claims as the limit of its territorial waters, an additional as a contiguous customs and security zone. It has an exclusive economic zone of with .\nThe boundary with Laos was settled on both an ethnic and geographical basis between the rulers of Vietnam and Laos in the mid-seventeenth century. The Annamite Range as a reference, was formally defined by a delimitation treaty signed in 1977 and ratified in 1986. The frontier with Cambodia, defined at the time of French annexation of the western part of the Mekong Delta in 1867, remained essentially unchanged, according to Hanoi, until some unresolved border issues were finally settled in the 1982\u201385 period. The land and sea boundary with China, delineated under the France-China treaties of 1887 and 1895, is \"the frontier line\" accepted by Hanoi. China agreed in 1957\u20131958 to respect that border line. However, in February 1979, following the Sino-Vietnamese War, Hanoi complained that from 1957 onward China had provoked numerous border incidents as part of its anti-Vietnam policy and expansionist designs in Southeast Asia. Among the territorial infringements cited was the Chinese occupation in January 1974 of the Paracel Islands, claimed by both countries in a dispute left unresolved in the 1980s.\nPhysiography.\nThe country is divided into the highlands and the Hong River Delta in the north, the Annamite Range along with the coastal lowlands in the centre, and the Mekong Delta in the south.\nTerrain.\nVietnam is a country of subtropical and tropical lowlands, hills, and densely forested highlands, with level land covering less than 20% of the area.\nRed River Delta.\nThe joined Delta of Hong River (Red River) and Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh River is a flat, triangular region of . The Hong River Delta is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong Delta. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in by the enormous alluvial deposits of the rivers over a period of millennia, and it advances one hundred meters into the Gulf annually. The ancestral home of the ethnic Vietnamese, the delta accounted for almost 70% of the agriculture and 80% of the industry of North Vietnam before 1975.\nThe Red River, rising in China's Yunnan province, is about long. Its two main tributaries, the S\u00f4ng L\u00f4 (also called the Lo River, the Riviere Claire, or the Clear River) and the S\u00f4ng \u0110\u00e0 (also called the Black River or Riviere Noire), contribute to its high water volume, which averages per second.\nThe entire delta region, backed by the steep rises of the forested highlands, is no more than three meters above sea level, and much of it is one meter or less. The area is subject to frequent flooding; at some places the high-water mark of floods is fourteen meters above the surrounding countryside. For centuries flood control has been an integral part of the delta's culture and economy. An extensive system of dikes and canals has been built to contain the Red River and to irrigate the rich rice-growing delta. Modeled on that of China's, this ancient system has sustained a highly concentrated population and has made double-cropping wet-rice cultivation possible throughout about half the region.\nMountainous.\nThe mountain plateaus in the north and northwest are inhabited mainly by tribal minority groups. The D\u00e3y Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n (Annamite Range) originates in the Tibetan and Yunnan regions of southwest China and forms Vietnam's border with Laos. It terminates in the Mekong River Delta north of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City (formerly Saigon).\nThese central mountains, which have several high plateaus, are irregular in elevation and form. The northern section is narrow and very rugged; the country's highest peak, Fan Si Pan, rises to 3,142 meters in the extreme northwest. The southern portion has numerous spurs that divide the narrow coastal strip into a series of compartments. For centuries these topographical features not only rendered north\u2013south communication difficult, but also formed an effective natural barrier for the containment of the people living in the Mekong basin.\nCentral Highlands.\nWithin the southern portion of Vietnam is a plateau known as the Central Highlands (T\u00e2y Nguy\u00ean), approximately 51,800 square kilometers of rugged mountain peaks, extensive forests, and rich soil. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil spread over the provinces of \u0110\u1eafk L\u1eafk (or \"Dac Lac\"), Gia Lai, and Kon Tum, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land. Before 1975, North Vietnam had maintained that the Central Highlands and the Day Truong Son were strategic areas of paramount importance, essential to the domination not only of South Vietnam but also of the southern part of Indochina. Since 1975, the highlands have provided an area in which to relocate people from the densely populated lowlands.\nCoastal lowlands.\nThe narrow, flat coastal lowlands extend from south of the Red River Delta to the Mekong River basin. On the landward side, the D\u00e3y Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n rises precipitously above the coast, its spurs jutting into the sea at several places. Generally the coastal strip is fertile and rice is cultivated intensively.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 3,069\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Vietnam, making it the 10th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.\nMekong River Delta.\nThe Mekong Delta, covering about 40,000 square kilometers, is a low-level plain not more than three meters above sea level at any point and criss-crossed by a maze of canals and rivers. So much sediment is carried by the Mekong's various branches and tributaries that the delta advances sixty to eighty meters into the sea every year. An official Vietnamese source estimates the amount of sediment deposited annually to be about 1 billion cubic meters, or nearly thirteen times the amount deposited by the Red River. About 10,000 square kilometers of the delta are under rice cultivation, making the area one of the major rice-growing regions of the world. The southern tip, known as the C\u00e0 Mau Peninsula is covered by dense jungle and mangrove swamps.\nThe Mekong, which is 4,220 kilometers long, is one of the 12 great rivers of the world. From its source in the Tibetan Plateau, it flows through the Tibetan and Yunnan regions of China, forms the boundary between Laos and Myanmar as well as between Laos and Thailand. At Phnom Penh it merges with the Tonl\u00e9 Sap and divides into two branches \u2013 the S\u00f4ng H\u1eadu Giang (H\u1eadu Giang river) (known as the Bassac River on the Cambodian side) and the S\u00f4ng Ti\u1ec1n Giang (Ti\u1ec1n Giang river) \u2013 and continues through Cambodia and the Mekong basin before draining into the South China Sea through nine mouths known as the \"C\u1eedu Long\" (nine dragons). The river is heavily silted and is navigable by seagoing craft of shallow draft as far as Kompong Cham in Cambodia. A tributary entering the river at Phnom Penh drains the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, a shallow freshwater lake that acts as a natural reservoir to stabilize the flow of water through the lower Mekong. When the river is in flood stage, its silted delta outlets are unable to carry off the high volume of water. Floodwaters back up into the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, causing the lake to inundate as much as 10,000 square kilometers. As the flood subsides, the flow of water reverses and proceeds from the lake to the sea. The effect is to reduce significantly the danger of devastating floods in the Mekong delta, where the river floods the surrounding fields each year to a level of one to two meters.\nClimate.\nVietnam's climate, being located in the tropics and strongly influenced by the South China Sea has a monsoon-influenced climate typical of that of mainland Southeast Asia. In the north, the climate is humid subtropical and monsoonal and with four distinct seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter) while in the central and south, the climate is tropical monsoon with two seasons (rainy and dry). In addition, temperate climate exists in mountainous areas, which are found in Sa Pa and Da Lat, while a more continental climate exists in Lai Ch\u00e2u province and S\u01a1n La province. The diverse topography, wide range of latitudes (Vietnam spans over 15\u00b0 of latitude), and influences from the South China Sea lead to climatic conditions varying significantly between regions.\nBased on geographic and climatic conditions, there are seven different climatic regions in Vietnam: Northwest, Northeast, North Delta (Red River Delta), North Central (North Central Coast), South Central (South Central Coast), Central Highlands, and the South. The South is subdivided into the Southeast for the southeastern provinces and the Mekong Delta for the southwestern provinces. Generally, these seven different climatic regions are grouped into two main types: The North (includes Northwest, Northeast, North Delta (Red River Delta), North Central (North Central Coast)) which includes all areas north of the H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Pass and the South (South Central Coast, Central Highlands and the extreme south) which includes all areas south of the H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Pass. These climatic regions are based on time of rainy season and other climatic elements such as insolation, sunshine, temperature, precipitation, and humidity.\nDuring winter, polar air originating from the Siberian High penetrate deeply into the low latitudes, facilitated by the eastern Tibetan Plateau that funnels the air southwards in a northeast direction (the cool air is a wind coming from the northeast). Many cold fronts can penetrate into Vietnam during winter of which there are three to four occurrences every month in northern Vietnam. This leads to cold temperatures where temperatures drop by . Cold weather, occasionally extreme cold can persist for a long time, being characterized by a long stretch of cloudless or partly cloudy days in the first half of winter or a long stretch of cloudy and drizzly conditions in the latter half of winter. Cold weather occurs more frequently in the north than in the south due to cold fronts penetrate the north more frequently.\nIn summer, the general wind pattern are southwesterly winds in the southern parts of Vietnam and southeasterly winds in northern Vietnam. The predominantly air blocks in Vietnam are the equatorial and tropical blocks that originate from high pressure systems in the Southern Hemisphere, and a maritime tropical block originating from the subtropical high pressure system in the Pacific Ocean (Pacific subtropical high pressure). In addition, during summer, Vietnam is influenced by tropical air from the Bay of Bengal which occurs when a continental low pressure originating from South Asia (South Asian continental low) moves eastwards towards Vietnam, covering almost all of Vietnam and southern China; this causes hot, dry weather in the North Central Coast as westerly winds descend and warm adiabatically on the eastern slopes of the Annamite Range (Truong Son Range). On average, eleven storms and tropical low pressures develop in the South China sea during summer of which half are tropical cyclones that originate from the western Pacific. These storms and cyclones then move westwards towards Vietnam. On average, Vietnam is affected by six to eight typhoons or tropical cyclones per year.\nSpring and Fall are transitional seasons. The atmospheric circulation in these seasons represent a transition between winter\u2013summer and summer\u2013winter respectively.\nMean annual temperatures in the country, based on meteorological data from weather stations range from in Hoang Lien Son. At the highest altitudes in the Hoang Lien Son range, mean annual temperatures is only . As temperatures vary by altitude, temperatures decrease by for every increase in altitude. The lowest mean annual temperatures are found in the mountainous areas where the altitude is higher and in northern areas due to their higher latitudes. Many mountainous areas in the north have experienced subzero conditions. In contrast, temperatures in the Spratly Islands never falls below . Because Vietnam is strongly influenced by the monsoon, the mean temperatures in Vietnam are lower than other countries located at the same latitude in Asia. The highest temperatures normally occurs in March\u2013May in the south and May\u2013July in the north. Temperatures in summer are relatively equal among the northern and southern parts of the country with differences being mostly due to altitude (the decrease in temperature is predominantly due to altitude).\nMean annual rainfall in the country ranges from although most places in Vietnam receive between . The majority of rainfall occurs during the rainy season, which is responsible for 80%\u201390% of the annual precipitation. Generally, northern parts of the country receive more rainfall than southern parts of the country. Drizzle is a weather phenomenon that is characteristic of the weather in winter in the north and north central coast. Depending on the region, the onset of the rainy season (defined as when the monthly average precipitation exceeds ) differs.\n*Total: \n**country rank in the world: \"66th\"\n*Land: \n*Water: \n*Australia comparative: approximately larger than Victoria\n*Canada comparative: approximately half the size of Alberta\n*United States comparative: slightly larger than New Mexico\n*United Kingdom comparative: approximately times the size of the United Kingdom\n*EU comparative: slightly larger than Poland\n*Total: \n*Border countries: Cambodia , China , Laos \n*Contiguous zone: \n*Continental shelf: or to the edge of the continental margin\n*Exclusive economic zone: , \n(Territorial sea: \n*Lowest point: South China Sea 0 m\n*Highest point: Fansipan \n*Longest river: \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai river (longest inland river) \n*Biggest lake: Ba B\u1ec3 Lake \nResources and land use.\nNatural resources: phosphates, coal, manganese, rare earth elements, bauxite, offshore oil and gas deposits, timber, hydropower\nLand use:\nArable land: 19.64%\nPermanent crops: 11.18%\nOther: 69.18% (2011)\nIrrigated land: 45,850\u00a0km2 (2005)\nTotal renewable water resources: 864.1\u00a0km3 (2011)\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\ntotal: 82.03 km3/yr (1%/4%/95%)\nper capita: 965 m3/yr (2005)\nEnvironmental concerns.\nNatural hazards: occasional typhoons (May to January) with extensive flooding, especially in the Mekong Delta.\nEnvironment \u2013 current issues:\nLogging and slash-and-burn agricultural practices contribute to deforestation and soil degradation; water pollution and overfishing threaten marine life populations; groundwater contamination limits potable water supply; growing urbanization and human migration are rapidly degrading environment in Hanoi and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City\nEnvironment \u2013 international agreements:\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Wetlands\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n "}

The ethnic Vietnamese inhabit a little less than half of Vietnam, while the ethnic minorities inhabit the majority of Vietnam's land (albeit the least fertile parts of the country).\nThe relation between China and Vietnam also declined following reunification in 1976, with Vietnam siding with the Soviet Union against China in the Chinese-Soviet split. Tensions peaked when Vietnam and Cambodia started a war, Cambodia led by Pol Pot being a Chinese ally, resulting in a Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1978\u201379, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China. In recent years the government has performed an about turn and is encouraging overseas Hoa to return and invest, but the ethnic Chinese population has been in continuous decline since the 1970s due to assimilation and low birth rates.\nThe central highland peoples commonly termed Degar or Montagnards (mountain people) comprise two main ethnolinguistic groups \u2013 Malayo-Polynesian and Mon\u2013Khmer. About 30 groups of various cultures and dialects are spread over the highland territory.\nOther minority groups include the Cham\u2014remnants of the once-mighty Champa Kingdom, conquered by the Vietnamese in the 15th century, Hmong, and Th\u00e1i.\nLanguages.\nVietnamese is the national language. It belongs to the Austroasiatic language family, which also includes languages such as Khmer and Mon. Vietnamese was spoken by 85\u201390\u00a0million people in Vietnam at the 1999 census. In the early 21st century, around another four million Vietnamese speakers are found outside of Vietnam, mostly refugees from the Vietnam-American War. Thus Vietnamese is the most spoken language of the Austroasiatic family, being spoken by three times more people than the second most spoken language of the family, Khmer. Both languages, however, are extremely different: Vietnamese is a tonal, monosyllabic language while Khmer has remained non-tonal. Vietnamese was heavily influenced by Chinese, with up to around 50\u201370% words having Chinese origins, whilst Khmer was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Pali, uses an abugida writing system, and has a great part of its vocabulary originating from Indian languages. Since the early 20th century, the Vietnamese have used a Romanized script introduced by the French, developed by Jesuit missionaries led by Alexandre de Rhodes and later on, refined by Vietnamese scholars to produce what is now known as the Vietnamese alphabet.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2019 Census, the religious demographics of Vietnam are as follows:\nIt is worth noting here that the data is highly skewed, as a large majority of Vietnamese may declare themselves atheist yet practice forms of traditional folk religion or Mahayana Buddhism.\nEstimates for the year 2010 published by the Pew Research Center:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32380", "revid": "6278275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32380", "title": "Politics of Vietnam", "text": "The politics of Vietnam is dominated by a single party, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), under an authoritarian system. The President of Vietnam (Vietnamese: ) is the head of state, and the Prime Minister of Vietnam is the head of government. Both of these offices are separate from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, who leads the CPV and is head of the Politburo and the Central Military Commission. The General Secretary is thus the \"de facto\" highest position in the Vietnamese politics.\nExecutive power is exercised by the government and the President of Vietnam. Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly of Vietnam (Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ed9i Vi\u1ec7t Nam). The Judiciary is independent of the executive. The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Vietnam, the country's fifth, on 28 November 2013.\nThe communist state which emerged in the 20th century has been described either as totalitarian or not totalitarian but autocratic; the authoritarian system established after the 1986 reforms has inherited many legacies of the past, with the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted. There are no freely elected national leaders, political opposition is suppressed, all religious activity is controlled by the CPV, dissent is not permitted, and civil rights are curtailed. Elections in Vietnam occur under a single-party authoritarian political system. Vietnam is among the few contemporary party-led dictatorships to not hold any direct multiparty elections at the national level. The competitive nature of the elections is highly constrained by the Communist Party's monopoly on power in Vietnam, limitations on free speech, and government interference with the elections.\nThe National Assembly is a rubber stamp unicameral legislative body. The National Assembly has 500 members, indirectly elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The legislature is, according to the constitution, the highest organ of the state. Its powers includes the enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; the adoption of the government budget; supervising the Government of Vietnam and other holders of public powers responsible to the National Assembly; and appointing members of the judiciary. The Vietnamese constitution and legislation provides for regular elections for the office of the President of the Socialist Republic, the National Assembly and the People's Councils.\nThe President is elected by National Assembly for a five-year term and acts as the \"de jure\" commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. However, the president has the right to decide on executive brands. The government (), the main executive state power of Vietnam, is headed by the Prime Minister, who has several Deputy Prime Ministers and several ministers in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for the implementation of political, economic, cultural, social, national defence, security and external activities of the state.\nVietnam has a judicial system governed by the Constitution of Vietnam and national legislation enacted by National Assembly. The Supreme People's Court () is the highest court of appeal in Vietnam. There are other specialised courts in Vietnam, including the Central Military Court, the Criminal Court, the Civil Court and the Appeal Court. The Supreme People's Procuracy observes the implementation of state organs and makes sure that Vietnamese citizens follow the law.\nKey figures.\nPractically, a four-person collective leadership is responsible for governing Vietnam. Unofficially referred as the four pillars (, ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: &lt;templatestyles src=\"vi-nom/fonts.css\" /&gt;\u56db\u67f1), the collection consists of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, President of Vietnam, Prime Minister of Vietnam and Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam, being four key figures in the Vietnamese political system. It is instrumented to avoid consolidating too much power into a single position, thus avoiding dictatorship.\nLegal framework.\nVietnam is a one-party socialist republic. The current Vietnamese state traces its direct lineage back to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the 1945 August Revolution led by H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. The current constitution was adopted on 28 November 2013 by the National Assembly of Vietnam. There have been four other constitutions in Vietnamese history: the 1946, 1959, 1980, and 1992 constitutions. The Communist Party of Vietnam, the leading non-State organ, operates in accordance with the laws. Government powers in Vietnam are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. Vietnam's legal system is based upon socialist legality according to Article 12 of the constitution.\nState ideology.\nVietnam is a socialist republic with a one-party system led by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The CPV espouses Marxism\u2013Leninism and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, the political philosophy and ideology of the late H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. The two ideologies function as a firm ideological basis and serve as guidance for the activities of the Party and state. According to the Constitution, Vietnam is \"in the period of transition to socialism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism was introduced to Vietnam in the 1920s and 1930s, and Vietnamese culture has been led under the banner of patriotism and Marxism\u2013Leninism. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's beliefs were not systematised during his life, nor quickly following his death. Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh's biography of \"Chairman H\u1ed3\" in 1973 emphasised his revolutionary policies. The thoughts of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh were systematised in 1989, under the leadership of Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, alongside Marxism\u2013Leninism, became the official ideology of the CPV and the state in 1991. The CPV's claim to legitimacy was retained following the collapse of communism in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 by its commitment to the thoughts of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, according to Sophie Quinn-Judge. According to Pierre Brocheux, the author of \"Ho Chi Minh: a Biography\", the current state ideology is H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, with Marxism\u2013Leninism playing a secondary role. While some claim that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought is used as a veil for the Party leadership since they, according to this version, have stopped believing in communism, others claim this is not true considering that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was an avid supporter of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Others see H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to smuggle in non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality.\nSince its foundation, the key ideology has been Marxism\u2013Leninism, but since the introduction of a mixed economy in the late 1980s and 1990s, it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy. As became clear because of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi reforms, the Party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants, which was officially referred to as the \"working class-peasant alliance\". In the constitution introduced in 1992, the State represented the \"workers, peasants and intellectuals\". In recent years, the Party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the \"interests of the entire people\", which includes entrepreneurs. The final class barrier was removed in 2002, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. In the face of de-emphasising the role of Marxism\u2013Leninism, the Party has acquired a broader ideology, placing more emphasis on nationalism, developmentalism, and becoming the protector of tradition.\nCommunist Party of Vietnam.\nAccording to the official version, the Communist Party of Vietnam () is leading the Vietnamese people \"in carrying out the country's renovation, modernisation and industrialisation.\" According to the Party's statute, amended at the 9th National Congress on 22 April 2001, the CPV was \"established and trained by President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, has led the Vietnamese people to carry out successfully the August Revolution, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam, now the Socialist Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam, to defeat foreign invaders, to abolish the colonial and feudalist regime, to liberate and reunify the country, and then carry out the cause of renovation and socialist construction and firmly defend national independence.\" It believes in socialist internationalism of the working class, and supports the \"struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress of the world's people.\" The CPV acts as the vanguard of the working people and the whole nation by representing their interests. Its aim is to create \"a strong, independent, prosperous and democratic country with an equitable and civilized society, to realise socialism and ultimately, communism.\" The Party's ideological foundation is Marxism\u2013Leninism and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thoughts. These ideologies guide the activities of the Party, while promoting \"the nation's traditions, and absorbing other nations' essential ideas.\"\nThe CPV is organised on the principles of democratic centralism. It practices \"criticism, self-criticism, and strict discipline\" and pursues \"collective leadership and individual responsibility, and promoting comradeship and solidarity in line with the Party's political programs and statutes.\" The CPV is subject to Vietnamese laws and the Constitution. It is the country's ruling party and promotes the \"mastery of the people over the country\". The Party is under the supervision of the people. It is dependent on having the people contribute to the party, by strengthening, uniting, and leading the people in the revolutionary cause. The political system in Vietnam is led by the CPV, and it \"leads, respects and promotes the role of the State, the Vietnamese Fatherland Front (VFF) and other socio-political organisations.\"\nIn 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he is Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.\nCongress.\nThe National Congress is the party's highest organ. The direction of the Party and the Government is decided at the National Congress, held every fifth year. The Central Committee is elected by the National Congress. Delegates vote on policies and candidate posts within the central party leadership. Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress, the National Congress dissolves itself. The Central Committee, which is elected by the National Congress every fifth year, implements the decisions of the National Congress in the five-year period. Since the Central Committee only meets twice a year, the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress.\nCentral Committee.\nThe Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most powerful institution. It delegates some of its powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo when it is not in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that V\u00f5 V\u0103n Ki\u1ec7t tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The former President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang (2011\u20132016) was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held in 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau's rule.\nThe Central Committee elects the Politburo in the aftermath of the Party Congress. Since the full Central Committee meets only once a year, the Politburo functions as the Party's leading collective decision-making body. The Secretariat is also elected by the Central Committee, and is headed by the General Secretary (). It is responsible for solving organizational problems and implementing the demands of the Central Committee. The Secretariat oversees the work of the Commissions of the Central Committee. The General Secretary is the de facto leader of Vietnam.\nThe following is the official order of precedence of the Politburo according to the 13th National Party Congress.\nThe Secretariat (term 13) includes some Politburo members assigned to join the Secretariat and 5 comrades elected at the first PCC meeting (term 13).\nFatherland Front.\nThe Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF) () is an umbrella group of pro-communist movements. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the VFF and its members constitute \"the political base of people's power\". The state must create a favorable environment for the VFF and its member organisations. The VFF is a voluntary mass organisation of political, socio-political and social organisations and \"individuals from all classes, social strata, ethnic groups, and religions, including overseas Vietnamese.\" Its main objectives are to gather and build a people unity bloc, \"strengthen the people's political and spiritual consensus, encourage the people to promote their mastership, to implement the CPV's guidelines and policies, and to abide by the Constitution and laws.\" The VFF is governed on the principles of \"democratic consensus, coordinated and united action.\" Its organisation has been modelled after the state structure, and the VFF has its own independent statute. Notable member organisations of the VFF include the General Confederation of Labour, the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Communist Youth Union and the Veteran Association, among others.\nExecutive.\nThe State President () is the head of state, elected to a five-year term by the National Assembly, and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum tenure of 3 terms. In addition to being the Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security and nominal commander-in-chief of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing or dismissing the Vice President, Prime Minister, Deputy Chief Judge of the Supreme People's Court and Head of the Supreme People's Procuracy, with the consent of the National Assembly through a simple majority vote. The President has theoretical influence on foreign policy, and has the right to declare a state of emergency and to declare war.\nThe Government () is mechanically headed Prime Minister and consists of several Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers and other members. The Government is a unified administration responsible for the implementation of political, economic, cultural, social, national defence, security and external activities of the state. It is also responsible for the effectiveness of the state apparatus itself from the top down, stabilisation in the country and the observance of the constitution. As with the President, the Government is elected by the deputies of the National Assembly for a five-year term. The Prime Minister of the Government () is the head of government and is elected or dismissed by the National Assembly, at the request of the President. Since 5 April 2021, the Prime Minister has been Ph\u1ea1m Minh Ch\u00ednh.\nLegislative.\nThe National Assembly () is a unicameral legislative body, and is governed on the basis of democratic centralism. It is the highest representative organ and the highest state organ. The National Assembly is the only organ vested with constitutional and legislative powers. It is responsible for fundamental domestic and foreign policies, socio-economic policies, defence and security issues, and it exercises supreme control over all state activities. Delegates (or members) of the National Assembly are elected through secret ballots in democratic elections which are held every fifth year. The National Assembly is convened twice a year, and its Standing Committee represents it between sessions.\nThe membership of the Standing Committee consists of the Chairman (), deputy chairmen and other members; these members are elected by the National Assembly. Standing Committee members cannot simultaneously be members of the Government. Members work on a full-time basis, and their terms of office correspond with the term of the National Assembly. The Standing Committee continues to function until a new National Assembly is elected. According to the constitution, the Standing Committee is responsible for 12 duties. Of these, the most important are the powers to announce, convene and chair the National Assembly sessions, to interpret the constitution, laws and ordinances, and to issue ordinances on those matters assigned by the National Assembly. It supervises and guides the People's Councils and their activities, and directs, regulates and coordinates the activities of the Ethnic Council and the committees of the National Assembly.\nThere are seven committees of the National Assembly. Committee membership is determined by the National Assembly. They are responsible for the studying and examination of bills, legislative initiatives, drafts of ordinances and other drafts of legal documents and reports assigned by the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. The committees provide the National Assembly and its Standing Committee with their opinions on the legislative programme. The committees supervise and conduct investigations within their respective competency and exercise powers which are stipulated by law. The National Assembly elects the Ethnic Council, which consists of a chairman, deputy chairmen and other members. The Ethnic Council studies and recommends actions to the National Assembly; the National Assembly has to consult with the Ethnic Council before issuing any decisions on ethnic policy. The Chairman of the Ethnic Council has to attend meetings of the Government which concern ethnic policy. The powers of the Ethnic Council are comparable to those of the committees.\nJudiciary.\nThe Vietnamese judicial system is based upon Socialist legality. The country's highest judicial organ is the Supreme People's Court (SPC) (). The composition of the SPC includes the Chief Justice (), Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SPC (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, Central Military Court, Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SPC is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic has the power to nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during hearings, that the \"judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws.\" Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.\nThe Supreme People's Prosecutor (SPP) (), the Vietnamese equivalent to an attorney general, observes the implementation process of the Ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government organs, local authorities, social and economic organisations, the armed forces, security forces and the Vietnamese citizens in general. The SPP respects the Constitution and state laws, practices public prosecution as stated by the law and ensures law enforcement. The head of the SPP is elected, dismissed, or removed from office by a proposal of the President. The Deputy Heads, prosecutors and inspectors appointed by the SPP head can be dismissed by the President on the Head's request.\nThe SPC is the highest court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which controls the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, in part because the Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.\nElections.\nArticle 6 of the Constitution states that \"The people make use of state power through the agency of the National Assembly and the People's Councils, which represent the will and aspirations of the people, are elected by them and responsible to them\". Deputies (members) of the National Assembly are directly elected on a democratic basis through secret ballots. All citizens who are 18 or older, regardless of ethnic group, gender, social position, belief, religion, level of education, occupation or length of residency have the right to vote, the exceptions being the mentally disabled and those people who have been deprived of the right to vote by law. People aged 21 or older have the right to stand as a candidate at elections. Three election commissions have been established to manage elections; at the central level is the Election Council, at the provincial level and in centrally-run cities the Election Committee is responsible for election monitoring and the Election Commission is responsible for election monitoring at constituencies.\nThe current 500 members of the National Assembly were elected during the 2016\n parliamentary election, and they have a five-year term. Despite foreign criticism, it is generally believed that the National Assembly has become more powerful in recent years. The last election was held, according to the authorities, in a democratic, fair, lawful and safe manner and was considered a success. Voter turnout was 99.51 percent; nearly 62 million people voted. In their respective constituencies, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng, the General Secretary, was elected to the National Assembly with 85.63 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng was elected with 95.38 percent and President Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang was elected with 80.19 percent. Outside the ruling troika, it was Nguy\u1ec5n Xu\u00e2n Ph\u00fac, the Chairman of the Government Office, who was elected with the highest margin, with 94.59 percent of the votes. The number of self-nominated candidates was four times higher than the previous election. Fifteen out of the 182 candidates nominated by the central government and the central party leadership were defeated in the elections. L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Thu Ba, a member of the Party's Central Committee and Chairman of the Committee of Law during the 12th National Assembly (2007\u20132011), was not re-elected to the National Assembly. Several capitalists were elected to the assembly, but due to the socialist ideology of the state, they are not allowed to sit on the assembly's Committee on Economy and Budget.\nNguy\u1ec5n Sinh H\u00f9ng, the Chairman of the National Assembly, nominated Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang for the Presidency. 487 deputies of the National Assembly, meaning 97.4 percent, voted in favour of Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang. In his victory speech, Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang said, \"I pledge to improve my moral quality and study the example of the late President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to cooperate with the government to bring Vietnam to become a fully industrialized country by 2015.\"\nLocal government.\nProvinces and municipalities are subdivided into towns, districts and villages. Provinces and municipalities are centrally controlled by the national government. Towns, districts and villages are locally accountable to some degree through elected people's councils. Certain cities and provinces are under direct control of the central government. The provinces are divided into districts, provincial cities and towns; cities under direct rule are divided into towns, urban and rural districts. In turn, the district is divided into communes and townlets. In the words of Article 118 of the Constitution, the \"provincial city and the town are divided into wards and communes; the urban district is divided into wards.\" The establishment of People's Council and People's Committees is determined by law.\nIn the provinces, the People's Council is the \"local organ of State power\", and it represents the \"aspirations, and mastery of the people\". The People's Council is democratically elected, and is accountable to the people and to superior organs of the state. It must pass resolutions which are formal orders of superior organs of state, and it acts on behalf of the constitution. The People's Council decides the plans for socio-economic development, decides the budget and is responsible for national defence and security at the local level. The deputy (member) of the People's Council acts on the behalf of the people, and has the right to make proposals to the People's Council and other local State organs. In turn, officials of these local organs have the responsibility to receive and to examine them.\nThe People's Council appoint a People's Committee, the executive organ of the People's Council. It is the People's Committee which has the responsibility to implement \"the Constitution, the law, the formal written orders of superior State organs and the resolutions of the People's Council.\" The People's Committee is headed by a chairman, who acts as the body's leader. All decisions of the People's Committee are taken through a collegial decision-making process, and have to \"conform to the will of the majority.\" The chairman has the power to annul decisions of lower standing organs.\nLocal officials of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, its local head, and officials from other mass organisations in the locality have the right to attend the meetings of the People's Council and the People's Committee if relevant problems are discussed. According to Article 125 of the constitution, \"The People's Council and the People's Committee shall make regular reports on the local situation in all fields to the Fatherland Front and the mass organisations; shall listen to their opinions and proposals on local power building and socio-economic development; shall cooperate with them in urging the people to work together with the State for the implementation of socio-economic, national-defence, and security tasks in the locality.\"\nList of provinces.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.

{"id": "32381", "revid": "34573757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32381", "title": "Economy of Vietnam", "text": "Vietnamese economy\nThe economy of Vietnam is a developing mixed socialist-oriented market economy. It is the 33rd-largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and the 26th-largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity (PPP). It is a lower-middle income country with a low cost of living. Vietnam is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the World Trade Organization.\nSince the mid-1980s, through the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi reform period, Vietnam has made a shift from a highly centralized planned economy to a mixed economy. Before, South Vietnam was reliant on U.S. aid, while North Vietnam and reunified Vietnam relied on communist aid until the Soviet Union's dissolution.\nThe economy uses both directive and indicative planning through five-year plans, with support from an open market-based economy. Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in Southeast Asia.\nAccording to a forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers in February 2017, Vietnam may be the fastest-growing of the world's economies, with a potential annual GDP growth rate of about 5.1 percent, which would make its economy the 10th-largest in the world by 2050. Vietnam has also been named among the so-called Next Eleven and CIVETS countries.\nHistory.\nBefore 1858.\nCivilization in Vietnam had been built on agriculture. The feudal dynasties always considered agriculture as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on physiocracy. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as dykes were constructed in the Red River Delta to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term . Thang Long (Hanoi) was the main handicraft manufacturing center of the country. Chinese noted that the Vietnamese were doing business just like the same with in the Chinese Song dynasty. From the 9th to 13th century, the Vietnamese traded ceramics and silks with regional powers such as China, Champa, Western Xia, Java among others. Further archeological evidence suggests that Muslim traders had lived in Hanoi from around the 9th to 10th centuries, based on Muslim ceramics found in the Old Quarter of Hanoi.\nHowever, from the 16th century, Confucianism was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary pre-capitalism economy began to develop. During the L\u00ea\u2013M\u1ea1c period, the state encouraged semi-industrial business and sea-traders, as the Vietnamese economy would mainly depended on them for the next 250 years. Cities such as Dong Kinh, H\u1ed9i An and others grew quickly under rapid urbanization. They were later constrained when foreign nations saw them as an economic threat.\nDuring the 17th century, Vietnam's economy had reached its peak as the country was the third-largest economic power in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In the late 18th century, the economy suffered depression because of a series of diseases and disaster such as the Tay Son peasant rebellion which devastated the country. This policy led to stagnation of the Vietnamese economy in the early-19th century, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.\n1858\u20131975.\nUntil the French colonization in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the South for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the North for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi; railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.\nWhen the North and South were divided politically in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: socialism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the Second Indochina War from 1955 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers out of the millions of war refugees.\n1975\u20131997.\nThe government's Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u20131981) aimed for solid high annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained. The economy remained dominated by small-scale production, low labor productivity, material and technological shortfalls, and insufficient food and consumer goods. The more modest goals of the Third Five-Year Plan (1981\u201385) were a compromise between ideological and pragmatic factions; they emphasized the development of agriculture and industry. Efforts were also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of government officials.\nAfter reunification in 1975, the economy of Vietnam was plagued by enormous difficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in distribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt problems. Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the Comecon, and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the Soviet Union and its allies. Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its traditional trading partners, Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade, devalue its exchange rate to increase exports, and embark on a policy of economic development. Between 1975 and 1994, the United States imposed a trade embargo on Vietnam, forbidding any trade during the 19-year period.\nIn 1986, Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign (\"\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi\") that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized economy to a socialist-oriented market economy. \"\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi\" combined government planning with free-market incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including foreign-owned enterprises. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity to lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the population by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per household to two, called the two-child policy. By the late 1990s, the success of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under \"\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi\" was evident. More than 30,000 private businesses had been created, the economy was growing at an annual rate of more than 7%, and poverty was nearly halved.\nSince the early 1990s, Vietnam had structurally changed away from agriculture, but without industrialisation (service-oriented globalisation).\nIn 1990, the state sector was the key hoped-for site of industrialisation. The state sector transitioned away from the processes of bottom-up commercialisation of the 1980s. This created a supply capacity. The supply capacity allowed Vietnam to avoid negative shock as Soviet aid was removed, and the supply capacity allowed the economy of Vietnam to grow rapidly in the 1990s. Its growth has averaged about 7% annually since the 1990s, a rate second only to China.200\nThroughout the 1990s, exports increased by as much as 20% to 30% in some years. In 1999, exports accounted for 40% of GDP, an impressive performance in the midst of the economic crisis that hit other countries in Asia. Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007, which freed Vietnam from textile quotas enacted worldwide as part of the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in 1974. The MFA placed restrictions on the import by industrialized countries of textiles from developing countries. For China and other WTO members, however, textile quotas under the MFA expired at the end of 2004 as agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994. A 2019 study found that Vietnam's WTO entry led to substantial gains in productivity for private firms, but had no impact on state-owned enterprises. In the absence of state-owned enterprises, \"the overall productivity gains would have been about 40% larger in a counterfactual Vietnamese economy.\"\nDevelopment since 1997.\nVietnam's economic policy following the 1997 Asian financial crisis has been a cautious one, emphasizing macroeconomic stability rather than growth. While the country shifted toward a more market-oriented economy, the Vietnamese government still continues to hold a tight rein over major state sectors, such as the banking system, state-owned enterprises and foreign trade. GDP growth fell to 6% in 1998 and 5% in 1999. The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2000.\nThe signing of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between the United States and Vietnam on 13 July 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a manufacturing-based, export-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from Europe, Asia and other regions.\nIn 2001, the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state. Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global recession, making it the world's second fastest-growing economy. At the same time, investment grew threefold and domestic savings quintupled.\nIn 2003, the private sector accounted for more than one-quarter of all industrial output. However, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam fell dramatically in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report rankings, largely due to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions. Official corruption is endemic, and Vietnam lags in property rights, efficient regulation of markets, and labor and financial market reforms.\nVietnam had an average GDP growth of 7.1% a year from 2000 to 2004. The GDP growth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only China's. The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%. According to the Minister of Planning and Investment, the government targeted a GDP growth of around 8.5% in 2007.\nOn 7 November 2006, the General Council at the World Trade Organization (WTO) approved Vietnam's accession package. On 11 January 2007, Vietnam officially became the WTO's 149th member, after 11 years of preparation, including eight years of negotiation. The country's access to the WTO was intended to provide an important boost to the economy, as it ensured that the liberalizing reforms continue and created options for trade expansion. However, the accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the Vietnam War from the 1950s to the 1970s, the punitive embargoes of the United States and its allies, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath. In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after a large number of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose. The main danger has been over the bad debt in the banks totalling to 15% and forecast growth is 5.2% for 2012 but this is also due to the global economic crisis. The government has launched schemes to reform the economy, such as lifting foreign ownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing the country's state-owned companies that have been responsible for the recent economic downturn. By the end of 2013, the government is expected to privatize 25\u201350% of SOEs, only maintaining control on public services and military. The recent reforms have created a major boom in the Vietnamese stock market as confidence in the Vietnamese economy is returning.\nVietnam's current economic turmoil has given rise to questions of a possible new period of changing political economy, however poverty remains to be the main concern on the national performance index as of 2018. The Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) found that 28% of survey respondents cited poverty as their main problem. Most respondents agreed with the statement that \"[P]overty reduction is imperative to ensuring that Vietnam becomes an advanced, developed country. The percentage of the poorest Vietnamese respondents who believed that their economic situation would worsen increased from 13% in 2016 to 26% in 2017. The percentage of respondents with health insurance increased from 74% in 2016 to 81% in 2017, with strongest gains in the rural population groups.\nIn 2017, Transparency International, a non-profit that tracks graft ranked Vietnam as 113th worst out of 176 countries and regions for perceptions of corruption. Several graft cases found in 2016 and 2017 led to the corruption crackdown which prosecuted many bankers, businesspeople, and government officials under charges of corruption. PAPI found that bribery at public district hospital services decreased from 17% in 2016 to 9% in 2017. Reports of land seizures went down from an average of about 9% before 2013, to less than 7% in 2017. The number of respondents who believed that their land was sold at a fair market value decreased from 26% in 2014 to 21% in 2017. Land-use graft and petty graft, such as police officers accepting bribes, are common. According to Ralph Jennings, Vietnam has been privatizing many of its state-owned operations to reduce corruption and increase efficiency.\nAs of March 2018, Vietnam's economy continued to grow, achieving the best annual growth rate in over a decade; which has led media outlets to speculate if in the near future it could be one of the Asian tigers.\nAccording to DBS Bank in 2019, Vietnam's economy has the potential to grow at a pace of about 6.0%\u20136.5% by 2029. Vietnam can overpower Singapore's economy by the next decade because of its strong foreign investment inflow and productivity growth. However, Vietnam has surpassed Singapore just a year later.\nIn the early 2020s, despite trade wars with Vietnam's major trade partners, a pandemic and the increasing trend in deglobalisation, Vietnam has still managed to become Asia's top-performing economy. Since 2000, Vietnam has now managed to manufacture higher-value goods with better paying jobs due to its more highly skilled workers. These workers now produce electronics which makes up 38% (in 2020) of Vietnam's exports (compared to 14% in 2010). The country had achieved an average of 6.2% in economic growth (faster than any other country in Asia after China). Foreign investment on the luxury hotels sector and resorts will rise to support the tourist industry.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1990\u20132023 (with IMF staff estimations in 2021\u20132027). Inflation below 5% is in green.\nEconomic sectors.\nAgriculture, fishery and forestry.\nIn 2003, Vietnam produced an estimated 30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to dwindling forests, Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.\nVietnam's fishing industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and extensive network of rivers and lakes, has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by shrimp farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered antidumping complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.\nVietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer. Vietnam is also the world's second-largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.\nVietnam produced in 2018:\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nIn 2018, Vietnam was the world's 5th largest producer of pork (3.8 million tonnes). This year the country also produced 839 thousand tons of chicken meat, 334 thousand tons of beef, 936 million liters of cow's milk, 20 thousand tons of honey, among others.\nEnergy, mining and minerals.\nPetroleum is the main source of energy, followed by coal, which contributes about 25% of the country's energy (excluding biomass). Vietnam's oil reserves are in the range of 270\u2013500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are antimony, bauxite, chromium, gold, iron, natural phosphates, tin, and zinc.\nIn 2019, Vietnam was the 9th largest world producer of antimony; 10th largest producer of tin; 11th largest producer of bauxite; 12th largest world producer of titanium; 13th largest world producer of manganese and 9th largest producer of phosphate in the world. The country is also one of the world's largest producers of ruby, sapphire, topaz and spinel.\nOil was discovered in Vietnam in the mid-1980s and oil production began in the 1990s.24 Crude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings. Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity. Vietnam's only operational refinery, a facility at Cat Hai near Ho Chi Minh City, has a capacity of only . Refined petroleum accounted for 10.2% of total imports in 2002. As of 2012, Vietnam had only one refinery, the Dung Quat refinery, but a second one, the Nghi Son Refinery was planned and was scheduled for construction in May 2013.\nVietnam's anthracite coal reserves are estimated at 3.7 billion tons. Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam's potential natural gas reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Hydroelectric power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance, and a second by a Japanese group.\nFrom 2019 onwards, renewable energy deployment in Vietnam accelerated, by far surpassing the other Southeast Asian countries. Most of the newly deployed renewable energy was in the form of solar and wind power plants. By 2023, however, this development had slowed down, mainly due to limited electrical grid capacity and reduced government support.\nIndustry and manufacturing.\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce.\nFrom 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, food processing, cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms. For instance, Samsung produces about 40% of its phones in Vietnam.\nAs of 2019, Samsung employs over 200,000 employees in the Hanoi-area of Vietnam to produce smartphones, while offsourcing some manufacturing to China and manufacturing large portions of its phones in India. LG Electronics moved smartphone production to Vietnam from South Korea, in order to stay competitive. LG said that \"Vietnam provides an \"abundant labor force\", as motivation for the move.\nOf note, Samsung accounted for 15 percent of Vietnam's exports in the first seven months of 2024. Although significant, this is a decrease from 2017, during which Samsung accounted for 22.7 percent of Vietnam's exports.\nIn the past decade, a significant automotive industry has been developed.\nIn recent years, Vietnam's domestic automaker VinFast has led the country's push into electric vehicles (EVs), marking Vietnam's ambition to become a global EV hub. In late 2022, VinFast shipped its first batch of 999 electric SUVs to U.S. customers, a milestone in its overseas expansion plans. The company has since accelerated its international strategy\u2014expanding sales beyond Vietnam and building supporting infrastructure\u2014while reporting rising revenues alongside continued heavy investment to scale its operations. In 2024, VinFast's founder also launched V-Green to develop EV charging networks in key markets, further supporting the brand's global rollout.\nVietnam has become a prime beneficiary of the \u201cChina+1\u201d strategy as multinational firms diversify production beyond China. In 2024, Vietnam's foreign direct investment (FDI) disbursements reached an all-time high of approximately **USD 25.35 billion**, reflecting a 9.4% year-on-year increase. Companies have shifted manufacturing to Vietnam for lower labor costs and favorable trade zones, with Vietnam's industrial capacity expanding by 116% over the past decade\u2014outpacing regional peers.\nServices and tourism.\nIn 2004, services accounted for 38.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). From 1994 to 2004, GDP attributable to the service sector grew at an average annual rate of 6.0%.\nBy 2024, the service sector had expanded significantly, contributing more than half of Vietnam's GDP. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, services grew by 6.12% year-on-year and accounted for 52.23% of GDP growth, underscoring their rising role in the national economy.\nTourism.\nIn 2012, Vietnam received 6.8 million international visitors and the number is expected to reach over 7 million in 2013. Vietnam keeps emerging as an attractive destination. In TripAdvisor's list of top 25 destinations Asia 2013 by travelers' choice, there are four cities of Vietnam, namely Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hoi An and Ha Long.\n2016 was the first year ever which Vietnam received over 10 million international visitors. Since then, this figure has continued to rise. In 2019, Vietnam with 18 million international visitors was fifth most visited country in the Asia-Pacific region as per World Tourism rankings released by the United Nations World Tourism Organization.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam, the country suspended issuance of all tourist visas from March 2020 and recorded a 98% year-on-year drop in foreign visitors for April 2020. Furthermore, Total tourism revenues dropped by over 60% year-on-year for July 2020. The country reopened to international arrivals in March 2022.\nIn the first six months of 2024, Vietnam received 6,943,961 tourist arrivals representing an increase over the same period in 2023 of 65.7 percent.\nTourism has also become a major contributor to the national economy, generating revenues equivalent to around 6.6% of Vietnam's GDP in 2024, with forecasts suggesting an increase to over 7% in 2025.\nThe largest sources of international visitors in 2024 were South Korea, China, and the United States, together accounting for nearly half of total arrivals.\nIn support of this growth, Vietnam has expanded infrastructure with new international terminals at Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City airports, alongside investments in coastal resort zones such as Da Nang and Phu Quoc.\nExport of labour.\nThe export of labour, that is the sending of Vietnamese workers to work in other countries, is also key to the Vietnamese economy, with much of their earnings being sent back to Vietnam. This labour export was disrupted due to the COVID pandemic, however by 2022, Vietnam hopes to send 90,000 workers abroad. Traditional destinations have included South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Republic of China, and now Vietnam is aiming for Germany, Russia, and Israel.\nBanking and finance.\nBanking.\nThe most important banks are the state-owned VietinBank, BIDV, and Vietcombank, which dominate the banking sector. There is also a trend of foreign investment into profitable banks. For example, VietinBank is currently owned by Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ (19.73%) while Vietcombank is owned by Mizuho (15%).\n\"(NOTE: Average exchange rates of 2020. Source: tradingeconomics.com. 1 USD = 23,286 VND)\"\nFinance.\nVietnam has two stock trading centers, the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center and the Hanoi Securities Trading Center, which run the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) and the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX), respectively. However, there is also a third market, the Unlisted Public Companies market (UPCOM) which is a part of the Hanoi Stock Exchange. Together these two trading centres and three exchanges come under the purview of the Vietnam Stock Exchange (VSE). The VSE is a legislated body overseen by the State Securities Commission (SSC) which is a branch of the Ministry of Finance. This structure was established through the Law on Securities 2019.\nCurrency, exchange rate and inflation.\nThe currency used in Vietnam is the \u0111\u1ed3ng, shortened as VND or \u0111.\nExchange rate.\nThe exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng is important because the dong, although not freely convertible, is loosely pegged to the dollar through an arrangement known as a \"crawling peg\". This mechanism allows the dollar\u2013dong exchange rate to adjust gradually to changing market conditions. This was set at 3 percent either side of a fixed rate set each day by the SBV, however, it was increased to 5 percent in October 2022.\nAs of 27 December 2024, a US dollar is worth 25,448 Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng.\nGold still maintains its position as a physical currency to a certain extent, although it has seen its economic role declining in recent years.\nInflation.\nVietnam saw high inflation in 1980s. During this period, there was excessive demand for the industrial sector development, food, and other commodities. In order to stimulate supply, government attempted co-integration of parallel and planned market. Though the initial reform in the 1980s raised the total output, due to the report being partial, it also led to the CPI inflation rate being pushed to 200% in 1982. To tackle this, the government introduced forced savings, which can be understood as the accumulation of unspent money to make the monetary overhang.\nVietnam's economy experienced a hyperinflation period in its early years of the extensive reform program, especially from 1987 to 1992.\nIn 2008, inflation was tracking at 20.3% for the first half of the year, higher than the 3.4% in 2000, but down significantly from 160% in 1988.\nIn 2010, inflation stood at 11.5%, and 18.58% in 2011.\nAt the end of 2012, inflation stood at 7.5%, a substantial decrease from 2011.\nIn 2013, inflation stood at 6%, and 4.09% in 2014. In 2016, it was only 2%.\nMergers and acquisitions.\nWith 1,120 inbound deals with a cumulated value of almost US$15 billion, there is a demonstrated interest by foreign companies to access the Vietnamese market or continue expansion using mergers and acquisitions. From 1991 to February 2018, Vietnamese companies were involved as either an acquiror or an acquired company in 4,000 mergers and acquisitions with a total value of US$40.6 billion. The mergers and acquisitions activities faced many obstacles, lowering the rate of success of the transaction. Common obstacles come from culture, transparency and legal aspects. Among the largest and most prominent transactions since 2000 are:\nAll of the top 10 deals are inbound into Vietnam and none are outbound.\nTrade.\nEconomic relations with the United States are improving but are not without challenges. Although the United States and Vietnam reached a landmark bilateral agreement in December 2001, which helped increase Vietnam's exports to the United States, disagreements over textile and catfish exports are hindering full implementation of the agreement. Further disrupting the economic relations between the two countries were efforts in Congress to link non-humanitarian aid to Vietnam's human rights record. Barriers to trade and intellectual property are also within the purview of bilateral discussions.\nGiven neighboring China's rapid economic ascendancy, Vietnam highly values its economic relationship with China. Following the resolution of most territorial disputes, trade with China is growing rapidly, and in 2004, Vietnam imported more products from China than from any other country. In November 2004, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a member, and China announced plans to establish the world's largest free-trade area by 2010.\nVietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 January 2007.\nIn December 2015, Vietnam joined the ASEAN Economic Community along with the 9 other ASEAN members. The community's goal is to integrate the 10 members of ASEAN and bring a freer flow of labor, investment and trade to the region.\nCurrently, Vietnam is being tugged in multiple directions from multiple powers, namely, Russia, China and the U.S. in its attempts to achieve economic multilateralization. Alternatively in the region, it is also pulled by either China, South Korea, Japan or ASEAN countries, as well as other constituents such as Taiwan &amp; Hong Kong as well as Australia/New Zealand and India in the region (ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6).\nForeign trade.\nSince \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi in 1986, Vietnam has increased trading, growing both exports and imports in double digits ever since. More recently, alarms on trade account deficits have been raised domestically, especially after joining the WTO in 2007. Throughout the next five years after 2007, Vietnam ran a trade deficit with the rest of the world in the tens of billions of dollars, with the record trade deficit in 2008 of US$18 billion.\nThe account deficit has since decreased. In 2012, Vietnam recorded a trade surplus of US$780 million, the first trade surplus since 1993. Total trade reached US$228.13 billion, an increase of 12.1% from 2011. In 2013, Vietnam recorded the second year of trade surplus of US$863 million. In 2014, Vietnam recorded the third year of trade surplus of US$2.14 billion, the largest trade surplus ever in history. Three years later, in 2017, it surpassed itself with a record of $2.92 billion.\nExports.\nIn 2004, Vietnam's exports of merchandise were valued at US$26.5 billion, and were growing rapidly along with imports. Vietnam's principal exports were crude oil (22.1%), textiles and garments (17.1%), footwear (10.5%), fisheries products (9.4%) and electronics (4.1%). The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the United States (18.8%), Japan (13.2%), China (10.3%), Australia (6.9%), Singapore (5.2%), Germany (4.0%), and the United Kingdom (3.8%).\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion. Vietnam's main export market included the EU with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, ASEAN with $US 17.8 billion, Japan with US$13.9 billion, China with US$14.2 billion, and South Korea with US$7 billion.\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The United States continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The EU is second with US$27.9 billion, ASEAN is third, China is fourth and Japan is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\nIn 2024, Vietnam's exports increased 14.3 percent. Among Vietnam's biggest exports were garments and textiles (US$37 billion), electronics (US$72.6 billion), plastics (US$11.8 billion) and furniture (US$3.4 billion).\nImports.\nIn 2004, Vietnam's merchandise imports were valued at US$31.5 billion and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), Taiwan (11.6%), Singapore (11.3%), Japan (11.1%), South Korea (10.4%), Thailand (5.8%), and Malaysia (3.8%).\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion. Major import countries were China US$29.2 billion, ASEAN with US$22.3 billion, South Korea with US$16.2 billion, Japan with US$13.7 billion, EU with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export. China continued to be Vietnam's largest import partner, with US$43.7 billion. The ASEAN is second with US$23.1 billion, South Korea is third, Japan is fourth and the EU is the fifth largest import partner of Vietnam.\nExternal debt, foreign aid and foreign investment.\nIn 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.\nFrom 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. In 2003, new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and construction. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the Japan External Trade Organization of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004. A study was conducted to examine the effect foreign investment had on corruption in Vietnam. The study concluded that the propensity of foreign firms to bribe at entry is higher in restricted sectors. Also, the removal of investment restrictions leads to reductions in bribery as a result of more Foreign Investment Enterprises, and consequently more competition entering that sector.\nThe World Bank's assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and sustainable development and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of official development assistance (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA.\nPledged foreign direct investment was US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008. Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy, especially after 2005.\nIn 2023, Vietnam realised foreign direct investment in the amount of US$23.2 billion and recorded a further US$36.6 billion in registered FDI commitments.\nEconomic development strategy.\nTrade liberalization.\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department). Most recently, on 30 June 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\nDomestic reform.\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. Between 1981 and 2005, Vietnam created a new intellectual property law that gradually moved away from the Soviet-style concept of collective ownership. A milestone in this evolution was the \"Copyright Agreement\" that Vietnam concluded with the US in 1997, serving primarily the US interest of preventing Vietnam from becoming an international center for illegal copying. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006. In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings, Vietnam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\nHuman and physical capital investment.\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 100 million as of 2024, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessities like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operations in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of the international business community.\nSustainable growth.\nEconomic growth in Vietnam was considered as broadly in line with other developing countries. The Inclusive Development Index by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011\u20132020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\", integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011\u20132020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u20132020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The PAVN is the backbone component of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and includes: Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, Border Guard and Coast Guard. Vietnam does not have a separate and formally-structured Ground Force or Army service. Instead, all ground troops, army corps, military districts and special forces are designated under the umbrella term combined arms () and belong to the Ministry of National Defence, directly under the command of the CPV Central Military Commission, the Minister of National Defence, and the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. \nDuring the French Indochina War (1946\u20131954), the PAVN was often referred to as the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. In the context of the Vietnam War (1955\u20131975), the army was referred to by its opposition forces as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA; ), serving as the military force of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This allowed writers, the U.S. military, and the general public, to distinguish northern communists from the southern communists, called the Viet Cong (VC), or more formally the National Liberation Front. However, both groups ultimately worked under the same command structure. The Viet Cong had its own military forces called the Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV). It was practically considered a branch of the PAVN by the North Vietnamese. In 1976, following the political reunification of Vietnam, LASV was officially disbanded and merged into the so-called NVA to form the existing incarnation of PAVN, serving as the national military of the unified state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\nEtymology and symbols.\nEtymology.\nAfter multiple reorganizations during the final days of World War II and subsequently First Indochina War, Viet Minh's primary armed wing was formally named by President Ho Chi Minh and his administration in 1954, and since then, the name has become the sole official designation for the mainline military forces under the governments of the former Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the contemporary Socialist Republic of Vietnam. It is usually translated into English as the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), however, there are more recent consensus and standardization by official Vietnamese narratives to use Vietnam People's Army (VPA) as the uniformed English designation. The name shares the common \"People\" theming with many communist forces, and according to President Ho, this naming is to emphasize the military's morality of being \"from the People, fight for the People, and serve the People.\"\nThe usage of the word \"Army\" in English translations has caused confusion by making people mistakenly identifying the Vietnam People's Army to be the land service branch of the combined Vietnam People's Armed Forces, just like how the United States Army is under the United States Armed Forces. While VPA itself is already the entired combined military force and is indeed a part of the People's Armed Forces, in Vietnam, the Armed Forces is the umbrella designation to call the national uniformed services that consist of the military (VPA), the police (PPS), and the militia. In other words, Vietnam's \"Army\" is equivalent to most of the nations' \"Armed Forces\" or \"Defence Forces\", and in practice being similar to the Red Army, the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, the People's Liberation Army of China, and to some extent, the Army of the Czech Republic. VPA's land warfare arms have not been organized under an actual \"Ground Force\" () service branch, which would be comparable to many countries' \"Army\".\nSymbols and identification.\nAccording to codified regulations from the Government of Vietnam, the VPA emblem () is \"circular, with a shaded golden star in the middle, surrounded by two golden rice ears on a bright red background; below the two rice ears is a half golden cogwheel, with a golden outer rim\" and will be employed by all VPA service branches and components, expect Vietnam Coast Guard which uses slightly modified variants. There are different variants for different levels of usage from combat uniforms to service dress and full ceremonial, as well as versions for general officers, with all of them respecting the cited symbolism.\nThe VPA military flag () is the \"red banner with golden star\" national flag of Vietnam defaced with the motto (Determination to win) added in yellow at the canton (the top corner by the flagpole), having the unit's formal name or designation to be inscribed below the golden star in ceremonial occasions. Vietnam does not issue any distinctive unit colors, formation patches or shoulder sleeve insignia besides the units' inscribed military flags, shoulder patches indicating the service branches, as well as physical collar tabs indicating the service branches, combat arms and ranking.\nMost VPA armored vehicles are decorated with \"roundels\", to be a red circular field with a central yellow five-pointed star, bordered by a thick yellow ring. Meanwhile, most military aircraft are also designated with the similar roundels, however added with a pair of yellow-bordered red wing devices.\nHistory.\nBefore 1945.\nThe first historical record of Vietnamese military history dates back to the era of H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng, the first recorded state in ancient Vietnam to have assembled military force. Since then, military plays a crucial role in developing Vietnamese history due to its turbulent history of wars against China, Champa, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.\nThe Southern expansion of Vietnam resulted in the destruction of Champa as an independent nation to a level that it did not exist anymore; total destruction of Luang Prabang; the decline of Cambodia which resulted in Vietnam's annexation of the Mekong Delta and wars against Siam. In most of its history, the Royal Vietnamese Armed Forces was often regarded to be one of the most professional, battle-hardened and heavily trained armies in Southeast Asia as well as Asia in a large extent.\nEstablishment.\nThe PAVN was first conceived in September 1944 at the first Revolutionary Party Military Conference as the Information, Communication and Education Unit of the Liberation Army (alternatively translated as the Vietnam Information, Communication and Education Liberation Army, ) to educate, recruit and mobilise the Vietnamese to create a main force to drive the French colonial and Japanese occupiers from Vietnam. Under the guidelines of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p was given the task of establishing the brigades and the Propaganda Unit of the Liberation Army came into existence on 22 December 1944. The first formation was made up of thirty-one men and three women, armed with two revolvers, seventeen rifles, one light machine gun, and fourteen breech-loading flintlocks. It fought the PAVN's first ever engagement at the Battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan against French soldiers in late 1944. The United States' OSS agents, led by Archimedes Patti \u2013 who was sometimes referred as the first instructor of the PAVN due to his role - had provided ammunitions as well as logistic intelligence and equipment. They also helped train these soldiers, who formed the backbone of the Vietnamese military to successfully fight the Japanese and other opponents. For instance, the PAVN's July 19, 1945 attack at Tam Dao internment camp in Tonkin saw 500 soldiers kill fifty Japanese soldiers and officials, freeing French civilian captives and escorting them to the Chinese border. The PAVN also fought the Japanese 21st Division in Thai Nguyen that year, and regularly raided rice storehouses to alleviate an ongoing famine.\nThere was another separate communist army called the National Salvation Army (\"C\u1ee9u qu\u1ed1c qu\u00e2n\") which was founded and commanded by Chu V\u0103n T\u1ea5n on 23/2/1941.\nOn 15/5/1945 the Propaganda Liberation Army merged with the National Salvation Army into the Vietnam Liberation Army (\"Vi\u1ec7t Nam Gi\u1ea3i ph\u00f3ng Qu\u00e2n\") on 15 May 1945. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed in Hanoi by Ho Chi Minh and Vietminh on 2 September 1945. Then in September, the army was renamed the Vietnam National Defence Force (\"Vi\u1ec7t Nam V\u1ec7 qu\u1ed1c \u0110o\u00e0n\"). At this point, it had about 1,000 soldiers. On 22 May 1946, the army was called the National Army of Vietnam (\"Qu\u00e2n \u0111\u1ed9i Qu\u1ed1c gia Vi\u1ec7t Nam\", not to be confused with the opposite Vietnamese National Army of the France-associated State of Vietnam which had a synonymous English name and exactly the same Vietnamese name). Lastly, in 1950, it officially became the People's Army of Vietnam (or Vietnam People's Army, \"Qu\u00e2n \u0111\u1ed9i Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n Vi\u1ec7t Nam\").\nV\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p went on to become the first full general of the PAVN on 28 May 1948, and famous for leading the PAVN in victory over French forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and being in overall command against U.S. backed South Vietnam at the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.\nFrench Indochina War.\nOn 7 January 1947, its first regiment, the 102nd 'Capital' Regiment, was created for operations around Hanoi. Over the next two years, the first division, the 308th Division, later well known as the Pioneer Division, was formed from the 88th Tu Vu Regiment and the 102nd Capital Regiment. By late 1950 the 308th Division had a full three infantry regiments, when it was supplemented by the 36th Regiment. At that time, the 308th Division was also backed by the 11th Battalion that later became the main force of the 312th Division. In late 1951, after launching three campaigns against three French strongpoints in the Red River Delta, the PAVN refocused on building up its ground forces further, with five new divisions, each of 10\u201315,000 men, created: the 304th Glory Division at Thanh H\u00f3a, the 312th Victory Division in Vinh Phuc, the 316th Bong Lau Division in the northwest border region, the 320th Delta Division in the north Red River Delta, the 325th Binh Tri Thien Division in Binh Tri Thien province. Also in 1951, the first artillery Division, the 351st Division was formed, and later, before Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, for the first time in history, it was equipped with 24 captured 105mm US howitzers supplied by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The first six divisions (308th, 304th, 312th, 316th, 320th, 325th) became known as the original PAVN 'Steel and Iron' divisions. In 1954, four of these divisions (the 308th, 304th, 312nd, 316th, supported by the 351st Division's captured US howitzers) defeated the French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, ending 83 years of French rule in Indochina.\nThe French Foreign Legion had been deployed to combat the Vietnamese insurgency during the First Indochina War. However, some of the legionnaires, such as Stefan Kubiak, deserted after witnessing torture of Vietnamese peasants at the hands of French troops and began fighting for the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, volunteering to join the PAVN.\nVietnam War.\nSoon after the 1954 Geneva Accords, the 330th and 338th Divisions were formed by southern Viet Minh members who had moved north in conformity with that agreement, and by 1955, six more divisions were formed: the 328th, 332nd and 350th in the north of the North Vietnam, the 305th and the 324th near the DMZ, and the 335 Division of soldiers repatriated from Laos. In 1957, the theatres of the war with the French were reorganised as the first five military regions, and in the next two years, several divisions were reduced to brigade size to meet the manpower requirements of collective farms.\nBy 1958, it was becoming increasingly clear that the South Vietnamese government was solidifying its position as an independent republic under Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, who staunchly opposed the terms of the Geneva Accords, which required a national referendum on unification of north and south Vietnam under a single national government. North Vietnam prepared to settle the issue of unification by force.\nIn May 1959, the first major steps to prepare infiltration routes into South Vietnam were taken; Group 559 was established, a logistical unit charged with establishing routes into the south via Laos and Cambodia, which later became famous as the Ho Chi Minh trail. At about the same time, Group 579 was created as its maritime counterpart to transport supplies into the South by sea. Most of the early infiltrators were members of the 338th Division, former southerners who had been settled at Xuan Mai from 1954 onwards.\nRegular formations were sent to South Vietnam from 1965 onwards; the 325th Division's 101B Regiment and the 66th Regiment of the 304th Division met U.S. forces on a large scale, a first for the PAVN, at the Battle of Ia Drang in November 1965. The 308th Division's 88A Regiment, the 312th Division's 141A, 141B, 165A, 209A, the 316th Division's 174A, the 325th Division's 95A, 95B, the 320A Division also faced the U.S. forces which included the 1st Cavalry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 4th Infantry Division, the 1st Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division. Many of those formations later became main forces of the 3rd Division (Yellow Star Division) in Binh Dinh (1965), the 5th Division (1966) of 7th Military Zone (Capital Tactical Area of ARVN), the 7th (created by 141st and 209th Regiments originated in the 312th Division in 1966) and 9th Divisions (first Division of National Liberation Front of Vietnam in 1965 in Mekong Delta), the 10th Dakto Division in Dakto \u2013 Central Highlands in 1972.\nOn 20 December 1960, anti-government forces in South Vietnam joined to form a united front called National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (\"M\u1eb7t tr\u1eadn D\u00e2n t\u1ed9c Gi\u1ea3i ph\u00f3ng Mi\u1ec1n Nam Vi\u1ec7t Nam\") or simply known as the Vietcong in the United States. On 15 December 1961, the NLF established its own military called Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV) to fight against the American supported Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The LASV was controlled and equipped by the PAVN.\nGeneral Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0, one-time commander of the B2 Front (Saigon) HQ confirms that even though the PAVN and the LASV were confident in their ability to defeat the regular ARVN forces, U.S. intervention in Vietnam forced them to reconsider their operations. The decision was made to continue to pursue \"main force\" engagements even though \"there were others in the South \u2013 they were not military people \u2013 who wanted to go back to guerrilla war,\" but the strategic aims were adjusted to meet the new reality.\nWe had to change our plan and make it different from when we fought the Saigon regime, because we now had to fight two adversaries \u2014 the United States and South Vietnam. We understood that the U.S. Army was superior to our own logistically, in weapons and in all things. So strategically we did not hope to defeat the U.S. Army completely. Our intentions were to fight a long time and cause heavy casualties to the United States, so the United States would see that the war was unwinnable and would leave.\nDuring the Vietnamese Lunar New Year T\u1ebft holiday starting on 30 January 1968, the PAVN/VC launched a general offensive in more than 60 cities and towns throughout south of Vietnam against the US Army and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), beginning with operations in the border region to try and draw US forces and ARVN troops out of the major cities. In coordinated attacks, the U.S Embassy in Saigon, Presidential Palace, Headquarters of the Joint General Staff and Republic of Vietnam Navy, TV and Radio Stations, Tan Son Nhat Air Base in Saigon were attacked by commando forces known as \"\u0111\u1eb7c c\u00f4ng\". This offensive became known as the \"Tet Offensive\". The PAVN sustained heavy losses of its main forces in southern military zones. Some of its regular forces and command structure had to escape to Laos and Cambodia to avoid counterattacks from US forces and ARVN, while local guerrillas forces and political organisations in South Vietnam were exposed and had a hard time remaining within the Mekong Delta area due to the extensive use of the Phoenix Program.\nAlthough the PAVN lost militarily to the US forces and ARVN in the south, the political impact of the war in the United States was strong. Public demonstrations increased in ferocity and quantity after the Tet Offensive. During 1970, the 5th, 7th and 9th Divisions fought in Cambodia against U.S., ARVN, and Cambodian Khmer National Armed Forces. The PAVN gained new allies: the Khmer Rouge and guerrilla fighters supporting deposed Prime Minister Sihanouk. In 1975 the PAVN were successful in aiding the Khmer Rouge in toppling Lon Nol's U.S.-backed regime, despite heavy US bombing.\nAfter the withdrawal of most U.S. combat forces from Indochina because of the Vietnamization strategy, the PAVN launched the ill-fated Easter Offensive in 1972. Although successful at the beginning, the South Vietnamese repulsed the main assaults with U.S. air support. Still North Vietnam retained some South Vietnamese territory.\nNearly two years after the full U.S. withdrawal from Indochina in accordance with the terms of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the PAVN launched a Spring offensive aimed at overthrowing the South Vietnamese government and uniting Vietnam under communist rule. Without direct support of the U.S., and suffering from stresses caused by dwindling aid, the ARVN was ill-prepared to confront the highly motivated PAVN, and despite the on paper superiority of the ARVN, the PAVN quickly secured victory within two months and captured Saigon on 30 April 1975, ending the 20 year Vietnam war.\nAfter national reunification, the LASV was officially merged into PAVN on 2 July 1976.\nSino-Vietnamese conflicts (1975\u20131991).\nTowards the second half of the 20th century the armed forces of Vietnam would participate in organised incursions to protect its citizens and allies against aggressive military factions in the neighbouring Indochinese countries of Laos and Cambodia, and the defensive border wars with China.\nModern deployment.\nThe PAVN has been actively involved in Vietnam's workforce to develop the economy of Vietnam by co-ordinating national defence. It has regularly sent troops to aid with natural disasters such as flooding, landslides etc. The PAVN is also involved in such areas as industry, agriculture, forestry, fishery and telecommunications. The PAVN has numerous small firms which have become quite profitable in recent years. However, recent decrees have effectively prohibited the commercialisation of the military. Conscription is in place for theoretically every male, age 18 to 25 years old, with the exception of the disabled and men who attended universities right after high school.\nInternational presence &amp; operations.\nThe Foreign Relations Department of the Ministry of National Defence organises international operations of the PAVN.\nApart from its occupation of half of the disputed Spratly Islands, which have been claimed as Vietnamese territory since the 17th century, Vietnam has not officially had forces stationed internationally since its withdrawal from Cambodia and Laos in early 1990.\nVietnamese assistance for overseas leftist insurgencies.\nThe effectiveness of the People's Army of Vietnam Special Operation Forces during the Vietnam War saw them instruct various other countries and Marxist rebel groups. From the 1970s to 1990s, they covertly provided training at the PAVN Sapper Training School in via Vietnamese sapper advisors assigned to the Cuban Army's Sapper School in Cuba, and, during the 1980s, by a secret Vietnamese sapper training team stationed in Nicaragua.\u00a0In addition to training Cambodian, Laotian, Soviet, and Cuban military personnel, their publications revealed that among the foreign revolutionary forces that received training in sapper tactics, bomb-making, and the use of weapons and explosives, were members of the Marxist El Salvadoran FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front), the Chilean MIR (Movement of the Revolutionary Left) fighting against the dictatorial regime of Augusto Pinochet, as well as the Colombian FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) movement, a Marxist guerilla group.\nVietnamese intervention in Lao security crises.\nThe Center for Public Policy Analysis and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as Laotian and Hmong human rights organisations, including the Lao Human Rights Council, Inc. and the United League for Democracy in Laos, Inc., have provided evidence that since the end of the Vietnam War, significant numbers of Vietnamese military and security forces continue to be sent to Laos, on a repeated basis, to quell and suppress Laotian political and religious dissident and opposition groups including the peaceful 1999 Lao Students for Democracy protest in Vientiane in 1999 and the Hmong rebellion. In late November 2009, shortly before the start of the 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane, the PAVN undertook a major troop surge in key rural and mountainous provinces in Laos where Lao and Hmong civilians and religious believers, including Christians, have sought sanctuary.\nModern-era peacekeeping operations.\nIn 2014, Vietnam had requested to join the United Nations peacekeeping force, which was later approved. The first Vietnamese UN peacekeeping officers were sent to South Sudan, marked the first involvement of Vietnam into a United Nations' mission abroad. Vietnamese peacekeepers were also sent to the Central African Republic.\nFrom 2022, Vietnam has deployed its first military engineer unit to the peacekeeping missions in Abyei.\n2023 Turkish-Syrian earthquake.\nAs an effort to help Turkey overcome the consequences of the 2023 earthquake, PAVN has sent 76 servicemen of the Border Guard, Army Medic, and Engineering Corps (alongside personnel from Public Security) to participate in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief including search-and-rescue missions.\nThis is the first time ever that Vietnam has officially deployed and engaged in an overseas search and rescue campaign.\n2025 Myanmar earthquake.\nThe PAVN deployed 76 personnel from the Border Guard, Army Medical Corps, and Engineering Corps, along with members of the Public Security forces, to take part in humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search-and-rescue operations in Sagaing on 31 March.\nOrganisation.\nThe \"de jure\" Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces is the President of Vietnam, though this position is virtually nominal and a majority of political power over the military is assumed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam. The secretary of Central Military Commission (usually the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam) is the \"de facto\" supreme commander and now is T\u00f4 L\u00e2m.\nThe Minister of National Defence oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the PAVN. He also oversees such agencies as the General Staff and the General Department of Logistics. However, military policy is ultimately directed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.\nService branches.\nThe Vietnamese People's Army is subdivided into the following service branches:\n(B\u1ed9 T\u01b0 l\u1ec7nh B\u1ea3o v\u1ec7 L\u0103ng\nCh\u1ee7 t\u1ecbch H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh)\nThe People's Army of Vietnam composes of the standing (or regular) forces and the reserve forces. The standing forces include the main forces and the local forces. During peacetime, the standing forces are minimised in number, and kept combat-ready by regular physical and weapons training, and stock maintenance.\nVietnam People's Ground Force.\nWithin PAVN the Ground Force have not been established as a separate full Service Command, thus \"all of the ground troops, army corps, military districts and the specialised arms\" are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence, under the direct command of the General Staff, who serves as its \"de facto\" commander. \nMilitary regions.\nThe following military regions are under the direct control of the General Staff and the Ministry of Defence:\nMain forces.\nThe Main Force of the PAVN and its People's Ground Forces consists of combat ready troops, as well as support units such as educational institutions for logistics, officer training, and technical training. In 1991, Conboy et al. stated that the PAVN Ground Force had four 'Strategic Army Corps' in the early 1990s, numbering 1\u20134, from north to south. 1st Corps, located in the Red River Delta region, consisted of the 308th (one of the six original 'Steel and Iron' divisions) and 312th Divisions, and the 309th Infantry Regiment. The other three corps, 2 SAC, 3 SAC, and 4 SAC, were further south, with 4th Corps, in Southern Vietnam, consisting of two former LASV divisions, the 7th and 9th.\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the IISS Military Balance attributed the Vietnamese ground forces with an estimated 412,000 personnel. Formations, according to the IISS, include 8 military regions, 4 corps headquarters, 1 special forces airborne brigade, 6 armoured brigades and 3 armoured regiments, two mechanised infantry divisions, and 23 active infantry divisions plus another 9 reserve ones.\nCombat support formations include 13 artillery brigades and one artillery regiment, 11 air defence brigades, 10 engineers brigades, 1 electronic warfare unit, 3 signals brigades and 2 signals regiment.\nCombat service support formations include 9 economic construction divisions, 1 logistical regiment, 1 medical unit and 1 training regiment. Ross wrote in 1984 that economic construction division \"are composed of regular troops that are fully trained and armed, and reportedly they are subordinate to their own directorate in the Ministry of Defense. They have specific military missions; however, they are also entrusted with economic tasks such as food production or construction work. They are composed partially of older veterans.\"\nRoss also cited 1980s sources saying that economic construction divisions each had a strength of about 3,500.\nIn 2017, the listing was amended, with the addition of a single Short-range ballistic missile brigade. The ground forces according to the IISS, hold Scud-B/C SRBMs.\n 12th Corps\nFirst organised on 21 November 2023, the 12th Corps was created by merging all of the units from the former 1st Corps and the 2nd Corps. It is stationed in Tam \u0110i\u1ec7p District, Ninh B\u00ecnh.\n 34th Corps\nFirst organised on 10 December 2024, the 34th Corps was created by merging all of the units from the former 3rd Corps and the 4th Corps. Stationed in Pleiku, Gia Lai.\nLocal forces.\nLocal forces are an entity of the PAVN that, together with the militia and \"self-defence forces\", act on the local level in protection of people and local authorities. While the local forces are regular VPA forces, the people's militia consists of rural civilians, and the people's self-defence forces consist of civilians who live in urban areas and/or work in large groups, such as at construction sites or farms. The current number stands at 3\u20134\u00a0million reservists and militia personnel combined. They serve as force multipliers to the PAVN and Public Security during wartime and peacetime contingencies.\nRanks and insignia.\nCommissioned officer ranks.\nThe rank insignia of commissioned officers.\nOther ranks.\nThe rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.\nEquipment.\nFrom the 1960s to 1975 the Soviet Union, along with some smaller Eastern Bloc countries, was the main supplier of military hardware to North Vietnam. After the latter's victory in the war, it remained the main supplier of equipment to Vietnam. The United States had been the primary supplier of equipment to South Vietnam; much of the equipment left by the U.S. Army and the ARVN came under control of the re-unified Vietnamese government. The PAVN captured large numbers of ARVN weapons on 30 April 1975 after Saigon was captured.\nRussia remains the largest arms-supplier for Vietnam; even after 1986, there were also increasing arms sales from other nations, notably from India, Turkey, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and France. In 2016, President Barack Obama announced the lifting of the lethal weapons embargo on Vietnam, which has increased Vietnamese military equipment choices from other countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries, which could enable a faster modernization of the Vietnamese military. Since 2018, the United States has begun to provide warships for Vietnam Coast Guard as part of the military cooperation between two states, the first of these ships arrived in 2021.\nDespite Russia remaining Vietnam's largest weapon supplier, increasing cooperation with Israel has resulted in the development of Vietnamese weaponry with a strong mixture of Russian and Israeli weapons. For examples, the STV rifles are three Vietnam-made indigenous service rifles modeled after the Galil ACE of Israel.\nNotes.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Vietnam has shifted from a fierce opponent of the United States to a friendlier relations. Vietnam has for decades has both kept close economic and political ties with China and consistently sought to deny Chinese regional dominance.\nHistory.\nMonarchial Vietnam.\nIn its early history, Vietnam tried to maintain good relations with its neighbours. From the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng dynasty to many feudal dynasties like the Ng\u00f4, \u0110inh, Anterior L\u00ea, L\u00fd, Tr\u1ea7n, L\u00ea, T\u00e2y S\u01a1n and Nguy\u1ec5n, Vietnam's main diplomatic relationships were with neighboring Imperial China, Kingdom of Champa, Khmer Empire, Lan Xang kingdom and Siam. Later trading relationship were established with European countries (such as through the Dutch East India Company) and Japan.\nCold War era and the two Vietnams.\nFollowing Japan's surrender, British and Chinese Nationalist forces entered Vietnam to supervise the disarmament of Japanese troops. Following the 1946 Ho\u2013Sainteny Agreement, the communist-led Democratic Republic of Vietnam was recognized as a \"free state\" within the French Union. However, total war broke out later that year. The anti-communist State of Vietnam was established in 1949 under the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Accords and recognized as an \"independent state\" associated with the French Union.\nIn January 1950, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union were the first two countries to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States and other Western countries recognized the State of Vietnam. The colonial war and the civil war in Vietnam became internationalized and intertwined with the global Cold War. The 1954 Geneva Accords temporarily divided the country into North Vietnam and South Vietnam.\nDuring the Vietnam War (1959\u20131975), North Vietnam tried to balance relations with its two major allies, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. In 1964, Zhou Enlai, worried about the escalation of U.S. forces in South Vietnam, made an informal agreement with the North. The agreement stipulated that if U.S. and South Vietnamese forces invaded North Vietnam, the Chinese would respond by loaning pilots to the North. During the invasion, Mao Zedong failed to send as many trained pilots as he promised. As a result, the North became more reliant on the Soviet Union for its defense.\nBy 1977, tension began to grow as Beijing increasingly viewed Vietnam as a potential Soviet instrument to encircle China. Meanwhile, Beijing's increasing support for Cambodia's Khmer Rouge sparked Vietnamese suspicions of China's motives.\nVietnamese-Chinese relations deteriorated significantly after Hanoi instituted a ban in March 1978 on private trade, a move that particularly affected the Sino-Vietnamese sector of the population. Following Vietnam's December 1978 invasion of Cambodia, China launched a retaliatory invasion of Vietnam's northern border region. Faced with severance of Chinese aid and strained international relations, Vietnam established even closer ties with the Soviet Union and its allies in the Comecon member states. Throughout the 1980s, Vietnam received nearly US$3\u00a0billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union and conducted most of its trade with the U.S.S.R. and Comecon countries. Soviet and Eastern bloc economic aid, however, ceased after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nInternational memberships.\nIn 1951, both the State of Vietnam (SVN) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) applied for United Nations membership. In 1952, the SVN, which would later continue as the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), was granted observer status in the UN General Assembly. The DRV and the Republic of South Vietnam gained observer status only in July 1975.\nThe Soviet Union in 1952 vetoed the SVN's admission to full UN membership. In 1957, the General Assembly twice reaffirmed that the RVN was fully qualified for membership and should be admitted, yet both attempts were again vetoed by the Soviet Union. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, unified in 1976, maintained a sole observer mission and was admitted as a full UN member in September 1977.\nThe State of Vietnam was admitted to several specialized agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Universal Postal Union (UPU). As the continuator of the State of Vietnam, the Republic of Vietnam maintained membership in these organizations and later joined the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), among others.\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was not a member of any of these organizations and only joined the WMO in August 1975 and the WHO in October 1975. After the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam substituted for or continued South Vietnam's membership in many organizations, while in other cases it joined as a new member state.\n\u0110\u1ed5i m\u1edbi reforms.\nVietnam didn't begin to emerge from international isolation until it withdrew its troops from Cambodia in 1989. Within months of the 1991 Paris Agreements, Vietnam established diplomatic and economic relations with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states and also with most countries of Western Europe and Asia's Far East. China re-established full diplomatic ties with Vietnam in 1991. The two nations concluded a land border demarcation agreement in 1999. In 1995, the US and Vietnam re-established diplomatic ties. United States\u2013Vietnam relations improved in August 1995, when both nations upgraded their liaison offices opened during January 1995 to embassy status, with the United States later opening a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City, and Vietnam opening a consulate in San Francisco.\nIn 2001, Vietnam signed 16 free trade agreements.41\nFull diplomatic relations were restored with New Zealand who opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995, while Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. Pakistan reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000. Vietnam also reopened its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005.\nIn the past decade, Vietnam has recognized the importance of growing global economic interdependence and has made concerted efforts to adjust its foreign relations to reflect the evolving international economic and political situation in Southeast Asia. The country has begun to integrate itself into the regional and global economy by joining international organizations. Vietnam has stepped up its efforts to attract foreign capital from the West and regularize relations with the world financial system. In the 1990s, following the lifting of the US veto on multilateral loans to the country, Vietnam became a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Asian Development Bank. The country has expanded trade with its East Asian neighbors as well as with countries in Western Europe and North America. Of particular significance was Vietnam's acceptance into ASEAN in July 1995. Vietnam joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in November 1998 and also hosted the ASEAN summit the following month. In 2005, Vietnam attended the inaugural East Asia Summit. Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization in November 2006.\nCurrent issues.\nIn 2011 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, at the 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, released an official statement about Vietnam's foreign policy and a section of the statement stated: \"Vietnam is a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community, actively taking part in international and regional cooperation processes. Deepen, stabilize and sustain established international relations. Develop relations with countries and territories in the world, as well as international organizations, while showing: respect for each other's independence; sovereignty and territorial integrity; non-interference in each other's international affairs; non-use or threat of force; settlement of disagreements and disputes by means of peaceful negotiations; mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.\"\nWhile Vietnam has remained relatively conflict-free since its Cambodia days, tensions have arisen in the past between Vietnam and its neighbors, especially in the case of China since both nations assert claims to the Spratly and Paracel Islands - the two archipelagos in a potentially oil-rich area of the South China Sea. Conflicting claims have produced over the years small scale armed altercations in the area. In 1988, more than 70 Vietnamese troops were killed during a confrontation with Chinese forces, when China occupied several islands under Vietnamese control in the Spratly Islands. China's assertion of control over the Spratly Islands and the entire South China Sea has elicited concern from Vietnam and its Southeast Asia neighbors. The territorial border between the two countries is being definitively mapped pursuant to a Land Border Agreement signed in December 1999, and an Agreement on Borders in the Gulf of Tonkin signed in December 2000. Vietnam and Russia declared a strategic partnership in March 2001 during the first visit ever to Hanoi of a Russian head of state, largely as an attempt to counterbalance China's growing profile in Southeast Asia.\nDisputes \u2013 international: maritime boundary with Cambodia not defined; involved in a complex dispute over the Spratly - Paracel Islands with the People's Republic of China (PRC), Malaysia, Philippines, and possibly Brunei; maritime boundary with Thailand resolved in August 1997; maritime boundary dispute with the PRC in the Gulf of Tonkin resolved in 2000; Paracel Islands occupied by the PRC since 1974; offshore islands and sections of boundary with Cambodia are in dispute; agreement on land border with the People's Republic of China was signed in December 1999.\nIllicit drugs: minor producer of opium poppy with 21 km2 cultivated in 1999, capable of producing 11 metric tons of opium; probably minor transit point for Southeast Asian heroin destined for the US and Europe; growing opium/heroin addiction; possible small-scale heroin production.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Vietnam maintains diplomatic relations with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32388", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32388", "title": "Victoria, British Columbia", "text": "Capital city of British Columbia, Canada\nVictoria is the capital city of the Canadian province of British Columbia, located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island off Canada's Pacific coast. The city has a population of 91,867, and the Greater Victoria area has a population of 397,237. The city of Victoria is the seventh most densely populated city in Canada with .\nVictoria is the southernmost major city in Western Canada and is about southwest from British Columbia's largest city of Vancouver on the mainland. The city is about from Seattle by airplane, seaplane, ferry, or the Victoria Clipper passenger-only ferry, and from Port Angeles, Washington, by the ferry across the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\nNamed for Queen Victoria, the city is one of the oldest in the Pacific Northwest, with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, the Parliament Buildings (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia) and the Empress Hotel (opened in 1908). The city's Chinatown is the second oldest in North America, after San Francisco. The region's Coast Salish First Nations peoples established communities in the area long before European settlement, which had large populations at the time of European exploration.\nKnown as \"the Garden City\", Victoria is an attractive city and a popular tourism destination and has a regional technology sector that has risen to be its largest revenue-generating private industry. In 2019, Victoria was in the top 20 world cities for quality of life, according to Numbeo.\nHistory.\nPrior to the arrival of European navigators in the late 1700s, the Greater Victoria area was home to several communities of Coast Salish peoples, including the L\u0259k\u0313\u02b7\u0259\u014b\u0259n (Lekwungen) and W\u0331S\u00c1NE\u0106 (Saanich) peoples.\nEarly European exploration (1770\u20131871).\nThe Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of Juan P\u00e9rez in 1774, and of James Cook in 1778. Although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not explored until 1790, Spanish sailors visited Esquimalt Harbour (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.\nIn 1841, James Douglas was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. Upon the recommendation by George Simpson a new more northerly post should be built in case Fort Vancouver fell into American hands (see Oregon boundary dispute). Douglas founded Fort Victoria on the site of present-day Victoria in anticipation of the outcome of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, extending the British North America/United States border along the 49th parallel from the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia.\nIn 1843, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post was erected on a site originally called Camosack meaning \"rush of water\". Known briefly as \"Fort Albert\", the settlement was renamed Fort Victoria in November 1843, in honour of Queen Victoria. The Songhees established a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees' village was later moved north of Esquimalt in 1911.The crown colony was established in 1849. Between 1850\u20131854, a series of treaty agreements known as the Douglas Treaties were made with indigenous communities to purchase certain plots of land in exchange for goods. These agreements contributed to a town being laid out on the site and made the capital of the colony, though controversy has followed about the ethical negotiation and upholding of rights by the colonial government. The superintendent of the fort, Chief Factor James Douglas, was made the second governor of the Vancouver Island Colony (Richard Blanshard was first governor, Arthur Edward Kennedy was third and last governor), and would be the leading figure in the early development of the city until his retirement in 1864.\nWhen news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached San Francisco in 1858, Victoria became the port, supply base, and outfitting centre for miners on their way to the Fraser Canyon gold fields, mushrooming from a population of 300 to over 5,000 within a few days. Victoria was incorporated as a city in 1862. In 1862 Victoria was the epicentre of the 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic which devastated First Nations, killing about two-thirds of all natives in British Columbia. In 1865, the North Pacific home of the Royal Navy was established in Esquimalt and today is Canada's Pacific coast naval base. In 1866 when the island was politically united with the mainland, Victoria was designated the capital of the new united colony instead of New Westminster \u2013 an unpopular move on the Mainland \u2013 and became the provincial capital when British Columbia joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871.\nModern history (1871\u2013present).\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the Port of Victoria became one of North America's largest importers of opium, serving the opium trade from Hong Kong and distribution into North America. Opium trade was legal and unregulated until 1865, when the legislature issued licences and levied duties on its import and sale. The opium trade was banned in 1908.\nIn 1886, with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus on Burrard Inlet, Victoria's position as the commercial centre of British Columbia was irrevocably lost to the city of Vancouver. The city subsequently began cultivating an image of genteel civility within its natural setting, aided by the impressions of visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, the opening of the popular Butchart Gardens in 1904 and the construction of the Empress Hotel by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1908. Robert Dunsmuir, a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed Craigdarroch Castle in the Rockland area, near the official residence of the province's Lieutenant Governor. His son, James Dunsmuir, became Premier and subsequently Lieutenant Governor of the province and built his own grand residence at Hatley Park (used for several decades as Royal Roads Military College, now civilian Royal Roads University) in the present City of Colwood.\nA real-estate and development boom ended just before World War I, leaving Victoria with a large stock of Edwardian public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character. With the economic crash and an abundance of unmarried men, Victoria became an excellent location for military recruiting. Two militia infantry battalions, the 88th Victoria Fusiliers and the 50th Gordon Highlanders, formed in the immediate pre-war period. Victoria was the home of Sir Arthur Currie. He had been a high-school teacher and real-estate agent prior to the war and was the Commanding Officer of the Gordon Highlanders in the summer of 1914. Before the end of the war he commanded the Canadian Corps. A number of municipalities surrounding Victoria were incorporated during this period, including the Township of Esquimalt, the District of Oak Bay, and several municipalities on the Saanich Peninsula.\nWater in Greater Victoria had a reputation for excellent purity, and for several decades in the 20th century there was effective resistance to chlorination. However, drinking water has been chlorinated since March 1944.\nSince World War II the Victoria area has seen relatively steady growth, becoming home to two major universities. Since the 1980s the western suburbs have been incorporated as new municipalities, such as Colwood and Langford, which are known collectively as the Western Communities.\nGreater Victoria periodically experiences calls for the amalgamation of the thirteen municipal governments within the Capital Regional District. The opponents of amalgamation state that separate governance affords residents a greater deal of local autonomy. The proponents of amalgamation argue it would reduce duplication of services, while allowing for more efficient use of resources and the ability to better handle broad, regional issues and long-term planning.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nThe landscape of Victoria was formed by volcanism followed by water in various forms. Pleistocene glaciation put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam till. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and gravel. Marine clay settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the British Columbia Coast. Their thick dark topsoils denote a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming prior to urbanization.\nClimate.\nDepending on the classification used, Victoria either has a warm-summer Mediterranean or oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csb,\" Trewartha: \"Do\"); with fresh, dry, sunny summers, and cool, cloudy, rainy winters.\nVictoria is farther north than many \"cold-winter\" cities, such as Ottawa, Quebec City, and Minneapolis. However, westerly winds and Pacific Ocean currents keep Victoria's winter temperatures substantially higher, with an average January temperature of (Gonzales) and (University of Victoria) compared to Ottawa, the nation's capital, with .\nAt the Victoria Gonzales weather station, daily temperatures rise above on average less than one day per year and fall below on average only ten nights per year. Victoria has recorded completely freeze-free winter seasons four times (in 1925\u201326, 1939\u201340, 1999\u20132000, and 2002\u201303). 1999 is the only calendar year on record without a single occurrence of frost. During this time the city went 718 days without freezing, starting on 23 December 1998 and ending 10 December 2000. The second longest frost-free period was a 686-day stretch covering 1925 and 1926, marking the first and last time the city has gone the entire season without dropping below .\nDuring the winter, the average daily high and low temperatures are , respectively. The summer months are also relatively mild, with an average high temperature of and low of , although inland areas often experience warmer daytime highs. The highest temperature ever recorded at Victoria Gonzales was on 28 June 2021; The coldest temperature on record is , first set on 2 December 1941. The average annual temperature varies from a high of set in 2004 to a low of set in 1916.\nDue to the rain shadow effect of the nearby Olympic Mountains, Victoria is the driest location on the British Columbia coast and one of the driest in the region. Average precipitation amounts in the Greater Victoria area range from at the Gonzales observatory in the City of Victoria to at the University of Victoria. The Victoria Airport, north of the city, receives about 45% more precipitation than the city proper. Regional average precipitation amounts range from as low as on the north shore of the Olympic Peninsula to in Port Renfrew just away on the more exposed southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Vancouver measures annually and Seattle is at .\nOne feature of Victoria's climate is its distinct dry and rainy seasons. Over 60% of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, November to February at Gonzales Heights. However, at the University of Victoria, approximately north, over 60% of the annual precipitation falls between the four wettest months, October to January. Precipitation in December, the wettest month () is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month (). At the University of Victoria the wettest month is November with . Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).\nVictoria averages just of snow annually, about half that of Vancouver. Roughly one third of winters see virtually no snow, with less than falling during the entire season. When snow does fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or three days per year with at least of snow on the ground. Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls including the record breaking of snow that fell in December 1996. That amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada.\nWith 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually during the last available measurement period, Victoria is effectively tied with Cranbrook as the sunniest city in British Columbia. In July 2013, Victoria received 432.8 hours of bright sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British Columbia history.\nVictoria's equable climate has also added to its reputation as the \"City of Gardens\". The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every March, the annual Greater Victoria Flower Count kicks off while the rest of the country and most of the province is still in the dead of winter.\nDue to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, Gulf Islands, and parts of the Lower Mainland and Sunshine Coast) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including \"Quercus garryana\" (Garry oak), \"Arctostaphylos columbiana\" (hairy manzanita), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, \"Arbutus menziesii\" (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.\nNon-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm Trachycarpus fortunei, which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Victoria had a population of 91,867 living in 49,222 of its 53,070 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 85,792. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. Victoria is one of the most gender diverse cities in Canada, with approximately 0.75% of residents identifying as transgender or non-binary in the 2021 Statistics Canada Census of Population.\nAt the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Victoria CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.\nVictoria is known for its disproportionately large retiree population. Some 23.4 percent of the population of Victoria and its surrounding area are over 65 years of age, which is higher than the overall Canadian distribution of over 65 year-olds in the population (19%).\nEthnic origins.\nIndigenous peoples made up 5 percent of Victoria's population in 2021.\nReligion and spirituality.\nAccording to the 2021 census, the majority of the population of Victoria described themselves as irreligious (63.4%). Over 25% of Victoria residents are Christian, with the second largest religious group being Muslim (1.9%). A similar proportion of residents are Buddhist (1.4%) or Jewish (1.1%). Hinduism, Sikhism and Indigenous Spirituality make up under 1% of other groups.\nNeighbourhoods.\nThe following is a list of neighbourhoods in the City of Victoria, as defined by the city planning department. For a list of neighbourhoods in other area municipalities, see Greater Victoria, or the individual entries for those municipalities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInformal neighbourhoods include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment.\nVictoria City Council is composed of a mayor (elected by first-past-the-post voting), eight city councillors (elected in city-wide district using plurality block voting), and three Capital Regional District directors (elected in city-wide district using plurality block voting).\nEconomy.\nThe city's chief industries are technology, tourism, education, shipyards, federal and provincial government administration and services. Other nearby employers include the Canadian Forces (the Township of Esquimalt is the home of the Pacific headquarters of the Royal Canadian Navy), and the University of Victoria (in the municipalities of Oak Bay and Saanich) and Camosun College in Saanich (which have over 33,000 faculty, staff and students combined). Other sectors of the Greater Victoria area economy include: investment and banking, online book publishing, various public and private schools, food products manufacturing, light aircraft manufacturing (in North Saanich), technology products, various high tech firms in pharmaceuticals and computers, engineering, architecture and telecommunications.\nEmployment by industry.\nThe city's employment has 164,000 (87%) of workers in the service sector. Top segments include health care and social assistance (28,900; 15.3%), public administration (27,800; 14.7%), wholesale and retail trade (24,100; 12.7%), professional, scientific and technical services (19,800; 10.4%), educational services (15,000; 7.9%) and accommodation and food services (10,100; 5.3%). The goods-producing sector is dominated by construction (16,000; 8.4%) and manufacturing (6,900; 3.6%).\nRetail.\nThere are three major shopping malls in the City of Victoria, including the Bay Centre, Hillside Shopping Centre, and Mayfair Shopping Centre. Mayfair, one of the first major shopping centres in Victoria, first opened as an outdoor strip mall on 16 October 1963 with 27 stores. It was built on the site of a former brickyard in the Maywood district, a then-semi-rural area in the northern part of Victoria. Woodward's was Mayfair's original department store anchor upon the mall's opening.\nMayfair was enclosed and renovated into an indoor mall in 1974. The mall underwent three later expansions in 1984 (with the addition of Consumers Distributing), 1985 (expansion of the mall food court) and a major expansion in 1990 that saw the addition of more retail space. The Bay (later Hudson's Bay) replaced Woodward's as Mayfair's department store anchor in 1993 following Hudson's Bay Company's acquisition of the Woodward's chain. The mall was more recently renovated in 2019. Mayfair now offers over 100 stores and services. It has of retail space and it also provides customers with rooftop parking. In 2025, all Hudson's Bay Company stores across Canada closed, including at Mayfair. In 2021 Mayfair was acquired by Ruby Liu\u2019s Central Walk.\nTechnology industry.\nAdvanced technology is Victoria's largest revenue-producing private industry with $3.15\u00a0billion in annual revenues generated by more than 880 tech companies that have over 15,000 direct employees. The annual economic impact of the sector is estimated at more than $4.03\u00a0billion per year. With three post-secondary institutions in Saanich, eight federal research labs in the region, and Canada's Pacific Navy Base in Esquimalt, Victoria relies heavily upon the neighbouring communities for economic activity and as employment hubs. The region has many of the elements required for a strong technology sector, including Canada's highest household internet usage. Over a hundred technology, software and engineering companies have an office in Victoria.\nTourism.\nVictoria is a major tourism destination with over 3.5\u00a0million overnight visitors per year who add more than a billion dollars to the local economy. As well, over 500,000 daytime visitors arrive via cruise ships which dock at Ogden Point near the city's Inner Harbour. Many whale watching tour companies operate from this harbour due to the whales often present near its coast. The city is also close to Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, the Canadian Navy's primary Pacific Ocean naval base.\nDowntown Victoria also serves as Greater Victoria's regional downtown, where many night clubs, theatres, restaurants and pubs are clustered, and where many regional public events occur. Canada Day fireworks displays, Symphony Splash, and many other music festivals and cultural events draw tens of thousands of Greater Victorians and visitors to the downtown core. The Rifflandia and Electronic Music Festival are other music events that draw crowds to the downtown core. Victoria relies upon neighbouring communities for many recreational opportunities including ice rinks in Oak Bay and Saanich. Victoria has one small public pool (Crystal Pool) and many residents use larger and newer pool facilities in Oak Bay, and Saanich (Commonwealth Pool and Gordon Head Pool).\nThe city and metro region has hosted high-profile sports events including the 1994 Commonwealth Games which hosted track events at the Saanich-Oak Bay based University of Victoria and the Saanich Commonwealth Pool, the 2009 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the 2005 Ford World Men's Curling Championship tournament, and 2006 Skate Canada. Victoria co-hosted the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup at Royal Athletic Park, and is the venue for the Bastion Square Grand Prix Criterium road cycling race. The city is also a destination for conventions, meetings, and conferences, including a 2007 North Atlantic Treaty Organization military chief of staff meeting held at the Hotel Grand Pacific. Every year, the Swiftsure International Yacht Race attracts boaters from around the world to participate in the boat race in the waters off of Vancouver Island, and the Victoria Dragon Boat Festival brings over 90 teams from around North America. The Tall Ships Festival brings sailing ships to the city harbour. Victoria also hosts the start of the Vic-Maui Yacht Race.\nThe Port of Victoria consists of three parts, the Outer Harbour, used by deep sea vessels, the Inner and Upper Harbours, used by coastal and industrial traffic. It is protected by a breakwater with a deep and wide opening. The port is a working harbour, tourist attraction and cruise destination. Esquimalt Harbour is also a well-protected harbour with a large graving dock and shipbuilding and repair facilities.\nHomelessness.\nA point-in-time homeless count was conducted by volunteers between 11 March and 12 March 2020, that counted at least 1,523 homeless that night. The homeless count is considered an underestimate due to the hidden homeless that may be couch surfing or have found somewhere to stay that is not on the street or homeless shelters. The first homeless count was conducted in January 2005 by the Victoria Cool Aid Society and counted a homeless population of approximately 700 individuals.\nLike many west coast cities in North America the homeless population is both concentrated in specific areas (parts of Pandora avenue in Victoria) and is often outside due to milder climates that make homelessness more visible year-round.\nThe 2020 point-in-time homeless count found 35% respondents identified as being Indigenous. This is over representative in the homeless population as only 4.7% of the overall population of Victoria identify as Indigenous.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia, many homeless people sheltered in camping tents within the city's parks and some roadside greenspaces, including in Beacon Hill Park. In March 2021, Victoria City Council reinstated a bylaw prohibiting daytime camping in parks, and with support from the provincial government, pledged to find indoor accommodation for all those camping in parks. Homeless campers from parks and other public spaces were housed temporarily in motels, the Save-on-Foods arena and a tiny home village on a portion of the Royal Athletic Park's parking lot.\nArts and culture.\nThe Victoria Symphony, led by Christian Kluxen, performs at the Royal Theatre and the Farquhar Auditorium of the Saanich-Oak Bay sited University of Victoria from September to May. Every BC Day weekend, the Symphony mounts Symphony Splash, an outdoor event that includes a performance by the orchestra sitting on a barge in Victoria's Inner Harbour. Streets in the local area are closed, as each year approximately 40,000 people attend a variety of concerts and events throughout the day. The event culminates with the Symphony's evening concert, with Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture as the grand finale, complete with cannon fire from Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Gunners from HMCS QUADRA, a pealing carillon and a fireworks display to honour BC Day. Pacific Opera Victoria, Victoria Operatic Society, Victoria Philharmonic Choir, Canadian Pacific Ballet and Ballet Victoria stage two or three productions each year at the Macpherson or Royal Theatres.\nTheatre.\nThe Bastion Theatre, a professional dramatic company, functioned in Victoria through the 1970s and 1980s and performed high quality dramatic productions but ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1988. Reborn as The New Bastion Theatre in 1990 the company operated for five more years before closing operations in 1996.\nThe Belfry Theatre started in 1974 as the Springridge Cultural Centre in 1974. The venue was renamed the Belfry Theatre in 1976 as the company began producing its own shows. The Belfry's mandate is to produce contemporary plays with an emphasis on new Canadian plays. Other regional theatre venues include: the University of Victoria Phoenix Theatre; The Roxy Theatre, home of the Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre company; Kaleidoscope Theatre and Intrepid Theatre Company, producers of the Victoria Fringe Theatre Festival and The Uno Festival of Solo Performance.\nThe only Canadian Forces Primary Reserve brass/reed band on Vancouver Island is in Victoria. The 5th (British Columbia) Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery Band traces its roots back to 1864, making it the oldest, continually operational military band west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Its mandate is to support the island's military community by performing at military dinners, parades and ceremonies, and other events. The band performs weekly in August at Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site where the Regiment started manning the guns of the fort in 1896, and also performs every year at the Cameron Bandshell at Beacon Hill Park.\nThe annual multi-day Rifflandia Music Festival is one of Canada's largest modern rock and pop music festivals.\nFilms set in Victoria.\nDue to the proximity to Vancouver and a 6% distance location tax credit, Victoria is used as a filming location for many films, television series, and television movies. Some of these films include \"X2\", ', \"In the Land of Women\", \"White Chicks\", \"Scary Movie\", \"Final Destination\", \"Excess Baggage\" and \"Bird on a Wire\". Television series such as \"Smallville\", \"The Dead Zone\" and ' were also filmed there.\nVictoria-area artists and writers.\nCanadian director Atom Egoyan was raised in neighbouring Saanich.

In addition, the heart of downtown also has the Maritime Museum of British Columbia, Emily Carr House, Victoria Bug Zoo, and Market Square. The oldest (and most intact) Chinatown in Canada is within downtown and includes the Chinese Public School built in 1909, and some cultural items and pictures displayed at the Pandora avenue entrances to Market Square. The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is close to downtown in the Rockland neighbourhood several city blocks from Craigdarroch Castle built by industrialist Robert Dunsmuir and Government House, the official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.\nNumerous other buildings of historic importance or interest are also in central Victoria, including: the 1845 St. Ann's Schoolhouse; the 1852 Helmcken House built for Victoria's first doctor; the 1863 Congregation Emanu-El, the oldest synagogue in continuous use in Canada; the 1865 Angela College built as Victoria's first Anglican Collegiate School for Girls, now housing retired nuns of the Sisters of St. Ann; the 1871 St. Ann's Academy built as a Catholic school; the 1874 Church of Our Lord, built to house a breakaway congregation from the Anglican Christ Church cathedral; the 1890 St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church; the 1890 Metropolitan Methodist Church (now the Victoria Conservatory of Music),\n which is publicly open for faculty, student, and guest performances, also acts as Camosun College Music Department; the 1892 St. Andrew's Cathedral; and the 1925 Crystal Gardens, originally a saltwater swimming pool, restored as a conservatory and most recently a tourist attraction called the B.C. Experience, which closed down in 2006.\nDowntown Victoria is a very walkable area with many midblock crosswalks, an expanding central pedestrian street, public squares, and alleys that are predominantly spaces for pedestrians. Fan Tan alley is the narrowest commercial street in North America and runs between Pandora avenue and Fisgard street in Victoria's Chinatown. Dragon alley is also located in Chinatown and is a mix of commercial and residential units, located between Fisgard and Herald streets. Theatre alley was rebuilt in a newer condo construction in Chinatown and is a narrow alley that winds between Pandora avenue and Fisgard street just west of Fan Tan alley, but it does not include direct access to any commercial businesses. Waddington alley is uniquely paved with wooden blocks located between Yates and Johnson streets. Trounce alley is a small commercial alley located between Government and Broad streets.\nBeacon Hill Park is the central city's main urban green space. Its area of adjacent to Victoria's southern shore includes numerous playing fields, manicured gardens, exotic species of plants and animals such as wild peacocks, a petting zoo, and views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Olympic Mountains in Washington across it. The sport of cricket has been played in Beacon Hill Park since the mid-19th century. Each summer, the City of Victoria presents dozens of concerts at the Cameron Band Shell in Beacon Hill Park.\nThe extensive system of parks in Victoria also includes a few areas of natural Garry oak meadow habitat, an increasingly scarce ecosystem that once dominated the region.\nPrivate gardens that are open to the public with sometimes limited opening hours are located throughout the city and offer access at low or no cost to visitors, they include the rose garden next to the Empress Hotel, the Government House Gardens on the grounds of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia's house (also known as Government House) on Rockland Road, and Abkahazi Garden on Fairfield Road.\nDallas Road is a waterfront trail and road with a to walk, run, bike or drive. Clover Point is its main rest area with benches, lounge chairs, picnic tables and a public washroom.\nThe David Foster Harbour Pathway is a predominantly a pedestrian pathway that meanders around the inner harbour between the southern start at Ogden point by the cruise ship terminal and Rock Bay at its northern terminus. The pathway has some disconnected sections that are expected to be connected with redevelopments along the pathway near the Johnson street bridge. When completed the David Foster Harbour Pathway is expected to extend over in length.\nOutside the city.\nCFB Esquimalt navy base, in the adjacent municipality of Esquimalt, has a base museum dedicated to naval and military history, in the Naden part of the base.\nNorth of the city on the Saanich Peninsula are the marine biology Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre, Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, one of the biggest tourist and local resident attractions on Vancouver Island, as well as the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, part of the National Research Council of Canada, Victoria Butterfly Gardens and Centre of the Universe planetarium.\nSports and recreation.\nVictoria's climate, location and variety of facilities make it ideal for many recreational activities including rock climbing, hiking, kayaking, golf, water sports, informal team sports and jogging.\nVictoria is also known as the Cycling Capital of Canada, with hundreds of kilometres of bicycle paths, bike lanes and bike routes in the city, including the Galloping Goose Regional Trail.

Cycling advocacy groups including Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition (GVCC) and the Bike to Work Society have worked to improve Victoria's cycling infrastructure and facilities, and to make cycling a viable transportation alternative, attracting 5% of commuters in 2005.\nGreater Victoria also has a rich motorsports history, and was home to a 4/10ths mile oval race track called Western Speedway in the nearby City of Langford. Opened in 1954, Western Speedway was the oldest speedway in western Canada, and featured stock car racing, drag racing, demolition derbies and other events. Western Speedway was also home to the Victoria Auto Racing Hall of Fame and Museum.\nThe Greater Victoria area also serves as a headquarters for Rugby Canada, based out of Starlight Stadium in Langford, as well as a headquarters for Rowing Canada, based out of Victoria City Rowing Club at Elk Lake in Saanich. The Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame is at the Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre, and features numerous displays and information on the sporting history of the city.\nThe major sporting and entertainment complex, for Victoria and Vancouver Island Region, is the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre arena. It replaced the former Victoria Memorial Arena, which was constructed by efforts of World War II veterans as a monument to fallen comrades. World War I, World War II, Korean War, and other conflict veterans are also commemorated. Fallen Canadian soldiers in past, present, and future wars and/or United Nations, NATO missions are noted, or will be noted by the main lobby monument at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. The arena was the home of the ECHL (formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League) team, Victoria Salmon Kings, owned by RG Properties Limited, a real estate development firm that built the Victoria Save On Foods Memorial Centre, and Prospera Place Arena in Kelowna. The arena is the home of the Victoria Royals Western Hockey League (WHL) team that replaced the Victoria Salmon Kings (ECHL).\nInternational events.\nVictoria has also been a destination for numerous high-profile international sporting events.

The Victoria Cougars are perhaps the most famous sports franchise the city has known, existing as members of several professional leagues from 1911 to 1926, and again from 1949 to 1961. The Cougars won the Stanley Cup as members of the WCHL in 1925 after defeating the Montreal Canadiens three games to one in a best-of-five final. The Cougars were reincarnated in 1971 as a major junior hockey team in the Western Hockey League, before they moved to Prince George to become the Prince George Cougars. Today, the Cougars name and legacy continue in the form of the Junior 'B' team that plays in the Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League.

It was built in 1911.\nThe city's water is supplied by the Capital Regional District's Water Services Department from its Sooke Lake Reservoir. The lake is connected to a treatment plant at Japan Gulch by the Kapoor Tunnel. The lake water is very soft and requires no filtering. It is treated with chlorine, ammonia and ultraviolet light to control micro-organisms.\nUntil the tunnel was completed in 1967, water flowed from the lake through the circuitous, leaky and much smaller Sooke Flowline.\nThe Hartland landfill in Saanich is the waste disposal site for Greater Victoria area. Since 1985, it has been run by the Capital Regional District environmental services. It is on top of a hill, between Victoria and Sidney, at the end of Hartland Avenue () There is a recycling centre, a sewer solid waste collection, hazardous waste collection, and an electricity generating station. This generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough for 1,600 homes. The site has won international environmental awards. The CRD conducts public tours of the facility. It is predicted to be full by 2045.\nAs of 15 December 2020 the CRD announced that core municipalities within Greater Victoria no longer discharge screened wastewater into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The wastewater treatment facility was required to comply with federal regulations that forbid untreated discharge into waterways. The wastewater treatment project included pump stations at Clover Point and Macaulay Point in addition to the wastewater treatment plant at McLoughlin Point and the residuals treatment facility at Hartland landfill. The wastewater treatment plant serves Victoria, Esquimalt, Saanich, Oak Bay, View Royal, Langford, Colwood and the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations.\nThe Saanich Peninsula wastewater treatment plant serves North Saanich, Central Saanich and the Town of Sidney as well as the Victoria International Airport, the Institute of Ocean Sciences and the Tseycum and Pauquachin First Nations. This is a secondary level treatment plant which produces Class A biosolids.\nTransportation.\nAir.\nVictoria International Airport in North Saanich has non-stop flights to and from Toronto, Seattle, Montreal (seasonal), select seasonal sun destinations, and many cities throughout Western Canada. Multiple scheduled helicopter and seaplane flights are available daily from Victoria Inner Harbour Airport to Vancouver International Airport, Vancouver Harbour, and Seattle.\nVictoria is also home to the world's largest all-seaplane airline, Harbour Air. Harbour air offers flights during daylight hours at least every 30 minutes between Victoria's inner harbour and Vancouver's downtown terminal or YVR south terminal. Harbour Air also operate scenic tour flights over the Victoria harbour and gulf islands area.\nCycling.\nThe Greater Victoria area has the highest rate of bicycle commuting to work of any census metropolitan area in Canada. Greater Victoria also has an expanding system designed to facilitate cyclists, electrically assisted bicycles and other micromobility users via protected bike lanes on many roads, as well as separated multi-use paths for bicycles and pedestrians including the Galloping Goose Regional Trail, Lochside Regional Trail and the E&amp;N rail trail. These multi-use trails are designed exclusively for foot traffic, cyclists, and micro-mobility users and pass through many communities in the Greater Victoria area, beginning at the downtown core and extending into areas such as Langford and Central and North Saanich.\nVictoria is currently finishing a protected bike lane network intended for all ages and abilities (AAA). The first lane opened in Spring 2017 on Pandora Avenue, between Store Street and Cook Street in the downtown core and provides an easy cycling connection across the Johnson Street Bridge to the Galloping Goose Trail and E&amp;N rail trail. The second protected bike lane in the network opened on Fort Street on 27 May 2018. The next two roads added to the downtown area bike network were Wharf and Humboldt streets, completed in 2019 and 2020 respectively, with Vancouver Street and Graham/Jackson streets added to the AAA bike network in 2021. The next round of streets upgraded starting in 2021 as \"complete streets\" with AAA cycling infrastructure included Richardson Street, Haultain Street, Government Street north of Pandora Avenue to Gorge Road, and finally Kimta Road connecting the network to the E&amp;N rail trail. Connector routes in the Fernwood and Oaklands neighbourhoods to the Vancouver Street lanes were also constructed starting in 2021, avoiding hills and adding safer pedestrian and cyclist crossings. In 2022 the city constructed further AAA bicycle connections along Montreal Street, Superior Street, Government Street (south, between Humboldt Street and Dallas Road), Fort Street (between Cook Street and up to the municipal border with Oak Bay), and Gorge Road (between Government Street and up to the municipal border with Saanich).\nGo By Bike Week, previously called Bike to Work Week, is a bi-annual event held in communities throughout greater Victoria, British Columbia. It is organized by Capital Bike, a group created in 2021 by the merging of the Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition and Greater Victoria Bike to Work Society, and typically lasts one or two weeks. There is a large Spring event scheduled in late May every year, and again later during Fall typically in October. The original \"Bike to Work Week\" began in 1995 in Victoria and expanded to include other communities in BC through their local bicycle advocacy groups, all supported by the Bike to Work BC Society. The Bike to Work BC Society was formed in 2009 as a legal entity to run the event in other communities around BC, and was renamed the GoByBike BC Society to encourage cycling beyond the scope of commuting. The behaviour change (public health) model, relying on research conducted by both the provincial and federal governments that identified barriers to cycling and reasons for choosing cycling, was applied in the original Bike to Work Week event as a way to accomplish the goal of recruiting employees to bicycle to work. Since its inception, ridership in Go By Bike Week has steadily increased, and in 2017 over 7,000 people participated in Greater Victoria. The event aims to attract new riders, promote cycling for commuting, recreation, and general transportation, and advocate for expanding safe cycling networks with prizes, activities and free cycling skills workshops. Pop-up \"Celebration Stations\" are set up throughout Greater Victoria, which typically feature free snacks and local coffee for cyclists, bicycle repair stands, and local cycling-related vendors and advocacy groups. The events were cancelled during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, though individualized events were still promoted where participants could win prizes, and in-person events resumed in 2022.\nOther cycling advocacy initiatives in the Greater Victoria area include the Victoria chapter of Cycling Without Age, the Bike2Farm program and several recreational cycling clubs.\nFerries.\nThe CRD is served by several ferries with the Lower Mainland, Gulf Islands and the United States. BC Ferries provides service between Swartz Bay, located on the northern tip of the Saanich Peninsula, to Tsawwassen on the Lower Mainland for cars, bus, trucks, pedestrians and cyclists. The Coho ferry operates as a car and pedestrian/cyclist ferry between the inner harbour of Victoria and Port Angeles, Washington. The Victoria Clipper is a pedestrian and cyclist-only (no vehicles) ferry which operates daily, year-round between downtown Seattle and the inner harbour of Victoria. The Washington State Ferries ran a ferry until 2020 for cars, pedestrians and cyclists between Friday Harbor, Orcas Island and Anacortes in Washington State from the port at Sidney, north of Victoria on the Saanich Peninsula. However, the service was shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic and did not resume. Washington State Ferries, citing crew and vessel shortages, estimates that it will not resume until at least 2030.\nPublic transit.\nLocal public transportation is run by the Victoria Regional Transit System, which is part of BC Transit. Since 2000, double-decker buses have been introduced to the fleet, and have become an icon for the city. Rider fare payments can be made in exact cash, using the reloadable Umo app or card, and 30-day bus passes can be purchased from one of many vendors.\nIn 2024, BC transit rolled out its electronic payment system, Umo, where riders can board using the Umo app or the Umo card. Users can purchase bus passes and load money onto their accounts on the app, online, or toll-free through Umo\u2019s customer service phone line. To board the bus, scan the Umo apps' QR code or the Umo cards' barcode on the validator.\nAs of 1 April 2016 bus drivers do not provide transfers as proof of payment. Transfers were a source of disagreement and delay on the bus, due to improper transfer use, and disagreements over expired transfers or transfers used for return trips. Instead, a day-pass was added that can be purchased from the bus driver for $5. When using the Umo app or card, the Umo will halt your payments so you never pay more than the value of the day-pass.\nTo improve bus reliability and reduce delays, a bike and bus priority lane was opened in 2014 during peak traffic periods with fines for motorists operating in the bus/bike lane who are not turning in the same block. The dedicated bike and bus lane on Douglas street is being expanded from Downtown to near Uptown and may be changed to be restricted to only buses and bikes 24/7 rather than just during peak traffic periods depending on direction of travel. Most buses operating in the Greater Victoria area have a bike rack installed at the front of the bus that can accommodate two bicycles.\nRail.\nPassenger rail service previously operated by Via Rail provided a single daily return trip along between Victoria \u2013 Courtenay, along the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, to the cities of Nanaimo, Courtenay, and points between. The service was discontinued along this line indefinitely on 19 March 2011, due to needed track replacement work. Prior to further inspection of the track, service along the segment between Nanaimo and Victoria was originally planned to resume on 8 April, but lack of funding has prevented any of the work from taking place and it is unclear when or if the service will resume.\nRoads.\nLocal roadways are not based on a grid system as they are in Vancouver or Edmonton, and many streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is no directional indication in street names that may be used in other cities with numbered roads where a street may run north\u2013south or avenue may run east\u2013west.\nThe compact size of the city with few steep hills lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as scooters, Smart Cars, motorcycles and electric bicycles. Victoria incentivizes the use of smaller modes of transport by offering smaller metered parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designated for small vehicles and motorcycles. Rush hour traffic delays along the Trans-Canada Highway to western suburban municipalities (including Langford, Colwood, Sooke and Metchosin) is commonly referred to as the \"Colwood Crawl\".\nVictoria serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's Trans-Canada Highway, the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero marker is at the southernmost point of Douglas Street where it meets Dallas Road along the waterfront. The Mile Zero location includes a statue to honour Terry Fox.\nOther transportation.\nCoach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the Vancouver International Airport, which includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by Wilson's Transportation Limited. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the Vancouver International Airport. Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.\nBus service from Victoria to points up island is run by Island Link Bus or Tofino Bus. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal at 700 Douglas Street, behind the Fairmont Empress Hotel and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.\nEducation.\nThe city of Victoria lies entirely within the Greater Victoria School District. Victoria High School is the only public high school located within the municipal boundaries of the city of Victoria. Opened 7 August 1876, Victoria High School is the oldest High School in North America north of San Francisco and west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Many of the elementary schools in Victoria offer both French immersion and English programs of instruction. \u00c9cole Victor-Brodeur in Esquimalt serves as a dedicated school for Francophones.\nIn addition, there are several independent schools serving the Greater Victoria community, including the Chinese School in Chinatown, the Christ Church Cathedral School Christ Church Cathedral School | primary and middle school, Glenlyon Norfolk School, Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific, St. Margaret's School St. Margaret's School, St. Michaels University School, St. Patrick's Elementary School.\nGreater Victoria is served by three public post secondary educational institutions, listed by student population size below:\nA number of private career colleges are located in Victoria including the Justice Institute of British Columbia, Pacific Rim College, Sprott Shaw College and the Victoria College of Art.\nMedia.\nVictoria is served by a number of media outlets including the Times Colonist, an English-language daily; a variety of local print outlets; 12 radio stations, and 3 television stations: CHEK-DT (an independent station), CIVI-DT (a CTV 2 owned-and-operated station) and Shaw Spotlight.\nVictoria is the only Canadian provincial capital without a local CBC Television station, owned-and-operated or affiliate, although it does host a small CBC Radio One (CBCV-FM) station at 780 Kings Road. The region is considered to be a part of the Vancouver television market, receiving most stations that broadcast from across the Strait of Georgia, including CBC Television, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, CTV, Global, Citytv and Omni owned-and-operated stations.\nSister cities.\nVictoria has three sister cities:\nAs of 4 March 2022, Victoria City Council voted to suspend the city's relationship with Khabarovsk, Russia as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nVictoria also has Friendship City agreements with:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "32393", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32393", "title": "Puzzle video game", "text": "Video game genre\nPuzzle video games make up a broad genre of video games that emphasize puzzle solving. The types of puzzles can test problem-solving skills, including logic, pattern recognition, sequence solving, spatial recognition, and word completion. Many puzzle games involve a real-time element and require quick thinking, such as \"Tetris\" (1985) and \"Lemmings\" (1991).\nHistory.\nPuzzle video games owe their origins to brain teasers and puzzles throughout human history. The mathematical strategy game Nim, and other traditional thinking games such as Hangman and Bulls and Cows (commercialized as \"Mastermind\"), were popular targets for computer implementation.\nIn Universal Entertainment's \"Space Panic\", released in arcades in 1980, the player digs holes in platforms to trap creatures. It is a precursor to puzzle-platform games such as \"Lode Runner\" (1983), \"Door Door\" (1983), and \"Doki Doki Penguin Land\" (1985).\n\"Blockbuster\", by Alan Griesemer and Stephen Bradshaw (Atari 8-bit, 1981), is a computerized version of the Rubik's Cube puzzle. \"Snark Hunt\" (Atari 8-bit, 1982) is a single-player game of logical deduction, a clone of the 1970s \"Black Box\" board game.\nElements of Konami's tile-sliding \"Loco-Motion\" (1982) were later seen in \"Pipe Mania\" from LucasArts (1989).\nIn \"Boulder Dash\" (1984), the goal is to collect diamonds while avoiding or exploiting rocks that fall after digging out the dirt beneath them.\n\"Chain Shot!\" (1985) introduced removing groups of the same color tiles on a grid, causing the remaining tiles to fall into the gap. \"Uncle Henry's Nuclear Waste Dump\" (1986) involves dropping colored shapes into a pit, but the goal is to keep the same color tiles from touching.\n\"Tetris\" (1985) revolutionized and popularized the puzzle game genre. The game was created by Soviet game designer Alexey Pajitnov for the Electronika 60. Pajitnov was inspired by a traditional puzzle game named Pentominos in which players arrange blocks into lines without any gaps. The game was released by Spectrum Holobyte for MS-DOS in 1987, Atari Games in arcades in 1988, and sold 30 million copies for Game Boy.\nIn \"Lemmings\" (1991), a series of creatures walk into deadly situations, and a player assigns jobs to specific lemmings to guide the swarm to a safe destination.\nThe 1994 MS-DOS game \"Shariki\", by Eugene Alemzhin, introduced the mechanic of swapping adjacent elements to tile matching games. It was little known at the time, but later had a major influence on the genre.\nInterest in Mahjong video games from Japan began to grow in 1994.\nModern puzzle games.\nIn 2000, PopCap Games released \"Bejeweled\", a direct clone of the 1994 tile-matching game \"Shariki\" with improved visuals. It sparked interest in the match-three mechanic which became the foundation for other popular games, including \"\" (2007), \"Candy Crush Saga\" (2012), and \"Puzzle &amp; Dragons\" (2012).\nAfter the release of \"Portal\" in 2007, there has been a rise in popularity of physics-based logic puzzle games.\nSub-genres.\nPhysics game.\nA physics game is a type of logical puzzle video game wherein the player must use the game's physics and environment to complete each puzzle. Physics games use consistent physics to make games more challenging. The genre is popular in online flash games and mobile games. Educators have used these games to demonstrate principles of physics.\nPhysics-based logic puzzle games include \"The Incredible Machine\", \"Portal\", \"The Talos Principle\", \"Braid\", \"Fez\", \"World of Goo\", and \"Cut the Rope\", as well as projectile collision games such as \"Angry Birds\", \"Peggle\", \"Monster Strike\", and \"Crush the Castle\".\nProgramming game.\nProgramming games require writing code, either as text or using a visual system, to solve puzzles. Examples include \"Rocky's Boots\" (1982), \"Robot Odyssey\" (1984), \"SpaceChem\" (2011), and \"Infinifactory\" (2015).\nExploration.\nThis sub-genre includes point-and-click games that often overlap with adventure games and walking simulators. Unlike logical puzzle games, these games generally require inductive reasoning to solve. The defining trait is that the player must experiment with mechanisms in each level before they can solve them. Exploration games include \"Myst\", \"Limbo\", and \"The Dig\". Escape room games such as \"The Room\" involve detailed exploration of a single location.\nSokoban.\nSokoban games, such as its 1982 namesake title, or block-pushing games, involve pushing or pulling blocks on a grid-like space to move them into designated positions without blocking the movement of other blocks. Similar games include \"Baba is You\" and \"Patrick's Parabox\".\nHidden object game.\nA hidden object game, sometimes called hidden picture or hidden object puzzle adventure (HOPA), is a genre of puzzle video game in which the player must find items from a list that are hidden within a scene. Hidden object games are a popular trend in casual gaming.\nTile-matching.\nIn tile-matching video games, the player manipulates tiles in order to make them disappear according to a matching criterion. The genre began with 1985's \"Chain Shot!\" and has similarities to falling-block games such as \"Tetris.\" This genre includes games that require pieces to be swapped such as \"Bejeweled\" or \"Candy Crush Saga\", games that adapt the classic tile-based game Mahjong such as \"Mahjong Trails\", and games in which pieces are shot on the board such as \"Zuma\". Puzzle games based on \"Tetris\" include tile-matching games where the matching criterion is to place a given number of tiles of the same type so that they adjoin each other. That number is often three, and the corresponding subset of tile-matching games is referred to as match-three games.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32394", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32394", "title": "Platformer", "text": "Video game genre\nA platformer (also called a platform game) is a subgenre of action game in which the core objective is to move the player character between points in an environment. Platform games are characterized by levels with uneven terrain and suspended platforms that require jumping and climbing to traverse. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay, such as swinging from vines or grappling hooks, jumping off walls, gliding through the air, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines. \nThe genre started with the 1980 arcade video game \"Space Panic\", which has ladders but not jumping. \"Donkey Kong\", released in 1981, established a template for what were initially called \"climbing games\". \"Donkey Kong\" inspired many clones and games with similar elements, such as \"Miner 2049er\" (1982) and \"Kangaroo\" (1982), while the Sega arcade game \"Congo Bongo\" (1983) adds a third dimension via isometric graphics. Another popular game of that period, \"Pitfall!\" (1982), allows moving left and right through series of non-scrolling screens, expanding the play area. Nintendo's flagship \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1985) and the subsequent \"Super Mario\" series were the defining games for the genre, with horizontally scrolling levels and the player controlling a named character, Mario, which became Nintendo's mascot. The terms \"platform game\" and \"platformer\" gained traction in the late 1980s.\nDuring their peak of popularity, platformers were estimated to comprise between a quarter and a third of all console games. By 2006, sales had declined, representing a 2% market share as compared to 15% in 1998. In spite of this, platformers are still being commercially released every year, including some which have sold millions of copies.\nConcepts.\nA platformer requires the player to maneuver their character across platforms to reach a goal while confronting enemies and avoiding obstacles along the way. These games are either presented from the side view, using two-dimensional movement, or in 3D with the camera placed either behind the main character or in isometric perspective. Typical platforming gameplay tends to be very dynamic and challenges a player's reflexes, timing, and dexterity with controls.\nThe most common movement options in the genre are walking, running, jumping, attacking, and climbing. Jumping is central to the genre, though there are exceptions such as Nintendo's \"Popeye\" and Data East's \"BurgerTime\", both from 1982. In some games, such as \"Donkey Kong\", the trajectory of a jump is fixed, while in others it can be altered mid-air. Falling may cause damage or death. Many platformers contain environmental obstacles which kill the player's character upon contact, such as lava pits or bottomless chasms. The player may be able to collect items and power-ups and give the main character new abilities for overcoming adversities.\nMost games of this genre consist of multiple levels of increasing difficulty that may be interleaved by boss encounters, where the character has to defeat a particularly dangerous enemy to progress. Simple logical puzzles to resolve and skill trials to overcome are other common elements in the genre.\nA modern variant of the platform game, especially significant on mobile platforms, is the endless runner, where the main character is always moving forward and the player must dodge or jump to avoid falling or hitting obstacles.\nNaming.\nVarious names were used in the years following the release of the first established game in the genre, \"Donkey Kong\" (1981). Shigeru Miyamoto originally called it a \"running/jumping/climbing game\" while developing it. Miyamoto commonly used the term \"athletic game\" to refer to \"Donkey Kong\" and later games in the genre, such as \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1985).\n\"Donkey Kong\" spawned other games with a mix of running, jumping, and vertical traversal, a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it, leaving journalists and writers to offer their own terms. \"Computer and Video Games\" magazine, among others, referred to the genre as \"Donkey Kong-type\" or \"Kong-style\" games. \"Climbing games\" was used in Steve Bloom's 1982 book \"Video Invaders\" and 1983 magazines \"Electronic Games\" (US)\u2014which ran a cover feature called \"The Player's Guide to Climbing Games\"\u2014and \"TV Gamer\" (UK). Bloom defined climbing games as those where the player \"must climb from the bottom of the screen to the top while avoiding and/or destroying the obstacles and foes you invariably meet along the way\". Under this definition, he listed \"Space Panic\" (1980), \"Donkey Kong\", and, despite the top down perspective, \"Frogger\" (1981) as climbing games.\nIn a December 1982 \"Creative Computing\" review of the Apple II game \"Beer Run\", the reviewer used a different term: \"I'm going to call this a ladder game, as in the 'ladder genre,' which includes \"Apple Panic\" and \"Donkey Kong\".\" That label was also used by \"Video Games Player\" magazine in 1983 when it named the Coleco port of \"Donkey Kong\" \"Ladder Game of the Year\".\nAnother term used in the late 1980s to 1990s was \"character action games\", in reference to games based around named protagonists, such as \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", and \"Bubsy\". It was also applied more generally to side-scrolling video games, including run and gun video games such as \"Gunstar Heroes\".\n\"Platform game\" became a common term for the genre by 1989, popularized by its usage in the United Kingdom press. Examples include referring to the \"\"Super Mario\" mould\" (such as \"Kato-chan &amp; Ken-chan\") as platform games, and calling \"Strider\" a \"platform and ladders\" game.\nHistory.\nSingle screen.\nThe genre originated in the early 1980s. Levels in early platform games were confined to a single screen, viewed in profile, with climbing between platforms. \"Space Panic\", a 1980 arcade release by Universal, is sometimes credited as the first platformer. \"Space Panic\" has ladders and climbing, but not jumping. Another precursor to the genre from 1980 was Nichibutsu's \"Crazy Climber\", in which the player character scales vertically scrolling skyscrapers. The unreleased 1979 Intellivision game \"Hard Hat\" has a similar concept.\n\"Donkey Kong\", an arcade video game created by Nintendo and released in July 1981, was the first game to allow players to jump over obstacles and gaps. It is widely considered to be the first platformer. It introduced Mario. \"Donkey Kong\" was ported to many consoles and computers at the time, notably as the system-selling pack-in game for ColecoVision, and also a handheld version from Coleco in 1982. The game helped cement Nintendo's position as an important name in the video game industry internationally.\nGames with ladders and platforms rapidly followed from other developers, such as \"Kangaroo\", \"BurgerTime\", \"Canyon Climber\", and \"Ponpoko\", all from 1982. Also from the same year, \"Miner 2049er\" shipped with ten screens vs. \"Donkey Kong\"'s four. \"Jumpman\" (1983) upped the count to 30. \"Mr. Robot and His Robot Factory\" (1984) includes a level editor. \n\"Donkey Kong\" received a sequel, \"Donkey Kong Jr.\" (1982) and then \"Mario Bros.\" (1983), a platformer with two-player cooperative play. It laid the groundwork for other two-player cooperative games such as \"Fairyland Story\" and \"Bubble Bobble\".\nBeginning in 1982, transitional games emerged with non-scrolling levels spanning multiple screens. David Crane's \"Pitfall!\" for the Atari 2600, with 256 horizontally connected screens, became one of the best-selling games on the system and was a breakthrough for the genre. ' was released on the ColecoVision that same year, adding uneven terrain and scrolling pans between static screens. \"Manic Miner\" (1983) and its sequel \"Jet Set Willy\" (1984) continued this style of multi-screen levels on home computers. ' won the first award for Best Platform game in 1984 from \"Crash\" magazine. Later that year, Epyx released \"Impossible Mission\", and Parker Brothers released \"Montezuma's Revenge\", which further expanded on the exploration aspect.\nScrolling.\nThe first platformer to use scrolling graphics came years before the genre became popular. \"Jump Bug\" is a platform-shooter developed by Alpha Denshi under contract for Hoei/Coreland and released to arcades in 1981, only five months after \"Donkey Kong\". Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings, clouds, and hills. \"Jump Bug\" offered a glimpse of what was to come, with uneven, suspended platforms, levels that scroll horizontally (and in one section, vertically), and differently themed sections, such as a city, the interior of a large pyramid, and underwater.\nIrem's 1982 arcade game \"Moon Patrol\" combines jumping over obstacles and shooting attackers. A month later, Taito released \"Jungle King\", a side-scrolling action game with some platform elements: jumping between vines, jumping or running beneath bouncing boulders. It was quickly re-released as \"Jungle Hunt\" because of similarities to Tarzan.\nThe 1982 Apple II game \"Track Attack\" includes a scrolling platform level where the character runs and leaps along the top of a moving train.\nThe character is little more than a stick figure, but the acrobatics evoke the movement that games such as \"Prince of Persia\" would feature. \"B.C.'s Quest For Tires\" (1983) put a recognizable character from American comic strips into side-scrolling, jumping gameplay similar to \"Moon Patrol\". The same year, \"Snokie\" for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit computers added uneven terrain to a scrolling platformer.\nBased on the Saturday morning cartoon rather than the maze game, Namco's 1984 \"Pac-Land\" is a bidirectional, horizontally-scrolling, arcade video game with walking, running, jumping, springboards, power-ups, and a series of unique levels. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani described the game as \"the pioneer of action games with horizontally running background.\" According to Iwatani, Shigeru Miyamoto described \"Pac-Land\" as an influence on the development of \"Super Mario Bros.\".\nNintendo's \"Super Mario Bros.\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, became the archetype for the genre. It was bundled with Nintendo systems in North America, Japan, and Europe, and sold over 40 million copies, according to the 1999 Guinness Book of World Records. Its success as a pack-in led many companies to see platformers as vital to their success, and contributed greatly to popularizing the genre during the third and fourth generations of video game consoles.\nSega attempted to emulate this success with their \"Alex Kidd\" series, which started in 1986 on the Master System with \"Alex Kidd in Miracle World\". It has horizontal and vertical scrolling levels, the ability to punch enemies and obstacles, and shops for the player to buy power-ups and vehicles. Another Sega series that began that same year is \"Wonder Boy\". The original \"Wonder Boy\" in 1986 was inspired more by \"Pac-Land\" than \"Super Mario Bros.\", with skateboarding segments that gave the game a greater sense of speed than other platformers at the time, while its sequel, \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\" added action-adventure and role-playing elements. \"Wonder Boy\" in turn inspired games such as \"Adventure Island\", \"Dynastic Hero\", \"Popful Mail\", and \"Shantae\".\nOne of the first platformers to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called \"Major Havoc\", which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer. One of the first raster-based platformers to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is 1985's\" Legend of Kage\".\nIn 1985, Enix released the action-adventure platformer \"Brain Breaker\".\nThe following year saw the release of Nintendo's \"Metroid\", which was critically acclaimed for a balance between open-ended and guided exploration. Another platform-adventure released that year, Pony Canyon's \"Super Pitfall\", was critically panned for its vagueness and weak game design. That same year Jaleco released \"Esper Boukentai\", a sequel to \"Psychic 5\" that scrolled in all directions and allowed the player character to make huge multistory jumps to navigate the vertically oriented levels. Telenet Japan also released its own take on the platform-action game, \"Valis\", which contained anime-style cut scenes.\nIn 1987, Capcom's \"Mega Man\" introduced non-linear level progression where the player is able to choose the order in which they complete levels. This was a stark contrast to both linear games like \"Super Mario Bros.\" and open-world games like \"Metroid\". GamesRadar credits the \"level select\" feature of \"Mega Man\" as the basis for the non-linear mission structure found in most open-world, multi-mission, sidequest-heavy games. Another Capcom platformer that year was \"Bionic Commando\", which popularized a grappling hook mechanic that has since appeared in dozens of games, including \"Earthworm Jim\" and \"Tomb Raider\".\nScrolling platformers went portable in the late 1980s with games such as \"Super Mario Land\", and the genre continued to maintain its popularity, with many games released for the handheld Game Boy and Game Gear systems.\nSecond-generation side-scrollers.\nBy the time the Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 launched, platformers were the most popular genre in console gaming. There was a particular emphasis on having a flagship platform title exclusive to a system, featuring a mascot character. In 1989, Sega released \"Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle\", which was only modestly successful. That same year, Capcom released \"Strider\" in arcades, which scrolled in multiple directions and allowed the player to summon artificial intelligence partners, such as a droid, tiger, and hawk, to help fight enemies. Another Sega release in 1989 was \"Shadow Dancer\", which is a game that also included an AI partner: a dog who followed the player around and aid in battle. In 1990, Hudson Soft released \"Bonk's Adventure\", with a protagonist positioned as NEC's mascot. The following year, Takeru's \"Cocoron\", a late platformer for the Famicom allowed players to build a character from a toy box filled with spare parts.\nIn 1990, the Super Famicom was released in Japan, along with the eagerly anticipated \"Super Mario World\". The following year, Nintendo released the console as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America, along with \"Super Mario World\", while Sega released \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" for the Sega Genesis. \"Sonic\" showcased a new style of design made possible by a new generation of hardware: large stages that scrolled in all directions, curved hills, loops, and a physics system allowing players to rush through its levels with well-placed jumps and rolls. Sega characterized Sonic as a teenager with a rebellious personality to appeal to gamers who saw the previous generation of consoles as being for kids. The character's speed showed off the hardware capabilities of the Genesis, which had a CPU clock speed approximately double that of the Super NES.\nSonic's perceived rebellious attitude became a model for game mascots. Other companies attempted to duplicate Sega's success with their own brightly colored anthropomorphisms with attitude. These often were characterized by impatience, sarcasm, and frequent quips.\nA second generation of platformers for computers appeared alongside the new wave of consoles. In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, the Amiga was a strong gaming platform with its custom video hardware and sound hardware. The Atari ST was solidly supported as well. Games like \"Shadow of the Beast\" and \"Turrican\" showed that computer platformers could rival their console contemporaries. \"Prince of Persia\", originally a late release for the 8-bit Apple II in 1989, featured a high quality of animation.\nThe 1988 shareware game \"The Adventures of Captain Comic\" was one of the first attempts at a Nintendo-style platformer for IBM PC compatibles. It inspired \"Commander Keen\", released by id Software in 1990, which became the first MS-DOS platformer with smooth scrolling graphics. Keen's success resulted in numerous console-styled platformers for MS-DOS compatible operating systems, including \"Duke Nukem\", \"Duke Nukem II\", \"Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure\", and \"Dark Ages\" all by Apogee Software. These fueled a brief burst of episodic platformers where the first was freely distributed and parts 2 and 3 were available for purchase.\nDecline of 2D.\nThe abundance of platformers for 16-bit consoles continued late into the generation, with successful games such as \"Vectorman\" (1995), ' (1995), and \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\" (1995), but the release of new hardware caused players' attention to move away from 2D genres. The Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 nevertheless featured a number of successful 2D platformers. The 2D \"Rayman\" was a big success on 32-bit consoles. \"Mega Man 8\" and \"Mega Man X4\" helped revitalize interest in Capcom's Mega Man character. ' revitalized its series and established a new foundation for later \"Castlevania\" games. \"Oddworld\" and \"Heart of Darkness\" kept the subgenre born from \"Prince of Persia\" alive.\nThe difficulties of adapting platformer gameplay to three dimensions led some developers to compromise by pairing the visual flash of 3D with traditional 2D side scrolling gameplay. These games are often referred to as 2.5D. The first such game was Saturn launch title, \"Clockwork Knight\" (1994). The game featured levels and boss characters rendered in 3D, but retained 2D gameplay and used pre-rendered 2D sprites for regular characters, similar to \"Donkey Kong Country\". Its sequel improved upon its design, featuring some 3D effects such as hopping between the foreground and background, and the camera panning and curving around corners. Meanwhile, \"Pandemonium\" and \"Klonoa\" brought the 2.5D style to the PlayStation. In a break from the past, the Nintendo 64 had the fewest side scrolling platformers with only four, those being \"Yoshi's Story\", \"\", \"Goemon's Great Adventure\", and \"Mischief Makers\"\u2014and most met with a tepid response from critics at the time. Despite this, \"Yoshi's Story\" sold over a million copies in the US, and \"Mischief Makers\" rode high on the charts in the months following its release.\nThird dimension.\nThe term \"3D platformer\" usually refers to games with gameplay in three dimensions and polygonal 3D graphics. Games that have 3D gameplay but 2D graphics are usually included under the umbrella of \"isometric platformers\", while those that have 3D graphics but gameplay on a 2D plane are called \"2.5D\", as they are a blend of 2D and 3D.\nThe first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami's \"Antarctic Adventure\", where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade video game version, NES, and ColecoVision.\n1986 saw the release of the sequel to forward-scrolling platformer \"Antarctic Adventure\" called \"Penguin Adventure\", which was designed by Hideo Kojima. It included more action game elements, a greater variety of levels, RPG elements such as upgrading equipment, and multiple endings.\nIn early 1987, Square released \"3-D WorldRunner\", designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nasir Gebelli. Using a forward-scrolling effect similar to Sega's 1985 third-person rail shooter \"Space Harrier\". \"3-D WorldRunner\" was an early forward-scrolling pseudo-3D third-person platform-action game where players were free to move in any forward-scrolling direction and could leap over obstacles and chasms. It was notable for being one of the first stereoscopic 3-D games. Square released its sequel, \"JJ\", later that year.\nThe earliest example of a true 3D platformer is a French computer game called \"Alpha Waves\", created by Christophe de Dinechin and published by Infogrames in 1990 for the Atari ST, Amiga, and IBM PC compatibles.\n\"Bug!\", released in 1995 for the Saturn, has a more conservative approach. It allows players to move in all directions, but it does not allow movement along more than one axis at once; the player can move orthogonally but not diagonally. Its characters were pre-rendered sprites, much like the earlier \"Clockwork Knight\". The game plays very similarly to 2D platformers, but lets players walk up walls and on ceilings.\nIn 1995, Delphine Software released a 3D sequel to their 2D platformer \"\". Entitled \"Fade to Black\", it was the first attempt to bring a popular 2D platformer series into 3D. While it retained the puzzle-oriented level design style and step-based control, it did not meet the criteria of a platformer, and was billed as an action adventure. It used true 3D characters and set pieces, but its environments were rendered using a rigid engine similar to the one used by \"Wolfenstein 3D\", in that it could only render square, flat corridors, rather than suspended platforms that could be jumped between.\nSega had tasked their American studio, Sega Technical Institute, with bringing Sonic the Hedgehog into 3D. Their project, titled \"Sonic Xtreme\", was to have featured a radically different approach for the series, with an exaggerated fisheye camera and multidirectional gameplay reminiscent of \"Bug!\". Due in part to conflicts with Sega Enterprises in Japan and a rushed schedule, the game never made it to market.\nTrue 3D.\nIn the 1990s, platforming games started to shift from pseudo-3D to \"true 3D,\" which gave the player more control over the character and the camera. To render a 3D environment from any angle the user chose, the graphics hardware had to be sufficiently powerful, and the art and rendering model of the game had to be viewable from every angle. The improvement in graphics technology allowed publishers to make such games but introduced several new issues. For example, if the player could control the virtual camera, it had to be constrained to stop it from clipping through the environment.\nIn 1994, a small developer called Exact released a game for the X68000 computer called \"Geograph Seal\", which was a 3D first-person shooter game with platforming. Players piloted a frog-like mech that could jump and then double-jump or triple-jump high into the air as the camera panned down to help players line up their landings. In addition to shooting, jumping on enemies was a primary way to attack. This was the first true 3D platform-action game with free-roaming environments, but it was never ported to another platform or released outside Japan, so it remains relatively unknown in the West.\nThe following year, Exact released their follow-up to \"Geograph Seal\". An early title for Sony's new PlayStation console, \"Jumping Flash!\", released in April 1995, kept the gameplay from its precursor but traded the frog-like mech for a cartoony rabbit mech called Robbit. The title was successful enough to get two sequels and is remembered for being the first 3D platformer on a console. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer said \"Jumping Flash\" was perhaps \"one of the most important ancestors of every 3D platformer in the following decade.\" It holds the record of \"First platform videogame in true 3D\" according to \"Guinness World Records\". Another early 3D platformer was \"Floating Runner\", developed by a Japanese company called Xing and released for PlayStation in early 1996, before the release of \"Super Mario 64\". \"Floating Runner\" uses D-pad controls and a behind-the-character camera perspective.\nIn 1996, Nintendo released \"Super Mario 64\", which is a game that set the standard for 3D platformers. It let the player explore 3D environments with greater freedom than was found in any previous game in the genre. With this in mind, Nintendo put an analog control stick on its Nintendo 64 controller, a feature that had not been seen since the Vectrex but which has since become standard. The analog stick provided the fine precision needed with a free perspective.\nIn most 2D platformers, the player finished a level by following a path to a certain point, but in \"Super Mario 64\", the levels were open and had objectives. Completing objectives earned the player stars, and stars were used to unlock more levels. This approach allowed for more efficient use of large 3D areas and rewarded the player for exploration, but it meant less jumping and more action-adventure. Even so, a handful of boss levels offered more traditional platforming. Until then there was no settled way to make 3D platformers, but \"Super Mario 64\" inspired a shift in design. Later 3D platformers like \"Banjo-Kazooie\", \"Spyro the Dragon\", and \"Donkey Kong 64\" borrowed its format, and the \"collect-a-thon\" genre began to form.\nIn order to make this free-roaming model work, developers had to program dynamic, intelligent cameras. A free camera made it harder for players to judge the height and distance of platforms, making jumping puzzles more difficult. Some of the more linear 3D platformers like \"\" and \"Wario World\" used scripted cameras that limited player control. Games with more open environments like \"Super Mario 64\" and \"Banjo-Kazooie\" used intelligent cameras that followed the player's movements. Still, when the view was obstructed or not facing what the player needed to see, these intelligent cameras needed to be adjusted by the player.\nIn the 1990s, RPGs, first-person shooters, and more complex action-adventure games captured significant market share. Even so, the platformer thrived. \"Tomb Raider\" became one of the bestselling series on the PlayStation, along with Insomniac Games' \"Spyro\" and Naughty Dog's \"Crash Bandicoot\", one of the few 3D games to stick with linear levels. Moreover, many of the Nintendo 64's bestsellers were first- and second-party platformers like \"Super Mario 64\", \"Banjo-Kazooie\", and \"Donkey Kong 64\". On Windows and Mac, Pangea Software's \"Bugdom\" series and BioWare's \"MDK2\" proved successful.\nSeveral developers who found success with 3D platformers began experimenting with titles that, despite their cartoon art style, were aimed at adults. Examples include Rare's \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\", Crystal Dynamics's ' and ', and Shiny Entertainment's \"Messiah\".\nIn 1998, Sega produced a 3D Sonic game, \"Sonic Adventure\", for its Dreamcast console. It used a hub structure like \"Super Mario 64\", but its levels were more linear, fast-paced, and action-oriented.\nInto the 21st century.\nNintendo released \"Super Mario Sunshine\" for the GameCube in 2002, the second 3D \"Mario\" platformer.\nOther notable 3D platformers trickled out during this generation. ' was a spiritual heir to the \"Ghosts'n Goblins\" series, \"Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg\" offered Yuji Naka's take on a \"Mario 64\"-influenced platformer, Argonaut Software returned with a new platformer named \"Malice\", games such as ' and ' were attempts to modernise classic video games of the 1980s using the 3D platformer genre, \"Psychonauts\" became a critical darling based on its imaginative levels and colorful characters, and several franchises that debuted during the sixth generation of consoles such as \"Tak\" and \"Ty the Tasmanian Tiger\" each developed a cult following. In Europe specifically, the \"Kao the Kangaroo\" and \"Hugo\" series achieved popularity and sold well. \"Rayman\"'s popularity continued, though the franchise's third game was not as well received as the first two. ' brought the popular \"Oddworld\" franchise into the third dimension, but future sequels to this game did not opt for the 3D platform genre.\nNaughty Dog moved on from \"Crash Bandicoot\" to \"Jak and Daxter\", a series that became less about traditional platforming with each sequel. A hybrid platformer/shooter game from Insomniac Games called \"Ratchet &amp; Clank\" further pushed the genre away from such gameplay, as did Universal Interactive Studios' rebooted \"Spyro\" trilogy and Microsoft's attempt to create a mascot for the Xbox in \"\". Ironically, Microsoft later found more success with their 2003 take on the genre, \"Voodoo Vince\".\nIn 2008, Crackpot Entertainment released \"Insecticide\". Crackpot, composed of former developers from LucasArts, for the first time combined influences from the point and click genre LucasArts had been known for on titles such as \"Grim Fandango\" with a platformer.\nThe platformer remained a vital genre, but it never regained its past popularity. Part of the reason for the platformer's decline in the 2000s was a lack of innovation compared to other genres. Platformers were either aimed at younger players or designed to avoid the platform label. In 1998, platformers had a 15% share of the market, and an even higher share in their prime. Four years later that figure had dropped to 2%. Even the acclaimed \"Psychonauts\" saw modest sales at first, leading publisher Majesco Entertainment to withdraw from high-budget console games, though its sales in Europe were respectable.\nRecent developments.\nIn the seventh generation of consoles, despite the genre having a smaller presence in the gaming market, some platformers found success. In late 2007, \"Super Mario Galaxy\" and \"\" were received well by both critics and fans. \"Super Mario Galaxy\" was awarded the Best Game of 2007 by high-profile gaming websites like GameSpot, IGN, and GameTrailers. At that point, according to GameRankings, it was the most critically acclaimed game of all time. In 2008, \"LittleBigPlanet\" paired traditional 2D-platformer gameplay with physics simulation and user created content, earning it strong sales and good reviews. Electronic Arts released \"Mirror's Edge\", which coupled platformer gameplay with a first-person perspective, although they did not market the game as a platformer because of the association of the label with games made for kids. \"Sonic Unleashed\" featured stages with both 2D and 3D platformer gameplay, a formula used later in \"Sonic Colors\" and \"Sonic Generations\". Moreover, two \"Crash Bandicoot\" platformers were released in 2007 and 2008, and in 2013, RobTop Games, an indie developer, made \"Geometry Dash\".\nThe popularity of 2D platformers rose in the 2010s. Nintendo revived the genre. \"New Super Mario Bros.\" was released in 2006 and sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and the fourth best-selling non-bundled video game of all time. \"Super Mario Galaxy\" eventually sold over eight million units, while \"Super Paper Mario\", \"Super Mario 64 DS\", \"Sonic Rush\", \"Yoshi's Island DS\", \"Kirby Super Star Ultra\", and \"\" also sold well.\nAfter the success of \"New Super Mario Bros.\", there was a spate of 2D platformers. These ranged from revivals like ', \"Contra ReBirth\", \", and\" \"Rayman Origins\" to original titles like \"Splosion Man\" and \"Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure\". ', released in 2008, was a 2D platformer with a rich visual style. Later games like \"Limbo\", \"Super Meat Boy\", \"Braid\", Geometry Dash, \"A Boy and His Blob\", and The Behemoth's \"BattleBlock Theater\" also used 2D graphics. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is especially notable because unlike most 2D platformers in the twenty-first century, it came out for a non-portable console and was not restricted to a content delivery network. A year after the success of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", Nintendo released more 2D platformers in their classic franchises: \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\" and \"Kirby's Return to Dream Land\". In 2012, they released two more 2D platformers: \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" for the 3DS and \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" for the Wii U. Nintendo also experimented with 3D platformers that had gameplay elements from 2D platformers, leading to \"Super Mario 3D Land\" (2011) for the 3DS and \"Super Mario 3D World\" (2013) for the Wii U, the latter having cooperative multiplayer. Both were critical and commercial successes.\nGames from independent developers in the late 2000s and the 2010s helped grow the platform-game market. These had a stronger focus on story and innovation. In 2009, Frozenbyte released \"Trine\", a 2.5D platformer that mixed traditional elements with physics puzzles. The game sold more than 1.1\u00a0million copies, and a sequel, \"Trine 2\", came out in 2011.\nThe year 2017 saw the release of several 3D platformers, including \"Yooka-Laylee\" and \"A Hat in Time\", both crowdfunded on the website Kickstarter. \"Super Mario Odyssey\", which returned the series to the open-ended gameplay of \"Super Mario 64\", became one of the best-selling and best-reviewed games in the franchise's history. \"Super Lucky's Tale\" came out for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. \"Snake Pass\" was called a \"puzzle-platformer without a jump button.\" The \"Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy\" for PlayStation 4 sold over 2.5 million copies in three months, despite some critics noting it was harder than the original games. The next few years saw more remakes of 3D platformers: \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\" (2018) and \"\" (2020).\nIn the ninth generation of consoles, the platformer remains important. \"Astro Bot Rescue Mission\" (2018), a PlayStation VR game, was followed by \"Astro's Playroom\" (2020), which came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5. ' (2020), developed by Sumo Digital, was a PlayStation 5 launch title. ' (2020) was released to critical praise. \"Bowser's Fury\" (2021), a short campaign added to the Switch port of \"Super Mario 3D World\", bridged the gap between the gameplay of \"3D World\" and that of \"Odyssey\". \"\" (2021) was one of the first PlayStation 5-exclusive games made by Insomniac. On August 25, 2021, the Kickstarter-funded \"Psychonauts 2\" was released to critical acclaim. \"Fall Guys\" (2020) amalgamates platforming elements into the battle royale genre, and was a critical and commercial success. In 2024, the third game in the Astro Bot series, \"Astro Bot\", was released to widespread critical acclaim, becoming the highest-rated game of the year on OpenCritic.\nSubgenres.\nThis list some definable platformers in the following types, but there are also many vaguely defined subgenres games that have not been listed. These game categories are the prototypes genre that recognized by different platform styles.\nPuzzle-platformer.\nPuzzle-platformers are characterized by their use of a platformer structure to drive a game whose challenge is derived primarily from puzzles.\nEnix's 1983 release \"Door Door\" and Sega's 1985 release \"Doki Doki Penguin Land\" (for the SG-1000) are perhaps the first examples, though the genre is diverse, and classifications can vary. \"Doki Doki Penguin Land\" allowed players to run and jump in typical platform fashion, but they could also destroy blocks, and were tasked with guiding an egg to the bottom of the level without letting it break.\n\"The Lost Vikings\" (1993) was a popular game in this genre. It has three characters players can switch between, each with different abilities. All three characters are needed to complete the level goals.\nThis subgenre has a strong presence on handheld systems. \"Wario Land 2\" moved the Wario series into the puzzle-platform genre by eliminating the element of death and adding temporary injuries, such as being squashed or lit on fire, and specialized powers. \"Wario Land 3\" continued this tradition, while \"Wario Land 4\" was more of a mix of puzzle and traditional platform elements. The Game Boy update of \"Donkey Kong\" was also successful and saw a sequel on Game Boy Advance: \"Mario vs. Donkey Kong\". \"\", the first handheld title in its series, is also a puzzle-platformer.\nThrough independent game development, this genre has experienced a revival since 2014. \"Braid\" uses time manipulation for its puzzles, and \"And Yet It Moves\" uses frame of reference rotation. In contrast to these side-scrollers, \"Narbacular Drop\" and its successor, \"Portal\", are first-person games that use portals to solve puzzles in 3D. Since the release of \"Portal\", there have been more puzzle-platformers which use a first-person camera, including ' and \"Antichamber\". In 2014, Nintendo released ' which uses compact level design and camera rotation in order to reach the goal and find secrets and collectibles. Despite lacking jump ability, Toad still navigates the environment via unique movement mechanics.\nRun-and-gun platformer.\nThe run-and-gun platform genre was popularised by Konami's \"Contra\". Among the most popular games in this style are \"Gunstar Heroes\" and \"Metal Slug\". Side-scrolling run-and-gun games marry platformers with shoot 'em ups, with less tricky platforming and more shooting. These games are sometimes called platform shooters. The genre has arcade roots, so these games are generally linear and difficult.\nThere are games which have a lot of shooting but do not fall in this subgenre. \"Mega Man\", \"Metroid\", \"Ghosts 'n Goblins\", \"Vectorman\", \"Jazz Jackrabbit\", \"Earthworm Jim\", \"Turrican\", \"Cuphead\" and \"Enchanted Portals\" are all platformers with shooting, but unlike \"Contra\" or \"Metal Slug\", platforming, as well as exploring and back-tracking, figures prominently. Run-and-gun games are generally pure, and while they may have vehicular sequences or other shifts in style, they have shooting throughout.\nCinematic platformer.\nCinematic platformers are a small but distinct subgenre, usually distinguished by their relative realism. These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platformers, and they additionally often have an absent or minimal HUD. To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with \"Prince of Persia\", have employed rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts. Jumping abilities are typically roughly within the confines of an athletic human's capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of elevator platforms.\nAs these games tend to feature vulnerable characters who may die as the result of a single enemy attack or by falling a relatively short distance, they almost never have limited lives or continues. Challenge is derived from trial and error problem solving, forcing the player to find the right way to overcome a particular obstacle.\n\"Prince of Persia\" was the first cinematic platformer and perhaps the most influential. \"Impossible Mission\" pioneered many of the defining elements of cinematic platformers and is an important precursor to this genre. Other games in the genre include \"\" (and its 2013 remake), \"ReCore\", \"Another World\", \"Heart of Darkness\", the first two \"Oddworld\" games, \"Blackthorne\", \"Bermuda Syndrome\", \"Generations Lost\", \"Heart of the Alien\", \"Weird Dreams\", \"Limbo\", \"Inside\", \"onEscapee\", \"Deadlight\", \"The Way\", \"Lunark\", \"Planet of Lana\" and \"Full Void\". \"Tomb Raider\" was the first cinematic platformer to utilize real-time 3D graphics.\nComical action game.\nGames in the genre are most commonly called \"comical action games\" (CAGs) in Japan. The original arcade \"Mario Bros.\" is generally recognized as the originator of this genre, though \"Bubble Bobble\" is also highly influential. These games are characterized by single screen, non-scrolling levels and often contain cooperative two-player action. A level is cleared when all enemies on the screen have been defeated, and vanquished foes usually drop score bonuses in the form of fruit or other items. CAGs are almost exclusively developed in Japan and are either arcade games, or sequels to arcade games, though they are also a common genre among amateur \"doujinshi\" games. Other examples include \"Don Doko Don\", \"Snow Bros.\" and \"Nightmare in the Dark\".\nIsometric platformer.\nIsometric platformers present a three-dimensional environment using two-dimensional graphics in isometric projection. The use of isometric graphics was popularized by Sega's arcade isometric shooter \"Zaxxon\" (1981), which Sega followed with the arcade isometric platformer \"Congo Bongo\", released in February 1983. Another early isometric platformer, the ZX Spectrum game \"Ant Attack\", was later released in November 1983.\n\"Knight Lore\", an isometric sequel to \"Sabre Wulf\", helped to establish the conventions of early isometric platformers. This formula was repeated in later games like \"Head Over Heels\" and \"Monster Max\". These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments, usually a series of small rooms connected by doors, and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements. Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese action-adventure games like \"The Legend of Zelda\" to create games like \"Land Stalker\" and \"Light Crusader\". This influence later traveled to Europe with Adeline Software's sprawling epic \"Little Big Adventure\", which blended RPG, adventure, and isometric platforming elements.\nBefore consoles were able to display true polygonal 3D graphics, the \u00be isometric perspective was used to move some popular 2D platformers into three-dimensional gameplay. \"Spot Goes To Hollywood\" was a sequel to the popular \"Cool Spot\", and \"Sonic 3D Blast\" was Sonic's outing into the isometric subgenre.\nPlatform-adventure game.\n, such as \"The Legend of Zelda\", or Typically these elements include the ability to explore an area freely, with access to new areas granted by either gaining new abilities or using inventory items. Many 2D games in the \"Metroid\" and \"Castlevania\" franchises are among the most popular games of this sort, and so games that take this type of approach are often labeled as \"Metroidvania\" games. Other examples of such games include \"Hollow Knight\", both games in the \"Ori\" series (\"Ori and the Blind Forest\" and \"Ori and the Will of the Wisps\"), ', \"Tails Adventure\", \"Cave Story\", \"Mega Man ZX\", \"Shadow Complex,\" ').\nEarly examples of free-roaming, side-scrolling, 2D platform-adventures in the vein of \"Metroidvania\" include Nintendo's \"Metroid\" in 1986 and Konami's \"Castlevania\" games: \"Vampire Killer\" in 1986 and ' in 1987, \"The Goonies II\" in 1987 again by Konami, as well as Enix's sci-fi Sharp X1 computer game \"Brain Breaker\" in 1985, Pony Canyon's \"Super Pitfall\" in 1986, System Sacom's \"Euphory\" in 1987, Bothtec's \"The Scheme\" in 1988, and several \"Dragon Slayer\" action RPGs by Nihon Falcom such as the 1985 release ' and 1987 releases \"Faxanadu\" and \"Legacy of the Wizard\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Auto-runner games.\nAuto-runner games are platformers where the player-character is nearly always moving in one constant direction through the level, with less focus on tricky jumping but more on quick reflexes as obstacles appear on screen. The subcategory of endless runner games have levels that effectively go on forever, typically through procedural generation. Auto-runner games have found success on mobile platforms, because they are well-suited to the small set of controls these games require, often limited to a single screen tap for jumping.\nGame designer Scott Rogers named side-scrolling shooters like \"Scramble\" (1981) and \"Moon Patrol\" (1982) and chase-style gameplay in platformers like \"Disney's Aladdin\" (1994 8-bit version) and \"Crash Bandicoot\" (1996) as forerunners of the genre. \"B.C.'s Quest for Tires\" (1983) has elements of runner games, keeping the jumping of \"Moon Patrol\", but replacing the vehicle with a cartoon character.\nIn February 2003, Gamevil published \"Nom\" for mobile phones in Korea. The game's designer Sin Bong-gu, stated that he wanted to create a game that was only possible on mobile phones, therefore he made the player character walk up walls and ceilings, requiring players to turn around their mobile phones while playing. To compensate for this complication, he limited the game's controls to a single button and let the character run automatically and indefinitely, \"like the people in modern society, who must always look forward and keep running\".\nWhile the concept thus was long known in Korea, journalists credit \"Canabalt\" (2009) as \"the title that single-handedly invented the smartphone-friendly single-button running genre\" and spawned a wave of clones. \"Fotonica\" (2011), a one-button endless runner viewed from the first person, that was described as a \"hybrid of \"Canabalt\"'s running, \"Mirror's Edge\"'s perspective (and hands) and \"Rez\"'s visual style\".\n\"Temple Run\" (2011) and its successor \"Temple Run 2\" were popular endless running games. The latter became the world's fastest-spreading mobile game in January 2013, with 50 million installations within thirteen days."}
{"id": "32398", "revid": "42117739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32398", "title": "Fighting game", "text": "Video game genre\nThe fighting game genre involves combat between characters, often (but not necessarily limited to) one-on-one battles. The mechanics of combat in fighting games often features blocking, grappling, counter-attacking, and the ability to chain attacks together into \"combos\". Characters generally engage in hand-to-hand combat, often incorporating martial arts, but some may include weaponry. Battles are usually set in a fixed-size arena along a two-dimensional plane, where characters navigate horizontally by walking or dashing, and vertically by jumping. Some games allow limited movement in 3D space, such as \"Tekken\" and \"Soul Edge\" while some are set in fully three-dimensional environments without restricting characters' movement, such as ', \"Jump Force\", ', ', ', \"\" and \"Power Stone\"; these are sometimes referred to as \"3D arena\" fighting games.\nThe fighting game genre is distinctly related to the beat 'em up genre, which pits many computer-controlled enemies against one or more player characters. The first video game to feature fist fighting is \"Heavyweight Champ\" (1976), but \"Karate Champ\" (1984) actually features the one-on-one fighting game genre instead of a sports game in arcades. \"Yie Ar Kung-Fu\" was released later that year with various fighting styles and introduced health meters, and \"The Way of the Exploding Fist\" (1985) further popularized the genre on home systems. In 1987, Capcom's \"Street Fighter\" introduced special attacks, and in 1991, its highly successful sequel \"Street Fighter II\" refined and popularized many genre conventions, including combos. Fighting games subsequently became the preeminent genre for video gaming in the early to mid-1990s, particularly in arcades. This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games, including franchises like \"Street Fighter\", \"Mortal Kombat\", \"Super Smash Bros.\", and \"Tekken\".\nDefinition.\nFighting games are a type of action game where two (in one-on-one fighting games) or more (in platform fighters) on-screen characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. \"Street Fighter II\", though not the first fighting game, is considered to have standardized the genre, and similar games released prior to \"Street Fighter II\" have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, though many games also feature characters with melee weapons. Fighting characters are usually based on humans, but there are also games that are entirely based around mecha robot characters, for example the \"\" series.\nThis genre is distinctly related to beat 'em ups, another action genre involving combat, where the player character must fight many enemies at the same time. Beat 'em ups, like traditional fighting games, display player and enemy health in a bar, generally located at the top of the screen. However, beat 'em ups generally do not feature combat divided into separate \"rounds\". During the 1980s to 1990s, publications used the terms \"fighting game\" and \"beat 'em up\" interchangeably, along with other terms such as \"martial arts simulation\" (or more specific terms such as \"judo simulator\") and \"punch-kick\" games. Fighting games were still being called \"beat 'em up\" games in video game magazines up until the end of the 1990s. With hindsight, critics have argued that the two types of game gradually became dichotomous as they evolved, though the two terms may still be conflated.\nSports-based combat games are games that feature boxing, mixed martial arts (MMA), or wrestling. Serious boxing games belong more to the sports game genre than the action game genre, as they aim for a more realistic model of boxing techniques, whereas moves in fighting games tend to be either highly exaggerated or outright fantastical models of Asian martial arts techniques. As such, boxing games, mixed martial arts games, and wrestling games are often described as distinct genres, without comparison to fighting games, and belong more in the sports game genre.\nGame design.\nFighting games involve combat between pairs of fighters using highly exaggerated martial arts moves. They typically revolve primarily around brawling or combat sport, though some variations feature weaponry. Games usually display on-screen fighters from a side view, and even 3D fighting games play largely within a 2D plane of motion. Games usually confine characters to moving left and right and jumping, although some games such as \"\" allow players to move between parallel planes of movement. Recent games tend to be rendered in three dimensions, making it easier for developers to add a greater number of animations, but otherwise play like those rendered in two dimensions. Games that are fully three-dimensional without a 2D plane are sometimes referred to as \"3D arena\" fighting games.\nFeatures.\nAside from restricting movement space, fighting games confine the player's actions to offensive and defensive maneuvers. Players must learn each game's effective combinations of attacks and defenses. Blocking is a basic defense against basic attacks. Some games feature more advanced blocking techniques; for example, Capcom's \"Street Fighter III\" features a move termed \"parrying\", which can be immediately followed by counter-attack, skipping the temporary stun a block would have put them in. A similar stun state is termed \"just defended\" in SNK's \"\".\nSpecial attacks and combos.\nAn integral feature of fighting games is the use of \"special attacks\", also called \"secret moves\", that employ combinations of directional inputs and button presses to perform a particular move beyond basic punching and kicking. Some special moves, which play an animation portraying an aspect of the character's personality, are referred to as taunts. Originated by Japanese company SNK in \"Art of Fighting\" (1992), these add humor, and they affect gameplay in certain games, such as improving the strength of other attacks. Some characters have unusual taunts, like Dan Hibiki from \"Street Fighter Alpha\".\nCombos that chain several attacks are fundamental to the genre since \"Street Fighter II\" (1991). Most fighting games display a \"combo meter\" of progress through a combo. The effectiveness of such moves often relates to the difficulty of execution and the degree of risk. These moves are often challenging, requiring excellent memory and timing.\nCounterplay.\nPredicting opponents' moves and counter-attacking, known as \"countering\", is a common element of gameplay. Fighting games emphasize the height of blows, ranging from low to jumping attacks. Thus, strategy requires predicting adversarial moves, similar to rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors.\nIn addition to blows, players can utilize throwing or grappling to circumvent blocks. Most fighting games allow a grapple move by pressing two or more buttons together, or simply by pressing punch or kick while being directly adjacent to the opponent. Other fighting games, like \"Dead or Alive\", have a unique button for throws and takedowns.\nProjectiles are primarily in 2D fighting games, like the Hadouken in \"Street Fighter\". Projectiles can simply inflict damage, or can maneuver opponents into disadvantageous positions.\nEmergent gameplay elements.\nTurtling and zoning.\nEspecially in 2D, zoning is defensive play that focuses on using relatively risk-free attacks to keep the opposing player away. The object is to force an opponent to take significant risks to approach the zoning player's character, or to stall out the in-game timer, which causes the player with more health (typically the one doing the zoning) to win. The effectiveness of the latter strategy varies from game to game, based on the effectiveness of zoning tools as well as the length of the in-game timer and the rewards characters can receive for successfully landing a hit when countering zoning.\nRushdown.\nThe opposite of turtling, rushdown refers to a number of specific aggressive strategies, philosophies, and play styles across all fighting games. The general goal of a rushdown play style is to overwhelm the opponent and force costly mistakes, either by using fast, confusing setups or by taking advantage of an impatient opponent as they are forced to play defense for prolonged periods of time. Rushdown players often favor attacking opponents in the corner of a stage or as they get up from a knockdown; both situations severely limit the options of the opponent and often allow the attacking player to force high-risk guessing scenarios.\nSpacing and footsies.\nSpacing is the act of positioning a character at a range where their attacks and movement tools carry the lowest risk and the highest reward. The concept is somewhat akin to that of footwork in martial arts. The desired position for play varies based on what tools are available to the character each player is currently using. As a result of this, a concept called \"footsies\" has emerged, frequently defined as players jockeying for position and using low-commitment moves at distances where neither character has a particular advantage.\nPressure.\nDepending on the game, character, and move used, a player may be rewarded for a decisive blow with a strong positional advantage, strong enough that the rewarded player can minimize the number of viable moves available to the other player. Doing so, and then taking advantage of the opponent's limited options, is called pressure. Common forms of pressure include making a player guess whether they should block high or low, or keeping the opposing player trapped in the corner and punishing any attempts to escape.\nMatches and rounds.\nFighting game matches generally consist of a set number of rounds (typically three), beginning with the announcer's signal. If the score is tied after an even number of rounds (typically 1-1), then the winner is decided in the final round. Round decisions can also be determined by time over, which judge players based on remaining health to declare a winner. In the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, the rules are different. Instead of rounds, the games usually give players a set number of lives (called stocks) for each player (usually three), and if the score is tied between two or more fighters when time runs out, then a \"sudden death\" match will take place by delivering a single hit to an opponent with 300% damage.\nFighting games widely feature health bars, introduced in \"Yie Ar Kung-Fu\" in 1984, which are depleted as characters sustain blows. Each successful attack will deplete a character's health, and the round continues until a fighter's health reaches zero. Hence, the main goal is to completely deplete the health bar of one's opponent, thus achieving a \"knockout\". Games such as \"Virtua Fighter\" also allow a character to be defeated by forcing them outside of the arena, awarding a \"ring-out\" to the victor. The \"Super Smash Bros.\" series allows players to send fighters off the stage when a character reaches a high percentage of damage; however, the gameplay objective differs from that of traditional fighting games in that the aim is to increase damage counters and knock opponents off the stage instead of depleting life bars.\nBeginning with Midway's \"Mortal Kombat\" released in 1992, the \"Mortal Kombat\" series introduced \"Fatalities\", where the match victor inflicts a brutal and gruesome finishing move onto the defeated opponent. Prompted by the announcer saying \"Finish Him!\", players have a short time window to execute a Fatality by entering a specific button and joystick combination while positioned at a specific distance from the opponent. The Fatality and its derivations are arguably the most notable features of the \"Mortal Kombat\" series with cultural impact and controversies.\nFighting games often include a single-player campaign or tournament, where the player must defeat a sequence of several computer-controlled opponents. Winning the tournament often reveals a special story-ending cutscene, and some games also grant access to hidden characters or special features upon victory. \"Tekken\" introduced the concept of story modes in 1994 with the first arcade full motion video cutscenes for each character's victory.\nCharacter selection.\nIn most fighting games, players may select from a variety of playable characters with unique fighting styles, special moves, and personalities. This became a strong convention for the genre with the release of \"Street Fighter II\" (1991), and these character choices have led to deeper game strategy and replay value.\nCustom character creation, or \"create\u2013a\u2013fighter\", is a feature of some fighting games that allows a player to customize the appearance and move set of their own character. \"Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium\" was the first game to include such a feature.\nMultiplayer modes.\nFighting games can support a two-player duel, sometimes by letting a second player challenge the first at any moment during a single-player match. Some games allow four-player simultaneous competition. Uniquely, the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series has allowed eight-player local and online multiplayer matches, beginning with \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\", though many classify the series as the platform fighter subgenre due to its deviation from traditional fighting game rules and design. Several games such as \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" and \"Dead or Alive\" have featured teams where players form \"tag teams\" to fight duels, but a character may be swapped by a teammate. Some fighting games offer the endurance challenge of a series of opponents. Online games can suffer lag from slow data transmission, which can disrupt split-second timing. This is mitigated by technology such as rollback netcode, often implemented using the open-source library GGPO, which synchronizes players by quickly rolling back to the most recent accurate game state, correcting errors, and then jumping back to the current frame. Such games include \"Skullgirls\" and \"\".\nHistory.\nOrigins (1970s to early 1980s).\nThe first fighting games were fundamentally inspired by martial arts films, especially Bruce Lee's Hong Kong action cinema. Films include \"Game of Death\" (1972), where Lee fights a series of bosses, and \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973), about an international martial arts tournament. Other inspiration is Japanese martial arts works, including the manga and anime series \"Karate Master\" (1971\u20131977), and Sonny Chiba's \"The Street Fighter\" (1974).\nBefore martial arts games, the earliest video games with fist-fighting are boxing games, featuring battles between characters with fantastic abilities and complex special maneuvers. Sega's black-and-white boxing game \"Heavyweight Champ\", released for arcades in 1976, is considered the first video game with fist fighting, but it was still considered a sports game. Vectorbeam's arcade video game \"Warrior\" (1979) is sometimes credited as one of the first fighting games; in contrast to \"Heavyweight Champ\" and most later games, \"Warrior\" is based on sword fighting duels and uses a bird's-eye view. Sega's jidaigeki-themed arcade action game \"Samurai\", released in March 1980, features a boss battle where the samurai player character confronts a boss samurai in one-on-one sword-fighting combat.\nOne-on-one boxing games appeared on consoles with Activision's Atari VCS game \"Boxing\", released in July 1980, and Sega's SG-1000 game \"Champion Boxing\" (1983), which is Yu Suzuki's debut at Sega. Nintendo's arcade game \"Punch-Out\" was developed in 1983 and released in February 1984, as a boxing game featuring a behind-the-character perspective, maneuvers such as blocking and dodging, and stamina meters that are depleted or replenished by blows.\nEmergence of fighting game genre (mid-to-late 1980s).\n\"Karate Champ\" was developed by Techn\u014ds Japan and released by Data East in May 1984, and is credited with establishing and popularizing the one-on-one fighting game genre. A variety of moves can be performed using the dual-joystick controls. It uses a best-of-three matches format like later fighting games, and has training bonus stages. The \"Player vs Player\" edition of \"Karate Champ\", released later that year, is also the first fighting game to allow two-player duel. It influenced Konami's \"Yie Ar Kung Fu\", released in October 1984. The game drew heavily from Bruce Lee films, with the main player character Oolong modelled after Lee (like in Bruceploitation films). In contrast to the grounded realism of \"Karate Champ\", \"Yie Ar Kung-Fu\" moved the genre towards more fantastical, fast-paced action with a variety of special moves and high jumps, establishing the template for subsequent fighting games. It expanded on \"Karate Champ\" by pitting the player against a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style. The player could also perform up to sixteen different moves, including projectile attacks, and it replaced the point-scoring system of \"Karate Champ\" with a health meter system, becoming the standard for the genre.\nIrem's \"Kung-Fu Master\", designed by Takashi Nishiyama and released in November 1984, is a side-scrolling beat 'em up that, at the end of each level, featured one-on-one boss battles that resemble fighting games. It is based on Hong Kong martial arts films, specifically Jackie Chan's \"Wheels on Meals\" (1984) and Bruce Lee's \"Game of Death\". Nishiyama later used its one-on-one boss battles as the basis for his fighting game \"Street Fighter\". Nintendo's boxing sequel \"Super Punch-Out\" was released for arcades in late 1984 and ported by Elite to home computers as \"Frank Bruno's Boxing\" in 1985, features martial arts elements, high and low guarding, ducking, lateral dodging, and a KO meter. This meter is built up with successful attacks and, when full, enables a special, more powerful punch to be thrown. Broderbund's \"Karateka\", designed by Jordan Mechner and released at the end of 1984, is a one-on-one fighting game for home computers that successfully added plot to its fighting action, like the beat 'em up \"Kung-Fu Master\".\nBy early 1985, martial arts games had become popular in arcades. On home computers, the Japanese MSX version of \"Yie Ar Kung-Fu\" was released in January 1985, and Beam Software's \"The Way of the Exploding Fist\" was released for PAL regions in May 1985; \"The Way of the Exploding Fist\" borrowed heavily from \"Karate Champ\", but nevertheless achieved critical success and afforded the burgeoning genre further popularity on home computers in PAL regions, becoming the UK's best-selling computer game of 1985. In North America, Data East ported \"Karate Champ\" to home computers in October 1985, becoming one of the best-selling computer games of the late 1980s. Other game developers also imitated \"Karate Champ\", notably System 3's computer game \"International Karate\", released in Europe in November 1985; after Epyx released it in North America in April 1986, Data East took unsuccessful legal action against Epyx over the game. \"Yie Ar Kung-Fu\" went on to become the UK's best-selling computer game of 1986, the second year in a row for fighting games. The same year, Martech's \"Uchi Mata\" for home computers featured novel controller motions for grappling maneuvers, but they were deemed too difficult.\nIn the late 1980s, side-scrolling beat 'em ups became considerably more popular than one-on-one fighting games, with many arcade game developers focused more on producing beat 'em ups and shoot 'em ups. Takashi Nishiyama used the one-on-one boss battles of his earlier beat 'em up \"Kung-Fu Master\" as the template for Capcom's fighting game \"Street Fighter\", combined with elements of \"Karate Champ\" and \"Yie Ar Kung Fu\". \"Street Fighter\" found its own niche in the gaming world, which was dominated by beat 'em ups and shoot 'em ups at the time. Part of the game's appeal was the use of special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls, which created a sense of mystique and invited players to practice the game. Following \"Street Fighter's\" lead, the use of command-based hidden moves began to pervade other games in the rising fighting game genre. \"Street Fighter\" also introduced other staples of the genre, including the blocking technique, as well as the ability for a challenger to jump in and initiate a match against a player at any time. The game also introduced pressure-sensitive controls that determine the strength of an attack, though due to causing damaged arcade cabinets, Capcom replaced it soon after with a six-button control scheme offering light, medium, and hard punches and kicks, which became another staple of the genre.\nIn 1988, Home Data released \"Reikai D\u014dshi: Chinese Exorcist\", also known as \"Last Apostle Puppet Show\", the first fighting game to use digitized sprites and motion capture animation. Meanwhile, home game consoles largely ignored the genre. \"\" was one of the few releases for the Sega Genesis, but was not as popular as games in other genres. Technical challenges limited the popularity of early fighting games. Programmers had difficulty producing a game that could recognize the fast motions of a joystick, and so players had difficulty executing special moves with any accuracy.\nMainstream success (early 1990s).\nThe release of \"Street Fighter II\" in 1991 is considered a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, \"Street Fighter II\" allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of \"Street Fighter II\" surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines to keep up with demand. \"Street Fighter II\" was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly. Its success led to fighting games becoming the dominant genre in the arcade game industry of the early 1990s, which led to a resurgence of the arcade game industry. The popularity of \"Street Fighter II\" led it to be released for home game consoles and becoming the defining template for fighting games.\nSNK released \"\" shortly after \"Street Fighter II\" in 1991. It was designed by Takashi Nishiyama, the creator of the original \"Street Fighter\", which it was envisioned as a spiritual successor to. \"Fatal Fury\" placed more emphasis on storytelling and the timing of special moves, and added a two-plane system where characters could step into the foreground or background. Meanwhile, Sega experimented with \"Dark Edge\", an early attempt at a 3D fighting game where characters could move in all directions. However, Sega never released the game outside Japan because it felt that \"unrestrained\" 3D fighting games were unenjoyable. Sega also attempted to introduce holographic 3D technology to the genre with \"Holosseum\" in 1992, though it was unsuccessful. Several fighting games achieved commercial success, including SNK's \"Art of Fighting\" and \"Samurai Shodown\" as well as Sega's \"Eternal Champions\". Nevertheless, \"Street Fighter II\" remained the most popular, spawning a \"Champion Edition\" that improved game balance and allowed players to use boss characters that were unselectable in the previous version.\nChicago's Midway Games achieved unprecedented notoriety when they released \"Mortal Kombat\" in 1992. The game featured digital characters drawn from real actors, numerous secrets, and \"Fatality\" finishing maneuvers in which the player's character kills their opponent. The game earned a reputation for its gratuitous violence, and was adapted for home game consoles. The home version of \"Mortal Kombat\" was released on September 13, 1993, a day promoted as \"Mortal Monday\". The advertising resulted in line-ups to purchase the game and a subsequent backlash from politicians concerned about the game's violence. The \"Mortal Kombat\" franchise would achieve iconic status similar to that of \"Street Fighter\" with several sequels as well as movies, television series, and extensive merchandising. Numerous other game developers tried to imitate \"Street Fighter II\" and \"Mortal Kombat\"'s financial success with similar games, including Nintendo and Rare's \"Killer Instinct\", a game that featured unprecedentedly detailed pre-rendered 3D graphics and vastly improved on the core concept of combos, presenting a way faster gameplay than most other games of that era, specific combo-breaker maneuvers, and the \"Ultra\", a series of combined finishing moves surpassing the number of 20 hits; it was also marketed by Midway Games. Many of the games of that period were low budget clones of the more popular games, and in some cases this led to controversy; in 1994, Capcom USA took unsuccessful legal action against Data East over the 1993 arcade game \"Fighter's History\", which supposedly plagiarized \"Street Fighter 2\". Data East's largest objection in court was that their 1984 arcade game \"Karate Champ\" was the true originator of the competitive fighting game genre, which predated the original \"Street Fighter\" by three years, but the reason the case was decided against Capcom was that the copied elements were sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire and thus excluded from copyright.\nEmergence of 3D fighting games (mid-to-late 1990s).\nSega AM2 debuted in the genre with the 1993 arcade game \"Burning Rival\", but they gained renown with the release of \"Virtua Fighter\" for the same platform the same year. It is the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than \"Street Fighter\" and \"Mortal Kombat\", which has six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio. In 1994, Namco released \"Tekken\", the rival arcade game introducing cutting-edge 3D polygon technology at a revolutionary 60 frames per second.\nThe 1995 PlayStation game \"Battle Arena Toshinden\" is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3D\" due to its introduction of the sidestep maneuver, which IGN described as \"one little move\" that \"changed the fighter forever\". The \"sidestep\" in the game, however, consisted of shoulder rolls instead of actual sidesteps. That year, Namco released \"Tekken 2\", which introduced actual sidestepping or \"mist steps\" as first released in arcade games and in the international fighting game community. These moves are only exclusive to its protagonist, the penultimate boss of the arcade mode, Kazuya Mishima in his regular human state. The mist steps also allow combos to be performed as a manner of \"crouch dashing,\" or when the Mishima player could run to the opponent while crouching since regular running prevented executing easy combos. Polygonal fighters became trendy and many developers started to make them. Further all-new titles were released in 1995: \"Zero Divide\" on the PlayStation, the Western-developed \"FX Fighter\" on PC and \"Criticom\" on console, and Sega's arcade \"Fighting Vipers\" - on top of \"Tekken 2\", an updated \"Battle Arena Toshinden 2\", and console ports of \"Tekken\" and \"Virtua Fighter 2\". A multitude of new major polygonal releases arrived in 1996 from both prime and smaller developers. The 1996 arcade game \"Dead or Alive\" offered an interactive feature within its stages called the \"danger zone\", an environmental hazard outside the center of stages where if an opponent is knocked into it, they will take extra damage, jeopardizing their position and giving their attacker an advantage. If an opponent is knocked into the danger zone with very low health, the danger zone is more likely to knock them out than a regular attack. Other major 1996 releases include \"Virtua Fighter 3\", \"Soul Edge\", \"Last Bronx\" (in Japan), and the home port of \"Tekken 2\", cementing 3D as the future of the genre.\nIn 1994, SNK released \"The King of Fighters '94\" in arcades, where players choose from teams of three characters to eliminate each other one by one. Eventually, Capcom released further updates to \"Street Fighter II\", including \"Super Street Fighter II\" and \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\". These games feature more characters and new moves, some of which are a response to hackers of the original \"Street Fighter II\" game to add new features. However, criticism of these updates grew as players demanded a true sequel. By 1995, the dominant franchises were the \"Mortal Kombat\" series in America and the \"Virtua Fighter\" series in Japan, with \"Street Fighter Alpha\" unable to match the popularity of \"Street Fighter II\". Throughout this period, the fighting game was the dominant genre in competitive video gaming, with enthusiasts popularly attending arcades in order to find human opponents. The genre was also very popular on home consoles. At the beginning of 1996, \"GamePro\" (a magazine devoted chiefly to home console and handheld gaming) reported that for the last several years, their reader surveys had consistently yielded 4 out of 5 respondents name fighting games as their favorite genre.\nIn the late 1990s, traditional 2D fighting games began to decline in popularity, with specific franchises falling into difficulty due to 3D fighters. Although the release of \"Street Fighter EX\" introduced 3D graphics to the series, both it and ' flopped in arcades. A home video game also titled ' was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but it is not a port, but a separately produced game based on the same premise. Capcom released \"Street Fighter III\" in 1997 which features improved 2D visuals, but is also unable to match the impact of earlier games. Excitement stirred in Japan over \"Virtua Fighter 3\" in arcades, and Sega eventually ported the game to its Dreamcast console. Meanwhile, SNK released several fighting games on its Neo Geo platform, including \"Samurai Shodown II\" in 1994, \"Real Bout Fatal Fury\" in 1995, \"The Last Blade\" in 1997, and annual updates to its \"The King of Fighters\" franchise. \"\" from 1999 (part of the \"Fatal Fury\" series) was considered one of SNK's last great games; the company announced that it would close its doors in late 2001. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" reported that in 1996, U.S. gamers spent nearly $150\u00a0million on current generation fighting games, and in Japan, fighting games accounted for over 80% of video game sales.\nThe fighting game genre continued to evolve, with several strong 3D fighting games emerging in the late 1990s. Namco's \"Tekken\" (released in arcades in 1994 and on the PlayStation in 1995) proved critical to the PlayStation's early success, with its sequels also becoming some of the console's most important games. The \"Soul\" series of weapon-based fighting games also achieved considerable critical success, beginning with 1995's \"Soul Edge\" (known as \"Soul Blade\" outside Japan) to \"Soulcalibur VI\" in 2018. Tecmo released \"Dead or Alive\" in the arcades in 1996, porting it for the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. It spawned a long-running franchise, known for its fast-paced control system, innovative counterattacks, and interactive environments. The series again included games important to the success of their respective consoles, such as \"Dead or Alive 3\" for the Xbox and \"Dead or Alive 4\" for the Xbox 360. In 1998, \"Bushido Blade\", published by Square, introduced a realistic fighting engine that features three-dimensional environments while abandoning time limits and health bars in favor of an innovative Body Damage System, where a sword strike to a certain body part can amputate a limb or decapitate the head.\nVideo game enthusiasts took an interest in fictional crossovers, which feature characters from multiple franchises in a particular game. An early example of this type of fighting game is the 1996 arcade release \"X-Men vs. Street Fighter\" (which later became the \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series), featuring comic book superheroes and characters from other Capcom games. In 1999, Nintendo released the first game in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, which allowed match-ups from various franchises, such as Pikachu vs. Mario.\nDecline of Traditional 2D Games (early 2000s).\nIn the early 2000s, the fighting genre boom turned to bust. In retrospect, multiple developers attribute its decline to its increasing complexity and specialization, and to other factors such as over-saturation. This complexity shut out casual players, and the market for fighting games became smaller and more specialized. Even as far back as 1997, many in the industry said that the fighting game market's growing inaccessibility to newcomers was bringing an end to the genre's dominance. Furthermore, arcades gradually became less profitable throughout the late 1990s to early 2000s due to the increased technical power and popularity of home consoles. The early to mid 2000s is considered by some to be the \"Dark Age\" of fighting games. This term has been heavily criticized by some members of the fighting game community however. Maximilian Dood, a fighting game content creator, called this term specific to Capcom games, being built from the bias for the Street Fighter series in the United States. This is because of the rise of anime fighters, the 3D Tekken franchise, platform fighters including Super Smash Bros. Melee, and other fighting games. Sales of some of these series do not reflect the alleged decline in fighting games. Meanwhile, arcade games continued to thrive in other countries such as Japan.\nThe two most prolific developers of 2D fighting games, Capcom and SNK, combined intellectual property to produce \"SNK vs. Capcom\" games. SNK released the first game of this type, ', for its Neo Geo Pocket Color handheld at the end of 1999. GameSpot regarded the game as \"perhaps the most highly anticipated fighter ever\" and called it the best fighting game ever to be released for a handheld console. Capcom released ' for arcades and the Dreamcast in 2000, followed by sequels in subsequent years. Though none matched the critical success of the handheld version, \"Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO\" was noted as the first game of the genre to successfully utilize internet competition. Other crossovers from 2008 included \"Tatsunoko vs. Capcom\" and \"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\". The most successful crossover, however, was \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" for the Wii. Featuring 40 characters from Nintendo and third-party franchises, the game was a runaway commercial success in addition to being lavished with critical praise.\nIn the new millennium, fighting games became less plentiful than in the mid-1990s, with multiplayer competition diversifying toward other genres. However, SNK reappeared in 2003 as SNK Playmore and continued to release games. Arc System Works received critical acclaim for releasing \"Guilty Gear X\" in 2001, as well as its sequel \"Guilty Gear XX\", as both were 2D fighting games featuring striking anime-inspired graphics. Fighting games became a popular genre for amateur and doujin developers in Japan. The 2002 title \"Melty Blood\" was developed by then-amateur developer French Bread and achieved cult success on the PC. It became highly popular in arcades following its 2005 release, and a version was released for the PlayStation 2 the following year. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise in online gaming. In 2004, \"\", \"Dead or Alive Ultimate\", and the Xbox version of \"Street Fighter Anniversary Collection\" became the first fighting games to offer online multiplayer and have received positive reception from critics. While the genre became generally far less popular than it once was, arcades and their attendant fighting games remained reasonably popular in Japan during this time period, and remain so even today. \"Virtua Fighter 5\" lacked an online mode, but still achieved success both on home consoles and in arcades; players practiced at home and went to arcades to compete face-to-face with opponents. In addition to \"Virtua Fighter\", the \"Tekken\", \"Soul\" and \"Dead or Alive\" franchises continued to release installments. Classic \"Street Fighter\" and \"Mortal Kombat\" games were re-released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade, allowing internet play, and in some cases, HD graphics.\nThe early part of the decade had seen the rise of competitive video gaming, referred to by the term Esports. The rise in esports saw the rise of major international fighting game tournaments such as Tougeki \u2013 Super Battle Opera and Evolution Championship Series, and famous players such as Daigo Umehara. An important fighting game at the time was ', originally released in 1999. The game gained significant attention with \"Evo Moment 37\", also known as the \"Daigo Parry\", which refers to a portion of a \"3rd Strike\" semi-final match held at Evolution Championship Series 2004 (Evo 2004) between Daigo Umehara and Justin Wong. During this match, Umehara made an unexpected comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's \"Super Art\" move using Chun-Li while Umehara had only one pixel on his health bar. Umehara subsequently won the match. \"Evo Moment #37\" is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming, compared to sports moments such as Babe Ruth's called shot and the Ice Hockey Miracle on Ice. It inspired many to start playing \"3rd Strike,\" which brought new life into the fighting game community (FGC) during a time when the community was in a state of stagnation. Fighting games have also been featured in esports scenes with variety of gaming genres, with \"Dead or Alive 3\" becoming the fighting game to be included in the Xbox Championship in 2004, and \"Dead or Alive Ultimate\" becoming the first fighting game to be included in the World Cyber Games (WCG) in 2005. \"Dead or Alive 4s competitive scene became the first competitive esport fighting game scene to be televised as it was the only fighting game included in the esport league, the Championship Gaming Series (CGS), in 2007 and 2008. The league was operated and fully broadcast by DirecTV in association with British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) and STAR TV. \"Dead or Alive\" has been credited for launching the careers of pro-gamer turned Koei Tecmo employee, Emmanuel Rodriguez, and the highest-paid women pro-gamers, Kat Gunn and Vanessa Arteaga.\nRebirth (late 2000s to present).\nThe late 2000s featured a number of games that sparked another surge in fighting game popularity. \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" was released in early March 2008 to universal acclaim and went on to set a new record in sales, at one point selling at 120 units per minute. Another game was \"Street Fighter IV\", the series' first mainline title since \"Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike\" in 1999, which was released in early 2009 also to critical acclaim, having garnered praise since its debut at Japanese arcades in July 2008. The console versions of \"Street Fighter IV\", as well as the updated \"Super Street Fighter IV,\" sold more than 6\u00a0million copies over the next few years. The success of these two games, among others, sparked a renaissance for the genre, introducing new players to the genre and with the increased audience allowing other fighting game franchises to achieve successful revivals of their own, as well as increasing tournament participation. \"Tekken 6\" was building off the popularity of its and was still positively received, selling more than 3\u00a0million copies worldwide by August 2010, one year after its release. Other successful games that followed include \"Mortal Kombat\", \"\", \"The King of Fighters XIII\", \"Dead or Alive 5\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", \"Soulcalibur V\", and \"Guilty Gear Xrd\". Though the critically acclaimed \"Virtua Fighter 5\" was released to very little acclaim in 2007, its update \"Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown\" received much more attention due to renewed interest in the genre.\nNumerous indie fighting games have also been crowdfunded on websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, the most notable success being the tag team fighting game \"Skullgirls\" in 2012. Later, in 2019, Ubisoft reported that the free-to-play platform fighting game \"Brawlhalla\" reached 20\u00a0million players, with it climbing to 80 million by 2022.\nIn 2018, \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" for the Nintendo Switch was released. It became the best-selling fighting game of all time, topping its Wii predecessor \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" and introduced nearly 90 characters through its default mode and through downloadable content or DLC, having sold 36.55\u00a0million copies worldwide. Later in the mid-2020s, the genre achieved another renaissance with the arrival of \"Street Fighter 6\" and its immediate success, together with \"Mortal Kombat 1\" and \"Tekken 8\". \"Street Fighter 6\" sold over 1 million copies within five days after its launch, and sold over 3 million copies by January 2024. \"Mortal Kombat 1\" sold over 2 million copies in its first two months, and garnered over 3 million copies by January 2024, while the latest game \"Tekken 8\", which was released in January 2024 sold over 2 million copies in its first month alone. Thus, the 2020s have had a marked resurgence in fighting games that has been deemed a new golden age in fighting games.\nFinancial performance.\nHighest-grossing franchises.\nThe following are the highest-grossing fighting game franchises, in terms of total gross revenue generated by arcade games, console games, and computer games.\nBest-selling franchises.\nArcade.\nThe following are the best-selling fighting arcade video game franchises that have sold at least 10,000 arcade units.

{"id": "32399", "revid": "46051904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32399", "title": "Video game developer", "text": "Software developer specializing in the creation of video games\nA video game developer is a software developer specializing in video game development \u2013 the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programmers, designers, artists, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.\nA developer may specialize in specific game engines or specific video game consoles, or may develop for several systems (including personal computers and mobile devices). Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.\nMost video game publishers maintain development studios (such as Electronic Arts's EA Canada, Square Enix's studios, Activision's Radical Entertainment, Nintendo EPD and Sony's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as \"publishers\" rather than \"developers\". Developers may be private as well.\nTypes.\nFirst-party developers.\nIn the video game industry, a first-party developer is part of a company that manufactures a video game console and develops mainly for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as Nintendo), have a specific division name (such as Sony's Polyphony Digital) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as Rare or Naughty Dog). Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge financial investment on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game on time. However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits. Current examples of first-party studios include Nintendo EPD for Nintendo, PlayStation Studios for Sony, and Xbox Game Studios for Microsoft Gaming.\nSecond-party developers.\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios that take development contracts from platform holders and develop games exclusive to that platform, i.e. a non-owned developer making games for a first-party company. As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers. These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so that upon completion or termination of their contracts, they are able to continue developing games for other publishers if they choose to. For example, while HAL Laboratory initially began developing games on personal computers like the MSX, they became one of the earliest second-party developers for Nintendo, developing exclusively for Nintendo's consoles starting with the Famicom, though they would self-publish their mobile games.\nThird-party developers.\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's design and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer. Work for hire studios solely execute the publishers vision.\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on royalties. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may depend on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may devastate a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\nA common exit strategy for a successful video game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in game design and content than third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are the publisher's employees, their interests align with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\nActivision in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer. When four Atari, Inc. programmers left the company following its sale to Warner Communications, partially over the lack of respect that the new management gave to programmers, they used their knowledge of how Atari VCS game cartridges were programmed to create their own games for the system, founding Activision in 1979 to sell these. Atari took legal action to try to block the sale of these games, but the companies ultimately settled, with Activision agreeing to pay a portion of their sales as a license fee to Atari for developing for the console. This established the use of licensing fees as a model for third-party development that persists into the present. The licensing fee approach was further enforced by Nintendo when it decided to allow other third-party developers to make games for the Famicom console, setting a 30% licensing fee that covered game cartridge manufacturing costs and development fees. The 30% licensing fee for third-party developers has also persisted to the present, being a de facto rate used for most digital storefronts for third-party developers to offer their games on the platform.\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired Raven (1997); Neversoft (1999), which merged with Infinity Ward in 2014; Z-Axis (2001); Treyarch (2001); Luxoflux (2002); Shaba (2002); Infinity Ward (2003) and Vicarious Visions (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a database, Voice over IP, or add-in interface software; this is also known as middleware. Examples of this include SpeedTree and Havoc.\nIndie game developers.\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the Internet and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games. Digital distribution services for PC games, such as Steam, have also contributed to facilitating the distribution of indie games.\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms. In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).\nQuality of life.\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with t-shirts and sandals as common work attire. While some workers find this type of environment rewarding and pleasant professionally there has been criticism of this \"uniform\" potentially adding to a hostile work environment for women. The industry also requires long working hours from its employees (sometimes to an extent seen as unsustainable). Employee burnout is not uncommon.\nAn entry-level programmer can make, on average, over $66,000 annually only if they are successful in obtaining a position in a medium to large video game company. An experienced game-development employee, depending on their expertise and experience, averaged roughly $73,000 in 2007. Indie game developers may only earn between $10,000 and $50,000 a year depending on how financially successful their titles are.\nIn addition to being part of the software industry, game development is also within the entertainment industry; most sectors of the entertainment industry (such as films and television) require long working hours and dedication from their employees, such as willingness to relocate and/or required to develop games that do not appeal to their personal taste. The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts labor to the industry, creating a competitive labor market that demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees. Industry communities, such as the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), are conducting increasing discussions about the problem; they are concerned that working conditions in the industry cause a significant deterioration in employees' quality of life.\nCrunch.\nSome video game developers and publishers have been accused of the excessive invocation of \"crunch time\". \"Crunch time\" is the point at which the team is thought to be failing to achieve milestones needed to launch a game on schedule. The complexity of workflow, reliance on third-party deliverables, and the intangibles of artistic and aesthetic demands in video game creation create difficulty in predicting milestones. The use of crunch time is also seen to be exploitative of the younger workforce in video games, who have not had the time to establish a family and who were eager to advance within the industry by working long hours. Because crunch time tends to come from a combination of corporate practices as well as peer influence, the term \"crunch culture\" is often used to discuss video game development settings where crunch time may be seen as the norm rather than the exception.\nThe use of crunch time as a workplace standard gained attention first in 2004, when Erin Hoffman exposed the use of crunch time at Electronic Arts, a situation known as the \"EA Spouses\" case. A similar \"Rockstar Spouses\" case gained further attention in 2010 over working conditions at Rockstar San Diego. Since then, there has generally been negative perception of crunch time from most of the industry as well as from its consumers and other media.\nDiscrimination and harassment.\nGender.\nGame development had generally been a predominately male workforce. In 1989, according to \"Variety\", women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry, while a 2017 IGDA survey found that the female demographic in game development had risen to about 20%. Taking into account that a 2017 ESA survey found 41% of video game players were female, this represented a significant gender gap in game development.\nThe male-dominated industry, most who have grown up playing video games and are part of the video game culture, can create a culture of \"toxic geek masculinity\" within the workplace. In addition, the conditions behind crunch time are far more discriminating towards women as this requires them to commit time exclusively to the company or to more personal activities like raising a family. These factors established conditions within some larger development studios where female developers have found themselves discriminated in workplace hiring and promotion, as well as the target of sexual harassment. This can be coupled from similar harassment from external groups, such as during the 2014 Gamergate controversy. Major investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that went unchecked by management, as well as discrimination by employers, have been brought up against Riot Games, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard in the late 2010s and early 2020s, alongside smaller studios and individual developers. However, while other entertainment industries have had similar exposure through the Me Too movement and have tried to address the symptoms of these problems industry-wide, the video game industry has yet to have its Me Too-moment, even as late as 2021.\nThere also tends to be pay-related discrimination against women in the industry. According to Gamasutra's Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made. Game designing women had the closest equity, making 96 cents for every dollar men made in the same job, while audio professional women had the largest gap, making 68% of what men in the same position made.\nIncreasing the representation of women in the video game industry required breaking a feedback loop of the apparent lack of female representation in the production of video games and in the content of video games. Efforts have been made to provide a strong STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) background for women at the secondary education level, but there are issues with tertiary education such as at colleges and universities, where game development programs tend to reflect the male-dominated demographics of the industry, a factor that may lead women with strong STEM backgrounds to choose other career goals.\nRacial.\nThere is also a significant gap in racial minorities within the video game industry; a 2019 IGDA survey found only 2% of developers considered themselves to be of African descent and 7% Hispanic, while 81% were Caucasian; in contrast, 2018 estimates from the United States Census estimate the U.S. population to be 13% of African descent and 18% Hispanic. In a 2014 and 2015 survey of job positions and salaries, the IGDA found that people of color were both underrepresented in senior management roles as well as underpaid in comparison to white developers. Further, because video game developers typically draw from personal experiences in building game characters, this diversity gap has led to few characters of racial minority to be featured as main characters within video games. Minority developers have also been harassed from external groups due to the toxic nature of the video game culture.\nThis racial diversity issue has similar ties to the gender one, and similar methods to result both have been suggested, such as improving grade school education, developing games that appeal beyond the white, male gamer stereotype, and identifying toxic behavior in both video game workplaces and online communities that perpetuate discrimination against gender and race.\nLGBT.\nIn regards to LGBT and other gender or sexual orientations, the video game industry typically shares the same demographics as with the larger population based on a 2005 IGDA survey. Those in the LGBT community do not find workplace issues with their identity, though work to improve the representation of LGBT themes within video games in the same manner as with racial minorities. However, LGBT developers have also come under the same type of harassment from external groups like women and racial minorities due to the nature of the video game culture.\nAge.\nThe industry also is recognized to have an ageism issue, discriminating against the hiring and retention of older developers. A 2016 IGDA survey found only 3% of developers were over 50 years old, while at least two-thirds were between 20 and 34; these numbers show a far lower average age compared to the U.S. national average of about 41.9 that same year. While discrimination by age in hiring practices is generally illegal, companies often target their oldest workers first during layoffs or other periods of reduction. Older developers with experience may find themselves too qualified for the types of positions that other game development companies seek given the salaries and compensations offered.\nContract workers.\nSome of the larger video game developers and publishers have also engaged contract workers through agencies to help add manpower in game development in part to alleviate crunch time from employees. Contractors are brought on for a fixed period and generally work similar hours as full-time staff members, assisting across all areas of video game development, but as contractors, do not get any benefits such as paid time-off or health care from the employer; they also are typically not credited on games that they work on for this reason. The practice itself is legal and common in other engineering and technology areas, and generally it is expected that this is meant to lead into a full-time position, or otherwise the end of the contract. But more recently, its use in the video game industry has been compared to Microsoft's past use of \"permatemp\", contract workers that were continually renewed and treated for all purposes as employees but received no benefits. While Microsoft has waned from the practice, the video game industry has adapted it more frequently. Around 10% of the workforce in video games is estimated to be from contract labor.\nUnionization.\nSimilar to other tech industries, video game developers are typically not unionized. This is a result of the industry being driven more by creativity and innovation rather than production, the lack of distinction between management and employees in the white-collar area, and the pace at which the industry moves that makes union actions difficult to plan out. However, when situations related to crunch time become prevalent in the news, there have typically been followup discussions towards the potential to form a union. A survey performed by the International Game Developers Association in 2014 found that more than half of the 2,200 developers surveyed favored unionization. A similar survey of over 4,000 game developers run by the Game Developers Conference in early 2019 found that 47% of respondents felt the video game industry should unionize.\nIn 2016, voice actors in the Screen Actors Guild\u2010American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union doing work for video games struck several major publishers, demanding better royalty payments and provisions related to the safety of their vocal performances, when their union's standard contract was up for renewal. The voice actor strike lasted for over 300 days into 2017 before a new deal was made between SAG-AFTRA and the publishers. While this had some effects on a few games within the industry, it brought to the forefront the question of whether video game developers should unionize.\nA grassroots movement, Game Workers Unite, was established around 2017 to discuss and debate issues related to unionization of game developers. The group came to the forefront during the March 2018 Game Developers Conference by holding a roundtable discussion with the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), the professional association for developers. Statements made by the IGDA's current executive director Jen MacLean relating to IGDA's activities had been seen by as anti-union, and Game Workers Unite desired to start a conversation to lay out the need for developers to unionize. In the wake of the sudden near-closure of Telltale Games in September 2018, the movement again called out for the industry to unionize. The movement argued that Telltale had not given any warning to its 250 employees let go, having hired additional staff as recently as a week prior, and left them without pensions or health-care options; it was further argued that the studio considered this a closure rather than layoffs, as to get around failure to notify required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 preceding layoffs. The situation was argued to be \"exploitive\", as Telltale had been known to force its employees to frequently work under \"crunch time\" to deliver its games. By the end of 2018, a United Kingdom trade union, Game Workers Unite UK, an affiliate of the Game Workers Unite movement, had been legally established.\nFollowing Activision Blizzard's financial report for the previous quarter in February 2019, the company said that they would be laying off around 775 employees (about 8% of their workforce) despite having record profits for that quarter. Further calls for unionization came from this news, including the AFL\u2013CIO writing an open letter to video game developers encouraging them to unionize.\nIn January 2020, Game Workers Unite and the Communications Workers of America established a new campaign to push for unionization of video game developers, the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE), in January 2020. Initial efforts for CODE were aimed to determine what approach to unionization would be best suited for the video game industry. Whereas some video game employees believe they should follow the craft-based model used by SAG-AFTRA which would unionize based on job function, others feel an industry-wide union, regardless of job position, would be better.\nStarting in 2021, several smaller game studios in the United States began efforts to unionize. These mostly involved teams doing quality assurance rather than developers. These studios included three QA studios under Blizzard Entertainment: Raven Software, Blizzard Albany, and Proletariat; and Zenimax Media's QA team. Microsoft, which had previously acquired Zenimax and announced plans to acquire Blizzard via the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, stated it supported these unionization efforts. After this acquisition, the employees of Bethesda Game Studios, part of Zenimax under Microsoft, unionized under the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in July 2024. Over 500 employees within Blizzard Entertainment's \"World of Warcraft\" division also unionized with CWA that same month. Similarly, Blizzard's \"Overwatch\" team unionized in May 2025, Raven Software, Blizzard's story and franchise development team, and Blizzard's \"Diablo\" team separately voted for unionization in August 2025, and the \"Hearthstone\" and \"Warcraft Rumble\" teams followed with their vote in October 2025. By this point, over 2000 Blizzard employees had become unionzized.\nSweden presents a unique case where nearly all parts of its labor force, including white-collar jobs such as video game development, may engage with labor unions under the Employment Protection Act often through collective bargaining agreements. Developer DICE had reached its union agreements in 2004. Paradox Interactive became one of the first major publishers to support unionization efforts in June 2020 with its own agreements to cover its Swedish employees within two labor unions Unionen and SACO. In Australia, video game developers could join other unions, but the first video game-specific union, Game Workers Unite Australia, was formed in December 2021 under Professionals Australia to become active in 2022. In Canada, in a historic move, video game workers in Edmonton unanimously voted to unionize for the first time in June 2022.\nIn January 2023, after not being credited in \"The Last of Us\" HBO adaptation, Bruce Straley called for unionization of the video game industry. He told the \"Los Angeles Times\": \"Someone who was part of the co-creation of that world and those characters isn't getting a credit or a nickel for the work they put into it. Maybe we need unions in the video game industry to be able to protect creators.\"\nAn industry-wide union, the United Video game Workers-CWA (UVA-CWA), for North American workers, was announced in March 2025 with support from the Communication Workers of America.\nZU/AM, the developers of \"Disco Elysium \", became the first video game studio in the United Kingdom, unuionizing under the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain in October 2025.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "32401", "revid": "18779361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32401", "title": "History of video games", "text": "The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes. \"Spacewar!\" was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display. The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s. The first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games were \"Computer Space\" and \"Pong\". After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture \"Pong\"'s success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game, causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation.\nBy the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the discrete transistor\u2013transistor logic circuitry of early hardware, and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS). Coupled with rapid growth in the golden age of arcade video games, including \"Space Invaders\" and \"Pac-Man\", the home console market also flourished. The 1983 video game crash in the United States was characterized by a flood of too many games, often of poor or cloned qualities, and the sector saw competition from inexpensive personal computers and new types of games being developed for them. The crash prompted Japan's video game industry to take leadership of the market, which had only suffered minor impacts from the crash. Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States in 1985, helping to rebound the failing video games sector. The latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s included video games driven by improvements and standardization in personal computers and the console war competition between Nintendo and Sega as they fought for market share in the United States. The first major handheld video game consoles appeared in the 1990s, led by Nintendo's Game Boy platform.\nIn the early 1990s, advancements in microprocessor technology gave rise to real-time 3D polygonal graphic rendering in game consoles, as well as in PCs by way of graphics cards. Optical media via CD-ROMs began to be incorporated into personal computers and consoles, including Sony's fledgling PlayStation console line, pushing Sega out of the console hardware market while diminishing Nintendo's role. By the late 1990s, the Internet also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began incorporating online elements. Microsoft entered the console hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line, fearing that Sony's PlayStation, positioned as a game console and entertainment device, would displace personal computers. While Sony and Microsoft continued to develop hardware for comparable top-end console features, Nintendo opted to focus on innovative gameplay. Nintendo developed the Wii with motion-sensing controls, which helped to draw in non-traditional players and helped to resecure Nintendo's position in the industry; Nintendo followed this same model in the release of the Nintendo Switch.\nFrom the 2000s and into the 2010s, the industry has seen a shift of demographics as mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets displaced handheld consoles, and casual gaming became an increasingly larger sector of the market, as well as a growth in the number of players from China and other areas not traditionally tied to the industry. To take advantage of these shifts, traditional revenue models were supplanted with ongoing revenue stream models such as free-to-play, freemium, and subscription-based games. As triple-A video game production became more costly and risk-averse, opportunities for more experimental and innovative independent game development grew over the 2000s and 2010s, aided by the popularity of mobile and casual gaming and the ease of digital distribution. Hardware and software technology continues to drive improvement in video games, with support for high-definition video at high framerates and for virtual and augmented reality-based games.\nEarly history (1948\u20131970).\nThe term \"video game\" was originally used only for games that sent a video signal to a screen, such as a cathode-ray tube (CRT) or oscilloscope. Over time, the definition broadened to include any interactive electronic game that displays visuals for the player. The earliest known attempt at such a game was the cathode-ray tube amusement device, patented in 1947, which simulated missile fire on an oscilloscope. However, it was never mass-produced. In 1948, Alan Turing and David Champernowne designed \"Turochamp\", a chess program, but it was too complex to run on the computers available at the time.\nIn the 1950s, games began to appear alongside early digital computers like Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). For example, Josef Kates built \"Bertie the Brain\" in 1950, a tic-tac-toe machine intended for exhibition rather than personal use. The following year, the Ferranti company demonstrated Nimrod, a computer programmed specifically to play the game of Nim. In 1952, Christopher Strachey created a \"Checkers\" game for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, inspiring Arthur Samuel to develop one of the first checkers-playing artificial intelligence programs on IBM hardware. Military and research simulations, like CARMONETTE (Combined Arms Computer Model), which modeled ground combat scenarios, were also developed, though most of these games were dismantled or forgotten once their immediate purpose was completed.\nBy the early 1950s, interactive visual games started to emerge. Sandy Douglas created \"OXO\" (1952) on the EDSAC, allowing players to play tic-tac-toe on a CRT screen. Around the same time, Strachey and Stanley Gill experimented with visual games, while the Whirlwind I computer at MIT featured an early real-time ball simulation. The University of Michigan developed a pool game using MIDSAC, one of EDSAC's successors, in 1954, which continuously updated graphics on screen. In 1958, William Higinbotham created \"Tennis for Two\" at Brookhaven National Laboratory, displaying a simplified tennis match on an oscilloscope; this is considered one of the first games created specifically for entertainment rather than research.\nIn 1962, \"Spacewar!\" was developed for the PDP-1 minicomputer at MIT by Steve Russell and colleagues. It became the first widely shared video game, circulating across universities that had PDP-1 computers. Modifications introduced features like a moving starfield, simulated gravity, and external controllers. Despite the PDP-1\u2019s high cost and rarity, \"Spacewar!\" inspired others in programming communities to create their own games. During the 1960s, other games also appeared on mainframes, including \"The Sumerian Game\" by Mabel Addis and early simulations written in general-purpose languages like BASIC. In 1966, while working at Sanders Associates, Ralph Baer began developing a television-based interactive game system. With a small team, he created the \"Brown Box\" prototype by 1968. It could run multiple games, including forms of table tennis and volleyball, directly on a TV set.\n1970s.\nMainframe computer games.\nIn the 1960s, a number of computer games were created for mainframe and minicomputer systems, but these failed to achieve wide distribution due to the continuing scarcity of computer resources, a lack of sufficiently trained programmers interested in crafting entertainment products, and the difficulty in transferring programs between computers in different geographic areas. By the end of the 1970s, however, the situation had changed drastically. The BASIC and C high-level programming languages were widely adopted during the decade, which were more accessible than earlier more technical languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL, opening up computer game creation to a larger base of users. With the advent of time-sharing, which allowed the resources of a single mainframe to be parceled out among multiple users connected to the machine by terminals, computer access was no longer limited to a handful of individuals at an institution, creating more opportunities for students to create their own games. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of the PDP-10, released by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1966, and the portable UNIX operating system, developed at Bell Labs in 1971 and released generally in 1973, created common programming environments across the country that reduced the difficulty of sharing programs between institutions. Finally, the founding of the first magazines dedicated to computing like \"Creative Computing\" (1974), the publication of the earliest program compilation books like \"101 BASIC Computer Games\" (1973), and the spread of wide-area networks such as the ARPANET allowed programs to be shared more easily across great distances. As a result, many of the mainframe games created by college students in the 1970s influenced subsequent developments in the video game industry in ways that, \"Spacewar!\" aside, the games of the 1960s did not.\nIn the arcade and on home consoles, fast-paced action and real-time gameplay were the norm in genres like racing and target shooting. On the mainframe, however, such games were generally not possible due both to the lack of adequate displays (many computer terminals continued to rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into the 1970s and even most CRT terminals could only render character-based graphics) and insufficient processing power and memory to update game elements in real time. While 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade and console hardware of the period, the need to parcel out computing resources to dozens of simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities. Thus, programmers of mainframe games focused on strategy and puzzle-solving mechanics over pure action. Notable games of the period include the tactical combat game \"Star Trek\" (1971) by Mike Mayfield, the hide-and-seek game \"Hunt the Wumpus\" (1972) by Gregory Yob, and the strategic war game \"Empire\" (1977) by Walter Bright. Perhaps the most significant game of the period was \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" (or simply \"Adventure\"), created in 1976 by Will Crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from the newly released tabletop role-playing game (RPG) \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" (D&amp;D). Expanded by Don Woods in 1977 with an emphasis on the high fantasy of J.R.R. Tolkien, \"Adventure\" established a new genre based around exploration and inventory-based puzzle solving that made the transition to personal computers in the late 1970s.\nWhile most games were created on hardware of limited graphic ability, one computer able to host more impressive games was the PLATO system developed at the University of Illinois. Intended as an educational computer, the system connected hundreds of users all over the United States via remote terminals that featured high-quality plasma displays and allowed users to interact with each other in real time. This allowed the system to host an impressive array of graphical and/or multiplayer games, including some of the earliest known computer RPGs, which were primarily derived, like \"Adventure\", from \"D&amp;D\", but unlike that game placed a greater emphasis on combat and character progression than puzzle solving. Starting with top-down dungeon crawls like \"The Dungeon\" (1975) and \"The Game of Dungeons\" (1975), more commonly referred to today by their filenames, \"pedit5\" and \"dnd\", PLATO RPGs soon transitioned to a first-person perspective with games like \"Moria\" (1975), \"Oubliette\" (1977), and \"Avatar\" (1979), which often allowed multiple players to join forces to battle monsters and complete quests together. Like \"Adventure\", these games ultimately inspired some of the earliest personal computer games.\nThe first arcade video games and home consoles.\nThe modern video game industry grew out of the concurrent development of the first arcade video game and the first home video game console in the early 1970s in the United States.\nThe arcade video game industry grew out of the pre-existing arcade game industry, which was previously dominated by electro-mechanical games (EM games). Following the arrival of Sega's EM game \"Periscope\" (1966), the arcade industry was experiencing a \"technological renaissance\" driven by \"audio-visual\" EM novelty games, establishing the arcades as a healthy environment for the introduction of commercial video games in the early 1970s. In the late 1960s, a college student Nolan Bushnell had a part-time job at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games, watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates.\nIn 1966, while working at Sanders Associates, Ralph Baer came up with an idea for an entertainment device that could be hooked up to a television monitor. Presenting this to his superiors at Sanders and getting their approval, he, along with William Harrison and William Rusch, refined Baer's concept into the \"Brown Box\" prototype of a home video game console that could play a simple table tennis game. The three patented the technology, and Sanders, not in the commercialization business, sold licenses to the patents to Magnavox to commercialize. With Baer's help, Magnavox developed the Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercial home console, in 1972.\nConcurrently, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the idea of making a coin-operated system to run \"Spacewar!\" By 1971, the two had developed \"Computer Space\" with Nutting Associates, the first arcade video game. Bushnell and Dabney struck out on their own and formed Atari. Bushnell, inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey, hired Allan Alcorn to develop an arcade version of the game, this time using discrete transistor\u2013transistor logic (TTL) electronic circuitry. Atari's \"Pong\" was released in late 1972 and is considered the first successful arcade video game. It ignited the growth of the arcade game industry in the United States from both established coin-operated game manufacturers like Williams, Chicago Coin, and the Midway subsidiary of Bally Manufacturing, and new startups such as Ramtek and Allied Leisure. Many of these were \"Pong\" clones using ball-and-paddle controls, and led to saturation of the market in 1974, forcing arcade game makers to try to innovate new games in 1975. Many of the newer companies created in the wake of \"Pong\" failed to innovate on their own and shut down, and by the end of 1975, the arcade market had fallen by about 50% based on new game sale revenues. Further, Magnavox took Atari and several other of these arcade game makers to court over violations of Baer's patents. Bushnell settled the suit for Atari, gaining perpetual rights for the patents for Atari as part of the settlement. Others failed to settle, and Magnavox won around $ in damages from these patent infringement suits before the patents expired in 1990.\nArcade video games caught on quickly in Japan due to partnerships between American and Japanese corporations that kept the Japan companies abreast of technology developments within the United States. The Nakamura Amusement Machine Manufacturing Company (Namco) partnered with Atari to import \"Pong\" into Japan in late 1973. Within the year, Taito and Sega released \"Pong\" clones in Japan by mid-1973. Japanese companies began developing novel games and exporting or licensing them through partners in 1974. Among these included Taito's \"Gun Fight\" (originally \"Western Gun\" in its Japanese release), which was licensed to Midway. Midway's version, released in 1975, was the first arcade video game to use a microprocessor rather than discrete TTL components. This innovation drastically reduced the complexity and time to design of arcade games and the number of physical components required to achieve more advanced gameplay.\nThe dedicated console market.\nThe Magnavox Odyssey never caught on with the public, due largely to the limited functionality of its primitive discrete electronic component technology. By mid-1975, large-scale integration (LSI) microchips had become inexpensive enough to be incorporated into a consumer product. In 1975, Magnavox reduced the part count of the Odyssey using a three-chip set created by Texas Instruments and released two new systems that only played ball-and-paddle games, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200. Atari, meanwhile, entered the consumer market that same year with the single-chip Home \"Pong\" system. The next year, General Instrument released a \"Pong-on-a-chip\" LSI and made it available at a low price to any interested company. Toy company Coleco Industries used this chip to create the million-selling Telstar console model series (1976\u201377).\nThese initial home video game consoles were popular, leading to a large influx of companies releasing \"Pong\" and other video game clones to satisfy consumer demand. While there were only seven companies that were releasing home consoles in 1975, there were at least 82 by 1977, with more than 160 different models that year alone that were easily documented. A large number of these consoles were created in East Asia, and it is estimated that over 500 \"Pong\"-type home console models were made during this period. As with the prior paddle-and-ball saturation in the arcade game field by 1975 due to consumer weariness, dedicated console sales dropped sharply in 1978, disrupted by the introduction of programmable systems and Handheld electronic games.\nJust as dedicated consoles were waning in popularity in the West, they briefly surged in popularity in Japan. These \"TV geemu\" were often based on licensed designs from the American companies, manufactured by television manufacturers such as Toshiba and Sharp. Notably, Nintendo entered the video game market during this period alongside its current traditional and electronic toy product lines, producing the series of Color TV-Game consoles in partnership with Mitsubishi.\nGrowth of video game arcades and the golden age.\nAfter the ball-and-paddle market saturation in 1975, game developers began looking for new ideas for games, buoyed by the ability to use programmable microprocessors rather than analog components. Taito designer Tomohiro Nishikado, who had developed \"Gun Fight\" previously, was inspired by Atari's \"Breakout\" to create a shooting-based game, \"Space Invaders\", first released in Japan in 1978. \"Space Invaders\" introduced or popularized several important concepts in arcade video games, including play regulated by lives instead of a timer or set score, gaining extra lives through accumulating points, and the tracking of the high score achieved on the machine. It was also the first game to confront the player with waves of targets that shot back at the player and the first to include background music during game play, albeit a simple four-note loop. \"Space Invaders\" was an immediate success in Japan, with some arcades created solely for \"Space Invaders\" machines. While not quite as popular in the United States, \"Space Invaders\" became a hit as Midway, serving as the North American manufacturer, moved over 60,000 cabinets in 1979.\n\"Space Invaders\" led off what is considered to be the golden age of arcade games which lasted from 1978 to 1982. Several influential and best-selling arcade games were released during this period from Atari, Namco, Taito, Williams, and Nintendo, including \"Asteroids\" (1979), \"Galaxian\" (1979), \"Defender\" (1980), \"Missile Command\" (1980), \"Tempest\" (1981), and \"Galaga\" (1981). \"Pac-Man\", released in 1980, became a popular culture icon, and a new wave of games appeared that focused on identifiable characters and alternate mechanics such as navigating a maze or traversing a series of platforms. Aside from \"Pac-Man\" and its sequel, \"Ms. Pac-Man\" (1982), the most popular games in this vein during the golden age were \"Donkey Kong\" (1981) and \"Q*bert\" (1982). Games like \"Pac-Man\", \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Q*bert\" also introduced the concept of narratives and characters to video games, which led companies to adopt these later as mascots for marketing purposes.\nAccording to trade publication \"Vending Times\", revenues generated by coin-operated video games on location in the United States jumped from $308 million in 1978 to $968 million in 1979 to $2.8 billion in 1980. As \"Pac Man\" ignited an even larger video game craze and attracted more female players to arcades, revenues jumped again to $4.9 billion in 1981. According to trade publication \"Play Meter\", by July 1982, total coin-op collections peaked at $8.9 billion, of which $7.7 billion came from video games. Dedicated video game arcades grew during the golden age, with the number of arcades (locations with at least ten arcade games) more than doubling between July 1981 and July 1983 from over 10,000 to just over 25,000. These figures made arcade games the most popular entertainment medium in the country, far surpassing both pop music (at $4 billion in sales per year) and Hollywood films ($3 billion).\nIntroduction of cartridge-based home consoles.\nDevelopment costs of dedicated game hardware for arcade and home consoles based on discrete component circuitry and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with only limited consumer lifespans drove engineers to find alternatives. Microprocessors had dropped far enough in price by 1975 to make these a viable option for developing programmable consoles that could load in game software from a form of swappable media.\nThe Fairchild Channel F by Fairchild Camera and Instrument was released in 1976. It is the first home console to use programmable ROM cartridges - allowing players to swap games - as well as being the first home console to use a microprocessor which reads instructions from the ROM cartridge. Atari and Magnavox followed suit in 1977 and 1978, respectively, with the release of the Atari Video Computer System (VCS, later known as the Atari 2600) and the Magnavox Odyssey 2, both systems also introducing the use of cartridges. As to complete the Atari VCS quickly, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications $, providing the necessary cash infusion to complete the system's design by the end of 1977. The initial market for these new consoles were initially modest as consumers were still wary after the saturation of dedicated home consoles. However, there was still newfound interest in video games, and new players were drawn to the market, such as Mattel Electronics with the Intellivision. In contrast to the dedicated home \"Pong\" consoles, programmable cartridge-based consoles had a higher barrier of entry with the costs of research &amp; development and large-scale production, and fewer manufacturers entered the market during this period.\nThis new line of consoles had its breakthrough moment when Atari obtained a license from Taito to create the Atari VCS version of the arcade hit \"Space Invaders\", which was released in 1980. \"Space Invaders\" quadrupled sales of the Atari VCS, making it the first \"killer app\" in the video game industry, and the first video game to sell over one million copies and eventually sold over 2.5 million by 1981. Atari's consumer sales almost doubled from $119 million to nearly $204 million in 1980 and then exploded to over $841 million in 1981, while sales across the entire video game industry in the United States rose from $185.7 million in 1979 to just over $1 billion in 1981. Through a combination of conversions of its own arcade games like \"Missile Command\" and \"Asteroids\" and licensed conversions like \"Defender\", Atari took a commanding lead in the industry, with an estimated 65% market share of the worldwide industry by dollar volume by 1981. Mattel settled into second place with roughly 15%-20% of the market, while Magnavox ran a distant third, and Fairchild exited the market entirely in 1979.\nAnother critical development during this period was the emergence of third-party developers. Atari management did not appreciate the special talent required to design and program a game and treated them like typical software engineers of the period, who were not generally credited for their work or given royalties; this led to Warren Robinett secretly programming his name in one of the earliest Easter eggs into his game \"Adventure\". Atari's policies drove four of the company's programmers, David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead, to resign and form their own company Activision in 1979, using their knowledge of developing for the Atari VCS to make and publish their own games. Atari sued to stop Activision's activities, but the companies settled out of court, with Activision agreeing to pay a portion of their game sales as a license fee to Atari. Another group of Atari and Mattel developers left and formed Imagic in 1981, following Activision's model.\nAtari's dominance of the market was challenged by Coleco's ColecoVision in 1982. As \"Space Invaders\" had done for the Atari VCS, Coleco developed a licensed version of Nintendo's arcade hit \"Donkey Kong\" as a bundled game with the system. While the Colecovision only had 17% of the hardware market in 1982 compared to the Atari VCS' share of 58%, it outsold Atari's newer console, the Atari 5200.\nA few games from this period have been considered milestones in the history of video games, and some of the earliest in popular genres. Robinett's \"Adventure\" was inspired from the text adventure \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", and is considered one of the first graphic adventure and action-adventure games, and first cartridge fantasy-themed game. Activision's \"Pitfall!\", beside being one of the more successful third-party games, also established the foundation of side-scrolling platform games. \"Utopia\" for the Intellivision was the first city-building game and considered one of the first real-time strategy games.\nEarly hobbyist computer games.\nThe fruit of retail development in early video games appeared mainly in video arcades and home consoles, but at the same time, there was a growing market in home computers. Such home computers were initially a hobbyist activity, with minicomputers such as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI 8080 released in the early 1970s. Groups like the Homebrew Computer Club in Menlo Park, California envisioned how to create new hardware and software from these minicomputer systems that could eventually reach the home market. Affordable home computers began appearing in the late 1970s with the arrival of the \"1977 Trinity\": the Commodore PET, the Apple II, and the TRS-80. Most shipped with a variety of pre-made games as well as the BASIC programming language, allowing their owners to program simple games.\nHobbyist groups for the new computers soon formed and PC game software followed. Soon many of these games\u2014at first clones of mainframe classics such as \"Star Trek\", and then later ports or clones of popular arcade games such as \"Space Invaders\", \"Frogger\", \"Pac-Man\" (see \"Pac-Man\" clones) and \"Donkey Kong\"\u2014were being distributed through a variety of channels, such as printing the game's source code in books (such as David Ahl's \"BASIC Computer Games\"), magazines (\"Electronic Games\" and \"Creative Computing\"), and newsletters, which allowed users to type in the code for themselves.\nWhereas hobbyist programming in the United States was seen as a pastime while more players flocked to video game consoles, such \"bedroom coders\" in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe looked for ways to profit from their work. Programmers distributed their works through the physical mailing and selling of floppy disks, cassette tapes, and ROM cartridges. Possibly the first computer game to be sold commercially was \"Microchess\" in 1976 by Peter R. Jennings, who also started possibly the first computer game publishing company, Microware. Soon a small cottage industry was formed, with amateur programmers selling disks in plastic bags put on the shelves of local shops or sent through the mail.\nMainframe and minicomputer games were still largely developed by students and others during this period using the more powerful languages afforded on these systems. A team of MIT students, Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling, were inspired by \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" to create the text adventure game \"Zork\" across 1977 and 1979, and later formed Infocom to republish it commercially in 1980. The first graphical adventure games from Sierra On-Line such as \"Mystery House\", using simple graphics alongside text, also emerged around the same time. \"Rogue\", the namesake of the roguelike genre, was developed in 1980 by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy who wanted a way to randomize the gameplay of \"Colossal Cave Adventure\".\nFirst handheld LED/VFD/LCD games.\nHandheld electronic games, using all computerized components but typically using LED or VFD lights for display, first emerged in the early 1970s. LCD displays became inexpensive for consumer products by the mid-1970s and replaced LED and VFD in such games, due to their lower power usage and smaller size. Most of these games were limited to a single game due to the simplicity of the display. Companies like Mattel Electronics, Coleco, Entex Industries, Bandai, and Tomy made numerous electronics games over the 1970s and early 1980s.\nCoupled with inexpensive microprocessors, handheld electronic games paved the way for the earliest handheld video game systems by the late 1970s. In 1979, Milton Bradley Company released the first handheld system using interchangeable cartridges, Microvision, which used a built-in LCD matrix screen. While the handheld received modest success in its first year of production, the lack of games, screen size and video game crash of 1983 brought about the system's quick demise.\nIn 1980, Nintendo released the first of its Game &amp; Watch line, handheld electronic games using LCD screens. Game &amp; Watch spurred dozens of other game and toy companies to make their own portable games, many of which were copies of Game &amp; Watch games or adaptations of popular arcade games. Tiger Electronics borrowed this concept of videogaming with cheap, affordable handhelds and still produces games on this model to the present day.\n1980s.\nThe video games industry experienced its first major growing pains in the early 1980s; the lure of the market brought many companies with little experience to try to capitalize on video games, and contributors towards the industry's crash in 1983, decimating the North American market. In the wake of the crash, Japanese companies became the leaders in the industry, and as the industry began to recover, the first major publishing houses appeared, maturing the industry to prevent a similar crash in the future.\nVideo game crash of 1983.\nActivision's success as a third-party developer for the Atari VCS and other home consoles inspired other third-party development firms to emerge in the early 1980s; by 1983, at least 100 different companies claimed to be developing software for the Atari VCS. This had been projected to led to a glut in sales, with only 10% of games producing 75% of sales for 1983 based on 1982 estimates. Further, there were questions on the quality of these games. While some of these firms hired experts in game design and programming to build quality games, most were staffed by novice programmers backed by venture capitalists without experience in the area. As a result, the Atari VCS market became watered down with large quantities of poor quality games. These games did not sell well, and retailers discounted their prices to try to get rid of their inventory. This further impacted sales of high-quality games, since consumers would be drawn to purchase bargain-bin priced games over quality games marked at a regular price.\nAt the end of 1983, several factors, including a market flooded with poor-quality games and loss of publishing control, the lack of consumer confidence in market leader Atari due to the poor performance of several high-profile games, and home computers emerging as a new and more advanced platform for games at nearly the same cost as video game consoles, caused the North American video game industry to experience a severe downturn. The 1983 crash bankrupted several North American companies that produced consoles and games from late 1983 to early 1984. The $ U.S. market in 1983 dropped to $ by 1985, while the global video game market estimated at $ in 1982 fell to $ by 1985. Warner Communications sold off Atari to Jack Tramiel in 1984, while Magnavox and Coleco exited the industry.\nThe crash had some minor effects on Japanese companies with American partners impacted by the crash, but as most of the Japanese companies involved in video games at this point have long histories, they were able to weather the short-term effects. The crash set the stage for Japan to emerge as the leader in the video game industry for the next several years, particularly with Nintendo's introduction of the rebranded Famicom, the Nintendo Entertainment System, back into the U.S. and other Western regions in 1985, maintaining strict publishing control to avoid the same factors that led to the 1983 crash.\nThe rise of computer games.\nSecond wave of home computers.\nFollowing the success of the Apple II and Commodore PET in the late 1970s, a series of cheaper and incompatible home computers emerged in the early 1980s. This second batch included the VIC-20 and Commodore 64; Sinclair ZX80, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum; NEC PC-8000, PC-6001, PC-88 and PC-98; Sharp X1 and X68000; Fujitsu FM Towns, and Atari 8-bit computers, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, and MSX series. Many of these systems found favor in regional markets.\nThese new systems helped catalyze both the home computer and game markets, by raising awareness of computing and gaming through their competing advertising campaigns. This was most notable in the United Kingdom where the BBC encouraged computer education and backed the development of the BBC Micro with Acorn. Between the BBC Micro, the ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore 64, a new wave of \"bedroom coders\" emerged in the United Kingdom and started selling their own software for these platforms, alongside those developed by small professional teams. Small publishing and distribution companies such as Acornsoft and Mastertronic were established to help these individuals and teams to create and sell copies of their games. Ubisoft started out as such a distributor in France in the mid-1980s before they branched out into video game development and publishing. In Japan, systems like the MSX and the NEC PC line were popular, and several development houses emerged developing arcade clones and new games for these platforms. These companies included HAL Laboratory, Square, and Enix, which all later became some of the first third-party developers for the Nintendo Famicom after its release in 1983.\nGames from this period include the first ' by Richard Garriott and the first ' from Sir-Tech, both fundamental role-playing games on the personal computer. The space trading and combat simulation game \"Elite\" by David Braben and Ian Bell introduced a number of new graphics and gameplay features, and is considered one of the first open world and sandbox games. Early installments in a number of long-running franchises such as \"Castlevania\", \"Metal Gear\", \"Bubble Bobble\", \"Gradius\", as well as ports of console games and visual novels appeared on Japanese platforms like the PC88, X68000, and MSX.\nGames dominated home computers' software libraries. A 1984 compendium of reviews of Atari 8-bit software used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all others. By that year the computer game market took over from the console market following the crash of that year; computers offered equal ability and, since their simple design allowed games to take complete command of the hardware after power-on, they were nearly as simple to start playing with as consoles.\nLater in the 1980s the next wave of personal computers emerged, with the Amiga and Atari ST in 1985. Both computers had more advanced graphics and sound capabilities than the prior generation of computers, and made for key platforms for video game development, particularly in the United Kingdom. The bedroom coders had since formed development teams and started producing games for these systems professionally. These included Bullfrog Productions, founded by Peter Molyneux, with the release of \"Populous\" (the first such god game), DMA Design with \"Lemmings\", Psygnosis with \"Shadow of the Beast\", and Team17 with \"Worms\".\nIBM PC compatible.\nWhile the second wave of home computer systems flourished in the early 1980s, they remained as closed hardware systems from each other; while programs written in BASIC or other simple languages could be easily copied over, more advanced programs would require porting to meet the hardware requirements of the target system. Separately, IBM released the first of its IBM Personal Computers (IBM PC) in 1981, shipping with the MS-DOS operating system. The IBM PC was designed with an open architecture to allow new components to be added to it, but IBM intended to maintain control on manufacturing with the proprietary BIOS developed for the system. As IBM struggled to meet demand for its PC, other computer manufacturers such as Compaq worked to reverse engineer the BIOS and created IBM PC compatible computers by 1983. By 1987, IBM PC compatible computers dominated the home and business computer market.\nFrom a video games standpoint, the IBM PC compatible invigorated further game development. A software developer could write to meet IBM PC compatible specifications and not worry about which make or model was being used. While the initial IBM PC supported only monochromatic text games, game developers nevertheless ported mainframe and other simple text games to the PC, such as Infocom with \"Zork\". IBM introduced video display controllers such as the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) (1981), the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) (1984) and the Video Graphics Array (VGA) (1987) that expanded the computer's ability to display color graphics, though even with the VGA, these still lagged behind those of the Amiga. The first dedicated sound cards for IBM PC compatibles were released starting in 1987, which provided digital sound conversion input and output far exceeding the computer's internal speakers, and with Creative Labs' Sound Blaster in 1989, the ability to plug in a game controller or similar device.\nIn 2008, Sid Meier listed the IBM PC as one of the three most important innovations in the history of video games. The advancement in graphic and sound capabilities of the IBM PC compatible led to several influential games from this period. Numerous games that were already made for the earlier home computers were later ported to IBM PC compatible system to take advantage of the larger consumer base, including the \"Wizardry\" and \"Ultima\" series, with future installments released for the IBM PC. Sierra On-Line's first graphical adventure games launched with the \"King's Quest\" series. The first \"SimCity\" game by Maxis was released in 1989.\nThe Apple Macintosh also arrived at this time. In contrast to the IBM PC, Apple maintained a more closed system on the Macintosh, creating a system based around a graphical user interface (GUI)-driven operating system. As a result, it did not have the same market share as the IBM PC compatible, but still had a respectable software library including video games, typically ports from other systems.\nThe first major video game publishers arose during the 1980s, primarily supporting personal computer games on both IBM PC compatible games and the popular earlier systems along with some console games. Among the major publishers formed at this time included Electronic Arts, and Broderbund, while Sierra On-Line expanded its own publishing capabilities for other developers. Activision, still recovering from the financial impacts of the 1983 video game crash, expanded out to include other software properties for the office, rebranding itself as Mediagenic until 1990.\nEarly online games.\nDial-up bulletin board systems were popular in the 1980s, and sometimes used for online gaming. The earliest such systems were in the late 1970s and early 1980s and had a crude plain-text interface. Later systems made use of terminal-control codes (the so-called ANSI art, which included the use of IBM-PC-specific characters not part of an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard) to get a pseudo-graphical interface. Some BBSs offered access to various games which were playable through such an interface, ranging from text adventures to gambling games like blackjack (generally played for \"points\" rather than real money). On some multiuser BBSs (where more than one person could be online at once), there were games allowing users to interact with one another.\nSuperSet Software created \"Snipes\", a text-mode networked computer game in 1983 to test a new IBM Personal Computer\u2013based computer network and demonstrate its abilities. \"Snipes\" is officially credited as being the original inspiration for NetWare. It is believed to be the first network game ever written for a commercial personal computer and is recognized alongside 1974 game \"Maze War\" (a networked multiplayer maze game for several research machines) and \"Spasim\" (a 3D multiplayer space simulation for time shared mainframes) as the precursor to multiplayer games such as 1987's \"MIDI Maze\", and \"Doom\" in 1993. In 1995, iDoom (later Kali.net) was created for games that only allowed local network play to connect over the internet. Other services such as Kahn, TEN, Mplayer, and Heat.net soon followed. These services ultimately became obsolete when game producers began including their own online software such as Battle.net, WON and later Steam.\nThe first user interfaces were plain-text\u2014similar to BBSs\u2014but they operated on large mainframe computers, permitting larger numbers of users to be online at once. By the end of the decade, inline services had fully graphical environments using software specific to each personal computer platform. Popular text-based services included CompuServe, The Source, and GEnie, while platform-specific graphical services included PlayNET and Quantum Link for the Commodore 64, AppleLink for the Apple II and Macintosh, and PC Link for the IBM PC\u2014all of which were run by the company which eventually became America Online\u2014and a competing service, Prodigy. Interactive games were a feature of these services, though until 1987 they used text-based displays, not graphics.\nMeanwhile, schools and other institutions gained access to ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, in the mid-1980s. While the ARPANET connections were intended for research purposes, students explored ways to use this connectivity for video games. \"Multi-User Dungeon\" (\"MUD\") originally was developed by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at the University of Essex in 1978 as a multiplayer game but limited to the school's mainframe system, but was adapted to use ARPANET when the school gained access to it in 1981, making it the first internet-connected game, and the first such MUD and an early title of massively multiplayer online games.\nThe home console recovery.\n8-bit consoles.\nWhile the 1983 video game crash devastated the United States market, the Japanese video game sector remained unscathed. That year, Nintendo introduced the Famicom (short for Family Computer), while newcomer Sega used its arcade game background to design the SG-1000. The Famicom quickly became a commercial success in Japan, with 2.5 million consoles sold by the start of 1985. Nintendo wanted to introduce the system into the weak United States market but recognized the market was still struggling from the 1983 crash and video games still had a negative perception there. Working with its Nintendo of America division, Nintendo rebranded the Famicom as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), giving it the appearance of a video cassette recorder rather than a toy-like device, and launched the system in the United States in 1985 with accessories like R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) to make the system appear more sophisticated than prior home consoles. The NES revitalized the U.S. video game market, and by 1989, the U.S. market has resurged to $. Over 35 million NES systems were sold in the U.S. through its lifetime, with nearly 62 million units sold globally.\nBesides revitalizing the U.S. market, the Famicom/NES console had a number of other long-standing impacts on the video game industry. Nintendo used the razor and blades model to sell the console at near manufacturing cost while profiting from sales of games. Because games sales were critical to Nintendo, it initially controlled all game production, but at requests from companies like Namco and Hudson Soft, Nintendo allowed third-party developers to create games for the consoles, but strictly controlled the manufacturing process, limited these companies to five games per year, and required a 30% licensing fee per game sale, a figure that has been used throughout console development to the present. Nintendo's control of Famicom games led to a bootleg market of unauthorized games from Asian countries. When the NES launched, Nintendo took the lessons it learned from its own bootleg problems with the Famicom, and from the oversaturation of the U.S. market that led to the 1983 crash, and created the 10NES lockout system for NES games that required a special chip to be present in cartridges to be usable on NES systems. The 10NES helped to curb, though did not eliminate, the bootleg market for NES games. Nintendo of America also created the \"Nintendo Seal of Approval\" to mark games officially licensed by Nintendo and dissuade consumers from purchasing unlicensed third-party games, a symptom of the 1983 crash. Within the United States, Nintendo of America set up a special telephone help line to provide players with help with more difficult games and launched \"Nintendo Power\" magazine to provide tips and tricks as well as news on upcoming Nintendo games.\nSega's SG-1000 did not fare as well against the Famicom in Japan, but the company continued to refine it, releasing Sega Mark III (also known as the Master System) in 1985. Whereas Nintendo had more success in Japan and the United States, Sega's Mark III sold well in Europe, Oceania, and Brazil.\nNumerous fundamental video game franchises got their start during the Famicom/NES and Mark III/Master System period, mostly out of Japanese development companies. While Mario had already appeared in \"Donkey Kong\" and the Game &amp; Watch and arcade game \"Mario Bros.\", \"Super Mario Bros.\", debuting in 1985, established Mario as Nintendo's mascot as well as the first of the \"Super Mario\" franchise. Sega also introduced its first mascot characters, the Opa-Opa ship from \"Fantasy Zone\" in 1986 and later replaced by Alex Kidd via \"Alex Kidd in Miracle World\" in 1986, though neither gained the popular recognition that Mario had obtained. Other key Nintendo franchises were born out of the games \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"Metroid\", both released in 1986. The formulative center of turn-based computer role-playing games were launched with \"Dragon Quest\" (1986) from Chunsoft and Enix, \"Final Fantasy\" (1987) from Square, and \"Phantasy Star\" (1987) from Sega. Capcom's \"Mega Man\" (1987), and Konami's \"Castlevania\" (1986) and \"Metal Gear\" (1987) also have ongoing franchises, with \"Metal Gear\" also considered to be the first mainstream stealth game.\nWith Nintendo's dominance, Japan became the epicenter of the video game market, as many of the former American manufacturers had exited the market by the end of the 1980s. At the same time, software developers from the home computer side recognized the strength of the consoles, and companies like Epyx, Electronic Arts, and LucasArts began devoting their attention to developing console games By 1989 the market for cartridge-based console games was more than $2 billion, while that for disk-based computer games was less than $300 million.\n16-bit consoles.\nNEC released its PC Engine in 1987 in Japan, rebranded as the TurboGrafx-16 in North America. While the CPU was still an 8-bit system, the TurboGrafx-16 used a 16-bit graphics adapter, and NEC chose to heavily rely on marketing the system as a \"16 bit\" system to differentiate it from the 8-bit NES. This ploy led to the use of processor bit size as a key factor in marketing video game consoles over the next decade, a period known as the \"bit wars\".\nSega released its next console, the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, and rebranded as the Sega Genesis for its North American launch in 1989. Sega wanted to challenge the NES's dominance in the United States with the Genesis, and the initial campaign focused on the 16-bit power of the Genesis over the NES as well as a new line of sports games developed for the console. Failing to make a significant dent in NES' dominance, Sega hired Tom Kalinske to president of Sega of America to run a new campaign. Among Kalinske's changes was a significant price reduction in the console, and the bundling of Sega's newest game \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", featuring Sega's newest mascot of the same name, with the console. Kalinske's changes gave Genesis the edge over the NES by 1991 and led off the start of a console war between Sega and Nintendo. Nintendo's 16-bit console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) struggled on its initial launch in the United States due to the strength of the Genesis. This console war between Sega and Nintendo lasted until 1994 when Sony Computer Entertainment disrupted both companies with the release of the PlayStation.\nAmong other aspects of the console war between Sega and Nintendo, this period brought a revolution in sports video games. While these games had existed since the first arcade and console games, their limited graphics required gameplay to be highly simplified. When Sega of America first introduced the Genesis to the United States, it had gotten naming rights from high-profile people in the various sports, such as \"Pat Riley Basketball\" and \"Joe Montana Football\", but the games still lacked any complexity. Electronic Arts, under Trip Hawkins, were keen to make a more realistic football game for the Genesis which had the computation capabilities for this, but did not want to pay the high licensing fees that Sega were asking for developing on the Genesis. They were able to secure naming rights for John Madden and reverse engineer the Genesis as to be able to produce \"John Madden Football\", one of the first major successful sports games. Electronic Arts subsequently focused heavily on sports games, expanding into other sports like basketball, hockey and golf.\nSNK's Neo-Geo was the most costly console by a wide margin when released in 1990. The Neo-Geo used similar hardware as SNK's arcade machines, giving its games a quality better than other 16-bit consoles, but the system was commercially non-viable. The Neo-Geo was notably the first home console with support for memory cards, allowing players to save their progress in a game, not only at home but also shared with compatible Neo-Geo arcade games.\n1990s.\nThe 1990s were a decade of marked innovation in video games. It was a decade of transition from raster graphics to 3D graphics and gave rise to several genres of video games including first-person shooter, real-time strategy, and MMO. Handheld games become more popular throughout the decade, thanks in part to the release of the Game Boy in 1989. Arcade games experienced a resurgence in the early-to-mid-1990s, followed by a decline in the late 1990s as home consoles became more common.\nAs arcade games declined, however, the home video game industry matured into a more mainstream form of entertainment in the 1990s, but their video games also became more and more controversial because of their violent nature, especially in games of \"Mortal Kombat\", \"Night Trap\", and \"Doom\", leading to the formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and their rating games by signing them their ESRB ratings since 1994. Major developments of the 1990s include the popularizing of 3D computer graphics using polygons (initially in arcades, followed by home consoles and computers), and the start of a larger consolidation of publishers, higher budget games, increased size of production teams, and collaborations with both the music and motion picture industries. Examples of this include Mark Hamill's involvement with \"\", the introduction of QSound with arcade system boards such as Capcom's CP System II, and the high production budgets of games such as Squaresoft's \"Final Fantasy VII\" and Sega's \"Shenmue\".\nTransition to optical media.\nBy end of the 1980s, console games were distributed on ROM cartridges, while PC games shipped on floppy disks, formats that had limitations in storage capacity. Optical media, and specifically the CD-ROM, had been first introduced in the mid-1980s for music distribution and by the early 1990s, both the media and CD drives had become inexpensive to be incorporated into consumer computing devices, including for both home consoles and computers. Besides offering more capacity for gameplay content, optical media made it possible to include long video segments into games, such as full motion video, or animated or pre-rendered cutscenes, allowing for more narrative elements to be added to games.\nPrior to the 1990s, some arcade games explored the use of laserdiscs, the most notable being \"Dragon's Lair\" in 1983. These games are considered as interactive movies and used full motion video from the laserdisc, prompting the player to respond via controls at the right time to continue the game. While these games were popular in the early 1980s, the prohibitive cost of laserdisc technology at the time limited their success. When optical media technology matured and dropped in price by the 1990s, new laserdisc arcade games emerged, such as \"Mad Dog McCree\" in 1990. Pioneer Corporation released the LaserActive game console in 1993 that used only laserdiscs, with expansion add-ons to play games from the Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 library, but with a base console price of $ and add-ons at $, the console did not perform well.\nFor consoles, optical media were cheaper to produce than ROM cartridges, and batches of CD-ROMs could be produced in a week while cartridges could take two to three months to assemble, in addition to the larger capacity. Add-ons were made for the 16-bit consoles to use CD media, including the PC Engine and the Mega Drive. Other manufacturers made consoles with dual-media, such as NEC's TurboDuo. Philips launched the CD-i in 1990, a console using only optical media, but the unit had limited gaming capabilities and had a limited game library. Nintendo had similarly worked with Sony to develop a CD-based SNES, known as the Super NES CD-ROM, but this deal fell through just prior to its public announcement, and as a result, Sony went on to develop to the PlayStation console released in 1994, that exclusively used optical media. Sony was able to capitalize on how the Japanese market handled game sales in Japan for the PlayStation, by producing only limited numbers of any new CD-ROM game with the ability to rapidly produce new copies of a game should it prove successful, a factor that could not easily be realized with ROM cartridges where due to how fast consumers' tastes changed, required nearly all cartridges expected to sell to be produced upfront. This helped Sony overtake Nintendo and Sega in the 1990s. A key PlayStation game that adapted to the CD format was \"Final Fantasy VII\", released in 1997; Square's developers wanted to transition the series from the series' 2D presentation to using 3D models, and though the series had been exclusive to Nintendo consoles previously, Square determined it would be impractical to use cartridges for distribution while the PlayStation's CD-ROM gave them the space for all the desired content including pre-rendered cutscenes. \"Final Fantasy VII\" became a key game, as it expanded the idea of console role-playing games to console game consumers. Since the PlayStation, all home gaming consoles have relied on optical media for physical game distribution, outside the Nintendo 64 and Switch.\nOn the PC side, CD drives were initially available as peripherals for computers before becoming standard components within PCs. CD-ROM technology had been available as early as 1989, with Cyan Worlds' \"The Manhole\" being one of the first games distributed on the medium. While CD-ROMs served as a better means to distribute larger games, the medium caught on with the 1993 releases of Cyan's \"Myst\" and Trilobyte's \"The 7th Guest\", adventure games that incorporated full motion video segments among fixed pre-rendered scenes, incorporating the CD-ROM medium into the game itself. Both games were considered killer apps to help standardize the CD-ROM format for PCs.\nIntroduction of 3D graphics.\nIn addition to the transition to optical media, the industry as a whole had a major shift toward real-time 3D computer graphics across games during the 1990s. There had been a number of arcade games that used simple wireframe vector graphics to simulate 3D, such as \"Battlezone\", \"Tempest\", and \"Star Wars\". A unique challenge in 3D computer graphics is that real-time rendering typically requires floating-point calculations, which until the 1990s, most video game hardware was not well-suited for. Instead, many games simulated 3D effects such as by using parallax rendering of different background layers, scaling of sprites as they moved towards or away from the player's view, or other rendering methods such as the SNES's Mode 7. These tricks to simulate 3D-rendeder graphics through 2D systems are generally referred to as 2.5D graphics.\nTrue real-time 3D rendering using polygons were soon popularized by Yu Suzuki's Sega AM2 games \"Virtua Racing\" (1992) and \"Virtua Fighter\" (1993), both running on the Sega Model 1 arcade system board; some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation video game console credit \"Virtua Fighter\" as inspiration for the PlayStation's 3D graphics hardware. According to SCE's former producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a 2D-focused hardware, and it wasn't until the success of \"Virtua Fighter\" in the arcades that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D-focused hardware. Texture mapping and texture filtering were soon popularized by 3D racing and fighting games.\nHome video game consoles such as the PlayStation, the Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64 also became able to produce texture-mapped 3D graphics. Nintendo had already released \"Star Fox\" in 1993 which included the Super FX graphics co-processor chip built into the game cartridge to support polygonal rendering for the SNES, and the Nintendo 64 included a graphics coprocessor on the console directly.\nOn personal computers, John Carmack and John Romero of id Software had been experimenting with real-time rendering of 3D games through \"Hovertank 3D\" and \"Catacomb 3-D\". These led to the release of \"Wolfenstein 3D\" in 1992, considered to be the original first-person shooter as it rendered the game's world fast enough to keep up with the player's movements. However, at this point, \"Wolfenstein 3D\"'s maps were restricted to a single flat level. Improvements would come with \"Ultima Underworld\" from Blue Sky Productions, which included floors of different heights and ramps, which took longer to render but was considered acceptable in the role-playing game, and id's \"Doom\", adding lighting effects among other features, but still with limitations that maps were effectively two-dimensional and with most enemies and objects represented by sprites in-game. id had created one of the first game engines that separated the content from the gameplay and rendering layers, and licensed this engine to other developers, resulting in games such as \"Heretic\" and \"\", while other game developers built their own engines based on the concepts of the \"Doom\" engine, such as \"Duke Nukem 3D\" and \"Marathon\". In 1996, id's \"Quake\" was the first computer game with a true 3D game engine with in-game character and object models, and as with the \"Doom\" engine, id licensed the \"Quake\" engine, leading to a further growth in first-person shooters. By 1997, the first consumer dedicated 3D graphics cards were available on the market driven by the demand for first-person shooters, and numerous 3D game engines were created in the years that followed, including Unreal Engine, GoldSrc, and CryEngine, and establishing 3D as the new standard in most computer video games.\nResurgence and decline of arcades.\nThe 1991 release of Capcom's \"Street Fighter II\" popularized competitive one-on-one fighting games. Its success led to a wave of other popular fighting games, such as \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"The King of Fighters\". Sports games such as \"NBA Jam\" also briefly became popular in arcades during this period.\nFurther drawing players from arcades were the latest home consoles which were now capable of playing \"arcade-accurate\" games, including the latest 3D games. Increasing numbers of players waited for popular arcade games to be ported to consoles rather than pumping coins into arcade kiosks. This trend increased with the introduction of more realistic peripherals for computer and console game systems such as force feedback aircraft joysticks and racing wheel/pedal kits, which allowed home systems to approach some of the realism and immersion formerly limited to the arcades. To remain relevant, arcade manufacturers such as Sega and Namco continued pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics beyond what was possible in homes. \"Virtua Fighter 3\" for the Sega Model 3, for instance, stood out for having real-time 3D graphics approaching the quality of CGI full motion video (FMV) at the time. Likewise, Namco released the Namco System 23 to rival the Model 3. By 1998, however, Sega's new console, the Dreamcast, could produce 3D graphics on-par with the Sega Naomi arcade machine. After producing the more powerful Hikaru board in 1999 and Naomi 2 in 2000, Sega eventually stopped manufacturing custom arcade system boards, with their subsequent arcade boards being based on either consoles or commercial PC components.\nAs patronage for arcades declined, many were forced to close down by the late 1990s and early 2000s. Classic coin-operated games had largely become the province of dedicated hobbyists and as a tertiary attraction for some businesses, such as movie theaters, batting cages, miniature golf courses, and arcades attached to game stores such as F.Y.E. The gap left by the old corner arcades was partly filled by large amusement centers dedicated to providing clean, safe environments and costly game control systems unavailable to home users. These newer arcade games offer driving or other sports games with specialized cockpits integrated into the arcade machine, rhythm games requiring unique controllers like \"Guitar Freaks\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution\", and path-based light gun shooting gallery games like \"Time Crisis\". Arcade establishments expanded out to include other entertainment options, such as food and drink, such as the adult-oriented Dave &amp; Buster's and GameWorks franchises, while Chuck E. Cheese's is a similar type of business for families and young children.\nHandhelds come of age.\nIn 1989, Nintendo released the cartridge-based Game Boy, the first major handheld game console since the Microvision 10 years earlier. Included with the system was \"Tetris\", which became one of the best-selling video games of all time, drawing many that would not normally play video games to the handheld. Several rival handhelds made their debut in the early 1990s, including the Game Gear and Atari Lynx (the first handheld with color LCD display). Although these systems were more technologically advanced and intended to match the performance of home consoles, they were hampered by higher battery consumption and less third-party developer support. While some of the other systems remained in production until the mid-1990s, the Game Boy and its successive incarnations, the Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, were virtually unchallenged for dominance in the handheld market through the 1990s. The Game Boy family also introduced the first installments in the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series with \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\", which remains one of the best-selling video game franchises for Nintendo.\nComputer games.\nWith the introduction of 3D graphics and a stronger emphasis on console games, smaller developers, particularly those working on personal computers, were typically shunned by publishers as they had become risk-averse. Shareware, a new method of distributing games from these smaller teams, came out of the early 1990s. Typically a shareware game could be requested by a consumer, which would give them a portion of the game for free outside of shipping charges. If the consumer liked the game, they could then pay for the full game. This model was later expanded to basically include the \"demo\" version of a game on the insert CD-ROM media for gaming magazines, and then later as digital downloads from various sites like Tucows. id Software is credited with successfully implementing the idea for both \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\", which was later used by Apogee (now 3D Realms), Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games).\nSeveral key genres were established during this period. \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\" are the formative games of the first-person shooter (FPS); the genre itself had gone by \"\"Doom\" clones\" until about 2000 when FPS became the more popular term. Graphic adventure games rose to prominence during this period; including the forementioned \"Myst\" and \"The 7th Guest\", several of LucasArts adventure games including the \"Monkey Island\" series. However, the adventure game genre was considered dead by the end of the 1990s due to the rising popularity of the FPS and other action genres. The first immersive sims, games that gave the player more agency and choices through flexible game systems, came along after the rise of FPS games, with games like ' and '. \"Thief\" also expanded the idea of stealth games and created the idea of \"first person sneaker\" games where combat was less a focus.\nReal-time strategy games also grew in popularity in 1990s, with seminal games \"Dune II\", \"\" and \"Command &amp; Conquer\". The first 4X (short for \"Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate\") strategy games also emerged during this decade, popularized by \"Sid Meyer's Civilization\" in 1991. \"Alone in the Dark\" in 1992 established many elements of the survival horror genre that were in the console game \"Resident Evil\". Simulation games became popular, including those from Maxis starting with \"SimCity\" in 1989, and which culminated with \"The Sims\", which was first released in early 2000.\nOnline connectivity in computer games has become increasingly important. Building on the growing popularity of the text-based MUDs of the 1980s, graphical MUDs like \"Habitat\" used simple graphical interfaces alongside text to visualize the game experience. The first massively multiplayer online role-playing games adapted the new 3D graphics approach to create virtual worlds on screen, starting with \"Meridian 59\" in 1996 and popularized by the success of \"Ultima Online\" in 1997 and \"EverQuest\" and \"Asheron's Call\" in 1999. Online connective play also became important in genres like FPS and RTS, allowing players to connect to human opponents over phone and Internet connectivity. Some companies have created clients to help with connectivity, such as Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net.\nDuring the 1990s, Microsoft introduced its initial versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system for personal computers, a graphical user interface intended to replace MS-DOS. Game developers found it difficult to program for some of the earlier versions of Windows, as the operating system tended to block their programmatic access to input and output devices. Microsoft developed DirectX in 1995, later integrated into Microsoft Windows 95 and future Windows products, as a set of libraries to give game programmers direct access to these functions. This also helped to provide a standard interface to normalize the wide array of graphics and sound cards available for personal computers by this time, further aiding in ongoing game development.\n32- and 64-bit home consoles.\nSony's introduction of the first PlayStation in 1994 had hampered both Nintendo and Sega's console war, as well as made it difficult for new companies to enter the market. The PlayStation brought in not only the revolution in CD-ROM media but built-in support for polygonal 3D graphics rendering. Atari attempted to re-enter the market with the 32-bit Atari Jaguar in 1993, but it lacked the game libraries offered by Nintendo, Sega or Sony. The 3DO Company released the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1993, but it also suffered from a higher price compared to other consoles on the market. Sega has placed a great deal of emphasis on the 32-bit Sega Saturn, released in 1994, to follow the Genesis, and though initially fared well in sales with the PlayStation, soon lost ground to the PlayStation's larger range of popular games. Nintendo's next console after the SNES was the Nintendo 64, a 64-bit console with polygonal 3D rendering support. However, Nintendo opted to continue to use the ROM cartridge format, which caused it to lose sales against the PlayStation, and allowing Sony to become the dominant player in the console market by 2000.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\", as previously described, was an industry landmark title, and introduced the concept of role-playing games to console players. The origin of music video games emerged with the PlayStation game \"PaRappa the Rapper\" in 1997, coupled with the success of arcade games like \"beatmania\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution\". \"Resident Evil\" and \"Silent Hill\" formed the basis of the current survival horror genre. Nintendo had its own critical successes with \"GoldenEye 007\" from Rare, the first first-person shooter for a console that introduced staple features for the genre, and \"\", one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time.\nVideo gaming in Latin America.\nJapanese video game consoles were released in South American countries such as Colombia and Brazil nearly simultaneously with the United States throughout the 1980s and 1990s, even though local game development was minimal in these regions until the 2000s.\nSega's console sales were in decline in both the United States, Europe and Japan by the end of the 1990s, but due to a licensing agreement with Tectoy in Brazil, as well as the country's strict import taxes, Sega remained a big player in the country. Brazil is one of the world's largest video game markets, and by developing games and game systems locally through Tectoy, Sega managed to dominate the local console market. As of 2015, Tectoy still releases new cheap or portable versions of the Master System and Sega Genesis in the country, while companies such as Sony and Microsoft have difficulty retailing their modern hardware.\n2000s.\nThe 2000s (decade) showed innovation on both consoles and PCs, and an increasingly competitive market for portable game systems. The impact of wider availability of the Internet led to new gameplay changes, changes in gaming hardware and the introduction of online services for consoles.\nThe phenomenon of user-created video game modifications (commonly referred to as \"mods\") for games, one trend that began during the \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\"-era, continued into the start of the 21st century. The most famous example is that of \"Counter-Strike\"; released in 1999, it is still one of the most popular online first-person shooters, even though it was created as a mod for \"Half-Life\" by two independent programmers. Eventually, game designers realized the potential of mods and custom content in general to enhance the value of their games, and so began to encourage its creation. Some examples of this include \"Unreal Tournament\", which allowed players to import 3dsmax scenes to use as character models, and Maxis' \"The Sims\", for which players could create custom objects.\nIn China, video game consoles were banned in June 2000. This has led to an explosion in the popularity of computer games, especially MMOs.\nConsoles and the games for them are easily acquired however, as there is a robust grey market importing and distributing them across the country. Another side effect of this law has been increased copyright infringement of video games.\nThe changing home console landscape.\nSony's dominance of the console market at the start of the 2000s caused a major shift in the market. Sega attempted one more foray into console hardware with the Dreamcast in 1998, notably the first console with a built-in Internet connection for online play. However, Sega's reputation had been tarnished from the Saturn, and with Sony having recently announced its upcoming PlayStation 2, Sega left the hardware console market after the Dreamcast, though remained in the arcade game development as well as developing games for consoles. The Dreamcast's library has some groundbreaking games, notably the \"Shenmue series\" which are regarded as a major step forward for 3D open-world gameplay and has introduced the quick time event mechanic in its modern form.\nSony released the PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2000, the first console to support the new DVD format and with capabilities of playing back DVD movie disks and CD audio disks, as well as playing PlayStation games in a backward compatible mode alongside PS2 games. Nintendo followed the Nintendo 64 with the GameCube in 2001, its first console to use optical discs, though specially formatted for the system. However, a new player entered the console picture at this point, Microsoft with its first Xbox console, also released in 2001. Microsoft had feared that Sony's PS2 would become a central point of electronic entertainment in the living room and squeeze out the PC in the home, and after having recently developing the DirectX set of libraries to standardize game hardware interfaces for Windows-based computers, used this same approach to create the Xbox.\nThe PS2 remained the leading platform for the first part of the decade, and remains the best-selling home console of all time with over 155 million units sold. This was in part due to a number of critical games released on the system, including \"Grand Theft Auto III\", ', and \"Final Fantasy X\". The Xbox was able to gain second-place to the PS2 sales, but at a significant lost to Microsoft. However, to Microsoft, the loss was acceptable, as it proved to them they could compete in the console space. The Xbox also introduced Microsoft's flagship title, ', which relied on the Xbox's built-in Ethernet functionality to support online gameplay.\nBy the mid-2000s, only Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft were considered major players in the console hardware space. All three introduced their next generation of hardware between 2005 and 2006, starting with Microsoft's Xbox 360 in 2005 and Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3) in 2006, followed by Nintendo's Wii later that year. The Xbox 360 and PS3 showed a convergence with personal computer hardware: both consoles shipped with support for high-definition graphics, higher-density optical media like Blu-rays, internal hard drives for storage of games, and had built-in Internet connectivity. Microsoft and Sony also had developed online digital services, Xbox Live and PlayStation Network that helped players connect to friends online, matchmake for online games, and purchase new games and content from online stores. In contrast, the Wii was designed as part of a new blue ocean strategy by Nintendo after poor sales of the GameCube. Instead of trying to compete feature for feature with Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo designed the Wii to be a console for innovative gameplay rather than high performance, and created the Wii Remote, a motion detection-based controller. Gameplay designed around the Wii Remote provided instant hits, such as \"Wii Sports\", \"Wii Sports Resort\", and \"Wii Fit\", and the Wii became one of the fastest selling consoles in its few years. The success of the Wii's motion controls partially led to Microsoft and Sony to develop their own motion-sensing control systems, the Kinect and the PlayStation Move.\nA major fad in the 2000s was the rapid rise and fall of rhythm games which use special game controllers shaped like musical instruments such as guitars and drums to match notes while playing licensed songs. \"Guitar Hero\", based on the arcade game \"Guitar Freaks\", was developed by Harmonix and published by Red Octane in 2005 on the PS2, and was a modest success. Activision acquired Red Octane and gained the publishing rights to the series, while Harmonix was purchased by Viacom, where they launched \"Rock Band\", a similar series but adding in drums and vocals atop guitars. Rhythm games because a highly-popular property second only to action games, representing 18% of the video game market in 2008, and drew other publishers to the area as well. While Harmonix approached the series by adding new songs as downloadable content, Activision focused on releasing new games year after year in the \"Guitar Hero\" series; by 2009, they had six different \"Guitar Hero\"-related games planned for the year. The saturation of the market, in addition to the fad of these instrument controllers, quickly caused the $ market in 2008 to fall by 50% in 2009. By 2011, Activision had stopped publishing \"Guitar Hero\" games (though returned one time in 2015 with \"Guitar Hero Live\"), while Harmonix has continued to develop \"Rock Back\" after a hiatus between 2013 and 2015.\nNintendo still dominated the handheld games market during this period. The Game Boy Advance, released in 2001, maintained Nintendo's market position with a high-resolution, full-color LCD screen and 32-bit processor allowing ports of SNES games and simpler companions to N64 and GameCube games. The next two major handhelds, the Nintendo DS and Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) within a month of each other in 2004. While the PSP boasted superior graphics and power, following a trend established since the mid-1980s, Nintendo gambled on a lower-power design but featuring a novel control interface. The DS's two screens, with one being a touch-sensitive screen, proved extremely popular with consumers, especially young children and middle-aged gamers, who were drawn to the device by Nintendo's \"Nintendogs\" and \"\" series respectively, as well as introducing localized Japanese visual novel-type games such as the \"Ace Attorney\" and \"Professor Layton\" series to the Western regions. The PSP attracted a significant portion of veteran gamers in North America and was very popular in Japan; its ad-hoc networking capabilities worked well within the urban Japanese setting, which directly contributed to spurring the popularity of Capcom's \"Monster Hunter\" series.\nMMOs, esports, and online services.\nAs affordable broadband Internet connectivity spread, many publishers turned to online games as a way of innovating. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) featured significant PC games like \"RuneScape\", \"EverQuest\", and \"Ultima Online\", with \"World of Warcraft\" as one of the most successful. Other large-scale massively-multiplayer online games also were released, such as \"Second Life\" which focused mostly on social interactions with virtual player avatars and user creations, rather than any gameplay elements.\nHistorically, console-based MMORPGs have been few due to the lack of bundled Internet connectivity options for the platforms. This made it hard to establish a large enough subscription community to justify the development costs. The first significant console MMORPGs were \"Phantasy Star Online\" on the Sega Dreamcast (which had a built in modem and aftermarket Ethernet adapter), followed by \"Final Fantasy XI\" for the Sony PlayStation 2 (an aftermarket Ethernet adapter was shipped to support this game). Every major platform released since the Dreamcast has either been bundled with the ability to support an Internet connection or has had the option available as an aftermarket add-on. Microsoft's Xbox also had its own online service called Xbox Live. Xbox Live was a huge success and proved to be a driving force for the Xbox with games like \"Halo 2\" that were highly popular.\nThe first major esports (electronic sports) competitions also began in the 2000s. While \"Street Fighter II\" and other fighting games of the 1990s had introduced organized video game competitions earlier, professional esports emerged from South Korea around 2000, with many of their events around current fighting games and various RTS games like \"StarCraft\" and \"WarCraft III\". By 2010, numerous international esports tournaments had been established across various game genres.\nBrowser, casual, and social games.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Internet accessibility and new online technologies flourished, such as Java and Adobe Flash. Though Adobe Flash was initially intended to be a tool to develop fully interactive websites, Flash lost favor in this area but individual developers found ways to use the tool for animations and games, aided by the ease of the development tools for this purpose. The website Newgrounds was created to help people share and promote their Flash works. Though these Flash games lack the complexity of gameplay of games on consoles or computers, they were available for free and sparked creative ideas that would carry forward; for example, \"Crush the Castle\" directly inspired the popular mobile game \"Angry Birds\", while the founder of Newgrounds, Tom Fulp, teamed with animator Dan Paladin to create \"Alien Hominid\" as a Flash game, which they later built upon into the more complete \"Castle Crashers\" under the studio The Behemoth.\nFlash and other in-browser platforms created a new trend in casual games, with limited complexity and designed for shortened or impromptu play sessions. Many were puzzle games, such as Popcap's \"Bejeweled\" and PlayFirst's \"Diner Dash\" while others were games with a more relaxed pace and open-ended play. Sites like Kongregate and developers like PopCap, Zynga and King emerged as leaders in this area. Casual games also entered into more mainstream computer games with numerous simulation games. The biggest hit was \"The Sims\" by Maxis, which went on to become the best selling computer game of all time, surpassing \"Myst\".\nAs social media sites started to grow, the first social network games emerged on social platforms. These games, often based on casual game mechanics, typically rely on users to interact with their friends via the social media site as to gain a form of \"energy\" to continue to play. \"Happy Farm\", released in China in 2008, is considered the first such major social game. Influenced by the Japanese console RPG series \"Story of Seasons\", \"Happy Farm\" attracted 23 million daily active users in China. It soon inspired many clones such as \"Sunshine Farm\", \"Happy Farmer\", \"Happy Fishpond\", \"Happy Pig Farm\", and Facebook games such as \"FarmVille\", \"Farm Town\", \"Country Story\", \"Barn Buddy\", \"Sunshine Ranch\", \"Happy Harvest\", \"Jungle Extreme\", and \"Farm Villain\". \"Happy Farm\" served as direct inspiration for \"FarmVille\", which had over 80 million active users worldwide by 2010.\nRise of mobile gaming.\nSeparately, gaming on mobile devices had limited success until the mid-2000s. Nokia had installed \"Snake\" onto its line of mobile phones since the Nokia 6110 in 1997. Similar manufacturers of phones, personal digital assistants and other devices also included built-in games, but these were designed to pass the time and not as engaging. As phone technology improved, a Japanese mobile phone culture grew around 2003 with games ranging from puzzle games and virtual pet games that use camera phone and fingerprint scanner technologies to 3D games with PlayStation-quality graphics. Older arcade-style games became very popular on mobile phones, which were an ideal platform for arcade-style games designed for shorter play sessions. Namco made attempts to introduce mobile games to Europe in 2003. Nokia released its N-Gage, a hybrid phone/handheld game system, in 2003 but had limited success compared to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance.\nAround 2005, the first smartphones were available on the market, which offered data connectivity alongside phone services. Carriers licensed games to be made available for sale on a storefront, but this did not catch on due to the disparate storefronts and differences between phone models, and the games could not be as sophisticated as on consoles or handhelds due to limited hardware on the smartphones. In 2007, Apple, Inc. introduced its iPhone which was technologically more advanced than other smartphones on the market, and unveiled its App Store in 2008 through which new apps could be purchased. With the App Store, developers, once signed up as a partner, could then develop and publish their own apps through the store. This allowed developers of any size to participate in the App Store marketplace. Google, which developed the competing Android mobile operating system, released its own version of an app store in 2008, later named as Google Play in 2012.\nThe use of Apple's and Google's app storefronts for gaming applications quickly took off with early successes like \"Angry Birds\" and \"Bejeweled\". When Apple introduced in-app purchases (IAP) in October 2009, a number of developers found ways to monetize their mobile games uniquely compared to traditional games, establishing the freemium model where a game is usually free to download and play but players are encouraged to speed up their progress through IAPs. Games like \"Candy Crush Saga\" and \"Puzzle &amp; Dragons\", both in 2012, established this approach as highly-profitable business models for mobile games. Many of the social network game developers worked to either integrate a mobile version with their existing version, or completely shift their game to the mobile platform, as mobile gaming became more popular. A further rise in the popularity of mobile games was from China, where most residents do not own computers and where imported consoles were banned by the government starting in 2000, though eventually eased in 2014 and completely lifted in 2015. Instead, most players in China used mobile phones or accessed subscription-based games through PC cafes. Mobile games also proved popular and financially-successful there as well, with a ten-fold growth of China's video game market between 2007 and 2013.\nCoupled with the growth of mobile games was the introduction of microconsoles, low-cost home consoles that used the Android operating system as to take advantage of the large library of games already made for mobile devices. However, mobile gaming also displaced the handheld console market: both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita (both 2011 releases) had major drops in sales from their predecessors, the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable respectively (both 2004 releases), following the rapid growth of mobile gaming. Sony has since exited the handheld console arena.\nSince 2007, the fast growing mobile market in African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya has also resulted in a growth in mobile game development. Local developers have taken advantage of the recent increase in mobile internet connection in countries where broadband is rarely available and console games are costly, though locally developed applications have difficulty competing against millions of western applications available on the Google Play Store\nThe AAA video game industry and the emergence of indie games.\nEntering the 2000s, video game production experienced a sharp increase in development budgets, as studios began treating projects with financial and creative ambitions comparable to Hollywood filmmaking. Titles such as \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Shenmue\" reached estimated budgets of $40\u201345 million and $47\u201370 million respectively, excluding marketing, prompting large developers to allocate funds not only for core development, distribution, and marketing but also for in-game cinematography, professional voice acting, licensed properties, and extensive promotional campaigns. This expansion in production scope led to the classification of high-budget releases and their creators as \u201cAAA\u201d or \u201ctriple-A,\u201d a term that emerged by the late 1990s and early 2000s to describe blockbuster-scale games. Technological advancements and these larger budgets enabled the rise of narrative-driven design that integrated storytelling directly into gameplay, eliminating reliance on pre-rendered cutscenes and fostering cinematic presentation within the game engine. The emphasis on narrative mechanics contributed to the decline of the adventure game genre during this period, as exemplified by influential releases such as \"Half-Life 2\", \"Portal\", \"\", \"BioShock\", and the first installments of \"Call of Duty\" and \"Assassin\u2019s Creed\".\nIndependent game development, which originated with hobbyist and homebrew projects on early home computers in the late 1970s and 1980s and evolved into shareware distribution in the 1990s, faced diminished visibility with the rise of 3D gaming and the dominance of console-based AAA titles that made publishers increasingly averse to experimental or unconventional projects. In the late 2000s and 2010s, indie games gained substantial market presence as developers and audiences sought innovation beyond the standardized formulas of large-budget productions. The Flash game boom of the mid-2000s brought media attention to small teams and individual creators, while the concurrent expansion of mobile gaming provided independent studios with access to app store platforms. Crowdfunding through services like Kickstarter offered an alternative funding model beginning in the late 2000s, growing rapidly into the mid-2010s, and early access distribution became viable after the success of \"Minecraft\" in 2009. Valve\u2019s inclusion of indie titles on Steam alongside AAA games and Microsoft\u2019s 2004 launch of Xbox Live Arcade facilitated broader digital distribution, with Sony and Nintendo adopting comparable programs in the early 2010s. The era produced critically acclaimed and commercially visible indie releases such as \"Super Meat Boy\", \"Fez\", and \"Braid\".\n2010s.\nIn the 2010s, the traditional model of racing to a five-year console life cycle was reduced. Reasons included the challenge and massive expense of creating consoles that were graphically superior to the then-current generation, with Sony and Microsoft still looking to recoup development costs on their current consoles and the failure of content creation tools to keep up with the increased demands placed upon the people creating the games.\nOn June 14, 2010, during E3, Microsoft revealed its new Xbox 360 S or Slim. It is smaller and quieter, with a 250\u00a0GB hard drive and 802.11n WiFi. It started shipping to US stores the same day, and in Europe on July 13.\nThe OnLive cloud-based gaming system is one of the first cloud gaming services.\nHigh-definition graphics in video game hardware.\nCathode ray tube-based display units had begun to phase out in the 2000s, replaced by inexpensive flat-screen televisions and monitors which had far higher screen resolution and refresh rates. Video game hardware began introducing support for the new High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) standard, allowing for resolutions up to 4K (3840\u2009\u00d7\u20092160 pixels), which itself stressed the need for more powerful GPU cards with faster processors and larger memory. Game engines such as Unreal, Unity, and DirectX have added support for improved texture mapping to support high-resolution textures to give photorealistic graphics in games.\nMicrosoft and Sony both released their next console generations, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, in 2013. Both expanded on features from their previous consoles with the added support for high-resolution graphics, and more support for digital distribution of content with additional storage space. The Xbox One had an initial flubbed launch, as Microsoft wanted to require users to be always connected to the Internet, along with persistent use of the Kinect motion sensor, which in turn would have given certain benefits to players. However, these decisions were met with negative feedback in the months prior to release over their privacy concerns, and Microsoft revamped their policies. The Kinect, though initially bundled with the Xbox One, was made optional, and a year after launch, Microsoft opted to end Kinect's production for the Xbox One.\nNintendo still kept to its own path. The company decided that the Wii may have lost a portion of its core gamers and developed the Wii U to draw this group back in. The Wii U, released in 2012, included a tablet-like Wii U GamePad that included controls and a touchscreen display that acted as a second screen during gameplay, along with support for Wii Remote controllers, and included backward compatibility with Wii games. The Wii U was a commercial failure for Nintendo following the Wii; while the Wii had sold more than 100 million units, the Wii U only sold about 13 million in its lifetime. Nintendo attributed this to both the marketing of the Wii U which failed to make clear the purpose of the GamePad and which made consumers believe it was just another tablet system, and to the lack of third-party support on the console which dropped off quickly once initial console sale numbers were obtained. and marketing reasons.\nNintendo had already been working on its next console once the Wii U had been released, but pushed ahead as to get another console to release sooner to financially recover from the Wii U. Again, staying with their past blue ocean strategy to focus on innovation rather than technical superiority of their competitors, Nintendo released the Nintendo Switch in 2017, one of the first hybrid consoles, with the ability to be played as a handheld device but also can be placed into a docking station connected to a television and played like a home console. The Switch uses a detachable Joy-Con which function as both regular controllers and as motion-sensing devices like the Wii Remote. Alongside the Switch, Nintendo sought out third-party support for the console from both triple-A studios and indie developers. The Switch proved to be very successful; as of 2022, it is Nintendo's best-selling home console, succeeding the Wii, and helped Nintendo regain position in the hardware market.\nThe handheld market began to wane in the 2010s as mobile gaming supplanted it. Nintendo continued to refine the DS line; it released the Nintendo 3DS in 2011, which included a screen with an autostereoscopic display as to create a 3D effect without the need for special glasses. Sony released the PlayStation Vita in 2012 as a successor to the PSP, which included a front touch screen and a back-facing touchpad in addition to existing control. The Vita failed to gain significant market share, and after Sony discontinued the product, have stated they have no plans for further handheld systems. Nintendo, on the other hand, released a modified version of the Switch, the Nintendo Switch Lite, in 2019. The Switch Lite is a lower-cost version that directly integrates the Joy-Con into the unit and removes other features, as to create a device that supports handheld gameplay directly, but is otherwise fully compatible with the existing Switch library.\nIn personal computers, the graphics card market centered on progress made by industry leaders NVidia and AMD, who also supplied GPUs for the new consoles. Starting in the late 2010s, the power of these GPU cards were being used by cryptocurrency \"miners\", as they were lower cost than other computing hardware for the same purposes, and created a run on GPU cards that inflated prices and card shortages over extended periods. Solid-state drives (SSDs), which had been used for flash card storage for video game consoles in the past, had advanced far enough to become consumer options for large volume storage. Compared to the traditional hard disk drive (HDD) which used electromechanical parts, SSD drives have no mechanical componentry and are capable of much higher data throughput, which made them popular options for computers designed for video games.\nFurther advancements in online gaming: Cross-platform play and cloud gaming.\nUntil the 2010s, online play for most platforms was limited to players on that same platform, though some games such as \"Final Fantasy XI\" had experimented with limited models. As new gaming consoles converged in design to personal computers and with common middleware libraries, it became technically feasible to allow for cross-platform play between different platforms, but business objectives by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, looking to maintain control on their online services, initially rejected this, most notably by Sony who had stated they wanted to maintain a family-friendly environment for its online services. Epic Games' \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" first released in 2017, proved an instrumental driver of cross-platform play. \"Fortnite\" had quickly gained popularity in its first few months of release, and Epic had been able to prove the ease with which cross-platform play could be implemented between the Xbox, Windows, and mobile platforms with its backend libraries. Nintendo followed by allowing cross-play on the Switch, and eventually, by 2018, Sony agreed to allow selected games such as \"Fortnite\" to have cross-platform play. Since then, numerous games have gained or were released with cross-platform play support across consoles, computers, and mobile devices.\nThe first cloud gaming services emerged in 2009. These services allowed players to play games where the processing power was performed on a computer system at a hosted location, while the game's output and player's input were sent to that system over the Internet, using the power of cloud computing. This eliminated the need for a costly console or dedicated gaming computer for players. Early services like OnLive and Gaikai showed that cloud gaming was possible but was very much tied to the player's latency, as a slow network could easily stall the game's performance.\nCloud gaming became more refined in the 2010s as total network capacity around the world increased with higher bandwidths made available to consumers, in addition to new technologies to try to overcome the latency issue. Sony acquired both OnLive and Gaikai in the mid-2010s, and used the former as the basis for its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service, allowing players to play older PlayStation games on newer consoles. Other players in the cloud gaming arena that emerged in this period include NVidia's GeForce Now, Microsoft's xCloud, Google's Stadia, and Amazon Luna.\nNew revenue models for video games.\nWith game development budgets for triple-A games growing larger, developers and publishers looked for ways to gain additional revenue for games beyond the first sale of the game. Multiple factors from the prior decade including the growth of the mobile game market and the introduction of in-app purchases, subscription-based games such as MMOs, and the digital distribution market, led to new avenues for recurring revenue by treating games as a service (GaaS).\nLarger expansions and downloadable content had existed prior to the mid-2000s, and players had become accustomed to the subscription-based model for MMOs by that point. Microsoft enabled developers to offer microtransactions, content sold at a small price point typically under $, for their games on the Xbox 360 around 2005, with one of the most well-known examples being a horse armor package for \"\" in 2006. While mostly a cosmetic item in the game, the armor pack was one of the most popular items sold in for \"Oblivion\" by 2009, and cemented the idea of microtransactions.\nGames that followed \"Oblivion\" found ways to include additional microtransaction content to games to extend per-game earnings. Publishers that produced games with online content created special online passes, such as Electronic Arts' \"Project Ten Dollar\", which required purchase to gain access to online features; this was also intended to stall secondary sales of games. This approach was heavily criticized by consumers and players, and abandoned by 2013. Instead publishers offered the season pass model, first appearing in games like \"L.A. Noire\" and \"Mortal Kombat\". Without a season pass, players would still have access to all fundamental features of a game including online play, but the season pass gave access to all planned expanded content for single player modes and new characters or items and cosmetics for online modes, all planned to be released typically within a year's period, typically at a discount compared to purchasing each individually. A game could thus offer repeating season passes year after year and generate revenue this way. A related concept to the season pass is the battle pass, first introduced in \"Dota 2\". Within a battle pass are a number of in-game items that a player can earn at various levels of the battle pass, but requires them to complete in-game challenges as to earn the levels within the pass. Some battle passes include a free tier of items but most incorporate a tier that requires purchase of the pass. Battle passes can be cycled like season passes, offering a fresh set of items with new challenges on a regular basis, and supply recurring revenue for a game.\nFrom mobile and free-to-play games, \"gacha\" games had grown popular in Japan by the early 2010s, based on the capsule toy vending machine concept, with the earliest known system being in \"MapleStory\". In-game, players would earn currency that they could use to earn a random draw from a set of items based on a preset rarities, often with the goal to collect all of a one set of items to gain a powerful in-game reward. While players could earn more currency through in-game actions, typically by grinding, they could also can currency by spending real-world funds into the game. The \"gacha\" concept expanded out into loot boxes through the Chinese game \"ZT Online\", and in Western games like \"FIFA 09\" and \"Team Fortress 2\" in the early 2010s; players would earn loot boxes through in-game actions, or which could be purchased through real-world funds, and when opened would contain a variety of items, randomly selected based on rarity. By 2016, numerous high-profile games had included loot box mechanics, but this drew attention of world governments and policy makers, fearing that loot boxes were too similar to gambling, since real-world money could be used to purchase them. Since many of these video games were being aimed at minors, some countries had passed laws banning or restricting games with loot box mechanics due to their gambling nature. Coupled with poor implementation of loot box mechanics in \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" and Electronic Arts's \"FIFA\" Ultimate Team game mode, loot box mechanics began to lose favor with consumers by the end of the 2010s.\nChina's impact in monetization played a key role during this period, which exceeded over 500 million players by the mid-2010s. While the console ban had been lifted, China's government still required that imported hardware be sold through Chinese companies, and requires Chinese operators to manage online games as to uphold the country's laws on censorship and gameplay limitations for minors. Chinese companies that were already publishing games within the country began to make partnerships or other arrangements with foreign firms to help bring their games and hardware into the company through the complex approvals process. Such companies include NetEase and Perfect World, but the largest mover had been Tencent, which made numerous investments into foreign firms over the 2010s, which included full acquisition of Riot Games and partial ownership of Supercell and Epic Games, as well as minority stake in publishers Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard and Paradox Interactive. In exchange, Tencent had helped these companies refine their monetization approaches using their past experience with their own games.\nMixed, virtual and augmented reality games.\nVirtual reality (VR) systems for video games had long been seen as a target for VR technology and had been in development as early as the 1990s, but had been hampered by their high cost and impractical for consumer sales. One of the initial attempts, Nintendo's Virtual Boy in 1996, used a monochromatic stereoscopic display to simulate 3D, but the unit was impractical and failed to gain developers, leading it to be a commercial failure for Nintendo. Breakthroughs in consumer-ready VR hardware came in the early 2010s with the development of the Oculus Rift by Palmer Luckey. The Rift was demonstrated at trade shows in 2013, and proved popular enough to lead Facebook to purchase the company and technology for $ in 2014. Shortly afterward, Valve and HTC announced the HTC Vive, first released in 2015, while Sony released its PlayStation VR in 2016. Valve later developed its own VR hardware line, the Valve Index, released in 2019. While numerous VR games took advantage of VR effectively over \"flat-screen\" games (those lacking VR capabilities) for immersive experience, VR's \"killer app\" came by way of \"\", released by Valve in 2020. \"Half-Life: Alyx\" brought several new ideas for integrating first-person shooter gaming into a VR app, and spurred sales of the Index.\nAugmented reality (AR) games, where the game takes a real-time video game image and renders additional graphics atop it, had also existed before the 2010s. Some PlayStation console games used the EyeToy, PlayStation Eye, or PlayStation Camera as part of the gameplay, as well as Xbox 360 and Xbox One games using the Kinect. Most of the games were more experimental since cameras were fixed and limited what interactions could be made. As handheld consoles including the PSP and the Nintendo DS line, and mobile phones incorporated video camera capabilities, new AR possibilities opened up on portable devices. Initial games were still more experimental and toys without comprehensive gameplay loops. AR-based games took off with the release of \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\" in 2016, which combined AR with location-based games. Players would use their mobile device to guide them to where a virtual Pok\u00e9mon may be found, which they searched for and attempted to capture using AR atop their device's camera.\n2020s.\nRay-tracing and photorealistic graphics.\nNVidia and AMD introduced graphics cards in 2020 with hardware support for real-time ray tracing, which was also a major component introduced with Microsoft and Sony's next consoles, the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, both released in November 2020. Significant improvements in technology also furthered the ability to display highly detailed textures, allowing for photorealism in rendered video game scenes at high resolutions and high frame rates. These changes necessitated larger storage space for texture memory on the hardware and greater bandwidth between the storage memory and graphic processor. Both new consoles included specialized SSD options designed to provide high-bandwidth storage options, which had the added benefit of virtually eliminating loading times in many games particular those featuring in-game streaming for open world games.\nThe metaverse, blockchain and NFT games.\nMoving into the 2020s, the concept of the metaverse grew in popularity. Similar in nature to the social spaces of \"Second Life\", the concept of a metaverse is based on using more advanced technology like virtual and augmented reality to create immersive worlds that not only can be used for social and entertainment functions but as well as for personal and business purposes, giving the user the ability to earn from participation in the metaverse. \"Roblox\" is a more recent example of an open world game that allows players to build their own creations within game with the potential to earn money from these creations.\nThe metaverse in the early 2020s was not yet well defined, but those developing the nascent technologies recognized that a financial system would be tied to these systems. Avoiding the pitfalls of prior game currency systems, the development of cryptocurrency-based games and systems that used decentralized blockchain technologies started to grow in popularity. These blockchain games were frequently based on the trading of non-fungible tokens that players created and improved through the game, mimicking how metaverse content would function. Some video game companies have expressed strong support for using blockchain and NFTs in their games, such as Ubisoft, but there has been generally negative feedback from players and game developers that consider cryptocurrency and NFT a scam.\nGrowth and decline around the COVID pandemic.\nA large number of major acquisitions in the video game industry occurred at the start of the 2020s as large publishers gathered more studios and other publishers within their folds as to be able to offer their properties within the parent's version of the metaverse, diversify their offerings, and preparate for futures where gaming platforms shift away from traditional systems. Tencent Holdings has gained stake in numerous video game developers since the 2010s, including full ownership of Riot Games and minority ownership of Epic Games. Epic Games themselves have also used Tencent's investment and further funding to acquire numerous additional video game developers and middleware developers in the 2020s as part its goal to build out its version of the metaverse using its Unreal Engine. Embracer Group also launched a large series of acquisitions leading into the 2020s as to broaden its portfolio, including Gearbox Software. Other major acquisitions in the 2020s in support of the metaverse includes Take-Two Interactive's purchase of mobile game publisher Zynga, Sony Interactive Entertainment purchase of developer Bungie for supporting live-service games, and Microsoft's purchases of ZeniMax Media (including Bethesda Softworks) and Activision-Blizzard. Game prices were increasing from the generally pricing of $60 between c.\u20092005 and 2020, with $60 titles going back to the 1990s according to Bloomberg. The COVID pandemic in 2021 and 2022 also fueled global video game industry growth, as many around the globe, staying at home due to lockdowns, turned to video games as a means to pass the time and connect remotely with others. \nHowever, this rapid growth over the initial years of the 2020s fell back on the industry around mid-2023 and into 2025 with numerous layoffs, as several major publishers had to cull employees and studios with the world returning to normal following the pandemic. One major event was a failed $2 billion deal that the Embracer Group had been planning on before it fell through in June 2023; Embracer was forced to close several of its studios, divest others, and made planned to break into three separate publishing labels by 2025.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The practice probably started in several parts of the world over ten thousand years ago, with families growing vegetables for their own consumption or to trade locally.

More recently, mechanisation has revolutionised vegetable farming with nearly all processes being able to be performed by machine.

Marketing can be done locally in farmer's markets, traditional markets or pick-your-own operations, or farmers can contract their whole crops to wholesalers, canners or retailers.\nHistory.\nOriginally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits.\nTraditionally it was done in the soil in small rows or blocks, often primarily for consumption on the farm, with the excess sold in nearby towns. Later, farms on the edge of large communities could specialize in vegetable production, with the short distance allowing the farmer to get his produce to market while still fresh. The three sisters method used by Native Americans (specifically the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois) grew squash, beans and corn together so that the plants enhanced each other's growth. Planting in long rows allows machinery to cultivate the fields, increasing efficiency and output; however, the diversity of vegetable crops requires a number of techniques to be used to optimize the growth of each type of plant. Some farms, therefore, specialize in one vegetable; others grow a large variety. Due to the needs to market vegetables while fresh, vegetable gardening has high labor demands. Some farms avoid this by running u-pick operations where the customers pick their own produce. The development of ripening technologies and refrigeration has reduced the problems with getting produce to market in good condition.\nDifferent growing methods.\nOver the past 100 years a new technique has emerged\u2014raised bed gardening, which has increased yields from small plots of soil without the need for commercial, energy-intensive fertilizers. Modern hydroponic farming produces very high yields in greenhouses without using any soil.\nMarketing.\nSeveral economic models exist for vegetable farms: A relatively small operation is a market garden while a larger farm may grow large quantities of few vegetables and sell them in bulk to major markets or middlemen, which requires large growing operations. A farm may produce for local customers, which requires a larger distribution effort. A farm may produce a variety of vegetables for sale through an on-Farm Stalls, a local farmer's markets, or a u-pick operation. Such operations differ from commodity farm products like wheat and maize which are less perishable and are sold in bulk to the a local granary. Large cities often have a central produce market which handles vegetables in a commodity-like manner, and manages distribution to most supermarkets and restaurants.\nIn America, vegetable farms are in some regions known as truck farms; \"truck\" is a noun for which its more common meaning overshadows its historically separate use as a term for \"vegetables grown for market\". Such farms are sometimes called muck farms, after the dark black soil in which vegetables grow well.\nCommon vegetable crops.\nVegetables which are farmed include:"}

{"id": "32407", "revid": "34017952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32407", "title": "Virgo (constellation)", "text": "Zodiac constellation straddling the celestial equator\nVirgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac. The name means \"maiden\" in Latin and its traditional astrological symbol is . Between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, lying in the south, it is the second-largest constellation in the sky (after Hydra) and the largest constellation in the zodiac. The ecliptic intersects the celestial equator within this constellation and Pisces. Underlying these technical two definitions, the sun passes directly overhead of the equator, within this constellation, at the September equinox. Virgo can be easily found through its brightest star, Spica, (in Latin \"grain headed\").\nLocation.\nVirgo is prominent in the spring sky in the Northern Hemisphere, visible all night in March and April. As the largest zodiac constellation, the Sun takes 44 days to pass through it, longer than any other. From 1990 and until 2062, this will take place from September 16 to October 30. It is located in the third quadrant of the Southern Hemisphere (SQ3) and can be seen at latitudes between +80\u00b0 and -80\u00b0.\nThe bright star Spica makes it easy to locate Virgo, as it can be found by following the curve of the Big Dipper/Plough to Arcturus in Bo\u00f6tes and continuing from there in the same curve (\"follow the arc to Arcturus and speed on to Spica\").\nDue to the effects of precession, the autumn equinox point lies within the boundaries of Virgo very close to \u03b2 Virginis. This is one of the two points in the sky where the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic (the other being the vernal equinox point in the constellation of Pisces). From the 18th century to the 4th century BC, the Sun was in Libra on the autumnal equinox, shifting into Virgo thereafter. This point will pass into the neighboring constellation of Leo around the year 2440.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nBesides Spica, other bright stars in Virgo include \u03b2 Virginis (Zavijava), \u03b3 Virginis (Porrima), \u03b4 Virginis (Auva) and \u03b5 Virginis (Vindemiatrix). Other fainter stars that were also given names are \u03b6 Virginis (Heze), \u03b7 Virginis (Zaniah), \u03b9 Virginis (Syrma), \u03ba Virginis (Kang), \u03bb Virginis (Khambalia) and \u03c6 Virginis (Elgafar).\nThe 7 main stars of Virgo form 2 distinct star patterns: Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta Virginis; form an asterism known as \"The Bowl of Virgo\". Together with Spica and Theta Virginis, they form a Y shape.\nThe star 70 Virginis has one of the first known extrasolar planetary systems with one confirmed planet 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter.\nThe star Chi Virginis has one of the most massive planets ever detected, with a mass of 11.1 times that of Jupiter.\nThe sun-like star 61 Virginis has three known planets: one is a super-Earth and two are Neptune-mass planets.\nSS Virginis is a variable star with a noticeable red color. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.6 to a maximum of 6.0 over approximately one year.\nExoplanets.\nThere are 35 verified exoplanets orbiting 29 stars in Virgo, including PSR B1257+12 (three planets), 70 Virginis (one planet), Chi Virginis (one planet), 61 Virginis (three planets), NY Virginis (two planets), and 59 Virginis (one planet).\nDeep-sky objects.\nBecause of the presence of a galaxy cluster (consequently called the Virgo Cluster) within its borders 5\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 west of \u03b5 Vir (Vindemiatrix), this constellation is especially rich in galaxies.\nSome examples are Messier 49 (elliptical), Messier 58 (spiral), Messier 59 (elliptical), Messier 60 (elliptical), Messier 61 (spiral), Messier 84 (lenticular), Messier 86 (lenticular), Messier 87 (elliptical and a famous radio source), Messier 89 (elliptical) and Messier 90 (spiral). A noted galaxy that is not part of the cluster is the Sombrero Galaxy (M104), an unusual spiral galaxy. It is located about 10\u00b0 due west of Spica.\nNGC 4639 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy located from Earth (redshift 0.0034). Its outer arms have a high number of Cepheid variables, which are used as standard candles to determine astronomical distances. Because of this, astronomers used several Cepheid variables in NGC 4639 to calibrate type Ia supernovae as standard candles for more distant galaxies.\nVirgo possesses several galaxy clusters, one of which is HCG 62. A Hickson Compact Group, HCG 62 is at a distance of from Earth (redshift 0.0137) and possesses a large central elliptical galaxy. It has a heterogeneous halo of extremely hot gas, posited to be due to the active galactic nucleus at the core of the central elliptical galaxy.\nM87 is the largest galaxy in the Virgo cluster, and is at a distance of from Earth (redshift 0.0035). It is a major radio source, partially due to its jet of electrons being flung out of the galaxy by its central supermassive black hole. Because this jet is visible in several different wavelengths, it is of interest to astronomers who wish to observe black holes in a unique galaxy. On April 10, 2019, astronomers from the Event Horizon Telescope project released an image of its central black hole; the first direct image of one. With a mass of at least 7.2 billion times that of the Sun, it is the most massive black hole within the immediate vicinity of the Milky Way.\nM84 is another elliptical radio galaxy in the constellation of Virgo; it is at a distance of (redshift 0.0035) as well. Astronomers have surmised that the speed of the gas clouds orbiting the core (approximately ) indicates the presence of an object with a mass 300 million times that of the sun, which is most likely a black hole.\nThe Sombrero Galaxy, M104, is an edge-on spiral galaxy located 28 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0034). It has a bulge at its center made up of older stars that are larger than normal. It is surrounded by large, bright globular clusters and has a very prominent dust lane made up of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\nNGC 4438 is a peculiar galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, at a distance of from Earth (redshift 0.0035). Its supermassive black hole is ejecting jets of matter, creating bubbles with a diameter of up to .\nNGC 4261 also has a black hole from its center with a mass of 1.2 billion solar masses. It is located at a distance of from Earth (redshift 0.0075), and has an unusually dusty disk with a diameter of . Along with M84 and M87, NGC 4261 has strong emissions in the radio spectrum.\nVirgo is also home to the quasar 3C 273 which was the first quasar ever to be identified. With a magnitude of ~12.9, it is also the optically brightest quasar in the sky.\nMythology.\nIn the Babylonian MUL.APIN (c. 10th century BC), part of this constellation was known as \"The Furrow\", representing the goddess Shala and her ear of grain. One star in this constellation, Spica, retains this tradition as it is Latin for \"ear of grain\", one of the major products of the Mesopotamian furrow. For this reason the constellation became associated with fertility.\nThe constellation of Virgo in Hipparchus corresponds to two Babylonian constellations: the \"Furrow\" in the eastern sector of Virgo and the \"Frond of Erua\" in the western sector. The Frond of Erua was depicted as a goddess holding a palm-frond\u00a0\u2013 a motif that still occasionally appears in much later depictions of Virgo.\nEarly Greek astronomy associated the Babylonian constellation with their goddess of wheat, agriculture and autumn, Demeter.\nThe Romans associated it with their goddess Ceres.\nAlternatively, the constellation was sometimes identified as the virgin goddess \"Iustitia\" or Astraea, holding the scales of justice in her hand (that now are separated as the constellation Libra).\nAnother Greek myth from later, Classical times, identifies Virgo as Erigone, the daughter of Icarius of Athens.\nIcarius, who had been favored by Dionysus and was killed by his shepherds while they were intoxicated after which Erigone hanged herself in grief;\nin versions of this myth, Dionysus is said to have placed the father and daughter in the stars as Bo\u00f6tes and Virgo respectively. Another figure who is associated with the constellation Virgo was the spring goddess Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter who had married Hades and resided in the Underworld.\nIn the \"Poeticon Astronomicon\" by Hyginus (1st century BC), \"Parthenos\" () is the daughter of Apollo and Chrysothemis, who died a maiden and was placed among the stars as the constellation. Diodorus Siculus has an alternative account, according to which Parthenos was the daughter of Staphylus and Chrysothemis, sister of Rhoeo and Molpadia (Hemithea). After a suicide attempt she and Hemithea were carried by Apollo to Chersonesus, where she became a local goddess.\nStrabo also mentions a goddess named \"Parthenos\" worshipped throughout Chersonesus.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Virgo sometimes was associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary.\nIn Greek mythology, the constellation is also associated with the daughter of Zeus, Dike the goddess of justice, who is represented holding the scales of justice.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
