He is the chief god of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, with the Dagda portrayed as a father-figure, king, and druid. He is associated with fertility, agriculture, masculinity and strength, as well as magic, druidry and wisdom. He can control life and death (cf. his staff), the weather and crops, as well as time and the seasons.\nHe is often described as a large bearded man or giant wearing a hooded cloak. He owns a magic staff () of dual nature: it kills with one end and brings to life with the other. He also owns a cauldron (the \"coire ansic\") which never runs empty, and a magic harp (\"Uaithne\", though this may be the name of the harper), which will not play unless called by its two bynames, and the harp can fly itself to the Dagda when thus beckoned. He is said to dwell in Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne (Newgrange). Other places associated with or named after him include Uisneach, Grianan of Aileach, Lough Neagh and Knock Iveagh. The Dagda is said to be the husband of the Morr\u00edgan and lover of Boann. His children include Aengus, Brigit, Bodb Derg, Cermait, Aed, and Midir.\nThe Dagda's name is thought to mean \"the good god\" or \"the great god\". His other names include \"Eochu\" or \"Eochaid Ollathair\" (\"horseman, great father\"), and \"Ruad Rofhessa\" (\"mighty one/lord of great knowledge\"). There are indications \"D\u00e1ire\" was another name for him. The death and ancestral god Donn may originally have been a form of the Dagda, and he also has similarities with the later harvest figure Crom Dubh. Several tribal groupings saw the Dagda as an ancestor and were named after him, such as the U\u00ed Echach and the D\u00e1irine.\nThe Dagda has been likened to the Germanic god Odin, the Gaulish god Sucellos, and the Roman god D\u012bs Pater or Jupiter.\nName.\nEtymology.\nThe Old Irish name \"Dagda\" is generally believed to stem from , meaning \"the good god\" or \"the great god\".\nEpithets.\nThe Dagda has several other names or epithets which reflect aspects of his character. \nThe name Eochu is a diminutive form of Eochaid, which also has spelling variants of Eochaidh and Echuid. The death and ancestral god Donn may originally have been a form of the Dagda, who is sometimes called Dagda Donn.\nDescription.\nThe Dagda was one of the kings of the Tuatha De Danann. The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are the race of supernatural beings who conquered the Fomorians, who inhabited Ireland previously, prior to the coming of the Milesians. The M\u00f3rr\u00edgan is described as his wife, his daughter was Brigit, and his lover was Boann, after whom the River Boyne is named, though she was married to Elcmar and with whom he had the god Aengus. Prior to the battle with the Fomorians, he coupled with the goddess of war, the M\u00f3rr\u00edgan, on Samhain. (Cf. ).\nOf Dagda it is stated \"He was a beautiful god of the heathens, for the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann worshipped him: for he was an earth-god to them because of the greatness of his magical power\", in the Middle Irish language \"Coir Anmann\" (The Fitness of Names) says:\nTales depict the Dagda as a figure of immense power. He is said to own a magic staff, club or mace which could kill nine men with one blow; but with the handle he could return the slain to life. He owned a magic harp.\nDagda's staff.\nIn the tract found in the Yellow Book of Lecan, there were three items the Dagda named together, his staff (), there was the shirt (\"l\u00e9ine\") of protection from sickness, and the cloak () of shape-shifting and color-change. The \"great staff\" () had a smooth end which brought the dead back to life (he resuscitated his son Cermait Milb\u00e9l with the smooth end), but the staff's rough end caused instant death.\nThe staff/club is also described in the Ulster Cycle narrative, \"Mesca Ulad\", where it was called the \"terrible iron staff\" ().\nCauldron.\nThe Cauldron of the Dagda is one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, of which it was said \"an assembly used not to go unsatisfied from it\".\nThe cauldron \"signified plenty and generousity\". Hence, his magic cauldron was otherwise known as the \"coire ansic\" (\"the un-dry cauldron\").\nDagda's harp.\nAfter \u00daaithne, the Dagda's harper was abducted by the Fomorians, the Dagda went to the enemy's hall and retrieved his magic harp, which had two names, according to the text of the \"Cath Maige Tuired\" (\"Second Battle of Moytura\"). And when the Dagda called upon his harp by its two names: \"Come Daur D\u00e1 Bl\u00e1o / Come C\u00f3ir Cetharchair /\nCome summer, come winter..\" the harp leapt off the wall and came to him. The harp was forbidden by the Dagda from issuing any sound, unless thus called upon by the names, which translate to \"Oak of Two Meadows\" and \"the Four Angled Music\"; The Dagda had the skill to play the \"Three Strains\" (joy, sorrow, sleep) which he used to immobilize the Fomorians and escape.\nOther possessions.\nHe possessed two pigs, one of which was always growing whilst the other was always roasting, and ever-laden fruit trees. He is also described as being the owner of a black-maned heifer that was given to him for his labours prior to the Second Battle of Moytura. When the heifer calls her calf, all the cattle of Ireland taken by the Fomorians as tribute graze.\nFamily.\nThe Dagda is said to be husband of the Morr\u00edgan, who is called his \"envious wife\". His children include Aengus, Cermait, and Aed (often called the three sons of the Dagda), Brigit and Bodb Derg. He is said to have two brothers, Nuada and Ogma, but this may be an instance of the tendency to triplicate deities. Elsewhere the Dagda is linked exclusively with Ogma, and the two are called \"the two brothers.\" In the Dindsenchas, the Dagda is given a daughter named Ainge, for whom he makes a twig basket or tub that always leaks when the tide is in and never leaks when it is going out. The Dagda's father is named Elatha son of Delbeath. Englec, the daughter of Elcmar, is named as a consort of the Dagda and the mother of his \"swift son\". Echtgi the loathesome is another daughter of the Dagda's named in the Banshenchas.\nMythology.\nBefore the Second Battle of Mag Tuired the Dagda builds a fortress for Bres called D\u00fan Brese and is also forced by the Fomorian kings Elatha, Indech, and Tethra to build raths. In the lead up to the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, when Lugh asks Dagda what power he will wield over the Fomorian host, he responds that he \"will take the side of the men of Erin both in mutual smiting and destruction and wizardry. Their bones under my club will be as many as hailstones under feet of herds of horses\".\nThe Dagda has an affair with Boann, the goddess of the River Boyne. She lives at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne with her husband Elcmar. The Dagda impregnates her after sending Elcmar away on a one-day errand. To hide the pregnancy from Elcmar, the Dagda casts a spell on him, making \"the sun stand still\" so he will not notice the passing of time. Meanwhile, Boann gives birth to Aengus, who is also known as Macc\u00e1n \u00d3g ('the young son'). Eventually, Aengus learns that the Dagda is his true father and asks him for a portion of land. In some versions of the tale, the Dagda helps Aengus take ownership of the Br\u00fa from Elcmar. Aengus asks and is given the Br\u00fa for \"l\u00e1a ocus aidche\"; because in Old Irish this could mean either \"a day and a night\" or \"day and night\", Aengus claims it forever. Other versions have Aengus taking over the Br\u00fa from the Dagda himself by using the same trick.\nIt has been suggested that this tale represents the winter solstice illumination of Newgrange at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne, during which the sunbeam (the Dagda) enters the inner chamber (the womb of Boann) when the sun's path stands still. The word \"solstice\" (Irish \"grianstad\") means sun-standstill. The conception of Aengus may represent the 'rebirth' of the sun at the winter solstice, him taking over the Br\u00fa from an older god representing the growing sun taking over from the waning sun.\nThe \"Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne\", tells the story of how B\u00f3and conceives Aengus by the Dagda. In the Aislinge Oengusso or Dream of Aengus the Dagda and Boand help Aengus to find a mysterious woman who he has fallen in love with in his dreams.\nIn a poem about Mag Muirthemne, the Dagda banishes an octopus with his \"mace of wrath\" using the following words: \"Turn thy hollow head! Turn thy ravening body! Turn thy resorbent forehead! Avaunt! Begone!\", the sea receded with the creature and the plain of Mag Muirthemne was left behind.\nIn the \"Dindsenchas\" the Dagda is described as swift with a poison draught and as a justly dealing lord. He is also called a King of Erin with hosts of hostages, a noble, slender prince, and the father of Cermait, Aengus, and Aed.\nHe is credited with a seventy- or eighty-year reign (depending on source) over the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, before dying at Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne, finally succumbing to a wound inflicted by Cethlenn during the battle of Mag Tuired.\nParallels.\nThe Dagda has similarities with the later harvest figure Crom Dubh. He also has similarities with the Gaulish god Sucellos, who is depicted with a hammer and a pot, and the Roman god D\u012bs Pater.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30961", "revid": "49409394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30961", "title": "Tuba", "text": "Brass instrument\nThe tuba (; ) is the largest and lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by lip vibration\u00a0\u2013 a buzz\u00a0\u2013 into a mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid-19th\u00a0century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band, and largely replaced the ophicleide. \"Tuba\" is Latin for \"trumpet\".\nA person who plays the tuba is called a tubaist, a tubist, or simply a tuba player. In a British brass band or military band, they are known as bass players.\nHistory.\nPrussian Patent No. 19 was granted on 12 September 1835 to the military bandmaster Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht and Johann Gottfried Moritz, a Berlin-based instrument maker, for a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt; (lit.\u2009'bass tuba') in F. The original Wieprecht and Moritz instrument used five valves, forerunners of the modern P\u00e9rinet piston valves. The first tenor tuba was invented in 1838 by Moritz's son, Carl Wilhelm Moritz.\nThe addition of valves made it possible to play low in the harmonic series of the instrument and still have a complete selection of notes. Prior to the invention of valves, brass instruments were limited to notes in the harmonic series, and were thus generally played very high with respect to their fundamental pitch. Harmonics starting three octaves above the fundamental pitch are about a whole step apart, making a useful variety of notes possible.\nThe ophicleide used a bowl-shaped brass instrument mouthpiece but had keys and tone holes similar to those of a modern saxophone. Another forerunner to the tuba, the serpent, was a bass instrument shaped in a wavy form to make the tone holes accessible to the player. Tone holes change the pitch by providing an intentional leak in the bugle of the instrument, but this system has a pronounced effect on the timbre. By using valves instead, the tuba could produce a smoother tone, which led to its popularity. Tubas were mostly used by French composers, especially Hector Berlioz, who famously used the ophicleide in his compositions \"Symphonie fantastique\" and \"Benvenuto Cellini\". These pieces are now normally performed on F or CC tuba.\nAdolphe Sax, like Wieprecht, was interested in marketing families of instruments ranging from soprano to bass, and developed a series of brass instruments known as saxhorns. The instruments developed by Sax were generally pitched in E\u266d and B\u266d, while the Wieprecht \"basstuba\" and the subsequent \u010cerven\u00fd contrabass tuba were pitched in F and C (see below on pitch systems). Sax's instruments gained dominance in France, and later in Britain and America, as a result of the movements of popular instrument makers such as Gustave Auguste Besson (who moved from France to Britain) and Henry Distin (who eventually found his way to America).\nThe cimbasso is also seen instead of a tuba in the orchestral repertoire. The Italian word , first appearing in the early 19th century, is thought to be a contraction used by musicians of the term or (lit.\u2009'bass horn'), sometimes appearing in scores as \"c. basso\" or \"c. in basso\". The original design was inspired by the ophicleide and the bassoon. The cimbasso is sometimes used in historically accurate performances and is commonly called for in film and video game soundtracks.\nRole.\nAn orchestra usually has a single tuba, though an additional tuba may be requested. It serves as the bass of the orchestral brass section and it can reinforce the bass voices of the strings and woodwinds. It provides the bass of brass quintets and choirs (though many small brass ensembles will use the euphonium or bass trombone as the lowest voice). It is the principal bass instrument in concert bands, brass bands and military bands, and those ensembles generally have two to four tubas. It is also a solo instrument.\nTubas are used in marching bands, drum and bugle corps and in many jazz bands (see below). In British style brass bands, two E\u266d and two B\u266d tubas are used and are referred to as \"basses\".\nWell known and influential parts for the tuba include:\nConcertos have been written for the tuba by many notable composers, including Ralph Vaughan Williams (Tuba Concerto), Edward Gregson, John Williams, Alexander Arutiunian, Eric Ewazen, James Barnes, Joseph Hallman, Martin Ellerby, Philip Sparke, Kalevi Aho, Josef Tal, Bruce Broughton (Tuba Concerto), John Golland, Roger Steptoe, David Carlson, Jennifer Higdon (Tuba Concerto), and Marcus Paus (\"Tuba Mirum\").\nTypes and construction.\nTubas are found in various pitches, most commonly in F, E\u266d, C, or B\u266d. The key of a tuba depends on the fundamental pitch of the instrument, or fundamental note in the series of overtones (also called \"partials\") available without any valves being pressed. Tubas in different keys use different lengths of tubing. The main tube of a B\u266d tuba is approximately long, while that of a C tuba is , of an E\u266d tuba , and of an F tuba . The instrument has a conical bore, meaning the bore diameter increases as a function of the tubing length from the mouthpiece to the bell. The conical bore causes the instrument to produce a preponderance of even-order harmonics.\nA tuba with its tubing wrapped for placing the instrument on the player's lap is usually called a \"concert tuba\" or simply a \"tuba\". Tubas with the bell pointing forward (\"pavillon tournant\") instead of upward are often called \"recording tubas\" because of their popularity in the early days of recorded music, as their sound could more easily be directed at the recording microphone. When wrapped to surround the body for cavalry bands on horseback or marching, it is traditionally known as a helicon. The modern sousaphone, named after American bandmaster John Philip Sousa, resembles a helicon with the bell pointed up (in the original models as the J. W. Pepper prototype and Sousa's concert instruments) and then curved to point forward (as developed by Conn and others). Some ancestors of the tuba, such as the military \"bombardon\", had unusual valve and bore arrangements compared to modern tubas.\nDuring the American Civil War, most brass bands used a branch of the brass family known as \"saxhorns\", which, by today's standards, have a narrower bore taper than tuba\u2014the same as true cornets and baritones but distinct from trumpets, euphoniums, and others with different tapers or no taper. Around the start of the Civil War, saxhorns manufactured for military use in the USA were commonly wrapped with the bell pointing backwards over the player's shoulder, and these were known as \"over-the-shoulder saxhorns\", and came in sizes from cornets down to E\u266d basses. However, the E\u266d bass, even though it shared the same tube length as a modern E\u266d tuba, has a narrower bore and as such cannot be called by the name \"tuba\" except as a convenience when comparing it to other sizes of the saxhorn.\nMost music for the tuba is written in bass clef in concert pitch, so tuba players must know the correct fingerings for their specific instruments. Traditional British-style brass band parts for the tuba are usually written in treble clef, with the B\u266d tuba sounding two octaves and one step below and the E\u266d tuba sounding one octave and a major sixth below the written pitch. This allows musicians to change instruments without learning new fingerings for the same written music. Consequently, when its music is written in treble clef, the tuba is a transposing instrument but not when the music is in bass clef.\nThe lowest pitched tubas are the contrabass tubas, pitched in C or B\u266d, referred to as CC and BB\u266d tubas respectively, based on a traditional distortion of a now-obsolete octave naming convention. The fundamental pitch of a CC tuba is 32\u00a0Hz, and for a BB\u266d tuba, 29\u00a0Hz. The CC tuba is used as an orchestral and concert band instrument in the U.S., but BB\u266d tubas are the contrabass tuba of choice in German, Austrian, and Russian orchestras. In the United States, the BB\u266d tuba is the most common in schools (largely due to the use of BB\u266d sousaphones in high school marching bands) and for adult amateurs. Many professionals in the U.S. play CC tubas, with BB\u266d also common, and many train in the use of all four pitches of tubas.\nThe next smaller tubas are the bass tubas, pitched in F or E\u266d (a fourth above the contrabass tubas). The E\u266d tuba often plays an octave above the contrabass tubas in brass bands, and the F tuba is commonly used by professional players as a solo instrument and, in America, to play higher parts in the classical repertoire (or parts that were originally written for the F tuba, as is the case with Berlioz). In most of Europe, the F tuba is the standard orchestral instrument, supplemented by the CC or BB\u266d only when the extra weight is desired. Wagner, for example, specifically notates the low tuba parts for \"Kontrabasstuba,\" which are played on CC or BB\u266d tubas in most regions. In the United Kingdom, the E\u266d is the standard orchestral tuba.\nThe euphonium is sometimes referred to as a tenor tuba and is pitched in B\u266d, one octave higher than the BB\u266d contrabass tuba. The term \"tenor tuba\" is often used more specifically to refer to B\u266d rotary-valved tubas pitched in the same octave as euphoniums. The \"Small Swiss Tuba in C\" is a tenor tuba pitched in C, and provided with 6 valves to make the lower notes in the orchestral repertoire possible. The French C tuba was the standard instrument in French orchestras until overtaken by F and C tubas since the Second World War. One popular example of the use of the French C tuba is the \"Byd\u0142o\" movement in Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", though the rest of the work is scored for this instrument as well.\nA very small number of larger subcontrabass tubas exist as novelty instruments. Two in 36\u2032 B\u266d, an octave below the B\u266d contrabass, were built by Gustave Besson on the suggestion of Patrick Gilmore, but were not completed until after his death in 1892. One survives in the Harvard University Band, where it was restored and features occasionally in concerts. Another with four valves was exhibited by maker Bohland &amp; Fuchs in 1928, in height with a bell, weighing . In 1956, British musician Gerard Hoffnung used a 32\u2032 C subcontrabass tuba, built c.\u20091899 by German maker Rudolf Sander, in the first of his comedy Hoffnung Music Festivals. In 2010, a fully playable \"Riesentuba\" in 36\u2032 B\u266d with four rotary valves was built and resides in the Markneukirchen Musical Instrument Museum, Germany.\nSize vs. pitch.\nIn addition to the length of the instrument, which dictates the fundamental pitch, tubas also vary in the overall width of the tubing sections. Tuba sizes are usually denoted by a quarter system, with &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20444 designating a normal, full-size tuba. Larger rotary instruments are known as \"kaiser tubas\" and are often denoted &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5\u20444. Larger piston tubas, particularly those with front action, are sometimes known as \"grand orchestral tubas\" (examples: the Conn 36J Orchestra Grand Bass from the 1930s, and the current model Hirsbrunner HB-50 \"Grand Orchestral\", which is a replica of the large York tubas owned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra). Grand orchestral tubas are generally described as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6\u20444 tubas. Smaller instruments may be described as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 instruments. \nNo standards exist for these designations, and their use is up to manufacturers, who usually use them to distinguish among the instruments in their own product line. The size designation is related to the larger outer branches and not to the bore of the tubing at the valves, though the bore is usually reported in instrument specifications. The quarter system is also not directly related to bell size, though there is typically a correlation. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 tubas are common in American grade schools for use by young tuba players for whom a full-size instrument might be too cumbersome. Though smaller and lighter, they are tuned and keyed identically to full-size tubas of the same pitch, although they usually have 3 rather than 4 or 5 valves.\nValves.\nTubas are made with either piston or rotary valves. Rotary valves, invented by Joseph Riedl, are based on a design included in the original valve patents by Friedrich Bl\u00fchmel and Heinrich St\u00f6lzel in 1818. \u010cerven\u00fd of Graslitz was the first to use true rotary valves, starting in the 1840s or 1850s. Modern piston valves were developed by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rinet for the saxhorn family of instruments promoted by Adolphe Sax around the same time. Pistons may either be oriented to point to the top of the instrument (top-action) or out the front of the instrument (front-action or side-action).\nPiston valves require more maintenance than rotary valves \u2013 they require regular oiling to keep them freely operating, while rotary valves are sealed and seldom require oiling. Piston valves are easy to disassemble and re-assemble, while rotary valve disassembly and re-assembly is much more difficult and is generally left to qualified instrument repair persons.\nTubas generally have from three to six valves, though some rare exceptions exist. Three-valve tubas are generally the least expensive and are almost exclusively used by amateurs, and the sousaphone (a marching version of a BB\u266d tuba) usually has three valves. Among advanced players, four and five valve tubas are by far the most common choices, with six-valve tubas being relatively rare except among F tubas, which mostly have five or six valves.\nThe valves add tubing to the main tube of the instrument, thus lowering its fundamental pitch. The first valve lowers the pitch by a whole step (two semitones), the second valve by a semitone, and the third valve by three semitones. Used in combination, the valve tubing is too short and the resulting pitch tends to be sharp. For example, a BB\u266d tuba becomes (in effect) an A\u266d tuba when the first valve is depressed. The third valve is long enough to lower the pitch of a BB\u266d tuba by three semitones, but it is not long enough to lower the pitch of an A\u266d tuba by three semitones. Thus, the first and third valves used in combination lower the pitch by something \"just short\" of five semitones, and the first three valves used in combination are nearly a quarter tone sharp.\nThe fourth valve lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth, so it can be used in place of the combination of the first and third valves. When tuned properly it helps solve the issue of valve combinations being too sharp. Using the fourth valve with the first three valves allows the musician to extend the instrument's range down to the fundamental pitch. As with other valve combinations that lengthen the tubing considerably, some of these lower notes can be sharp.\nA fifth and sixth valve, if fitted, are used to provide alternative fingering possibilities to improve intonation, and are also used to reach into the low register of the instrument where all the valves will be used in combination to fill the first octave between the fundamental pitch and the next available note on the open tube. The fifth and sixth valves also give the musician the ability to trill more smoothly or to use alternative fingerings for ease of playing. This type of tuba is what is most found in orchestras and wind bands around the world.\nThe bass tuba in F is pitched a fifth above the BB\u266d tuba and a fourth above the CC tuba, so it needs additional tubing length beyond that provided by four valves to play securely down to a low F as required in much tuba music. The fifth valve is commonly tuned to a flat whole step, so that when used with the fourth valve, it gives an in-tune low B\u266d. The sixth valve is commonly tuned as a flat half step, allowing the F tuba to play low G as 1-4-5-6 and low G\u266d as 1-2-4-5-6. In CC tubas with five valves, the fifth valve may be tuned as a flat whole step or as a minor third depending on the instrument.\nCompensating valves.\nSome tubas have a compensating system to allow accurate tuning when using several valves in combination, simplifying fingering and removing the need to constantly adjust slide positions. The most popular of the automatic compensation systems was invented by Blaikley (Bevan, 1874) and was patented by Boosey (later, Boosey and Hawkes, which also, later still, produced Besson instruments). The patent on the system limited its application outside of Britain, and to this day, tubas with compensating valves are primarily popular in the United Kingdom and countries of the former British Empire. \nThe Blaikley design plumbs the instrument so that if the fourth valve is used, the air is sent back through a second set of branches in the first three valves to compensate for the combination of valves. This does have the disadvantage of making the instrument significantly more \"stuffy\" or resistant to air flow when compared to a non-compensating tuba. This is due to the need for the air to flow through the valves twice. It also makes the instrument heavier. But many prefer this approach to having additional valves\u00a0\u2013 or to the manipulation of tuning slides while playing\u00a0\u2013 to achieve improved intonation within an ensemble. \nMost modern professional-grade euphoniums also now feature Blaikley-style compensating valves.\nResonance and false tones.\nSome tubas have a strong and useful resonance that is not in the well-known harmonic series. For example, most large B\u266d tubas have a strong resonance at low E\u266d (E\u266d1, 39\u00a0Hz), which is between the fundamental and the second harmonic (an octave higher than the fundamental). These alternative resonances are often known as false tones or privileged tones. Adding the six semitones provided by the three valves, these alternative resonances let the instrument play chromatically down to the fundamental of the open bugle (which is a 29\u00a0Hz B\u266d0). The addition of valves below that note can lower the instrument a further six semitones to a 20\u00a0Hz E0. Thus, even three-valved instruments with good alternative resonances can produce very low sounds in the hands of skilled players; instruments with four valves can play even lower. \nThe lowest note in the widely known repertoire is a 16\u00a0Hz double-pedal C0 in the William Kraft piece \"Encounters II\", which is often played using a timed flutter tongue rather than by buzzing the lips. The fundamental of this pitch borders on infrasound and its overtones define the pitch in the listener's ear.\nMaterials and finish.\nThe tuba is generally constructed of brass, which is either unfinished, lacquered or electro-plated with nickel, gold or silver. Unfinished brass will eventually tarnish and thus must be periodically polished to maintain its appearance.\nManufacturers.\nThere are many types of tubas that are manufactured in Europe, the United States, and Asia. In Europe, the predominant models that are professionally used are Meinl-Weston (Germany) and Miraphone (Germany). Asian brands include the Yamaha Corporation (Japan) and Jupiter Instruments (Taiwan). Holton Instrument Company and King Musical Instruments are some of the most well known brands from the United States.\nVariations.\nSome tubas are capable of being converted into a marching style, known as \"marching tubas\". A leadpipe can be manually screwed on next to the valves. The tuba is then usually rested on the left shoulder (although some tubas allow use of the right shoulder), with the bell facing directly in front of the player. Some marching tubas are made only for marching, and cannot be converted into a concert model. \nMost marching bands opt for the sousaphone, an instrument that is easier to carry since it was invented specifically for this and almost always cheaper than a true marching tuba. The earlier helicon is still used by bands in Europe and other parts of the world. Drum and bugle corps players, however, generally use marching tubas or Contrabass bugles. \nStandard tubas can also be played whilst standing and marching, which is the usual practice in British brass bands and military bands. With the comfort of the player in mind, companies have provided harnesses that sometimes use a strap joined to the tuba with two rings, a 'sack' to hold the bottom of the tuba, or numerous straps holding the larger parts of tubing on the tuba. The strap(s) goes over the shoulder like a sash or sit at the waist, so the musician can play the instrument in the same position as when sitting.\nJazz.\nThe tuba has been used in jazz since the genre's inception. In the earliest years, bands often used a tuba for outdoor playing and a double bass for indoor performances. In this context, the tuba was sometimes called \"brass bass\", as opposed to the double bass \"(string bass)\". Many musicians played both instruments.\nThis practice was mostly used in the New Orleans jazz scene. The tuba was used most frequently with the Louis Armstrong groups and prominent in the album \"Hot Five\".\nIn modern jazz, it is not unknown for their players to take solos. New Orleans style brass bands like the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and the Rebirth Brass Band use a sousaphone as the bass instrument. Bill Barber played tuba on several Miles Davis albums, including the sessions compiled as the \"Birth of the Cool\" and \"Miles Ahead\". New York City-based tubist Marcus Rojas performed frequently with Henry Threadgill. Starting in 1955, Stan Kenton made his fifth trombonist double on tuba, namely on ballads to make use of the tuba's distinct warm, enveloping sound.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Apostle Paul met him during his second missionary journey and he became Paul's companion and missionary partner along with Silas. The New Testament indicates that Timothy traveled with Paul the Apostle, who was also his mentor. He is addressed as the recipient of the First and Second Epistles to Timothy in the New Testament, \nLife.\nTimothy was a native of Lystra or of Derbe in Lycaonia (Asia Minor). When Paul and Barnabas first visited Lystra, Paul healed a person crippled from birth, leading many of the inhabitants to accept his teaching. When he returned a few years later with Silas, Timothy was already a respected member of the Christian congregation, as were his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice, both Jews. In 2 Timothy 1:5, his mother and grandmother are noted as eminent for their piety and faith. Timothy is said to have been acquainted with the Scriptures since childhood. In 1 Corinthians 16:10, there is a suggestion that he was by nature reserved and timid: \"When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord\".\nTimothy's father was a Greek Gentile. Thus Timothy had not been circumcised and Paul now ensured that this was done, according to Acts 16:1-3, to ensure Timothy's acceptability to the Jews whom they would be evangelizing. According to John William McGarvey: \u201cYet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this \u2018on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters.\u2019\u201d This did not compromise the decision made at the Council of Jerusalem, that gentile believers were not required to be circumcised.\nMinistry.\nTimothy became St Paul's disciple, and later his constant companion and co-worker in preaching. In the year 52, Paul and Silas took Timothy along with them on their journey to Macedonia. Augustine extols his zeal and disinterestedness in immediately forsaking his country, his house, and his parents, to follow the apostle, to share in his poverty and sufferings. Timothy may have been subject to ill health or \"frequent ailments\", and Paul encouraged him to \"use a little wine for your stomach's sake\".\nWhen Paul went on to Athens, Silas and Timothy stayed for some time at Beroea and Thessalonica before joining Paul at Corinth. suggests that from Corinth, Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonika to enquire about the community's continued faith, reporting back that it was in good shape. Timothy next appears in Acts during Paul's stay in Ephesus (54\u201357), and in late A. D. 56 or early 57 Paul sent him forth to Macedonia with the aim that he would eventually arrive at Corinth. Timothy arrived at Corinth just after Paul's letter 1 Corinthians reached that city.\nTimothy was with Paul in Corinth during the winter of 57\u201358 when Paul dispatched his Letter to the Romans. According to Acts 20:3\u20136, Timothy was with Paul in Macedonia just before Passover in 58; he left the city before Paul, going ahead of him to await Paul in Troas. \"That is the last mention of Timothy in Acts\", Raymond Brown notes. In the year 64, Paul left Timothy at Ephesus, to govern that church.\nHis relationship with Paul was close. Timothy's name appears as the co-author on 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Paul wrote to the Philippians about Timothy, \"I have no one like him.\" When Paul was in prison and awaiting martyrdom, he summoned his faithful friend Timothy for a last farewell.\nThat Timothy was jailed at least once during the period of the writing of the New Testament is implied by the writer of Hebrews mentioning Timothy's release at the end of the epistle.\nAlthough not stated in the New Testament, other sources have records of the apostle's death. The apocryphal \"Acts of Timothy\" states that in the year 97 AD, the 80-year-old bishop tried to halt a procession in honor of the goddess Diana by preaching the Gospel. The angry pagans beat him, dragged him through the streets, and stoned him to death.\nVeneration.\nTimothy is venerated as an apostle, saint, and martyr by the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 22 January. The General Roman Calendar venerates Timothy together with Titus by a memorial on 26 January, the day after the Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul. From the 13th century until 1969 the feast of Timothy (alone) was on 24 January, the day before that of the Conversion of Saint Paul. Along with Titus and Silas, Timothy is commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 26 January. Timothy's feast is kept by the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod on 24 January.\nTimothy is honored on the calendars of the Church of England and the Episcopal Church (with Titus) on 26 January.\nIn the 4th century, the relics of Timothy were transferred from Ephesus to Constantinople and placed in the Church of the Holy Apostles near the tombs of Andrew and Luke. Later on in the 13th century, the relics seem to have been taken to Italy by a count returning from the crusades, and buried around 1239 in the Termoli Cathedral. The remains were rediscovered in 1945, during restoration work.\nPatronage.\nTimothy is invoked against stomach and intestinal disorders.\nPastoral Epistles.\nThere are two letters to Timothy attributed to Paul the Apostle, the First Epistle to Timothy and the Second Epistle to Timothy. These \u2013 along with the Epistle to Titus \u2013 are called the Pastoral Epistles, and are considered pseudepigraphic by some modern scholars, including Bart Ehrman, Raymond Collins, and David E. Aune.\nFirst Timothy (c. 62\u201364).\nThe author of this epistle writes to Timothy concerning the organization of the church and Timothy's own leadership within the body. Major themes include the use of The Law, warnings against false doctrine such as Encratism, instructions for prayer, roles of women in the church, qualifications for leaders of the church, and the treatment of widows, elders, masters, youth, and church members in general.\nSecond Timothy (c. 62\u201364).\nAccording to the letter, Paul urges Timothy not to have a \"spirit of timidity\" and not to \"be ashamed to testify about our Lord\". He also entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him. Paul clearly anticipates his being put to death and realities beyond in his valedictory found in 2 Timothy 4:6\u20138. He exhorts his spiritual \"son\" Timothy to all diligence and steadfastness in the face of false teachings, with advice about combating them with reference to the teachings of the past, and to patience under persecution, and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office, with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of the quick and the dead (God).\nActs of Timothy.\nThe Acts of Timothy (Acta Timothei) is a work of New Testament apocrypha, most likely from the 5th century. The Acts tell how Paul had consecrated Timothy as bishop during Nero's reign on the occasion of a visit to Ephesus which they made together. Then, under Nerva, Timothy suffers a martyr's death during a pagan festival. Timothy \"attempts to put an end to the wild and violent goings-on but himself falls victim to the orgies.\"\nThe Acts of Timothy contain almost as much material about John the Evangelist, who was also a resident of Ephesus as they do about Timothy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "30964", "revid": "34001628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30964", "title": "Third Epistle of John", "text": "Book of the New Testament\nThe Third Epistle of John is the third-to-last book of the New Testament and the Christian Bible as a whole, and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John. The Third Epistle of John is a personal letter sent by \"the elder\" (the presbyter) to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived. The purpose of the letter is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author of the letter.\nEarly church literature contains no mention of the epistle, with the first reference to it appearing in the middle of the third century AD. This lack of documentation, though likely due to the extreme brevity of the epistle, caused early church writers to doubt its authenticity until the early 5th century, when it was accepted into the canon along with the other two epistles of John. The language of 3 John echoes that of the Gospel of John, which is conventionally dated to around AD 90, so the epistle was likely written near the end of the first century. Others contest this view, such as the scholar John A. T. Robinson, who dates 3 John to c.\u2009AD 60\u201365. The location of writing is unknown, but tradition places it in Ephesus. The epistle is found in many of the oldest New Testament manuscripts, and its text is free of major discrepancies or textual variants.\nContent.\nThere is no doctrine laid out in 3 John, which is strictly a personal letter, but the overall theme is the importance of hospitality, especially when it comes to men who were working to spread the gospel. Third John is the shortest book of the Bible by word count, though 2 John has fewer verses. 3 John has 15 verses in the critical SBL Greek New Testament text, or 14 in the Textus Receptus.\nIt is the only New Testament book which does not contain the names \"Jesus\" or \"Christ\". The original Greek uses the term \u1f48\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (Onomatos, verse 7) generally translated \"Name\" and referring specifically to the \"Name of Jesus\", but the text does not say \"Jesus\" or \"Christ\".\nGreeting and introduction.\nThe letter is written to a man named Gaius. Gaius seems to have been a wealthy man, since the epistle's author, who identifies himself only as \"the Elder\", did not think it would impose unduly on him to host some traveling preachers for a short time. The Elder may have converted Gaius, since he calls Gaius his \"child\" in the faith. The \"Apostolic Constitutions\" VII.46.9 records that Gaius was made bishop of Pergamon, though there is no early support for this statement.\nThe name Gaius occurs four other times in the New Testament. First, a Christian Gaius is mentioned in Macedonia as a traveling companion of Paul, along with Aristarchus (Acts 19:29). One chapter later, a Gaius from Derbe is named as one of Paul's seven traveling companions who waited for him at Troas (Acts 20:4). Next, a Gaius is mentioned residing in Corinth as being one of only a few people there (the others being Crispus and the household of Stephanas) who were baptised by Paul, who founded the Church in that city (1 Corinthians 1:14). Lastly, a Gaius is referred to in a final greeting portion of the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:23) as Paul's \"host\" and also host of the whole church, in whatever city Paul is writing from at the time (probably Corinth). However, there is no reason to suppose that any of these men were the Gaius of 3 John.\n\"Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.\"\nVerse 2.\nThis verse, where the author wishes material prosperity upon Gaius similar to the prosperity of his soul, is a commonly used proof text within prosperity gospel teachings; opponents of the prosperity gospel consider the verse to be little more than well-wishing.\nMissionaries.\nThe Elder continues the letter by commending Gaius for his loyalty and his hospitality towards a group of traveling \"brothers\". The \"brothers\" are brothers in the faith or missionaries, who in accordance with Jesus's command in Mark 6:8\u20139 have set out on a journey without any money. The Elder then goes on to request that Gaius provide for the brothers to continue their journey.\nOpposition of Diotrephes.\nThe Elder next describes his conflict with Diotrephes, who does not acknowledge the Elder's authority and is excommunicating those, like Gaius, who welcome missionaries sent by the Elder. In verse 9 the Elder mentions a previous letter which he has written to the church which was suppressed by Diotrephes, and says that he intends to visit the church and to confront Diotrephes. \"The church\" is apparently known to Gaius, but he is likely not a member of it, since otherwise the Elder would not need to provide him with information about Diotrephes's activities. The dispute between Diotrephes and the Elder seems to be based on church leadership and authority rather than doctrine, since the Elder does not accuse Diotrephes of teaching heresy.\nMost scholars do not connect the letter the Elder mentions with 2 John, since 3 John does not contain any reference to the doctrinal controversy described in 2 John, and argue that the Elder is here referring to a previous letter of recommendation. John Painter, however, argues the Elder is in fact referring to 2 John, since there is overlap between 2 John 9 and the theme of hospitality in 3 John.\nThe Elder closes this section with an entreaty to Gaius: \"Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.\" This injunction is reminiscent of several passages in 1 John (2:3\u20135, 3:4\u201310, 4:7).\nFinal greetings and conclusion.\nVerse 12 introduces another man named Demetrius, who according to the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" VII.46.9 was ordained by John as bishop of Philadelphia (modern Amman, Jordan). Demetrius was probably a member of the group of missionaries discussed earlier in the letter, and 3 John likely serves as a recommendation letter to Gaius about Demetrius. Recommendation letters were quite common in the early church, as evidenced by 2 Corinthians 3:1, Romans 16:1\u20132, and Colossians 4:7\u20138.\nThe Elder, before ending the letter, says that he has many other things to tell to Gaius, and plans to make a journey to see him in the near future, using almost the exact language of 2 John 12. The closing verse, \"Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, one by one\", is typical of contemporary correspondence, with \"Peace be to you\" a greeting adopted by Christians from the Jews.\nAuthorship.\n3 John was almost certainly written by the same author who wrote 2 John, and likely 1 John as well. This individual may have been John the Evangelist himself or someone else, perhaps John the Presbyter, though according to scholar C. H. Dodd, \"If we attempt to\u00a0... identify the anonymous author of these epistles with some known individual, we have little but surmise to go on.\"\nThere are many similarities between 2 and 3 John. Both follow the format of other personal letters of the era; in both the author self-identifies as \"the Presbyter\", a term which literally means \"the elder\"; and both deal with themes of hospitality and conflict within the church. They are also extremely similar in length, probably because they were both written to fit on one papyrus sheet.\n3 John is also linguistically similar to both 2 John and other Johannine works. Of 99 different words used, 21 are unimportant words like \"and\" or \"the\", leaving 78 significant words. 23 of these do not appear in 1 John or the Gospel of John, of which four are unique to 3 John, one is common to 2 and 3 John, and two are found in both 2 and 3 John as well as in other New Testament writings. Approximately 30% of the significant words in 3 John do not appear in 1 John or the Gospel, compared to 20% for 2 John. These considerations indicate a close affinity between 2 and 3 John, though 2 John is more strongly connected with 1 John than it is with 3 John. A minority of scholars, however, argue against common authorship of 2 and 3 John, and Rudolf Bultmann held that 2 John was a forgery based on 3 John.\nIf 3 John was written by John the Apostle, however, it is strange that Diotrephes would oppose him since the apostles were highly respected in the early church. One possible alternative view of the epistle's authorship arises from a fragment written by Papias of Hierapolis and quoted by Eusebius which mentions a man named \"the Presbyter John\". However, since nothing else is known of this individual it is not possible to positively identify him as the author of 3 John.\nDate and location of writing.\nAll three letters of John were likely written within a few years of each other, and internal evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them in the second half of the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.\nDodd argues for a date between 96 and 110 A.D., concluding from the absence of references to persecution in the letters that they were probably written after the harsh reign (AD 81\u201396) of the Roman emperor Domitian, whose persecution of Christians seems to have prompted the writing of the Book of Revelation. Dodd notes, however, that they could have been written in the pre-Domitian era, which is likely if the author was a personal disciple of Jesus. Marshall suggests a date of between the 60s and 90s. Rensberger suggests a dating of around 100, assuming that the Gospel of John was written in the 90s and the letters must have followed after. Brown argues for a date of between 100 and 110, with all three letters composed in close time proximity. A date past 110\u2013115 is unlikely, as parts of 1 John and 2 John are quoted by Polycarp and Papias.\nThe letters do not indicate the location of authorship, but since the earliest quotations of them (in the writings of Polycarp, Papias, and Irenaeus) come from the province of Asia Minor, it is likely that the epistles were also written in Asia. Church tradition typically places them in the city of Ephesus.\nManuscripts.\n3 John is preserved in many of the old manuscripts of the New Testament. Of the Greek great uncial codices, codices Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, and Vaticanus contain all three Johannine epistles, while Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus contains 3 John 3\u201315 along with 1 John 1:1\u20134. Codex Bezae, while missing most of the Catholic epistles, contains 3 John 11\u201315 in Latin translation. In languages other than Greek, the Vulgate and the Sahidic, Armenian, Philoxenian Syriac, and Ethiopian versions contain all three epistles. Between the different copies there are no major difficulties or differences, meaning that there is very little doubt over determining the original text.\nCanonical history.\nThere are some doubtful similarities between passages in the Johannine epistles and the writings of Polycarp and Papias, but the earliest definitive references to the epistles come from the late second century. Irenaeus in \"Adversus Haereses\" 3.16.8 (written c.\u2009180), quotes 2 John 7 and 8, and in the next sentence 1 John 4:1, 2, but does not distinguish between 1 and 2 John; he does not quote from 3 John. The Muratorian Canon seems to refer to two letters of John only, though it is possible to interpret it as referring to three. 1 John is extensively cited by Tertullian, who died in 215, and Clement of Alexandria, in addition to quoting 1 John, wrote a commentary on 2 John in his \"Adumbrationes\". All three Johannine epistles were recognized by the 39th festal letter of Athanasius, the Synod of Hippo and the Council of Carthage (397). Additionally Didymus the Blind wrote a commentary on all three epistles, showing that by the early 5th century they were being considered as a single unit.\nThe first reference to 3 John is in the middle of the third century; Eusebius says that Origen knew of both 2 and 3 John, however Origen is reported as saying \"all do not consider them genuine\". Similarly, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Origen's pupil, was aware of a \"reputed Second or Third Epistle of John\". Also around this time 3 John is thought to have been known in North Africa as it was referred to in the \"Sententiae Episcoporum\" produced by the Seventh Council of Carthage. There was doubt about the authority of 3 John, however, with Eusebius listing it and 2 John as \"disputed books\" despite describing them as \"well-known and acknowledged by most\". Although Eusebius believed the Apostle wrote the Gospel and the epistles, it is likely that doubt about the fidelity of the author of 2 and 3 John was a factor in causing them to be disputed. By the end of the fourth century the Presbyter (author of 2 and 3 John) was thought to be a different person than the Apostle John. This opinion, although reported by Jerome, was not held by all, as Jerome himself attributed the epistles to John the Apostle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOnline translations\nCommentaries\nOther"}

It consisted of Canadians Rick Danko (bass, guitar, vocals, fiddle), Garth Hudson (organ, keyboards, accordion, saxophone), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, vocals) and Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, percussion) and American Levon Helm (drums, vocals, mandolin, guitar, bass). The Band's music combined elements of Americana, folk, rock, R&amp;B, jazz and country, which influenced artists including George Harrison, Elton John, the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, Wilco, and King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard.\nBetween 1958 and 1963, the group were known as the Hawks and were the backing band for rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins, based in Toronto, Ontario. In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing Bob Dylan on his 1966 concert tour as Dylan's first electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to \"The Band\", they released their 1968 debut album, \"Music from Big Pink\", and its succeeding album, 1969's \"The Band\", to critical acclaim and commercial success. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters deemed it the \"second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll\", and music journalist Al Aronowitz called it \"country soul ... a sound never heard before\". The Band's most popular songs include \"The Weight\" (1968), \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" (1969), and \"Up on Cripple Creek\" (1969). The Band later released \"Stage Fright\" (1970), \"Cahoots\" (1971), the live album \"Rock of Ages\" (1972), the covers album \"Moondog Matinee\" (1973), and \"Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross\" (1975).\nThe Band performed a farewell concert on November 25, 1976. Footage from the event was released in 1978 as the concert film \"The Last Waltz\", directed by Martin Scorsese. After five years apart, Danko, Hudson, Helm, and Manuel reunited in 1983 for a tour without Robertson. Manuel died in 1986, but the remaining three members continued to tour and occasionally released new albums of studio material until Danko's death in 1999, after which the Band broke up for good. The Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked them 50th on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Band received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 and were inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2014.\nHistory.\n1957\u20131964: The Hawks.\nThe future members of the Band first played together as the Hawks, the backing group for rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins, based in Toronto. Levon Helm began playing with the group in 1957 and became their fulltime drummer after graduating from high school in 1958. Helm journeyed with Hawkins from Arkansas to Ontario, where they were joined by Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and finally Garth Hudson. Later-Band member Stan Szelest was also in the group at that time. Hawkins's act was popular in and around Toronto and in Hamilton to the south, and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition. When a promising band appeared, Hawkins would hire their best musicians for his own group; Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins's tutelage this way.\nIn the late 1950s, with Helm and Robertson in his band, Hawkins performed regularly at Pop Ivey's Summer Garden Pavilion in Port Dover, Ontario. In May 1961, he recruited Danko after watching the Simcoe native, who was 17, playing at the Pavilion.\u00a0 At the same venue, Hawkins and other members of the Hawks happened to see Richard Manuel's group Revols perform for the first time. That led Hawkins to take on management of Manuel's band. In September 1961, Hawkins convinced Manuel to leave the Revols and join the Hawks.\nWhile most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins's group, getting Hudson to join was more difficult. Having earned a college degree, Hudson planned on a career as a music teacher, and was only interested in playing rock music as a hobby. The Hawks admired his wild, full-bore organ style and asked him repeatedly to join. Hudson finally agreed, under the condition that the Hawks each pay him $10 per week to be their instructor and purchase a new state-of-the-art Lowrey organ; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is a view that jazz is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd\u00a0Street, and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.\n\u2014Garth Hudson in \"The Last Waltz\"\nWith Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene. Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed their instrumental skills. In late 1963, the group split from Hawkins over personal differences. They had grown tired of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were also wary of Hawkins's heavy-handed leadership. He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs (fearing it might reduce the numbers of \"available\" girls who came to performances) or if they smoked marijuana.\nRobertson later said: \nEventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically.\nThe group was briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet, with a sixth member, saxophonist Jerry Penfound after leaving Hawkins. Then it became Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name the Canadian Squires, but they returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for Atco later that year. Also in 1965, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson. They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting.\nLater in 1965, American musician Bob Dylan hired the group as his backing band for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. After the 1966 tour, the group moved with help from Dylan and his manager, Albert Grossman, to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became \"The Basement Tapes\", the basis for their 1968 debut album, \"Music from Big Pink\". Because they were always referred to simply as \"the band\" to various frontmen and the locals in Woodstock, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group decided on it as their official name and began performing under it from 1968 onward. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, most notably in a joint 1974 tour.\n1965\u20131967: With Bob Dylan.\nIn late summer 1965, Bob Dylan was looking for a backup band for his first U.S. \"electric\" tour. Levon and the Hawks were recommended by blues singer John P. Hammond, who earlier that year had recorded with Helm, Hudson and Robertson on his Vanguard album \"So Many Roads\". Around the same time, one of their friends from Toronto, Mary Martin, was working as secretary to Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman. She told Dylan to visit the group at Le Coq d'Or Tavern, a club on Yonge Street, in Toronto\u2014though Robertson recollects it was the Friar's Tavern, just down the street. Her advice to Dylan: \"You \"gotta\" see these guys.\"\nAfter hearing the Band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson to join his backing band. After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates and told him that they would continue with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and rhythm and blues group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.\nWith Dylan, the Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as \"Bob Dylan and The Band\". The tours were marked by Dylan's reportedly copious use of amphetamines. Some, though not all, of the Hawks joined in the excesses. Most of the concerts were met with heckling and disapproval from folk music purists. Helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour after a little more than one month and sat out the rest of that year's concerts, as well as the world tour in 1966. Helm spent much of this period working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.\nDuring and between tours, Dylan and the Hawks attempted several recording sessions, but with less than satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable single (\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan's next album, \"Blonde on Blonde\", resulted in \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album. On \"One of Us Must Know\", Dylan was backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and Al Kooper (who was more a guitarist than an organist) playing organ. Frustrated by the slow progress in the New York studio, Dylan accepted the suggestion of producer Bob Johnston and moved the recording sessions to Nashville. In Nashville, Robertson's guitar was prominent on the \"Blonde on Blonde\" recordings, especially in the song \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\", but the other members of the Hawks did not attend the sessions.\nDuring the European leg of their 1966 world tour, Mickey Jones replaced Sandy Konikoff on drums. Dylan and the Hawks played at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan's electric set, an audience member shouted \"Judas!\" After a pause, Dylan replied, \"I don't believe you. You're a liar!\" He then turned to the Hawks and said, \"Play it fucking loud!\" With that, they launched into an acidic version of \"Like a Rolling Stone\".\nThe Manchester performance was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly placed at the Royal Albert Hall). In a 1971 review for \"Creem\", critic Dave Marsh wrote: \nMy response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable.\nWhen the concert finally saw an official release as \"\" in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record \"an important document of rock history.\"\nOn July 29, 1966, while on a break from touring, Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident that precipitated his retreat into semi-seclusion in Woodstock, New York. For a while, the Hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit, sometimes backing other singers, including a brief stint with Tiny Tim. Dylan invited the Hawks to join him in Woodstock in February 1967, and Danko, Hudson, and Manuel rented a large pink house, which they named \"Big Pink\", in nearby West Saugerties, New York. The next month (initially without Helm) they commenced recording a much-bootlegged and influential series of demos, initially at Dylan's house in Woodstock and later at Big Pink, which were released partially on LP as \"The Basement Tapes\" in 1975 and . A track-by-track review of the bootleg was detailed by Jann Wenner in \"Rolling Stone\", in which the band members were explicitly named and given the collective name \"the Crackers\". While Helm was not involved in the initial recording, he did perform in later sessions and in overdubs recorded in 1975 before the album's release.\n1968\u20131972: Initial success as The Band.\nThe sessions with Dylan ended in October 1967, with Helm having rejoined the group by that time, and the Hawks began writing their own songs at Big Pink. When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves. Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name \"The Band\". In \"The Last Waltz\", Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either \"The Honkies\" or \"The Crackers\" (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to Woody Guthrie), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as \"the band\" and the name stuck. Initially they disliked the moniker, but eventually they grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, \"Rolling Stone\" referred to them as \"the band from Big Pink\".\nTheir debut album, \"Music from Big Pink\", was released in July 1968 and was widely acclaimed. It included three songs written or co-written by Dylan (\"This Wheel's on Fire\", \"Tears of Rage\" and \"I Shall Be Released\") as well as \"The Weight\", which became one of their best-known songs after it was used in the 1969 film \"Easy Rider\". While a thematic continuity ran through the music, the musical style varied from song to song. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters deemed it the \"second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll\", and music journalist Al Aronowitz called it \"country soul... a sound never heard before\".\nIn early 1969, after the success of \"Music from Big Pink\", the Band went on tour, starting with an appearance at Winterland Ballroom. They performed at the Woodstock Festival (their performance was not included in the famed \"Woodstock\" film because of legal complications), and later that year they performed with Dylan at the UK Isle of Wight Festival (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan's \"Self Portrait\" album). That same year, they left for Los Angeles to record their follow-up, \"The Band\" (1969). From their rustic appearance on the cover to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day. Several other artists had already made similar stylistic moves, notably Dylan, on \"John Wesley Harding\" (1967), which was written during the \"Basement Tapes\" sessions, and the Byrds, on \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" (1968), which featured two \"Basement Tapes\" covers. \"The Band\" featured songs that evoked old-time rural America, from the Civil War in \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" to the unionization of farm workers in \"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\".\nThese first two records were produced by John Simon, who was practically a group member: he aided in arrangements in addition to playing occasional piano and tuba. Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively using their limited technique.\n\"Rolling Stone\" lavished praise on the Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine's history; Greil Marcus's articles contributed to the Band's mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of \"Time\" (January 12, 1970), the first rock group after the Beatles, over two years earlier, to achieve this rare distinction. David Attie's unused photographs for this cover\u2014among the very few studio portraits taken during The Band's prime\u2014have only recently been discovered, and were featured in Daniel Roher's Robbie Robertson documentary \"\", as well as having their own four-page spread in Harvey Kubernik and his brother, Ken Kubernik's \"The Story of The Band: From \"Big Pink\" to \"The Last Waltz\"\" (Sterling Publishing, 2018).\nA critical and commercial triumph, \"The Band\", along with works by the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers, established a musical template (dubbed country rock) that paved the way to the Eagles. Both \"Big Pink\" and \"The Band\" also influenced their musical contemporaries. Eric Clapton and George Harrison cited the Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clapton later revealed that he wanted to join the group. While he never did join, he recruited all of the members of the Band as well as other roots rock performers for his 1976 album \"No Reason to Cry\".\nAfter their second album, The Band embarked on their first tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. \"Stage Fright\" (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on stage at the iconic \"Woodstock Playhouse\". As with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited with most of the songwriting. Initial critical reaction was positive, but it was seen as a disappointment from the previous two albums for various reasons. After recording \"Stage Fright\", The Band was among the acts participating in the Festival Express, an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead and future Band member Richard Bell (at the time he was a member of Joplin's band). In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen participating in a drunken jam session with Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, John Dawson, and Joplin while singing \"Ain't No More Cane\".\nAbout that time, Robertson began exerting greater control over the Band, a point of contention between him and Helm. Helm charged Robertson with authoritarianism and greed, while Robertson suggested that he made increased efforts to guide the group in part because Danko, Helm, and Manuel were becoming more unreliable due to their heroin usage. Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing more songs, only to see him descend into addiction.\nDespite mounting problems among the group members, The Band forged ahead with their next album, \"Cahoots\" (1971). \"Cahoots\" featured Dylan's \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\", \"4% Pantomime\" (with Van Morrison), and \"Life Is a Carnival\", the last featuring a horn arrangement by Allen Toussaint. Toussaint's contribution was a critical addition to The Band's next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: \"Holy Cow\" on \"Moondog Matinee\" and \"You See Me\" on \"Jubilation\". In late December 1971, The Band recorded the live album \"Rock of Ages\", which was released in the summer of 1972. On \"Rock of Ages\", they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section, with arrangements written by Toussaint. Dylan appeared on stage on New Year's Eve and performed four songs with the group, including a version of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\".\n1973\u20131975: Move to Shangri-La.\nIn 1973, the Band released the covers album \"Moondog Matinee\". There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews. However, on July 28, 1973, they played at Summer Jam at Watkins Glen, a massive concert that took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside Watkins Glen, New York. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band. It was during the event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on his album \"Planet Waves\". The album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour, in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the tour was documented on the live album \"Before the Flood\".\nDuring that time, the Band brought in \"Planet Waves\" producer Rob Fraboni to help design a music studio for the group. By 1975, the studio, Shangri-La, was completed. That year, the Band recorded and released \"Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross\", their first album of new material since 1971. All eight songs were written solely by Robertson. Despite comparatively poor record sales, the album is favored by critics and fans. Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, \"\": \"It was the best album we had done since \"The Band\".\" The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson, switching to synthesizers, showcased on \"Jupiter Hollow\".\n1976\u20131978: \"The Last Waltz\".\nBy the mid-1970s, Robbie Robertson was weary of touring. After \"Northern Lights\u00a0\u2013 Southern Cross\" failed to meet commercial expectations, much of the group's 1976 tour was confined to theaters and smaller arenas in secondary markets (including the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the Long Island Arena and the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction, Vermont), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant ZZ Top at the Nashville Fairgrounds in September. In early September, Richard Manuel suffered a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas, prompting Robertson to urge The Band to retire from live performances after staging a \"farewell concert\" known as \"The Last Waltz\". Following an October 30 appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\", the event, including turkey dinner for the audience of 5,000, was held on November 25 (Thanksgiving Day) of 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco and featured a horn section with arrangements by Allen Toussaint and an all-star lineup of guests, including Canadian artists Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. Two of the guests were fundamental to The Band's existence and growth: Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included Muddy Waters, Dr. John, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Ron Wood, Bobby Charles, Neil Diamond, and Paul Butterfield. The concert was filmed by Robertson's friend, filmmaker Martin Scorsese.\nIn 1977, the Band released their seventh studio album \"Islands\", which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned \"Last Waltz\" film and album could be released on the Warner Bros. label. \"Islands\" contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with the Band's original lineup. Also in 1977, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer Emmylou Harris (\"Evangeline\") and gospel-soul group the Staple Singers (\"The Weight\"); Scorsese combined these new performances\u2014as well as interviews he had conducted with the group\u2014with the 1976 concert footage. The resulting concert film\u2013documentary was released in 1978, along with a three-LP soundtrack.\nHelm later wrote about \"The Last Waltz\" in his autobiography, \"This Wheel's on Fire\", in which he made the case that it had been primarily Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced The Band's breakup on the rest of the group. Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: \nI made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it\u2014and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, \"Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.\" Well, fine. I'll take the best music film that's ever been made, and make it my statement. I don't have any problems with that. None at all.\nThe original quintet performed together one last time: on March\u00a01, 1978 after the late set of a Rick Danko solo show at The Roxy, the group performed \"Stage Fright\", \"The Shape I'm In\", and \"The Weight\" for an encore.\n1983\u20131989: Reformation and the death of Richard Manuel.\nThe Band resumed touring in 1983 without Robertson. An accomplished musician from Woodstock, New York, Jim Weider, became lead guitarist. Robertson had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. As a result of their diminished popularity, they performed in theaters and clubs as headliners and took support slots in larger venues for onetime peers such as the Grateful Dead and Crosby, Stills and Nash.\nAfter a performance in Winter Park, Florida, on March 4, 1986, Manuel hanged himself, aged 42, in his motel room. He had suffered for many years from alcoholism and drug addiction and had been clean and sober for several years beginning in 1978 but had begun drinking and using drugs again by 1984. Manuel's position as pianist was filled by old friend Stan Szelest (who died not long after) and then by Richard Bell. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after the departure of the original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band.\nThe Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the 1989 Juno Awards, where Robertson was reunited with original members Danko and Hudson. With Canadian country rock superstars Blue Rodeo as a back-up band, \"Music Express\" called the 1989 Juno appearance a symbolic \"passing of the torch\" from The Band to Blue Rodeo.\n1990\u20131999: Final recording and death of Rick Danko.\nIn 1990, Capitol Records began to re-release the records from the 1970s. The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles. The Band appeared at Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert in New York City in October 1992, where they performed their version of Dylan's \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\". In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, \"Jericho\". \"Jericho\" was their first album recorded since \"The Last Waltz\" 17 years prior, and also their first studio album since \"Islands\". Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the songwriting for the album came from outside of the group. Also in the same year, The Band, along with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and other performers appeared at President Bill Clinton's 1993 \"Blue Jean Bash\" inauguration party.\nIn 1994, The Band performed at Woodstock '94. Later in 1994, Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as The Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of The Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Helm, who had been at odds with Robertson for years over accusations of stolen songwriting credits, did not attend. In February 1996, The Band with the Crickets recorded \"Not Fade Away\", released on the tribute album \"Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly)\". The Band released two more albums after \"Jericho\": \"High on the Hog\" (1996) and \"Jubilation\" (1998), the latter of which included guest appearances by Eric Clapton and John Hiatt. Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years but he eventually regained the use of his voice. In 1998, the group revealed they were working on a follow-up album to \"Jubilation\" that has not been released.\nThe final song the group recorded together was their 1999 version of Bob Dylan's \"One Too Many Mornings\", which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album \"Tangled Up in Blues\". On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 55. Following his death, The Band broke up for good. The final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar).\nLater developments.\nIn 2002, Robertson bought all other former members' financial interests in the group (with the exception of Helm's), giving him major control of the presentation of the group's material, including latter-day compilations.\nRichard Bell died of multiple myeloma in June 2007.\nThe Band received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award on February 9, 2008, but there was no reunion of former members. In honor of the event, Helm held a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock.\nLevon Helm died on April 19, 2012, after a prolonged battle with throat cancer.\nIn December 2020, it was announced that the third album of The Band, \"Stage Fright\", would have an expanded reissue. The album contains alternate versions of some songs.\nRobbie Robertson died at the age of 80 on August 9, 2023, after battling prostate cancer.\nGarth Hudson, the last living original member of the Band, died at the age of 87 on January 21, 2025.\nMusical style.\nThe Band's style \"thematically and musically fuse[d] the past and the present\" by combining various genres. Although primarily incorporating old country music and early rock and roll, the rhythm section often was reminiscent of Stax- or Motown-style rhythm and blues, and Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences, resulting in a synthesis of many musical genres. Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm's Southern accent was prevalent in his raw and powerful vocals, Danko sang tenor with a distinctively choppy enunciation, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and a soulful baritone. The singers regularly blended singing harmonies. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as The Band's \"lead\" singer.\nEvery member was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of timbres from his Lowrey organ. Helm's drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was \"the only drummer who can make you cry,\" while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques. Producer John Simon is often cited as a \"sixth member\" of The Band for producing and playing on \"Music from Big Pink\", co-producing and playing on \"The Band\", and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 reunion album \"Jericho\".\nCopyright controversy.\nRobertson is credited as writer or co-writer of the majority of The Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. That developed into a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, \"This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band\", Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that The Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: \nI think Levon's book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey\u2014it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble.\nRobertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson.\nLegacy.\nThe Band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked them 50th on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and ranked \"The Weight\" 41st on its list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". In 2008, the group received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and in 2014, they were inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\nThe Band \"ushered in the roots-rock of the '70s, embodying Americana in a way that no one else has approached,\" according to Mark Deming of \"AllMusic\". He further explained: \nTheir work reflected the influences of country, blues, folk, and other forms of American roots music in a way that was fresh, organic, and innovative, and showed a creative maturity that was a revelation in the psychedelic era.\nMusic critic Bruce Eder said that The Band as \"one of the most popular and influential rock groups in the world, their music embraced by critics... as seriously as the music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\"\nThe Band has influenced numerous bands, songwriters and performers, including the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Costello, Elton John, Phish, and Pink Floyd. The album \"Music from Big Pink\", in particular, is credited with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 he had heard the album, \"and it changed my life.\" The band Nazareth took their name from a line in \"The Weight\". Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's \"Liege and Lief\", and journalist John Harris has asserted that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of the Beatles' back-to-basics album \"Let It Be\" as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with \"Beggars Banquet\". George Harrison said that his song \"All Things Must Pass\" was heavily influenced by The Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, \"The Weight\" has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence: \nWe certainly didn't want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll.\nIn the 1990s, a new generation of bands influenced by The Band began to gain popularity, including Counting Crows, the Wallflowers, and the Black Crowes. Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late Richard Manuel, \"If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)\", from their album \"Hard Candy\". The Black Crowes frequently cover songs by The Band during live performances, such as \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\", which appears on their DVD/CD \"Freak 'n' Roll into the Fog\". They have also recorded at Helm's studio in Woodstock.\nThe Hold Steady was formed after members Craig Finn and Tad Kubler watched \"The Last Waltz\". Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson are name-checked in the lyrics of \"The Swish\" from the Hold Steady's 2004 debut album \"Almost Killed Me\". Also that year, southern rock-revivalists Drive-By Truckers released the Jason Isbell penned track \"Danko/Manuel\" on the album \"The Dirty South\".\nThe Band also inspired Grace Potter, of Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, to form the band in 2002. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, Potter said:\nThe Band blew my mind. I thought if this is what Matt [Burr] meant when he said \"Let's start a rock 'n' roll band,\"... that was the kind of rock 'n' roll band I could believe in.\nA tribute album, entitled \"\", released in January 2007, included contributions from My Morning Jacket, Death Cab for Cutie, Gomez, Guster, Bruce Hornsby, Jack Johnson and ALO, Lee Ann Womack, the Allman Brothers Band, Blues Traveler, Jakob Dylan, Rosanne Cash, and others.\nMembers of Wilco, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the Shins, Dr Dog, Yellowbirds, Ween, Furthur, and other bands staged The Complete Last Waltz in 2012 and 2013. Their performances included all 41 songs from the original 1976 concert in sequence, even those edited out of the film. Musical director Sam Cohen of Yellowbirds claims \"the movie is pretty ingrained in me. I've watched it probably 100 times.\"\nAn incarnation of The Band's legacy, The Weight Band, originated inside the barn of Levon Helm in 2012 when Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante, both former members of The Band were performing \"Songs of The Band\" with Garth Hudson, Jimmy Vivino and Byron Isaacs. In July 2017, PBS's Infinity Hall Live program began airing a televised performance by The Weight Band, featuring Band covers and new music by the band. Every year on the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving, Dayton, Ohio NPR affiliate WYSO and The Dayton Art Institute host a tribute to \"The Last Waltz\". Frequently selling out, the show features more than 30 local musicians. A similar event takes place annually in Madison, Wisconsin, on the Saturday night after Thanksgiving.\nThe Band are the subjects of the 2019 documentary film \"Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band\", which premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. The Band is the subject of an extensive historical podcast, \"The Band: A History\", currently covering the entire history of the group.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30967", "revid": "3174456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30967", "title": "Tempo", "text": "Musical concept indicating to the speed of interpretation\nIn musical terminology, tempo (Italian for 'time'; plural 'tempos', or from the Italian plural), measured in beats per minute, is the speed or pace of a given composition, and is often also an indication of the composition's character or atmosphere. In classical music, tempo is typically indicated with an instruction at the start of a piece (often using conventional Italian terms) and, if a specific metrical pace is desired, is usually measured in beats per minute (bpm or BPM). In modern classical compositions, a \"metronome mark\" in beats per minute, indicating only measured speed and not any form of expression, may supplement or replace the normal tempo marking, while in modern genres like electronic dance music, tempo will typically simply be stated in bpm.\nTempo (the underlying pulse of the music) is one of the three factors that give a piece of music its texture. The others are meter, which is indicated by a time signature, and articulation, which determines how each note is sounded and how notes are grouped into larger units. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a vital skill for a musical performer, tempo is malleable. Depending on the genre of a piece of music and the performers' interpretation, a piece may be played with slight variations in tempo, known as tempo rubato, or significant variations. In ensembles, the tempo is often maintained by having players synchronise with a conductor or with a specific instrumentalist, for instance the first violin or the drummer.\nMeasurement.\nAlthough tempo is described or indicated in many different ways, including with a range of words (e.g., \"Slowly\", \"Adagio\", and so on), it is typically measured in beats per minute (bpm or BPM). For example, a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second, while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid, signifying two beats every second. The note value of a beat will typically be that indicated by the denominator of the time signature. For instance, in time, the beat will be a crotchet, or quarter note.\nThis measurement and indication of tempo became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century, after Johann Nepomuk Maelzel invented the metronome. Beethoven was one of the first composers to use the metronome; in the 1810s he published metronomic indications for the eight symphonies he had composed up to that time.\nWith the advent of modern electronics, beats per minute became an extremely precise measure. Music sequencers use the bpm system to denote tempo. In popular music genres such as electronic dance music, accurate knowledge of a tune's bpm is important to DJs for the purposes of beatmatching.\nThe speed of a piece of music can also be gauged according to measures per minute (mpm) or bars per minute (bpm), the number of measures of the piece performed in one minute. This measure is commonly used in ballroom dance music.\nChoosing speed.\nIn different musical contexts, different instrumental musicians, singers, conductors, bandleaders, music directors or other individuals will select the tempo of a song or piece. In a popular music or traditional music group or band, the bandleader or drummer may select the tempo. In popular and traditional music, whoever is setting the tempo often counts out one or two bars in tempo. In some songs or pieces in which a singer or solo instrumentalist begins the work with a solo introduction (prior to the start of the full group), the tempo they set will provide the tempo for the group. In an orchestra or concert band, the conductor normally sets the tempo. In a marching band, the drum major may set the tempo. In a sound recording, in some cases a record producer may set the tempo for a song (although this would be less likely with an experienced bandleader). Differences in tempo and its interpretation can differ between cultures, as shown by Curt Sachs when comparing Tunisian with Western Classical melodies, while certain genres display rhythmic variation in line with its forms, as occurs with flamenco and its \"palos\".\nMusical vocabulary.\nIn classical music, it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words, most commonly in Italian, in addition to or instead of a metronome mark in beats per minute. Italian is typically used because it was the language of most composers during the time these descriptions became commonplace in the Western musical lexicon. Some well-known Italian tempo indications include \"Allegro\" (English \"Cheerful\"), \"Andante\" (\"Walking-pace\") and \"Presto\" (\"Quickly\"). This practice developed during the 17th and 18th centuries, the baroque and classical periods. In the earlier Renaissance music, performers understood most music to flow at a tempo defined by the tactus (roughly the rate of the human heartbeat). The mensural time signature indicated which note value corresponded to the tactus.\nIn the Baroque period, pieces would typically be given an indication, which might be a tempo marking (e.g. \"Allegro\"), or the name of a dance (e.g. \"Allemande\" or \"Sarabande\"), the latter being an indication both of tempo and of metre. Any musician of the time was expected to know how to interpret these markings based on custom and experience. In some cases, however, these markings were simply omitted. For example, the first movement of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 has no tempo or mood indication whatsoever. Despite the increasing number of explicit tempo markings, musicians still observe conventions, expecting a minuet to be at a fairly stately tempo, slower than a Viennese waltz; a perpetuum mobile quite fast, and so on. Genres imply tempos, and thus, Ludwig van Beethoven wrote \"In tempo d'un Menuetto\" over the first movement of his Piano Sonata Op. 54, though that movement is not a minuet.\nMany tempo markings also indicate mood and expression. For example, \"presto\" and \"allegro\" both indicate a speedy execution (\"presto\" being faster), but \"allegro\" also connotes joy (from its original meaning in Italian). \"Presto\", on the other hand, simply indicates speed. Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood. For example, the \"agitato\" in the \"Allegro agitato\" of the last movement of George Gershwin's piano concerto in F has both a tempo indication (undoubtedly faster than a usual \"Allegro\") and a mood indication (\"agitated\").\nOften, composers (or music publishers) name movements of compositions after their tempo (or mood) marking. For instance, the second movement of Samuel Barber's first String Quartet is an \"Adagio\".\nBasic tempo markings.\nHere follows a list of common tempo markings. The beats per minute (bpm) values are very rough approximations for time, and vary widely according to composers and works. A metronome marking cannot be deduced from one of the descriptive Italian or non-Italian terms alone. Where both metronome marking and a word indication occur together, the verbal cue is often also intended to express a style or feeling, which a metronome marking alone cannot do.\nIt is therefore important to remember that the exact sense of many of these terms has changed over time. One striking example is the use of the term \"Allegretto\". Between its early use in the 18th century and its later use from the 19th century onwards, it has experienced a slight increment in the tempo that it is intended to denote. Originally it implied a tempo very slightly faster than \"Andante\", whereas now it is often used to indicate one that is just a little slower than \"Allegro\". A similar fate has befallen the terms \"Adagietto\" and \"Andantino\". Likewise, the terms \"Largo\" and \"Adagio\" have experienced a considerable shift with regards to the tempi, in beats per minute, that they are required to express: A modern \"Largo\" is slower than \"Adagio\", but in the Baroque period it was faster.\nFrench tempo markings.\nSeveral composers have written markings in French, among them baroque composers Fran\u00e7ois Couperin and Jean-Philippe Rameau as well as Claude Debussy, Olivier Messiaen, Maurice Ravel and Alexander Scriabin. Erik Satie was known to write extensive tempo (and character) markings by defining them in a poetical and literal way, as in his \"Gnossiennes\". Common tempo markings in French are:\nGerman tempo markings.\nMany composers have used German tempo markings. Typical German tempo markings are:\nOne of the first German composers to use tempo markings in his native language was Ludwig van Beethoven, but only sparsely. Robert Schumann followed afterwards with increasingly specific markings, and later composers like Hindemith and Mahler would further elaborate on combined tempo and mood instructions in German. For example, the second movement of Mahler's Symphony No. 9 is marked , indicating a slowish folk-dance-like movement, with some awkwardness and much vulgarity in the execution. Mahler would also sometimes combine German tempo markings with traditional Italian markings, as in the first movement of his sixth symphony, marked (Energetically quick, but not too much. Violent, but vigorous.)\nEnglish tempo markings.\nEnglish indications, for example \"quickly\", have also been used, by Benjamin Britten and Percy Grainger, among many others. In jazz and popular music lead sheets and fake book charts, terms like \"fast\", \"laid back\", \"steady rock\", \"mid-tempo\", \"medium\", \"medium-up\", \"ballad\", \"brisk\", \"brightly\", \"up\", \"slowly\", and similar style indications may appear. In some lead sheets and fake books, both tempo and genre are indicated, e.g., \"slow blues\", \"fast swing\", or \"medium Latin\". The genre indications help rhythm section instrumentalists use the correct style. For example, if a song says \"medium shuffle\", the drummer plays a shuffle drum pattern; if it says \"fast boogie-woogie\", the piano player plays a boogie-woogie bassline.\n\"Show tempo\", a term used since the early days of vaudeville, describes the traditionally brisk tempo (usually 160\u2013170 bpm) of opening songs in stage revues and musicals.\nHumourist Tom Lehrer uses facetious English tempo markings in his anthology \"Too Many Songs by Tom Lehrer\". For example, \"National Brotherhood Week\" is to be played \"fraternally\"; \"We Will All Go Together\" is marked \"eschatologically\"; and \"Masochism Tango\" has the tempo \"painstakingly\". His English contemporaries Flanders and Swann have similarly marked scores, with the music for their song \"The Whale (Moby Dick)\" shown as \"oceanlike and vast\".\nVariation through a piece.\nTempo is not necessarily fixed. Within a piece (or within a movement of a longer work), a composer may indicate a complete change of tempo, often by using a double bar and introducing a new tempo indication, often with a new time signature and/or key signature.\nIt is also possible to indicate a more or less gradual change in tempo, for instance with an \"accelerando\" (speeding up) or \"ritardando\" (\"rit\"., slowing down) marking. Indeed, some compositions chiefly comprise \"accelerando\" passages, for instance Monti's \"Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s\", or the Russian Civil War song Echelon Song.\nOn the smaller scale, tempo rubato refers to changes in tempo within a musical phrase, often described as some notes 'borrowing' time from others.\nTerms for change in tempo.\nComposers may use expressive marks to adjust the tempo:\nWhile the base tempo indication (such as \"Allegro\") typically appears in large type above the staff, adjustments typically appear below the staff or, in the case of keyboard instruments, in the middle of the grand staff.\nThey generally designate a \"gradual\" change in tempo; for immediate tempo shifts, composers normally just provide the designation for the new tempo. (Note, however, that when \"Pi\u00f9 mosso\" or \"Meno mosso\" appears in large type above the staff, it functions as a new tempo, and thus implies an immediate change.) Several terms, e.g., \"assai\", \"molto\", \"poco\", \"subito\", control how large and how gradual a change should be (see common qualifiers).\nAfter a tempo change, a composer may return to a previous tempo in two ways:\nThese terms also indicate an immediate, not a gradual, tempo change. Although they are Italian, composers tend to employ them even if they have written their initial tempo marking in another language.\nTempo\u2013rhythm interaction.\nOne difficulty in defining tempo is the dependence of its perception on rhythm, and, conversely, the dependence of rhythm perception on tempo. Furthermore, the tempo-rhythm interaction is context dependent, as explained by Andranik Tangian using an example of the leading rhythm of \u2033Promenade\u2033 from Modest Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\":\nThis rhythm is perceived as it is rather than as the first three events repeated at a double tempo (denoted as R012 = repeat from 0, one time, twice faster):\nR012\nHowever, the motive with this rhythm in the Mussorgsky's piece\nis rather perceived as a repeat\nR012\nThis context-dependent perception of tempo and rhythm is explained by the principle of correlative perception, according to which data are perceived in the simplest way. From the viewpoint of Kolmogorov's complexity theory, this means a representation of the data that minimizes the amount of memory.\nThe example considered suggests two alternative representations of the same rhythm: as it is, and as the rhythm-tempo interaction \u2014 a two-level representation in terms of a generative rhythmic pattern and a \"tempo curve\". Table 1 displays these possibilities both with and without pitch, assuming that one duration requires one byte of information, one byte is needed for the pitch of one tone, and invoking the repeat algorithm with its parameters R012 takes four bytes. As shown in the bottom row of the table, the rhythm without pitch requires fewer bytes if it is \"perceived\" as it is, without repetitions and tempo leaps. On the contrary, its melodic version requires fewer bytes if the rhythm is \"perceived\" as being repeated at a double tempo.\nThus, the loop of interdependence of rhythm and tempo is overcome due to the simplicity criterion, which \"optimally\" distributes the complexity of perception between rhythm and tempo. In the above example, the repetition is recognized because of additional repetition of the melodic contour, which results in a certain redundancy of the musical structure, making the recognition of the rhythmic pattern \"robust\" under tempo deviations. Generally speaking, the more redundant the \"musical support\" of a rhythmic pattern, the better its recognizability under augmentations and diminutions, that is, its distortions are perceived as tempo variations rather than rhythmic changes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By taking into account melodic context, homogeneity of accompaniment, harmonic pulsation, and other cues, the range of admissible tempo deviations can be extended further, yet still not preventing musically normal perception. For example, Scriabin's own performance of his \"Poem\", Op. 32, No. 1, transcribed from a piano-roll recording contains tempo deviations within . \n 19/119, a span of 5.5 times. Such tempo deviations are strictly prohibited, for example, in Bulgarian or Turkish music based on so-called additive rhythms with complex duration ratios, which can also be explained by the principle of correlativity of perception. If a rhythm is not structurally redundant, then even minor tempo deviations are not perceived as \"accelerando\" or \"ritardando\" but rather given an impression of a change in rhythm, which implies an inadequate perception of musical meaning.\nModern classical music.\nTwentieth-century classical music introduced a wide range of approaches to tempo, particularly thanks to the influence of modernism and later postmodernism.\nWhile many composers have retained traditional tempo markings, sometimes requiring greater precision than in any preceding period, others have begun to question basic assumptions of the classical tradition like the idea of a consistent, unified, repeatable tempo. Graphic scores show tempo and rhythm in a variety of ways. Polytemporal compositions deliberately utilise performers playing at marginally different speeds. John Cage's compositions approach tempo in diverse ways. For instance, \"4\u203233\u2033\" has a defined duration, but no actual notes, while As Slow as Possible has defined proportions but no defined duration, with one performance intended to last 639 years.\nBeatmatching.\nIn popular music genres such as disco, house music and electronic dance music, beatmatching is a technique that DJs use that involves speeding up or slowing down a record (or CDJ player, a speed-adjustable CD player for DJ use) to match the tempo of a previous or subsequent track, so both can be seamlessly mixed. Having beatmatched two songs, the DJ can either seamlessly crossfade from one song to another, or play both tracks simultaneously, creating a layered effect.\nDJs often beatmatch the underlying tempos of recordings, rather than their strict bpm value suggested by the kick drum, particularly when dealing with high tempo tracks. A 240\u00a0bpm track, for example, matches the beat of a 120\u00a0bpm track without slowing down or speeding up, because both have an underlying tempo of 120 quarter notes per minute. Thus, some soul music (around 75\u201390\u00a0bpm) mixes well with a drum and bass beat (from 150 to 185\u00a0bpm). When speeding up or slowing down a record on a turntable, the pitch and tempo of a track are linked: spinning a disc 10% faster makes both pitch and tempo 10% higher. Software processing to change the pitch without changing the tempo is called pitch-shifting. The opposite operation, changing the tempo without changing the pitch, is called time-stretching.\nCitations.\nSources"}

The band has had two No. 1 singles in the U.S.: \"Hanky Panky\" (1966), the band's only RIAA Certified Gold record, and \"Crimson and Clover\" (1969). The band also charted twelve other top 40 hits, including five in the Hot 100's Top 10: \"I Think We're Alone Now\" (1967), \"Mirage\" (1967), \"Mony Mony\" (1968), \"Sweet Cherry Wine\" (1969), and \"Crystal Blue Persuasion\" (1969).\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe band The Echoes formed in 1959 in Niles, Michigan, then evolved into Tom and the Tornadoes, with 12-year-old Tommy James (then known as Tommy Jackson) as lead singer. While attending Niles High School in Niles, Michigan, the group released its first single, \"Long Pony Tail\", in 1962.\nIn 1964, James renamed the band the Shondells because the name \"sounded good\" and in honor of nearby Fort Wayne's own Troy Shondell, famous for his 1961 release \"This Time\". At this time, the band included Tommy James (vocals and guitar), Larry Coverdale (lead guitar), Larry Wright (bass), Craig Villeneuve (keyboards) and Jim Payne (drums). In February 1964 the band recorded the Jeff Barry\u2013Ellie Greenwich song \"Hanky Panky\" (originally a B-side by the Raindrops). As James could often be found playing at Niles High School events, his popularity locally continued to grow. James' version of \"Hanky Panky\" sold respectably in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, but Snap Records, the label under which \"Hanky Panky\" was originally released, had no national distribution. The band toured the eastern Midwest, but no other market took to the song. The single failed to chart nationally and the Shondells disbanded in 1965 after its members graduated from high school.\nAfter first considering taking a job outside of music, James decided to form a new band, the Koachmen, with Shondells guitarist Larry Coverdale and members of a rival group called the Spinners (not the hit-making group from Detroit). The Koachmen played a circuit of clubs in the Midwest through the summer and fall of 1965, but returned to Niles in February 1966, after the gigs dried up, to plot their next move.\nHanky Panky.\nMeanwhile, in 1965, Pittsburgh dance promoter Bob Mack had unearthed the forgotten single \"Hanky Panky\", playing it at various dance parties, and radio stations there touted it as an \"exclusive\". Listener response encouraged regular play and demand soared. Bootleggers responded by printing 80,000 black market copies of the recording, which were sold in Pennsylvania stores.\nJames first learned of all of this activity in April 1966, after getting a telephone call from Pittsburgh disc jockey \"Mad Mike\" Metro(vich), who asked him to come and perform the song. James attempted to contact other members of the Shondells, but they had all moved away, joined the service or gotten married and left the music business altogether. There remains disagreement over the role of Metrovich in the recording. In his book, \"Me, The Mob and the Music\", James credits Pittsburgh dance promoter Bob Mack and never mentions Metrovich.\nIn April 1966, James went by himself to make promotional appearances in Pittsburgh in nightclubs and on local television. Bob Mack made his dance club bands available to James for promotional appearances, but nothing seemed to fit until a guitarist from one of the bands took James to the Thunderbird Lounge in Greensburg, where he recruited a quintet that was playing there called the Raconteurs \u2013 Joe Kessler (guitar), Ron Rosman (keyboards), George Magura (saxophone and piano), Mike Vale (bass) and Vincent Pietropaoli (drums) \u2013 as the new Shondells. \"I had no group, and I had to put one together really fast,\" recalled James. \"I was in a Greensburg, PA club one night, and I walked up to a group that was playing that I thought was pretty good and asked them if they wanted to be the Shondells. They said yes, and off we went.\"\nWith a touring group to promote the single, James went to New York City, where he sold the master of \"Hanky Panky\" to Roulette Records, at which time he changed his last name to James. With national promotion, the single became a No. 1 hit in July 1966. He signed with Leonard Stogel and Associates for management. In 1967, Kessler and Pietropaoli were forced to leave after a dispute when planned monies were not remitted to them by Roulette, a label closely associated with organized crime, and whose head, Morris Levy, was the inspiration for the Herman \"Hesh\" Rabkin character on \"The Sopranos\". They were replaced by Eddie Gray (guitar) and Peter Lucia (drums); Magura departed as well.\nTommy James and the Shondells.\nAt first, Tommy James and \"his\" Shondells played straightforward rock and roll, but they soon became associated with the budding bubblegum music genre. James disputes this, saying that Super K Productions \"bubblegum\" producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz approached his record company (run by Morris Levy) looking for songwriting jobs. Levy spurned Kasenetz and Katz, so they went elsewhere and became successful with such bands as the 1910 Fruitgum Company. Bubblegum is generally traced to the success of the 1968 Fruitgum Company hit \"Simon Says\". Tommy rejects the \"bubblegum\" label for his music. In early 1967 songwriter Ritchie Cordell gave them the No. 4 hit \"I Think We're Alone Now\" and the No. 10 hit \"Mirage\". In 1968, James had a No. 3 hit with \"Mony Mony\". Co-written by James, Cordell, Cordell's writing partner Bo Gentry, and Bobby Bloom, \"Mony Mony\" reached No. 3 in the US and was a British No. 1 in 1968. The title was inspired by a flashing sign for Mutual Of New York visible from James's apartment balcony in New York. He followed it with \"Do Something to Me\". The \"Crimson &amp; Clover\" album marked the start of the band's psychedelic style.\nThe group toured with Vice President Hubert Humphrey during his 1968 presidential campaign, for which Humphrey showed his appreciation by writing the liner notes for their next album \"Crimson &amp; Clover\", which was released in December 1968. From late 1968, the group began writing their own songs, with James and Lucia penning the psychedelic-tinged classic \"Crimson and Clover\", which was recorded and mixed by Bruce Staple, with James tackling vocal duties and playing many of the instruments himself, and featured the creative use of studio effects such as delay and tremolo.\nFurther hits included \"Sweet Cherry Wine\", \"Crystal Blue Persuasion\", and \"Ball of Fire\", all from 1969. They also produced \"Sugar on Sunday\", later covered by the Clique. As the band embraced the sounds of psychedelia, they were invited to perform at Woodstock, but declined. \nThe group continued until 1970.\nHog Heaven.\nAt a concert in Birmingham, Alabama, in March 1970, an exhausted James collapsed after coming off stage from a reaction to drugs and was pronounced dead. He was not dead, however, and decided to move to the country to rest and recuperate, and left the band. His four bandmates carried on for a short while under the name Hog Heaven, recording two albums (one \"self-titled\" on Roulette Records in March 1971 and the second recorded in 1971, but unreleased until 2008), and landing one Hot 100 hit, \"Happy\", at number 98, but disbanded soon afterwards.\nIn a 1970 side project, James wrote and produced the No. 7 hit single \"Tighter, Tighter\" for the group Alive N Kickin'. James launched a solo career in 1970 that yielded two notable hits over a 10-year span, \"Draggin' the Line\" (1971) and \"Three Times in Love\" (1980).\nCovers by other artists.\nDuring the 1980s, the group's songbook produced major hits for three other artists: Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts' version of \"Crimson and Clover\" (US No. 7 in 1982), Tiffany's \"I Think We're Alone Now\" and Billy Idol's \"Mony Mony\" (back-to-back US No. 1 singles in November 1987). Other Shondells covers have been performed by acts as disparate as psychobilly ravers the Cramps, new wave singer Lene Lovich, country music veteran Dolly Parton, and the Boston Pops orchestra.\n1980s and later.\nIn the mid-1980s, Tommy James began touring in oldies packages with other acts from the 1960s sometimes billed as Tommy James &amp; the Shondells, although he is the group's only original member. A Greenwich Village nightclub appearance was filmed and released as \"Tommy James &amp; the Shondells: Live! At The Bitter End\". \nOn January 6, 1987, original drummer Peter P. Lucia Jr. died of a heart attack while playing golf at the age of 39.\nIn 2008, \"I'm Alive\" was covered by Tom Jones and released on his \"24 Hours\" album.\nIn 2009, James and the surviving Shondells, Gray, Vale and Rosman, reunited to record music for a soundtrack of a proposed film based on James's autobiography, \"Me, the Mob, and the Music\", released in February 2010. \nIn March 2011, the Tommy James song \"I'm Alive\" (co-written with Peter Lucia) became a top-20 hit in the Netherlands for UK singer Don Fardon after his version had been used in a Vodafone commercial. \nIn 2012, \"Crystal Blue Persuasion\" was used in the eighth episode of Season 5 of \"Breaking Bad\", \"Gliding Over All\", during a montage depicting the process involved to bring main character Walter White's methamphetamine operation and its signature blue crystal meth to an international level.\nIn 2015, Gray, Vale, and Rosman decided to reunite and form their new group, The Crystal Blue Band. They recruited their longtime friend and drummer Mike Wilps to replace the late Peter Lucia. That group disbanded in 2022.\nRecognition.\nIn 2008, Tommy James and The Shondells were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nTunnel in the Sky is a juvenile science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1955 by Scribner's as one of the Heinlein juveniles. The novel follows a group of students participating in a survival test on an uninhabited planet, where they soon discover they are stranded.\nPlot summary.\nIn the future, Malthusian overpopulation on Earth has been averted by the invention of teleportation, called the \"Ramsbotham jump\", which enables the excess population to colonize other planets. However, the cost of the technology means that colonies remain isolated from Earth until they can produce something to justify two-way trade. Because modern technology requires a supporting infrastructure, the colonists employ easily maintained technology similar to that of 19th century pioneers (such as Conestoga wagons and horses rather than tractors).\nRod Walker, a high-school student, dreams of becoming a professional colonist. The final test of his Advanced Survival class involves staying alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days. Students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry, but they are otherwise completely on their own. They are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable. On test day, students walk through a Ramsbotham portal and find themselves alone on a strange planet, but reasonably close to the designated pickup point. Rod, acting on his older sister's advice, takes hunting knives and basic survival gear, avoiding high-tech weapons that might make him overconfident. The last advice that the students receive is to \"watch out for stobor.\"\nOn the second day, a thief ambushes Rod and knocks him unconscious. He wakes up to find all that he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage. In his desperate concentration on survival, he loses track of time. Eventually, he teams up with Jacqueline \"Jack\" Daudet, a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male. When she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact, he realizes that something has gone wrong and they are stranded.\nRod and Jack start recruiting other survivors to build a settlement for long-term survival, and Rod becomes the \"de facto\" leader of a community that eventually grows to around 75 people. Disagreements reveal the need to elect a government for the new town. Rod has no taste for politics or administration and is happy to have Grant Cowper, an older college student and born politician, elected as mayor. Grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done. Despite disagreeing with many of Grant's policies, Rod supports him. Grant ignores Rod's warning that they are living in a dangerously hard-to-defend location and that they should move to a cave system that he has found. When an indigenous species that the humans had regarded as harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through the camp, the settlement is devastated and Grant is killed. The citizens elect Rod as their new mayor.\nHeinlein tracks the social development of the frontier community of educated young Westerners deprived of technology, followed by their society's abrupt dissolution when Earth reestablishes contact. After nearly two years of isolation, the culture shock experienced by the survivors highlights for them and the reader the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult by reversing the process abruptly. Each of the students returns from being a self-responsible member of an autonomous community to being regarded as a youth.\nAll of the students go back to Earth willingly enough except for Rod, who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small but sovereign state to a teenager whom the adult rescuers casually brush aside. However, his teacher (and now brother-in-law) and his sister persuade him to change his mind. His teacher also informs Rod that his warning against \"stobor\" was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet to instill fear and caution in the students, as all students receive the same warning, regardless of the planet they are sent to for the final exam.\nYears later, Rod accomplishes his heart's desire: leading a formal colonization party to another planet.\nThemes.\nAs in \"Lord of the Flies\", which had been published a year earlier, isolation reveals the true natures of the students as individuals, but it also demonstrates some of the constants of human existence as a social animal. Its underlying themes run counter to those in \"Lord of the Flies\", however, in that it shows a belief in the inherent strength of humans as proto-adults who can self-organize rather than descend into barbarism. Some of the students fall victim to their own foolishness, and others turn out to be thugs, but that is a part of human nature, just as the counter-trends take the group as a whole towards the beginnings of a stable society. The numerous political crises of the fledgling colony illustrate the need for legitimacy in a government appropriate for the society it administers, another common theme in Heinlein's books. In both its romanticization of the pioneer and its glorification of \"Homo sapiens\" as the toughest player in the Darwinian game, it presages themes developed further in books like \"Time Enough for Love\" and \"Starship Troopers\". Unusual for science fiction at the time, but quite typical of Heinlein's works, the novel portrays several competent and intelligent female characters.\nThe earlier part of the book makes a reference to a war \u2013 some generations before the book's plot begins \u2013 in which China conquered and colonized Australia. The remnants of Australia's original population \u2013 evidently referring to both Aboriginal Australians and European-descended Australians \u2013 were evacuated to New Zealand. The Chinese then engaged in a giant engineering project to reclaim Australia's central desert, but it soon became a vast overpopulated slum. In the book's present, the Chinese are colonizing marginal planets with harsh conditions, which nobody else wants, miserable peasants forced to move there against their will. All that has little bearing on the book's main plot, serving mainly to demonstrate the strong Malthusian pressures which inflicted Earth until the way to colonize other planets by matter transmitter was found.\nRod's ethnicity.\nHeinlein Society member and researcher Robert James has noted that Heinlein wrote a letter in which he \"firmly states\" that Rod Walker is black. According to James, \"The most telling evidence is that everybody in 'Tunnel' expects Rod to end up with Caroline, who is explicitly described as black.\" In recognition of this, the cover illustration of a full cast audio version of the work was revised to \"show Rod with his correct ethnicity\".\nRod's ethnicity being black can be validated by cross-checking Heinlein's statements in his published correspondence, specifically from https:// in PDF archive https:// on page 923. Here in conversation with Sandra Jane Fulton he explicitly states that the hero of Tunnel in the Sky is a Negro boy, and he continues on to speak about racism in the following paragraphs and the fact that he parted ways with his publisher at that time due to their attitudes concerning this topic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Relative to Jupiter, each trojan librates around one of Jupiter's stable Lagrange points: either \"L4\", existing 60\u00b0 ahead of the planet in its orbit, or \"L5\", 60\u00b0 behind. Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5.2\u00a0AU.\nThe first Jupiter trojan discovered, 588 Achilles, was spotted in 1906 by German astronomer Max Wolf. More than 15,300 Jupiter trojans have been found as of \u00a02025[ [update]]. By convention, they are each named from Greek mythology after a figure of the Trojan War, hence the name \"trojan\". The total number of Jupiter trojans larger than 1\u00a0km in diameter is believed to be about 1 million, approximately equal to the number of asteroids larger than 1\u00a0km in the asteroid belt. Like main-belt asteroids, Jupiter trojans form families.\nAs of 2004[ [update]], many Jupiter trojans showed to observational instruments as dark bodies with reddish, featureless spectra. No firm evidence of the presence of water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5\u00a0g\u00b7cm\u22123. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during the early stages of the Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.\nThe term \"Trojan Asteroid\" specifically refers to the asteroids co-orbital with Jupiter, but the general term \"trojan\" is sometimes more generally applied to other small Solar System bodies with similar relationships to larger bodies: Mars trojans, Neptune trojans, Uranus trojans and Earth trojans are known to exist. Temporary Venus trojans and Saturn trojans exist, as well as for 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta. The term \"Trojan asteroid\" is normally understood to specifically mean the Jupiter trojans because the first Trojans were discovered near Jupiter's orbit and Jupiter currently has by far the most known Trojans.\nObservational history.\nIn 1772, Italian-born mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, in studying the restricted three-body problem, predicted that a small body sharing an orbit with a planet but lying 60\u00b0 ahead or behind it will be trapped near these points. The trapped body will librate slowly around the point of equilibrium in a tadpole or horseshoe orbit. These leading and trailing points are called the L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The first asteroids trapped in Lagrange points were observed more than a century after Lagrange's hypothesis. Those associated with Jupiter were the first to be discovered.\nE. E. Barnard made the first recorded observation of a trojan, 12126 Chersidamas (identified as A904 RD at the time), in 1904, but neither he nor others appreciated its significance at the time. Barnard believed he had seen the recently discovered Saturnian satellite Phoebe, which was only two arc-minutes away in the sky at the time, or possibly an asteroid. The object's identity was not understood until its orbit was calculated in 1999.\nThe first accepted discovery of a trojan occurred in February 1906, when astronomer Max Wolf of Heidelberg-K\u00f6nigstuhl State Observatory discovered an asteroid at the L4 Lagrangian point of the Sun\u2013Jupiter system, later named 588 Achilles. In 1906\u20131907 two more Jupiter trojans were found by fellow German astronomer August Kopff (624 Hektor and 617 Patroclus). Hektor, like Achilles, belonged to the L4 swarm (\"ahead\" of the planet in its orbit), whereas Patroclus was the first asteroid known to reside at the L5 Lagrangian point (\"behind\" the planet). By 1938, 11 Jupiter trojans had been detected. This number increased to 14 only in 1961. As instruments improved, the rate of discovery grew rapidly: by January 2000, a total of 257 had been discovered; by May 2003, the number had grown to 1,600. As of October\u00a02025[ [update]] there are 9,694 known Jupiter trojans at L4 and 5,628 at L5.\nNomenclature.\nThe custom of naming all asteroids in Jupiter's L4 and L5 points after famous heroes of the Trojan War was suggested by Johann Palisa of Vienna, who was the first to accurately calculate their orbits.\nAsteroids in the leading (L4) orbit are named after Greek heroes (the \"Greek node or camp\" or \"Achilles group\"), and those at the trailing (L5) orbit are named after the heroes of Troy (the \"Trojan node or camp\"). The asteroids 617 Patroclus and 624 Hektor were named before the Greece/Troy rule was devised, resulting in a \"Greek spy\", Patroclus, in the Trojan node and a \"Trojan spy\", Hector, in the Greek node.\nIn 2018, at its 30th General Assembly in Vienna, the International Astronomical Union amended the naming convention for Jupiter trojans, allowing for asteroids with \"H\" larger than 12 (that is, a mean diameter smaller than approximately 22 kilometers, for an assumed albedo of 0.057) to be named after Olympic athletes, because there are now far more known Jupiter trojans than available names of Greek and Trojan warriors that fought in the Trojan war. As of June 2025, 24 Jupiter trojans have been named after athletes.\nNumbers and mass.\nEstimates of the total number of Jupiter trojans are based on deep surveys of limited areas of the sky. The L4 swarm is believed to hold between 160,000 and 240,000 asteroids with diameters larger than 2\u00a0km and about 600,000 with diameters larger than 1\u00a0km. If the L5 swarm contains a comparable number of objects, there are more than 1 million Jupiter trojans 1\u00a0km in size or larger. For the objects brighter than absolute magnitude 9.0 the population is probably complete. These numbers are similar to that of comparable asteroids in the asteroid belt. The total mass of the Jupiter trojans is estimated at 0.0001 of the mass of Earth or one-fifth of the mass of the asteroid belt.\nTwo more recent studies indicate that the above numbers may overestimate the number of Jupiter trojans by several-fold. This overestimate is caused by (1) the assumption that all Jupiter trojans have a low albedo of about 0.04, whereas small bodies may have an average albedo as high as 0.12; (2) an incorrect assumption about the distribution of Jupiter trojans in the sky. According to the new estimates, the total number of Jupiter trojans with a diameter larger than 2\u00a0km is 6,300 \u00b1 1,000 and 3,400 \u00b1 500 in the L4 and L5 swarms, respectively. These numbers would be reduced by a factor of 2 if small Jupiter trojans are more reflective than large ones.\nThe number of Jupiter trojans observed in the L4 swarm is slightly larger than that observed in L5. Because the brightest Jupiter trojans show little variation in numbers between the two populations, this disparity is probably due to observational bias. Some models indicate that the L4 swarm may be slightly more stable than the L5 swarm.\nThe largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, which has a mean diameter of 203\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0km. There are few large Jupiter trojans in comparison to the overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84\u00a0km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84\u00a0km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4\u201340\u00a0km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans may be the products of collisions by larger Jupiter trojans.\nOrbits.\nJupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35\u00a0AU (the mean semi-major axis is 5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0AU), and are distributed throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26\u00b0 along the orbit of Jupiter, amounting to a total distance of about 2.5\u00a0AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill's radii, which in the case of Jupiter amounts to about 0.6\u00a0AU. Many of Jupiter trojans have large orbital inclinations relative to Jupiter's orbital plane\u2014up to 40\u00b0.\nJupiter trojans do not maintain a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically moving closer to Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6\u00b0 to 88\u00b0, with the average being about 33\u00b0. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another\u2014these are called horseshoe orbits (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known, though one is known for Neptune).\nDynamical families and binaries.\nDiscerning dynamical families within the Jupiter trojan population is more difficult than it is in the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.\nIn 2001, 617 Patroclus was the first Jupiter trojan to be identified as a binary asteroid. The binary's orbit is extremely close, at 650\u00a0km, compared to 35,000\u00a0km for the primary's Hill sphere. The largest Jupiter trojan\u2014624 Hektor\u2014 is probably a contact binary with a moonlet.\nPhysical properties.\nJupiter trojans are dark bodies of irregular shape. Their geometric albedos generally vary between 3 and 10%. The average value is 0.056\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003 for the objects larger than 57\u00a0km, and 0.121\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003 (R-band) for those smaller than 25\u00a0km. The asteroid 4709 Ennomos has the highest albedo (0.18) of all known Jupiter trojans. Little is known about the masses, chemical composition, rotation or other physical properties of the Jupiter trojans.\nRotation.\nThe rotational properties of Jupiter trojans are not well known. Analysis of the rotational light curves of 72 Jupiter trojans gave an average rotational period of about 11.2\u00a0hours, whereas the average period of the control sample of asteroids in the asteroid belt was 10.6\u00a0hours. The distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans appeared to be well approximated by a Maxwellian function, whereas the distribution for main-belt asteroids was found to be non-Maxwellian, with a deficit of periods in the range 8\u201310\u00a0hours. The Maxwellian distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans may indicate that they have undergone a stronger collisional evolution compared to the asteroid belt.\nIn 2008 a team from Calvin College examined the light curves of a debiased sample of ten Jupiter trojans, and found a median spin period of 18.9 hours. This value was significantly higher than that for main-belt asteroids of similar size (11.5 hours). The difference could mean that the Jupiter trojans possess a lower average density, which may imply that they formed in the Kuiper belt (see below).\nComposition.\nSpectroscopically, the Jupiter trojans mostly are D-type asteroids, which predominate in the outer regions of the asteroid belt. A small number are classified as P or C-type asteroids. Their spectra are red (meaning that they reflect more light at longer wavelengths) or neutral and featureless. No firm evidence of water, organics or other chemical compounds has been obtained as of 2007[ [update]]. 4709 Ennomos has an albedo slightly higher than the Jupiter-trojan average, which may indicate the presence of water ice. Some other Jupiter Trojans, such as 911 Agamemnon and 617 Patroclus, have shown very weak absorptions at 1.7 and 2.3\u00a0\u03bcm, which might indicate the presence of organics. The Jupiter trojans' spectra are similar to those of the irregular moons of Jupiter and, to a certain extent, comet nuclei, though Jupiter trojans are spectrally very different from the redder Kuiper belt objects. A Jupiter trojan's spectrum can be matched to a mixture of water ice, a large amount of carbon-rich material (charcoal), and possibly magnesium-rich silicates. The composition of the Jupiter trojan population appears to be markedly uniform, with little or no differentiation between the two swarms.\nA team from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii announced in 2006 that it had measured the density of the binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8\u00a0g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition\u2014water ice with a layer of dust\u2014than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480\u00a0g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.\nOrigin and evolution.\nTwo main theories have emerged to explain the formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans. The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming. The last stage of Jupiter's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk; during this growth, which lasted for only about 10,000 years, the mass of Jupiter increased by a factor of ten. The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet. The capture mechanism was very efficient\u2014about 50% of all remaining planetesimals were trapped. This hypothesis has two major problems: the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude, and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model. Simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for Saturn, and this has been borne out by observation: to date no trojans have been found near Saturn. In a variation of this theory Jupiter captures trojans during its initial growth then migrates as it continues to grow. During Jupiter's migration the orbits of objects in horseshoe orbits are distorted causing the L4 side of these orbits to be over occupied. As a result, an excess of trojans is trapped on the L4 side when the horseshoe orbits shift to tadpole orbits as Jupiter grows. This model also leaves the Jupiter trojan population 3\u20134 orders of magnitude too large.\nThe second theory proposes that the Jupiter trojans were captured during the migration of the giant planets described in the Nice model. In the Nice model the orbits of the giant planets became unstable 500\u2013600 million years after the Solar System's formation when Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 mean-motion resonance. Encounters between planets resulted in Uranus and Neptune being scattered outward into the primordial Kuiper belt, disrupting it and throwing millions of objects inward. When Jupiter and Saturn were near their 1:2 resonance the orbits of pre-existing Jupiter trojans became unstable during a secondary resonance with Jupiter and Saturn. This occurred when the period of the trojans' libration about their Lagrangian point had a 3:1 ratio to the period at which the position where Jupiter passes Saturn circulated relative to its perihelion. This process was also reversible allowing a fraction of the numerous objects scattered inward by Uranus and Neptune to enter this region and be captured as Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits separated. These new trojans had a wide range of inclinations, the result of multiple encounters with the giant planets before being captured. This process can also occur later when Jupiter and Saturn cross weaker resonances.\nIn a revised version of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are captured when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In this version of the Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.\nThe long-term future of the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable over the age of the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1\u00a0km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.\nExploration.\nOn 4 January 2017 NASA announced that \"Lucy\" was selected as one of their next two Discovery Program missions. \"Lucy\" is set to explore seven Jupiter trojans. It was launched on October 16, 2021, and will arrive at the L4 Trojan cloud in 2027 after two Earth gravity assists and a fly-by of a main-belt asteroid. It will then return to the vicinity of Earth for another gravity assist to take it to Jupiter's L5 Trojan cloud where it will visit 617 Patroclus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"proof\" of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the inference rules of a deductive system to establish that the theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms and previously proved theorems.\nIn mainstream mathematics, the axioms and the inference rules are commonly left implicit, and, in this case, they are almost always those of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), or of a less powerful theory, such as Peano arithmetic. Generally, an assertion that is explicitly called a theorem is a proved result that is not an immediate consequence of other known theorems. Moreover, many authors qualify as \"theorems\" only the most important results, and use the terms \"lemma\", \"proposition\" and \"corollary\" for less important theorems.\nIn mathematical logic, the concepts of theorems and proofs have been formalized in order to allow mathematical reasoning about them. In this context, statements become well-formed formulas of some formal language. A theory consists of some basis statements called \"axioms\", and some \"deducing rules\" (sometimes included in the axioms). The theorems of the theory are the statements that can be derived from the axioms by using the deducing rules. This formalization led to proof theory, which allows proving general theorems about theorems and proofs. In particular, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems show that every consistent theory containing the natural numbers has true statements on natural numbers that are not theorems of the theory (that is they cannot be proved inside the theory).\nAs the axioms are often abstractions of properties of the physical world, theorems may be considered as expressing some truth, but in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is \"experimental\", the justification of the truth of a theorem is purely deductive.\nA \"conjecture\" is a tentative proposition that may evolve to become a theorem if proven true.\nTheoremhood and truth.\nUntil the end of the 19th century and the foundational crisis of mathematics, all mathematical theories were built from a few basic properties that were considered as self-evident; for example, the facts that every natural number has a successor, and that there is exactly one line that passes through two given distinct points. These basic properties that were considered as absolutely evident were called postulates or axioms; for example Euclid's postulates. All theorems were proved by using implicitly or explicitly these basic properties, and, because of the evidence of these basic properties, a proved theorem was considered as a definitive truth, unless there was an error in the proof. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180\u00b0, and this was considered as an undoubtable fact.\nOne aspect of the foundational crisis of mathematics was the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries that do not lead to any contradiction, although, in such geometries, the sum of the angles of a triangle is different from 180\u00b0. So, the property \"the sum of the angles of a triangle equals 180\u00b0\" is either true or false, depending whether Euclid's fifth postulate is assumed or denied. Similarly, the use of \"evident\" basic properties of sets leads to the contradiction of Russell's paradox. This has been resolved by elaborating the rules that are allowed for manipulating sets.\nThis crisis has been resolved by revisiting the foundations of mathematics to make them more rigorous. In these new foundations, a theorem is a well-formed formula of a mathematical theory that can be proved from the axioms and inference rules of the theory. So, the above theorem on the sum of the angles of a triangle becomes: \"Under the axioms and inference rules of Euclidean geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180\u00b0\". Similarly, Russell's paradox disappears because, in an axiomatized set theory, the \"set of all sets\" cannot be expressed with a well-formed formula. More precisely, if the set of all sets can be expressed with a well-formed formula, this implies that the theory is inconsistent, and every well-formed assertion, as well as its negation, is a theorem.\nIn this context, the validity of a theorem depends only on the correctness of its proof. It is independent from the truth, or even the significance of the axioms. This does not mean that the significance of the axioms is uninteresting, but only that the validity of a theorem is independent from the significance of the axioms. This independence may be useful by allowing the use of results of some area of mathematics in apparently unrelated areas.\nAn important consequence of this way of thinking about mathematics is that it allows defining mathematical theories and theorems as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. Examples are G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. In particular, there are well-formed assertions than can be proved to not be a theorem of the ambient theory, although they can be proved in a wider theory. An example is Goodstein's theorem, which can be stated in Peano arithmetic, but is proved to be not provable in Peano arithmetic. However, it is provable in some more general theories, such as Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.\nEpistemological considerations.\nMany mathematical theorems are conditional statements, whose proofs deduce conclusions from conditions known as hypotheses or premises. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the hypotheses. Namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true\u2014without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could also be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol (e.g., non-classical logic).\nAlthough theorems can be written in a completely symbolic form (e.g., as propositions in propositional calculus), they are often expressed informally in a natural language such as English for better readability. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed.\nIn addition to the better readability, informal arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones\u2014indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way \"why\" it is obviously true. In some cases, one might even be able to substantiate a theorem by using a picture as its proof.\nBecause theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or \"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time and culture: for example, as a proof is obtained, simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. Fermat's Last Theorem is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.\nInformal account of theorems.\nLogically, many theorems are of the form of an indicative conditional: \"If A, then B\". Such a theorem does not assert \"B\" \u2014 only that \"B\" is a necessary consequence of \"A\". In this case, \"A\" is called the \"hypothesis\" of the theorem (\"hypothesis\" here means something very different from a conjecture), and \"B\" the \"conclusion\" of the theorem. The two together (without the proof) are called the \"proposition\" or \"statement\" of the theorem (e.g. \"If A, then B\" is the \"proposition\"). Alternatively, \"A\" and \"B\" can be also termed the \"antecedent\" and the \"consequent\", respectively. The theorem \"If \"n\" is an even natural number, then \"n\"/2 is a natural number\" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is \"\"n\" is an even natural number\", and the conclusion is \"\"n\"/2 is also a natural number\".\nIn order for a theorem to be proved, it must be in principle expressible as a precise, formal statement. However, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form\u2014with the presumption that a formal statement can be derived from the informal one.\nIt is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates. The field of mathematics known as proof theory studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.\nSome theorems are \"trivial\", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights. Some, on the other hand, may be called \"deep\", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics. A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is Fermat's Last Theorem, and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics, among other areas.\nOther theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.\nRelation with scientific theories.\nTheorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is falsifiable, that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.\nNonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. It is also possible to find a single counter-example and so establish the impossibility of a proof for the proposition as-stated, and possibly suggest restricted forms of the original proposition that might have feasible proofs.\nFor example, both the Collatz conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis are well-known unsolved problems; they have been extensively studied through empirical checks, but remain unproven. The Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified to hold for the first 10\u00a0trillion non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function. Although most mathematicians can tolerate supposing that the conjecture and the hypothesis are true, neither of these propositions is considered proved.\nSuch evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number \"n\" for which the Mertens function \"M\"(\"n\") equals or exceeds the square root of \"n\") is known: all numbers less than 1014 have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 1.59\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a googol), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by exhaustive search.\nThe word \"theory\" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, group theory (see mathematical theory). There are also \"theorems\" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such \"theorems\" are based are themselves falsifiable.\nTerminology.\nA number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary, and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.\nOther terms may also be used for historical or customary reasons, for example:\nA few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names, for example, the division algorithm, Euler's formula, and the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox.\nLayout.\nA theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:\n\"Theorem\" (name of the person who proved it, along with year of discovery or publication of the proof)\n\"Statement of theorem (sometimes called the \"proposition\")\"\n\"Proof\"\n\"Description of proof\"\n\"End\"\nThe end of the proof may be signaled by the letters Q.E.D. (\"quod erat demonstrandum\") or by one of the tombstone marks, such as \"\u25a1\" or \"\u220e\", meaning \"end of proof\", introduced by Paul Halmos following their use in magazines to mark the end of an article.\nThe exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or macros for typesetting in the house style.\nIt is common for a theorem to be preceded by definitions describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of \"propositions\" or \"lemmas\" which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.\nCorollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.\nLore.\nIt has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.\nThe well-known aphorism, , is probably due to Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi, although it is often attributed to R\u00e9nyi's colleague Paul Erd\u0151s (and R\u00e9nyi may have been thinking of Erd\u0151s), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the number of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.\nThe classification of finite simple groups is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof. Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read.\nTheorems in logic.\nIn mathematical logic, a formal theory is a set of sentences within a formal language. A sentence is a well-formed formula with no free variables. A sentence that is a member of a theory is one of its theorems, and the theory is the set of its theorems. Usually a theory is understood to be closed under the relation of logical consequence. Some accounts define a theory to be closed under the semantic consequence relation (formula_1), while others define it to be closed under the syntactic consequence, or derivability relation (formula_2).\nFor a theory to be closed under a derivability relation, it must be associated with a deductive system that specifies how the theorems are derived. The deductive system may be stated explicitly, or it may be clear from the context. The closure of the empty set under the relation of logical consequence yields the set that contains just those sentences that are the theorems of the deductive system.\nIn the broad sense in which the term is used within logic, a theorem does not have to be true, since the theory that contains it may be unsound relative to a given semantics, or relative to the standard interpretation of the underlying language. A theory that is inconsistent has all sentences as theorems.\nThe definition of theorems as sentences of a formal language is useful within proof theory, which is a branch of mathematics that studies the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. It is also important in model theory, which is concerned with the relationship between formal theories and structures that are able to provide a semantics for them through interpretation.\nAlthough theorems may be uninterpreted sentences, in practice mathematicians are more interested in the meanings of the sentences, i.e. in the propositions they express. What makes formal theorems useful and interesting is that they may be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of their truth. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement \"about\" a formal system (as opposed to \"within\" a formal system) is called a \"metatheorem\".\nSome important theorems in mathematical logic are:\nSyntax and semantics.\nThe concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a \"true proposition,\" which introduces semantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. belief, justification or other modalities). The soundness of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation (for example, in classical propositional logic, validities are tautologies). A formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its theorems are also tautologies.\nCitations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30978", "revid": "47080019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30978", "title": "Tool (band)", "text": "American rock band\nTool is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1990. It consists of vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey and bassist Justin Chancellor, who replaced founding member Paul D'Amour in 1995. Tool has won four Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping charts in several countries.\nThe band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. They emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, \"Undertow\" (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album \"\u00c6nima\" in 1996. The group's efforts to combine musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with \"Lateralus\" (2001) and \"10,000 Days\" (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Their fifth studio album \"Fear Inoculum\" was released on August 30, 2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.\nDue to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band has been described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and the music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.\nHistory.\nFormation and \"Opiate\" (1989\u20131992).\nDuring the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted to enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan, who had studied visual arts in Michigan, worked as a pet store remodeler. Danny Carey and Keenan performed for Green Jell\u00ff, and Carey played with Carole King and Pigmy Love Circus.\nKeenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989. After Keenan played Jones a tape recording of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming a new band. They started jamming together while searching for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he \"felt kinda sorry for them\", as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced the members to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that it formed because of the pseudophilosophy \"lachrymology\". Although \"lachrymology\" was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained the members' intentions differently: \"Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve.\"\nAfter almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies, and eventually signed a record deal with Zoo Entertainment. In March 1992, Zoo released the band's first effort, \"Opiate\". Described by the band as \"slam and bang\" heavy music and the \"hardest sounding\" six songs they had written to that point, the EP included the singles \"Hush\" and \"Opiate\". The band's first music video, \"Hush\", promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent Parents Music Resource Center and its advocacy of the censorship of music. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by Parental Advisory stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape. The band began touring with Rollins Band, Fishbone, Rage Against the Machine, White Zombie, and Corrosion of Conformity, to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of \"RIP Magazine\" summarized in September 1992 as a \"buzz\" and \"a strong start\".\n\"Undertow\" (1993\u20131994).\nThe following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge were at their height, Tool released their first full-length album, \"Undertow\" (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than \"Opiate\" and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound. The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to the Church of Scientology, which was perceived as a clash with \"the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being.\" Keenan \"spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience.\"\nTool later played several concerts during the Lollapalooza festival tour, and was moved from the second stage to the main stage by the group's manager and the festival co-founder Ted Gardner. At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian Bill Hicks introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in \"Undertow\"'s liner notes. He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens. The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped \"Undertow\" to be certified gold by the RIAA in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995, despite being sold with censored album artwork by distributors such as Wal-Mart. The single \"Sober\" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band \"Billboard\"'s \"Best Video by a New Artist\" award for the accompanying stop motion music video.\nWith the release of Tool's follow-up single \"Prison Sex\", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: \"It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open.\" The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his \"surrealistic interpretation\" of the subject matter. While some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as \"metaphoric\", the American branch of MuchMusic (which asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing) deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.\n\"\u00c6nima\" and \"Salival\" (1995\u20132000).\nIn September 1995, the band began writing and recording its second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. According to Carey, D'Amour left the band because he wanted to play guitar rather than bass. Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmate band Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour during the recording of the album, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E. Shepherd Stevenson, Jane's Addiction's Eric Avery, and ZAUM's Marco Fox.\nOn September 17, 1996, Tool released its second full-length album, \"\u00c6nima\" ( ). The band enlisted the help of producer David Bottrill, who had produced some of King Crimson's albums, while Jones collaborated with Cam de Leon to create \"\u00c6nima\"'s Grammy-nominated artwork. The album was dedicated to stand-up comedian Bill Hicks, who had died two-and-a-half years earlier. The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks \"were resonating similar concepts\". In particular, \"\u00c6nima\"'s final track \"Third Eye\" is preceded by a clip of Hicks' performances, and the lenticular casing of the \"\u00c6nima\" album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track \"\u00c6nema\" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's \"Arizona Bay\" (the title track of the \"Arizona Bay Extended\" version of the album), in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean.\nThe first single, \"Stinkfist\", garnered limited airplay. It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of \"Stinkfist\" to \"Track No.\u00a01\" due to offensive connotations, and the lyrics of the song were altered. Responding to fan complaints about censorship, Matt Pinfield of MTV's \"120 Minutes\" expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.\nA tour began in October 1996, two weeks after \"\u00c6nima\"'s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at Lollapalooza '97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from \"The New York Times\". \"\u00c6nima\" eventually matched Tool's successful debut album in sales, and the progressive-influenced album landed the band at the head of the alternative metal genre. It featured the Grammy Award-winning \"\u00c6nema\" and appeared on \"Best Albums of 1996\" lists in \"Kerrang!\" and \"Terrorizer\". It was eventually certified triple platinum by the RIAA on March 4, 2003. In 1998, Tool joined the Ozzfest tour in the United States as the co-headliner act before Ozzy Osbourne. The band accepted on the condition that Melvins had to join it as well because, as stated by its frontman Buzz Osborne, they \"wanted at least one band on the tour that they liked\", despite the dissuasions from the tour organizers.\nTwo legal battles then began that interfered with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment\u2014the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment\u2014alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a counter-suit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. Then in 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission. During this time, Keenan joined the band A Perfect Circle, which was founded by long-time Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel, while Jones joined The Melvins' Buzz Osborne and Carey drummed with Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra on side projects. Although there were rumors that Tool was breaking up, Chancellor, Jones, and Carey were working on new material while waiting for Keenan to return. In 2000, the \"Salival\" box set (CD/VHS or CD/DVD) was released, effectively putting an end to the rumors. The CD contained one new original track, a cover of Led Zeppelin's \"No Quarter\", a live version of Peach's \"You Lied\", and revised versions of old songs. The VHS and the DVD each contained four music videos, plus a bonus music video for \"Hush\" on the DVD. Although \"Salival\" did not yield any singles, the hidden track \"Maynard's Dick\" (which dates back to the \"Opiate\" era) briefly found its way to FM radio when several DJs chose to play it on air under the title \"Maynard's Dead\".\n\"Lateralus\" (2001\u20132005).\nIn January 2001, Tool announced a new album, \"Systema Enc\u00e9phale\", along with a 12-song track list containing titles such as \"Riverchrist\", \"Numbereft\", \"Encephatalis\", \"Musick\", and \"Coeliacus\". File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled \"Lateralus\"; the name \"Systema Enc\u00e9phale\" and the track list had been a ruse. \"Lateralus\" and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward art rock and progressive rock territory. \"Rolling Stone\" wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that \"Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent death march ... The prolonged running times of most of \"Lateralus\"' thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose.\" Joshua Klein of \"The A.V. Club\" expressed his opinion that \"Lateralus\", with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs\u2014topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for \"Parabola\"\u2014posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.\nThe album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart in its debut week. Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song \"Schism\". During the band's acceptance speech, Carey stated that he would like to thank his parents (for putting up with him) and Satan, and bassist Chancellor concluded: \"I want to thank my dad for doing my mom.\"\nExtensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported \"Lateralus\" and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with King Crimson in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as \"the once and future kings of progressive rock\". Keenan stated of the minitour: \"For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like Lenny Kravitz playing with Led Zeppelin, or Britney Spears onstage with Debbie Gibson.\" Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to signal the start of another hiatus for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with A Perfect Circle, the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both exclusive to the fan club. The \"double vinyl four-picture disc\" edition of \"Lateralus\" was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. On December 20 the two DVDs were released, one containing the single \"Schism\" and the other \"Parabola\", a remix by Lustmord, and a music video with commentary by David Yow and Jello Biafra.\n\"10,000 Days\" (2006\u20132009).\nFifteen years into the band's career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of \"Revolver\" described as a devoted \"cult\" following, and as details about the band's next album emerged, such as the influence of \"Lateralus\" tourmates Fant\u00f4mas and Meshuggah, controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs. Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was \"10,000 Days\". Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that \"10,000 Days\" was merely a \"decoy\" album to fool audiences. The rumor was proven false when a leaked copy of the album was distributed via filesharing networks a week prior to its official release.\nThe album opener, \"Vicarious\", premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. \"10,000 Days\" sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts, doubling the sales of Pearl Jam's self-titled album, its closest competitor. However, \"10,000 Days\" was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor \"Lateralus\".\nPrior to the release of \"10,000 Days\", a tour kicked off at Coachella on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the \"Lateralus\" tour of 2001; supporting acts were Isis and Mastodon. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a biceps tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend's dog, casting uncertainty on the band's upcoming concerts in North America. Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the Bonnaroo Music Festival with a guest appearance from Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello on \"Lateralus\". Meanwhile, \"Vicarious\" was a nominee for Best Hard Rock Performance and \"10,000 Days\" won Best Recording Package at the 49th Grammy Awards. The music video for \"Vicarious\" was released on DVD on December 18. The band's 2009 summer tour began on July 18 in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Mile High Music Festival. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and a show on August 22 for the Epicenter Festival in Pomona, California.\n\"Fear Inoculum\" (2012\u20132022).\nTheir Tool Winter Tour played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012. The band played at Ozzfest Japan on May 12, 2013. On July 15, 2014, Carey and Jones informed \"Rolling Stone\" that family commitments and an ongoing lawsuit are the key reasons for the delayed fifth album. Carey said to the music publication that one untitled track is \"pretty much done\". In March 2015, Jones revealed that the lawsuit had been settled in the band's favor, and as such, the band was turning their focus towards recording the album. He said that he hoped the album would be finished before the end of 2015 but emphasized that the band would not rush their work to meet an arbitrary deadline. In January 2016, Tool undertook a tour of the United States. While it was reported in February 2017 that Keenan had entered the studio to work on vocals for the fifth Tool album, it was later reported that the album was not scheduled for release in 2017. Still, the band announced a North American tour starting in May. A month later, Chancellor revealed that the new Tool album was \"about 90-percent there\", while Carey claimed in separate interviews that it would \"definitely\" be released in 2018. In February 2018, Jones revealed that Keenan was working on lyrics for the album, and that the band would begin recording in March. In June 2018, during his acceptance speech for the Icon Award at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards, Keenan stated \"I'll go on record now saying you're gonna see some new music next year.\"\n On September 11, 2018, Keenan announced via Twitter that production on the record was progressing and that vocals had been written, before suggesting a 2019 release. In January 2019, Keenan announced that he had completed recording his vocals for the album \"months ago.\" While Carey mentioned aiming for a mid-April release date, Keenan later explained that between May and July was a more realistic time frame to wrap up production and release the album. On May 5, 2019, the band debuted two new songs live at the Welcome to Rockville Festival in Jacksonville, Florida called \"Descending\" and \"Invincible\". Three days later, it was confirmed that the band's new album is scheduled to be released on August 30, 2019. On July 29, 2019, Keenan confirmed the album would be titled \"Fear Inoculum\". The title track was released as a single on August 7, the band's first release in 13 years.\nOn August 2, 2019, Tool's discography (with the exception of \"Salival\") became available on music streaming platforms. Tool was one of the last major holdouts to release their music digitally, as their record deal was signed before the rise in streaming and not revisited until before \"Fear Inoculum\". The release resulted in every Tool release entering several international charts, breaking several \"Billboard\" chart records. Keenan later said he regretted not moving to streaming platforms sooner, as it reduced Tool's exposure to new audiences.\n\"Fear Inoculum\" was launched on August 30 and became Tool's third U.S. number one. On January 26, 2020, the band won the Best Metal Performance for their song \"7empest\" at the 62nd Grammy Awards Their other nomination, \"Fear Inoculum\", lost the Best Rock Song category to Gary Clark Jr.\nIn June 2020, Tool canceled its upcoming North American tour after postponing a handful of dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following August, Carey noted that the band had entered a hiatus, but that he still hoped they would reconvene in the future to record an EP, which the band would have more freedom in releasing due to no longer being signed to a record label. On October 27, 2020, an instrumental song titled \"The Witness\" was released featuring Jones, Chancellor, and Carey, and featuring production from Barresi, though the song was credited to Jones, not the band itself.\n\"Opiate\" was re-recorded and released as \"Opiate\u00b2\" or \"Opiate Squared\" on March 1, 2022. It is almost twice as long as the original and includes the same lyrics as the live version, plus the extended instrumental midsection. A music video directed by Dominic Hailstone was released on March 18, 2022, to commemorate the EP's 30th anniversary.\nUpcoming sixth studio album (2022\u2013present).\nIn March 2022, Carey announced they were working on new material for their sixth studio album, noting that \"..it won't take us this long for the next one. We even had some stuff left over from the last one that we'll develop. We have head starts on three or four new songs.\" In October 2023, Chancellor reiterated this, and noted he hoped the band would enter the studio to record in 2024 after finishing touring. In January 2024, Carey mentioned the new album has the possibility of having a shorter track lengths, noting that \"we could just go back to doing an \"Undertow\" [type of] record. That's kind of appealing to me.\" In February 2025, Chancellor announced Tool would \"dedicate the next three months\" in the studio to \"organizing [their] ideas\" for new music.\nMusical style and influences.\nMusical style.\nTool's musical style has been described as alternative metal, art rock, post-metal, progressive rock, progressive metal, and heavy metal. Tool was described by Patrick Donovan of \"The Age\" as \"the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions.\" Tool has gained critical praise from the \"International Herald Tribune\"'s C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound. Describing their general sound, AllMusic refers to them as \"grinding, post-Jane's Addiction heavy metal\", and \"The New York Times\" sees similarities to \"Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes\". Their 2001 work \"Lateralus\" was compared by AllMusic to Pink Floyd's \"Meddle\" (1971), but thirty years later and altered by \"Tool's impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread\". Tool had been labelled as post-metal in 1993 and 1996, as well as in 2006, after the term came into popularity. A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of unusual time signatures. For instance, Chancellor describes the time signature employed on the first single from \"Lateralus\", \"Schism\", as \"six\" and \"six-and-a-half\" and that it later \"goes into all kinds of other times\". Further examples include the album's title track, which also displays shifting rhythms, as do \"10,000 Days\": \"Wings for Marie (Pt 1)\" and \"10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)\".\nBeyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his wide musical scope. \"Bass Player\" magazine described Chancellor's bass playing as having a \"thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility\". As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a wah effect by hammering \"the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep\", such as on the song \"The Patient\", from \"Lateralus\".\nCompleting the band's rhythm section, drummer Carey uses polyrhythms, tabla-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom electronic drum pads to trigger samples, such as prerecorded tabla and octoban sounds.\nKeenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\": After his performance during an Alice in Chains reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as \"a natural fit at replacing Layne Staley\". Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity\".\nAccording to \"Guitar Player\" magazine, Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques. For example, AllMusic wrote that he \"alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism\" in \"Sober\". Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a \"pipe bomb microphone\" (a guitar pickup mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a talk box guitar solo on \"Jambi\".\nThe band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with their albums, although they eventually released the lyrics for \"Fear Inoculum\" for that album's CD. Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in \"Lateralus\". The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to \"Lateralus\" correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers and the song \"Jambi\" uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot iamb. The lyrics on \"\u00c6nima\" and \"Lateralus\" focus on philosophy and spirituality\u2014specific subjects range from organized religion in \"Opiate\", to evolution and Jungian psychology in \"Forty-Six &amp; 2\" and transcendence in \"Lateralus\". On \"10,000 Days\", Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him: the album name and title track refer to the twenty-seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003.\nInfluences.\nIn 1997, Tool named King Crimson, Melvins, and Peter Gabriel's \"Passion\" as influences. In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are \"influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols.\" In a 1993 interview, Adam Jones mentioned Joni Mitchell, King Crimson, Depeche Mode, and country music as being among their inspirations. In 1997, Maynard James Keenan named \"Hejira\" by Joni Mitchell, \"Holy Money\"/\"Greed\" by Swans, \"Physical Graffiti\" by Led Zeppelin, \"Red\" by King Crimson, and \"Passion\" by Peter Gabriel as his five favorite records. Danny Carey cited Neil Peart from Rush, Bill Bruford and Alan White of Yes as his biggest rock influences, in addition to Bruford's adventurousness in electronic drums. In the same way, Jones stated that Robert Fripp's performances with King Crimson caused him to \"wake up\" to music as a teen. Furthermore, he acknowledged the other King Crimson guitarists, Adrian Belew and Trey Gunn, along with Buzz Osborne from the Melvins, as his biggest influences.\nTool have constantly expressed the massive impact that progressive rock pioneers King Crimson have had on their music; on a 2001 tour with them, Keenan joked: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Carey said that listening to the \"Discipline\" album upon its 1981 release \"revolutionized\" his musical perspective in terms of polyrhythms and the balance between the instruments. In 1997, Keenan explained how the composition process of Tool reflected that of King Crimson: \"They're very much into listening to each other; even though they might have a basic structure that they're following, it's about fitting themselves in with each other.\" Contrary to these statements, longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating \"Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing.\" He also said, {\nThe band's long build-ups of intensity were largely inspired by the Melvins. The latter's influence on Tool is most explicit in \"Undertow\", and some authors have described Tool's music as a progressive take on Melvins. On the other hand, Keenan's exotic modulations were influenced by world music; in his twenties, the singer was immersed in that type of music, thus when Peter Gabriel reunited several musicians whom Keenan already knew of for \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" soundtrack, which mixed their traditional styles with modern ambient music, it became a major revelation for him.\nOther reported influences of Tool include Fant\u00f4mas, Devo, Bill Hicks, Rush, Helmet, Faith No More, Bauhaus, Meshuggah, David Bowie, Black Sabbath, Mike Patton, Dave Lombardo, and Jane's Addiction.\nInfluence on other artists.\nWriters HP Newquist and Rich Maloof attribute to Tool an influence on modern metal in their book \"The New Metal Masters\". Sean Richardson of \"The Boston Phoenix\" sees System of a Down, Deftones, and Korn as examples of Tool's \"towering influence\" on the genre. Keenan's style of singing has been seen as heavily influencing artists such as Pete Loeffler of Chevelle, Benjamin Burnley of Breaking Benjamin, Will Martin of Earshot, and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit.\nVisual arts.\nPart of Tool's work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos, live shows, and album packaging. Adam Jones doubles as the band's art director and director of their music videos. Another expression of this is an official website \"dedicated to the arts and influences\" on the band.\nMusic videos.\nThe band has released eight music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two, which the band states is to prevent people from \"latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music.\" With the exception of \"Hush\" and \"Vicarious\" all of Tool's music videos feature stop motion animation to some extent. The videos are created primarily by Adam Jones, often in collaboration with artists such as Chet Zar, Alex Grey, and Osseus Labyrint.\nThe \"Sober\" music video in particular attracted much attention. Jones explained that it does not contain a storyline, but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery. \"Rolling Stone\" described this imagery as \"evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall\" and called it a \"groundbreaking\", \"epic\" clip. \"Billboard\" voted it \"Best Video by a New Artist\".\nThe video for \"Vicarious\" was released on DVD on December 18, 2007. The video is the first by Tool to be produced entirely through the use of CGI.\nAlbum artwork.\nJones is responsible for most of the band's artwork concepts. The album \"Undertow\" features a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members. Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: \"\u00c6nima\" and \"Salival\" featured works by Cam de Leon; \"Lateralus\" and \"10,000 Days\" were created with the help of Alex Grey. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the Associated Press attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.\nBoth \"\u00c6nima\" and \"10,000 Days\" were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for \"10,000 Days\" that features a pair of stereoscopic lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 1970s artwork he appreciates. The CD packaging for \"Fear Inoculum\" included a rechargeable 4 inch HD video screen and a speaker which played a hidden track along with a video when opened and also included a 36-page booklet.\nLive shows.\nFollowing its first tours in the early 1990s, Tool has performed as a headline act in world tours and major festivals such as Lollapalooza (1997 and 2009), Coachella (1999 and 2006), Voodoo Fest (2001 and 2016), Download Festival (2006 and 2019), Roskilde (2001 and 2006), Big Day Out (2007 and 2011), Bonnaroo (2007 and 2022), All Points West Music &amp; Arts Festival (2009), and Epicenter (2009). They have been joined on stage by numerous artists such as Buzz Osborne and Scott Reeder on several occasions; Tom Morello and Zack de la Rocha during their 1991 tour; Layne Staley in Hawaii, 1993; Tricky, Robert Fripp, Mike Patton, Dave Lombardo, Brann Dailor of Mastodon, and experimental arts duo Osseus Labyrint during their 2001\u201302 \"Lateralus\" tour; and Kirk Hammett, Phil Campbell, Serj Tankian, and Tom Morello during their 2006\u201307 tour. They have covered songs by Led Zeppelin, Ted Nugent, Peach, Kyuss, the Dead Kennedys, and the Ramones.\nLive shows on Tool's headline tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display. Keenan and Carey line up in the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No followspots or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage \"are mostly for Maynard\". He explains, \"[a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows.\" The big screens are used to play back \"looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They\u2019ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice.\" During the \"10,000 Days\" tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD \"Disturb the Normal\".\nBand members.\nCurrent\nFormer\nAwards and nominations.\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n! scope=\"row\"|AMFT Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|Billboard Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=9|Grammy Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungarian Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|iHeartRadio Music Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|MTV Video Music Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|Music Week Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|Pollstar Concert Industry Awards\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30979", "revid": "432843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30979", "title": "The Six Million Dollar Man", "text": "American television series\nThe Six Million Dollar Man is an American science fiction and action television series, running on ABC from March 7, 1973, to March 6, 1978, about a former astronaut, USAF Colonel Steve Austin, portrayed by Lee Majors. After being seriously injured in a NASA test flight crash, Austin is rebuilt (at considerable expense, hence the title of the series) with bionic implants that give him superhuman strength, speed and vision. Austin is then employed as a secret agent by a fictional U.S. government office titled OSI. The series was based on Martin Caidin's 1972 novel \"Cyborg\", which was the working title of the series during pre-production.\nFollowing three television films intended as pilots, which all aired in 1973, \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" television series aired on ABC as a regular episodic series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. Steve Austin became a pop culture icon of the 1970s. A spin-off television series, \"The Bionic Woman\", featuring the lead female character Jaime Sommers, ran from 1976 to 1978. During this time, several crossover episodes were produced. Three television movies featuring both bionic characters were also produced from 1987 to 1994.\nPlot.\nOriginal series.\nWhen NASA astronaut USAF Colonel Steve Austin is severely injured in the crash of an experimental lifting body aircraft, he is \"rebuilt\" in an operation that costs $6 million (equivalent to $41.6 million in 2024). His right arm, both legs and left eye are replaced with \"bionic\" implants that enhance his strength, speed and vision far above human norms: he can run at speeds of over , and his eye has a 20:1 zoom lens and infrared capabilities, while his bionic limbs all have the equivalent power of a bulldozer. He uses his enhanced abilities to work for the OSI (Office of Scientific Intelligence) as a secret agent.\nTelevision movie reunions.\nSteve Austin and Jaime Sommers returned in three subsequent made-for-television movies: \"The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman\" (1987), \"\" (1989) which featured Sandra Bullock in an early role as a new bionic woman; and \"Bionic Ever After?\" (1994) in which Austin and Sommers finally marry. Majors reprised the role of Steve Austin in all three productions, which also featured Richard Anderson and Martin E. Brooks, and Lindsay Wagner reprising the role of Jaime Sommers. The reunion films addressed the partial amnesia Sommers had suffered during the original series, and all three featured Majors's son, Lee Majors II, as OSI agent Jim Castillian. The first two movies were written in the anticipation of creating new bionic characters in their own series, but nothing further was seen of the new characters introduced in those produced. The third TV movie was intended as a finale.\nProduction.\nCaidin's novel \"Cyborg\" was a best-seller when it was published in 1972. He followed it up with three sequels, \"Operation Nuke\", \"High Crystal\", and \"Cyborg IV\", respectively about a black market in nuclear weapons, a \"Chariots of the Gods?\" scenario, and fusing Austin's bionic hardware to a spaceplane.\nIn March 1973, \"Cyborg\" was loosely adapted as a made-for-TV movie titled \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" starring Majors as Austin. The producers' first choice was Monte Markham. (When re-edited for the later series, it was re-titled \"The Moon and the Desert, Parts I and II\".) The adaptation was done by writer Howard Rodman, working under the pseudonym of Henri Simoun. The film, which was nominated for a Hugo Award, modified Caidin's plot and notably made Austin a civilian astronaut rather than a colonel in the United States Air Force. Absent were some of the standard features of the later series: the electronic sound effects, the slow-motion running, and the character of Oscar Goldman. Instead, another character named Oliver Spencer, played by Darren McGavin, was Austin's supervisor, of an organization here called the Office of Strategic Operations, or \"OSO\". (In the novels, \"OSO\" stood for Office of Special Operations. The CIA did have an Office of Scientific Intelligence in the 1970s.) The lead scientist involved in implanting Austin's bionic hardware, Rudy Wells, was played in the pilot by Martin Balsam, then on an occasional basis in the series by Alan Oppenheimer, and, finally, as a series regular, by Martin E. Brooks. Austin did not use the enhanced capabilities of his bionic eye during the first TV movie.\nThe first movie was a major ratings success and was followed by two more made-for-TV movies in October and November 1973 as part of ABC's rotating \"Movie of the Week\" series. The first was titled \"The Six Million Dollar Man: \"Wine, Women and War\"\", and the second was titled \"The Six Million Dollar Man: \"The Solid Gold Kidnapping\"\". The first of these two bore strong resemblances to Caidin's second \"Cyborg\" novel, \"Operation Nuke\"; the second, however, was an original story. This was followed in January 1974 by the debut of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" as a weekly hour-long series. The latter two movies, produced by Glen A. Larson, notably introduced a James Bond flavor to the series and reinstated Austin's status from the novels as an Air Force colonel; the hour-long series, produced by Harve Bennett, dispensed with the James Bond-gloss of the movies, and portrayed a more down-to-earth Austin. (Majors said of Austin, \"[He] hates...the whole idea of spying. He finds it repugnant, degrading. If he's a James Bond, he's the most reluctant one we've ever had.\") Use of deadly force by Austin - frequent in Caidin's novels and employed occasionally in the movies and early episodes - also decreased as the series progressed.\nThe show was very popular during its run and introduced several pop culture elements of the 1970s, such as the show's opening catchphrase (\"We can rebuild him; we have the technology\", voiced over by Richard Anderson in his role of Oscar Goldman), the slow motion action sequences, and the accompanying \"electronic\" sound effects. The slow motion action sequences were originally referred to as \"\"Kung Fu\" slow motion\" in popular culture (due to its use in that 1970s martial arts television series), although according to \"The Bionic Book\" by Herbie J. Pilato, the use of slow motion on the series was inspired by its use by NFL Films.\nIn 1975, a two-part episode titled \"The Bionic Woman\", written for television by Kenneth Johnson, introduced the lead character Jaime Sommers (played by Lindsay Wagner), a professional tennis player who rekindled an old romance with Austin, only to experience a parachuting accident that resulted in her being given bionic parts similar to Austin. Ultimately, her body \"rejected\" her bionic hardware and she died. The character was very popular, however, and the following season it was revealed that she had survived, having been saved by an experimental cryogenic procedure, and she was given her own spin-off series, \"The Bionic Woman\". This spin-off ran until 1978 when both it and \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" were simultaneously cancelled, though the two series were on different networks when their final seasons aired.\nOpening sequence.\nThe crash footage during the opening credits is from the M2-F2 crash that occurred on May 10, 1967. Test pilot Bruce Peterson's lifting body aircraft hit the ground at approximately and tumbled six times, but Peterson survived what appeared to be a fatal accident, though he later lost an eye to infection. In the episode \"The Deadly Replay\", Oscar Goldman refers to the lifting body aircraft in which Austin crashed as the HL-10, stating, \"We've rebuilt the HL-10.\" The HL-10 is the aircraft first seen in the original pilot movie before the accident flight. In the 1987 TV film \"The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman\", Austin refers to the craft as the \"M3-F5\", which was the name used for the aircraft that crashed in the original \"Cyborg\" novel.\nIn the opening sequence, a narrator (series producer Harve Bennett) identifies the protagonist, \"Steve Austin, astronaut. A man barely alive.\" Richard Anderson, in character as Oscar Goldman, then intones off-camera, \"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will \"be\" that man. Better than he was before. Better . . . stronger . . . faster.\" During the first season, beginning with \"Population: Zero\", Anderson, as Goldman, intoned more simply, \"We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was. Better . . . stronger . . . faster.\" During the operation, as his bionics are being fitted, a list of items and numbers is displayed and lists his power plant as \"atomic\".\nTheme music.\nThe opening and closing credits of the \"Wine, Women &amp; War\" and \"The Solid Gold Kidnapping\" telefilms used a theme song written by Glen A. Larson, and sung by Dusty Springfield, backed by Ron \"Escalade\" Piscina. This song was also used in the initial promotion of the series.\nHowever, when the weekly series began, the song was replaced by an instrumental theme by Oliver Nelson. The first regular episode, \"Population: Zero\", introduced a new element to the opening sequence: a voiceover by Oscar Goldman stating the rationale behind creating a bionic man. The first season narration and opening credits arrangement of Nelson's theme were shorter than that used in the second and subsequent seasons.\nSteve Austin's bionics.\nTo maintain the show's plausibility, producer Kenneth Johnson set very specific limits on Steve Austin's abilities. He elaborated, \"When you're dealing with the area of fantasy, if you say, 'Well, they're bionic so they can do whatever they want,' then it gets out of hand, so you've got to have really, really tight rules. [Steve and Jaime] can jump up two stories but not three. They can jump down three stories but not four.\"\nAustin's superhuman enhancements are:\n It has a 20.2:1 zoom lens along with a night vision function (as well as the restoration of normal vision). The figure of 20.2:1 is taken from the faux computer graphics in the opening credits; the figure 20:1 is mentioned twice in the series, in the episode \"Population: Zero\" and \"Secret of Bigfoot\". Austin's bionic eye also has other features, such as an infrared filter used frequently to see in the dark and also to detect heat (as in the episode \"The Pioneers\"), and the ability to view humanoid beings moving too fast for a normal eye to see (as in the story arc \"The Secret of Bigfoot\"). One early episode shows the eye as a deadly accurate targeting device for his throwing arm.\n In Caidin's original novels, Austin's eye was depicted as simply a camera (which had to be physically removed after use) and Austin remained blind in the eye. Later, Austin gained the ability to shoot a laser from the eye. The Charlton Comics comic book spin-off from the series also established that Austin's bionic eye could shoot a laser beam (as demonstrated in the first issues of the color comic), but neither function was shown on television.\n These allow him to run at tremendous speed and make great leaps. Austin's upper speed limit was never firmly established, although a speed of is commonly quoted since this figure is shown on a speed gauge during the opening credits. The highest speed ever shown in the series on a speed gauge is in \"The Pal-Mir Escort\"; however, the later revival films suggested that he could run approximately . A faster top speed is possible, as an episode of the \"Bionic Woman\" spin-off entitled \"Winning Is Everything\" shows female cyborg Jaime Sommers outrunning a race car going . In \"Secret of Bigfoot\" it is stated that he can leap high. In the later TV movies, Austin is shown leaping heights that clearly appear to be far in excess of this.\n It has the equivalent strength of a bulldozer; that the arm contains a Geiger counter was established in \"Doomsday and Counting\", the sixth episode of the first season.\nThe implants have a major flaw in that extreme cold interferes with their functions and can disable them given sufficient exposure. However, when Austin returns to a warmer temperature, the implants quickly regain full functionality. The first season also established that Austin's bionics malfunction in the micro-gravity of space, though Austin's bionics are later modified to rectify this. The bionic eye is vulnerable to ultrasonic attack, resulting in blindness and dizziness. It is not explained how Austin's organic body is able to withstand the stress of either bionic hardware weight or performance of superhuman feats.\nTo indicate to viewers that Austin was using his bionic enhancements, sequences with him performing superhuman tasks were presented in slow-motion and accompanied by an electronic \"dit dit dit dit\" sound effect. (This characteristic sound effect was actually first used in season 1 episode 4, \"Day of the Robot\", not during use of Austin's bionics but with the robotic clone of Major Fred Sloan, played by actor John Saxon, during the final fight scene.) When the bionic eye was used, the camera zoomed in on Austin's face, followed by an extreme close-up of his eye; his point of view usually included a crosshair motif accompanied by a beeping sound-effect. In early episodes, different ways of presenting Austin's powers were tested, including a heartbeat sound effect that predated the electronic sound, and in the three original made-for-TV movies, no sound effects or slow-motion were used, with Austin's actions shown at normal speed (except for his running, which used trick photography); the slow-motion portrayal was introduced with the first hour-long episode, \"Population: Zero\".\nNovels.\nMartin Caidin wrote four novels featuring his original version of Steve Austin beginning in 1972 with \"Cyborg\". Although several other writers such as Mike Jahn later wrote a number of novelizations based upon the TV series, in most cases these writers chose to base their character upon the literary version of Austin rather than the TV show version. As a result, several of the novelizations have entire scenes and in one case an ending that differed from the original episodes, as the cold-blooded killer of Caidin's novels handled things somewhat differently from his non-killing TV counterpart. For example, the Jahn book \"International Incidents\", an adaptation of the episode \"Love Song for Tanya\", ends with Austin using the poison dart gun in his bionic hand to kill an enemy agent; since the TV version of the character lacked this weapon, the villain was simply captured in the episode as broadcast.\nOther adaptations.\nComics.\nCharlton Comics published both a color comic book and a black and white, illustrated magazine, featuring original adventures as well as differing adaptations of the original TV movie. While the comic book was closely based upon the series, and geared toward a young audience, the magazine was darker and more violent and seemed to be based more upon the literary version of the character, aimed at adult readers. Both magazines were cancelled around the same time the TV series ended. Artists Howard Chaykin and Neal Adams were frequent contributors to both publications. Steve Kahn, who had previously published magazines on the Beatles and the teen fan magazine FLiP, worked with MCA and Charlton in overseeing and publishing these books.\nA British comic strip version was also produced, written by Angus P. Allan, drawn by Martin Asbury and printed in TV comic \"Look-In\" (around the time both TV series ended in 1978, it and \"Look-In's\" \"Bionic Woman\" strip merged into one title called \"Bionic Action\"). A series of standalone comic strips was printed on the packaging of a series of model kits by Fundimensions based upon the series. In Colombia, a black and white comic book series was published in the late 70s, with art and stories by Jorge Pe\u00f1a. This series was licensed by Universal studios to Greco (Grupo Editorial Colombiano), then known as Editora Cinco, now part of Grupo Editorial Televisa. In France, \"T\u00e9l\u00e9-Junior\", a magazine devoted to comic book adaptations of all sorts of TV series and cartoons also featured a \"Six Million Dollar Man\" comic (under its French title, \"L'Homme qui valait trois milliards\", i.e. \"The Three Billion Dollar Man\") with art by Pierre Le Goff and stories by P. Tabet and Bodis. A tradepaperback reprinting several episodes from the magazine was released in October, 1980.\nIn 1996, a new comic book series entitled \"Bionix\" was announced, to be published by Maximum Press. The comic was to have been an updated version of both the \"Six Million Dollar Man\" and the \"Bionic Woman\" and feature new renditions of the two characters. Although the magazine was advertised in comic book trade publications, it was ultimately never published.\nOn August 24, 2011, Dynamite Comics published the first issue of \"The Bionic Man\", an adaptation written by Kevin Smith based upon a screenplay he'd written for a never-produced 1990s motion picture version of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". After concluding the adaptation in the spring of 2012 the comic series moved on to original stories, as well as a re-imagining of the original TV series' \"Secret of Bigfoot\" storyline. A spin-off comic re-imagining \"The Bionic Woman\" followed a few months later, and in January 2013 Dynamite launched a crossover mini-series, \"The Bionic Man vs. The Bionic Woman\". The artwork in these series, covers and interiors, varies between Austin being rendered in the likeness of Lee Majors and not. As 2014 began, Dynamite discontinued its reboot titles and replaced them with a new ongoing series, \"The Six Million Dollar Man Season 6\", continuing the adventures of Austin from the conclusion of the 1977\u201378 season and featuring not only the likeness of Lee Majors, but also other recurring actors such as Richard Anderson, as well as Darren McGavin as Oliver Spencer from the first TV movie. Jaime Sommers was reintroduced from issue 3, with a spin-off comic series, \"The Bionic Woman Season 4\", announced in June 2014 with a scheduled launch in the fall of 2014. Dynamite has since published crossover titles pairing Jaime with characters from \"Charlie's Angels\" and the Lynda Carter version of DC Comics' Wonder Woman, and a crossover featuring Steve encountering characters from \"G.I. Joe\".\nAudiobooks.\nPeter Pan Records and its sister company Power Records published several record albums featuring original dramatized stories (including an adaptation of the pilot film), several of which were also adapted as comic books designed to be read along with the recording. Three albums' worth of stories were released, one of which featured Christmas-themed stories. Individual stories were also released in other formats, including singles.\nFilm.\nUniversal Pictures developed a screenplay in 1995 with Kevin Smith, but the outing never materialized. In December 2001, it was announced that Universal had pacted with Dimension Films on the project after Dimension president Bob Weinstein saw its potential as a franchise. Universal retained film rights to the original TV show, while Dimension purchased the rights to the \"Cyborg\" novel, as well as Caidin's three other novels in the series: \"Operation Nuke\", \"High Crystal\" and \"Cyborg IV\". Larry Gordon and Scott Faye were going to produce with Paul Rosenberg's Collision Entertainment. Smith's screenplay was later adapted for \"The Bionic Man\", an ongoing comic book series launched in 2011 by Dynamite Comics.\nIn October 2002, Trevor Sands was hired to write a new screenplay, titled \"The Six Billion Dollar Man\", but Dimension scrapped it when actor Jim Carrey pitched a comedic take on the material for him to star in, with Scot Armstrong as writer and Todd Phillips as director/co-writer. Filming was expected to begin in 2004.\nIn a July 2006 interview at San Diego Comic-Con, Richard Anderson (who played Oscar Goldman in the series) stated that he was involved with producing a movie of the series, but the rights were at the time in litigation between Miramax and Universal.\nOn November 6, 2014, it was announced that a feature film, tentatively titled \"The Six Billion Dollar Man\", would go into production. Mark Wahlberg was set to play Colonel Steve Austin, with Peter Berg as director. Filming was to begin in early 2015, for a theatrical release the following year. On November 2, 2015, it was reported that Berg had left the film and had been replaced by Damian Szifron, who will also write the film. Filming was to begin in September 2016 with a December 22, 2017, release date.\nIn December 2017, The Weinstein Company sold the film's rights to Warner Bros. As of January 2018, they hoped to start filming the movie in mid-2018. In April 2018, they set a May 31, 2019, release for the film. The film was moved to June 5, 2020, until \"Wonder Woman 1984\" took over the release date, and in April 2019, Travis Knight and Bill Dubuque replaced Szifron as director and writer. In August 2024 Wahlberg said he was still hopeful for the film going ahead.\nCultural influence.\nIn Brazil, under the military dictatorship, some important government officials, previously elected by direct suffrage, were appointed by the president, or elected indirectly, out of a shortlist picked by the president. These politicians were called \"bionic\" (\"bi\u00f4nicos\"), due to the series' popularity, and the association with the perceived extraordinary power and influence held by the appointed officials. Between 1964 and 1985, Brazil came to have \"bionic\" senators, governors and mayors. With the 1988 Constitution of Brazil, all \"bionic\" appointments were abolished.\nIn Israel, the series was retitled \"The Man Worth Millions\" since \"six million\" evoked memories of The Holocaust; specifically the most commonly quoted estimate of the number of Jewish victims.\nIn Indonesia, the comedy group Warkop released a 1981 parody comedy film of the series \"Manusia 6.000.000 Dollar\", with the title being simply a direct translation.\nAward.\nIn 2003, Lee Majors won TV Land's \"Superest Superhero\" award.\nHome media.\nUniversal Playback released the first two seasons of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" on DVD in Region 2 and Region 4 in 2005\u20132006. The first three seasons were also released on the Italian market (Region 2) in late 2008. The season 1 release also features the three pilot movies that preceded the weekly series.\nThe Region 1 (North American) release, along with that of \"The Bionic Woman\" was one of the most eagerly awaited; its release had been withheld for many years due to copyright issues regarding the original novel. In fact, with the exception of a few episodes released in the DiscoVision format in the early 1980s and a single VHS release of the two-part \"The Bionic Woman\" storyline that same decade, the series as a whole had never been released in North America in any home video format.\nOn July 21, 2010, Time Life (under license from Universal Pictures) announced the release of a complete series box set of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" on DVD in Region 1 on November 23, 2010. The 40-disc set features all 99 episodes of the series as well as the three pilot films and the three reunion TV-movies which also feature Jaime Sommers, along with several episodes of \"The Bionic Woman\" that were part of inter-series crossovers (i.e. part one aired on one series, and part two on another) in order to include complete storylines. In addition, the set features extensive bonus features including interviews and featurettes with all major cast members and the set comes encased in collectible packaging that includes a sound chip, activated when the box is opened, that plays back part of the first season opening credits dialogue. The release is available directly through Time-Life's \"6mdm\" website as well a through several third-party on-line vendors.\nIn November 2011, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment began releasing individual season sets of the series on DVD, available in retail stores. It has subsequently released all five seasons. The fifth and final season was released on February 18, 2014.\nSeveral episodes of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" actually saw their North American DVD debut several weeks in advance of the box set, as Universal Home Video included the three \"crossover\" episodes that helped launch \"The Bionic Woman\" as bonuses on the October 19, 2010 DVD release of Season 1 of \"The Bionic Woman\".\nOn October 13, 2015, Universal Home Video released a retail version of \"The Six Million Dollar Man - The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1.\nIn Region 2, Fabulous Films acquired the rights to the series in 2012 and subsequently released seasons 3\u20135 on DVD on October 1, 2012. It also re-released the first two seasons on February 25, 2013. A 40-disc complete series boxset was released on April 2, 2012.\nOn May 2, 2022, Shout Factory announced the complete series is scheduled to be released on Blu-ray July 12, 2022. It will also feature crossover episodes and six films.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30980", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30980", "title": "Tory", "text": "Conservative political philosophy\nA Tory () is an individual who supports a political philosophy known as Toryism, based on a British version of traditionalist conservatism which upholds the established social order as it has evolved through the history of Great Britain. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase \"God, King (or Queen) and Country\". Tories are monarchists, were historically of a high church Anglican religious heritage, and were opposed to the liberalism of the Whig party.\nThe philosophy originates from the Cavaliers, a royalist faction which supported the House of Stuart during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Tories, a British political party which emerged during the late 17th century, was a reaction to the Whig-controlled Parliaments that succeeded the Cavalier Parliament. As a political term, \"Tory\" (a word of Irish origin) was first used during the Exclusion Crisis of 1678\u20131681.\nIt also has exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America, who opposed secession during the American War of Independence. Loyalists who fled to the Canadas at the end of the conflict, known as the United Empire Loyalists, formed the support base for political cliques in Upper and Lower Canada. Toryism remains prominent in the politics of Canada and the United Kingdom. The British Conservative Party and Conservative Party of Canada, and their supporters, continue to be referred to as Tories. Adherents to traditional Toryism in contemporary times are referred to as High Tories, who typically defend the ideas of hierarchy, natural order, and aristocracy.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Tory\" derives from the Irish \"t\u00f3ra\u00ed\", meaning \"outlaw\" (literally \"pursuer\"). It entered the English language in the 17th century, when it was used to describe Irish outlaws who survived by committing acts of robbery and plunder against English settlers. Later, it came to denote any Catholic or Royalist who had taken up arms against the English government. \nThe word entered English politics during the Exclusion Crisis, emerging as a pejorative term for supporters of the Duke of York and his hereditary right to inherit the throne despite his Catholic religion. According to Daniel Defoe, it was popularised by Titus Oates, who once received a warning that a group of Irish Tories intended to assassinate him. Following this incident, Oates \"could never hear any man [...] talk against the plot, or against the witnesses, but he thought he was one of these \"tories\", and call'd almost every man a \"tory\" that oppos'd him in discourse; till at last the word \"tory\" became popular, and it stuck so close to the [Yorkist] party in all their bloody proceedings that they had no way to get it off\".\nAlthough both \"Tory\" and \"Whig\" originated as pejoratives, they soon became neutral terms for the two major factions in British politics. The suffix \"-ism\" was added to make Whiggism and Toryism, meaning the principles and methods of each faction.\nDuring the American Revolution, the term \"Tory\" was used interchangeably with the term \"Loyalist\" in the Thirteen Colonies to refer to colonists who remained loyal to the Crown during the conflict. The term contrasts the colloquial term used to describe supporters of the revolution, \"Patriots\" or \"Whigs\".\nPolitical history.\nTowards the end of Charles II's reign (1660\u20131685) there was some debate about whether his brother, James, Duke of York, should be allowed to accede to the throne because of James's Catholicism. \"Whigs\", originally a reference to Scottish cattle-drovers (stereotypically radical anti-Catholic Covenanters), was the abusive term directed at those who wanted to exclude James on the grounds that he was a Catholic. Those who were not prepared to exclude James were labelled \"Abhorrers\" and later \"Tories\". Titus Oates applied the term \"Tory\", which then signified an Irish robber, to those who would not believe in his Popish Plot and the name gradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy with the Catholic Duke of York.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Tory political faction originally emerged within the Parliament of England to uphold the legitimist rights of James II to succeed his brother Charles II to the thrones of the three kingdoms. James became a Catholic at a time when the state institutions were fiercely independent from the Catholic Church\u2014this was an issue for the Exclusion Crisis supporting Patricians, the political heirs to the nonconformist Roundheads and Covenanters. During the Exclusion Crisis, the word Tory was applied in the Kingdom of England as a nickname to the opponents of the bill, called the Abhorrers. The word \"Tory\" had connotations of Papist and outlaw derived from its previous use in Ireland.\nThere were two Tory ministries after James II acceded to the throne: the first led by the Earl of Rochester, the second by Lord Belasyse. A significant faction took part in the Glorious Revolution, the military coup d'\u00e9tat that ousted James II with the Whigs to defend the Church of England and definitive Protestantism. A large but dwindling faction of Tories continued to support James in exile and his Stuart heirs to the throne, especially in 1714 after the Hanoverian Succession by George I, the first Hanoverian monarch. Although only a minority of Tories gave their adhesion to the Jacobite risings, this was used by the Whigs to discredit the Tories and paint them as traitors. After the advent of the Prime Ministerial system under the Whig Robert Walpole, Lord Bute's premiership in the reign of George III marked a revival. Under the Corn Laws (1815\u20131846), a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for higher food prices, self-sufficiency and enhanced wages in rural employment.\nEnglish Tories from the time of the Glorious Revolution up until the Reform Act 1832 were characterised by strong monarchist tendencies, support for the Church of England and hostility to radical reform, while the Tory party was an actual organisation which held power intermittently throughout the same period. Conservatism began to emerge in the late 18th century\u2014it synthesised moderate Whig economic policies and many Tory social values to create a new political philosophy and faction in opposition to the French Revolution. Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger led the way in this. Interventionism and strong-armed forces were to prove a hallmark of Toryism under subsequent prime ministers. The word \"Conservative\" began to be used in place of Tory during the 1830s, as Robert Peel's followers began to re-interpret elements of Tory tradition under a banner of support for social reform and free trade. The party was eventually succeeded by the Conservative and Unionist Party, with the term \"Tory\" enduring to become an interchangeable phrase with \"Conservative\".\nCanada.\nThe term \"Tory\" was first used to designate the pre-Confederation British ruling classes of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, known as the Family Compact and the Ch\u00e2teau Clique, an elite within the governing classes and often members within a section of society known as the United Empire Loyalists. The United Empire Loyalists were American loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies who resettled elsewhere in British North America during or after the American Revolutionary War.\nIn post-Confederation Canada, the terms \"Red Tory\" and \"Blue Tory\" have long been used to describe the two wings of the Conservative and previously the Progressive Conservative (PC) parties. The dyadic tensions originally arose out of the 1854 political union of British-Canadian Tories, French-Canadian traditionalists and the monarchist and loyalist leaning sections of the emerging commercial classes at the time\u2014many of whom were uncomfortable with the pro-American and annexationist tendencies within the liberal Clear Grits. Tory strength and prominence in the political culture was a feature of life in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Manitoba.\nBy the 1930s, the factions within Canadian Toryism were associated with either the urban business elites or with rural traditionalists from the country's hinterland. A \"Red Tory\" is a member of the more moderate wing of the party (in the manner of John Farthing and George Grant). They are generally unified by their adherence to British traditions in Canada.\nThroughout the course of Canadian history, the Conservative Party was generally controlled by MacDonaldian Tory elements, which in Canada meant an adherence to the English-Canadian traditions of Monarchy, Empire-Commonwealth, parliamentary government, nationalism, protectionism, social reform and eventually acceptance of the necessity of the welfare state.\nBy the 1970s, the Progressive Conservative Party was a Keynesian-consensus party. With the onset of stagflation in the 1970s, some Canadian Tories came under the influence of neo-liberal developments in the United Kingdom and the United States, which highlighted the policies for privatization and supply-side interventions. In Canada, these Tories have been labelled neoconservatives\u2014which has a somewhat different connotation in the United States. By the early 1980s, there was no clear neoconservative in the Tory leadership cadre, but Brian Mulroney (who became leader in 1983) eventually came to adopt many policies from the Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan governments.\nAs Mulroney took the Progressive Conservative Party further in this direction, with policy initiatives in the areas of deregulation, privatization, free-trade and a consumption tax called the Goods and services tax (GST), many traditionally-minded Tories became concerned that a political and cultural schism was occurring within the party.\nThe 1986 creation of the Reform Party of Canada attracted some of the neo-liberals and social conservatives away from the Tory party, and as some of the neoconservative policies of the Mulroney government proved unpopular, some of the provincial-rights elements moved towards Reform as well. In 1993, Mulroney resigned rather than fight an election based on his record after almost nine years in power. This left the Progressive Conservatives in disarray and scrambling to understand how to make Toryism relevant in provinces such as Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia that had never had a strong Tory tradition and political culture.\nThereafter in the 1990s, the Progressive Conservatives were a small party in the House of Commons of Canada and could only exert legislative pressure on the government through their power in the Senate of Canada. Eventually, through death and retirements, this power waned. Joe Clark returned as leader, but the schism with the Reformers effectively watered down the combined Blue and Red Tory vote in Canada.\nBy the late 1990s, there was talk of the necessity of uniting the right in Canada to deter further Liberal Party majorities. Many Tories\u2014both red and blue\u2014opposed such moves, while others took the view that all would have to be pragmatic if there was any hope of reviving a strong party system. The Canadian Alliance party (as the Reform Party had become) and some leading Tories came together on an informal basis to see if they could find common ground. While Progressive Conservative Leader Joe Clark rebuffed the notion, the talks moved ahead and eventually, in December 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative parties voted to rejoin as a new party called the Conservative Party of Canada.\nAfter the merger of the Progressive Conservatives with the Canadian Alliance in 2003, there was debate as to whether the \"Tory\" appellation should survive at the federal level. Commentators speculated that some Alliance members would take offence at the term. Nevertheless, it was officially adopted by the merged party during the 2004 leadership convention. Stephen Harper, former leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015, regularly refers to himself as a Tory and says the new party is a natural evolution of the conservative political movement. However, there were some dissident Red Tories who were against the merger. They formed the rival Progressive Canadian Party.\nUnited States.\nThe term \"Loyalist\" was used in the American Revolution for those who remained loyal to the British Crown. About 80% of the Loyalists remained in the United States after the war. The 60,000 or so Loyalists who settled in Nova Scotia, Quebec, the Bahamas, or returned to Great Britain after the American War of Independence are known as United Empire Loyalists.\nOn 12 February 1798, Thomas Jefferson (of the Democratic-Republican Party) described the conservative Federalist Party as \"[a] political Sect [...] believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support, [who] are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes Tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of the same definition\". However, that was clearly a hostile description by the Federalists' foes of whom Jefferson was one and not a name used by the Federalists themselves. The Federalist Party was dissolved in 1835 with no successor parties.\nLater, the Democratic-Republican Party splintered into different parties, with the two dissidences being the National Republican Party and the Whig Party. The rest of the party would become the Democratic Party. The National Republican Party would then merge with the Whig Party, giving rise to what would be called the Second Party System. Although the Whig Party adopted its name from its British counterpart, the term \"Tories\" had already completely fallen out of favour in the US.\nDuring the American Civil War, Confederate forces commonly referred to Southern Unionists as \"Tories\", drawing a parallel with the Tories of the American Revolutionary War. To the Confederates, Southern Unionists symbolised a direct challenge to their political aspirations and were viewed as \"traitors to the white race\". Conversely, Unionists regarded Southern Unionists as a loyal segment of the Southern population, swept by the tide of succession, and around whom the foundations of Reconstruction would be built.\nTexas Revolution.\nIn Texas in 1832\u20131836, support for the Texas Revolution was not unanimous. The \"Tories\" were men who supported the Mexican government. The Tories generally were long-term property holders whose roots were outside of the lower South. They typically had little interest in politics and sought conciliation rather than war. The Tories wanted to preserve the economic, political and social gains that they enjoyed as citizens of Mexico, and the revolution threatened to jeopardise those gains.\nCurrent usage.\n\"Tory\" has become shorthand for a member of the Conservative Party or for the party in general in Canada and the UK, and can be used interchangeably with the word \"Conservative\".\nNorth America.\nIn the United States, \"Tory\" is often used as a historical term to describe supporters of Great Britain during the American Revolution. However, in Canadian parlance, British supporters during the revolution are called \"Loyalists\", with the term \"Tory\" being used as a contemporary political term.\nIn Canada, a \"Tory\" refers to a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, while the party as a whole are colloquially referred to as the \"Tories\". It is also used to refer to the party's predecessor, including the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In addition to the federal Conservative Party, the terms have also been used to describe provincial Conservative/Progressive Conservative parties and their members. LGBTory is an advocacy group for LGBT supporters of the Conservative Party of Canada and provincial conservative parties.\nThe terms \"Blue Tory\" and \"Red Tory\" describe two factions of Canada's federal and provincial conservative parties. The former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, Tim Hudak, adopted the term \"Purple Tory\" to characterize himself, aiming to avoid the strong ideological stance and instead provide a conciliatory position between Blue Tories and Red Tories. The term \"Pink Tory\" is also used by Canadian politics as a pejorative term to describe a conservative party member who is perceived as liberal.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Conservative and Unionist Party is often colloquially referred to as the \"Tories\", both by themselves and by opponents, and also in the media. Members and voters of the party are also often referred to as \"Tories\" as well. The British Broadcasting Corporation's own style guide permits the use of the term \"Tory\", although it requires the term \"Conservative\" to be used in its first instance.\nIn Scotland, the term \"Tory\" refers not only to members and supporters of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, but is also used to accuse other parties of being insufficiently opposed to that party. For example, members and supporters of the Scottish Labour Party (especially those from the \"Blairite and Brownite\" factions) may be referred to as \"Red Tories\" by traditional Labour members and advocates of an independent Scotland such as members and supporters of the Scottish National Party, the Alba Party (formerly Solidarity), the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Greens. Similarly, Labour supporters have referred to SNP members and supporters as being \"Tartan Tories\".\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, \"Tory\" is occasionally used as a pejorative term by members of the Australian Labor Party to refer to conservative members of the Liberal Party of Australia and National Party of Australia parties (who are in a long-standing coalition). The term is not used anywhere near as often as in the UK and Canada, and it is rare \u2013 though not unheard of \u2013 for members of those parties to self-describe as 'Tories'.\nWriting in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Michael Persse notes the impact of 'Liberal Toryism' on the colonial era Australian statesman William Charles Wentworth when he was in Britain. Chief Justice Garfield Barwick titled his memoir \"A Radical Tory\". The newspaper of the University of Sydney Conservative Club is named \"The Sydney Tory\". A moderate faction of the Australian Greens has been pejoratively dubbed the \"Tree Tories\" by the hard left faction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30981", "revid": "3080835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30981", "title": "Toronto Transit Commission", "text": "Public transit agency located in Toronto, Ontario\nThe Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is the primary public transport agency in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, operating the majority of the city's bus and rail services. It is the oldest and largest of the urban transit service providers in the Greater Toronto Area, with numerous connections to systems serving its surrounding municipalities.\nEstablished as the Toronto Transportation Commission in 1921, the TTC owns and operates three rapid transit lines with 70 stations, more than 150 bus routes, and nine streetcar lines. In 2024, the system had a total of 800,212,000 boardings. The TTC is the most heavily used urban mass transit system in Canada.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPublic transit in Toronto started in 1849 with a privately operated transit service. In later years, the city operated some routes, but in 1921, assumed control over all routes and formed the Toronto Transportation Commission to operate them. During this period, streetcars provided the bulk of the service. In 1954, the TTC adopted its present name, opened the first subway line, and greatly expanded its service area to cover the newly formed municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (which eventually amalgamated into the present City of Toronto). The system has evolved to feature a wide network of surface routes with the subway lines as the backbone. On February 17, 2008, the TTC made many service improvements, reversing more than a decade of service reductions and only minor improvements.\nIn addition to buses, streetcars, and subways, the TTC also operated the Toronto Island ferry service from 1927 to 1962, when it was transferred to the Metro Parks and Culture department (now Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation). The TTC also operated a suburban and regional intercity bus operator, Gray Coach Lines, from 1927 to 1990. Gray Coach used interurban coaches to link Toronto to points throughout southern Ontario. In addition, Gray Coach operated tour buses in association with Gray Line Tours. The main terminal was the Metropolitan Toronto Bus Terminal on Elizabeth Street north of Dundas Street, downtown. In 1954, Gray Coach expanded further when it acquired suburban routes from independent bus operators not merged with the TTC as it expanded to cover Metro Toronto. By the 1980s, Gray Coach faced fierce competition in the interurban service in the GTA. The TTC sold Gray Coach Lines in 1990 to Stagecoach Holdings, which split the operation between Greyhound Canada and the government of Ontario three years later.\nThe Gloucester subway cars, the first version of TTC subway cars, known as \"red rockets\" because of their bright red exterior, have been retired. The current T-series trains also have a red interior color scheme. The name lives on as the TTC uses the phrase to advertise the service, such as \"Ride the Rocket\" in advertising material, \"Rocket\" in the names of some express buses, and the new \"Toronto Rocket\" subway cars, which began revenue operation on July 21, 2011. Another common slogan is \"The Better Way\".\nFinances.\nThe TTC recovered 69.6 percent of its operating costs from the fare box in 2017. From its creation in 1921 until 1971, the TTC was self-supporting both for capital and operations (it had to pay property taxes until 1967). Through the Great Depression and World War II, it accumulated reserves that allowed it to expand considerably after the war, both with subways and major steady growth of its bus services into the suburbs. It was not until 1971 that the Metro Toronto government and the province started to provide operational funding, required primarily due to rising costs of delivering transit to low-density suburbs in Metro Toronto and large wage increases. Deficits and government funding soared throughout the 1970s and 1980s, followed by service cuts and a period of ridership decline in the 1990s, partly attributable to recession.\nIn 1997, the Progressive Conservative government under Premier Mike Harris implemented the \"Common Sense Revolution\" which, among other things, cut CA$ in provincial financing support for the Eglinton West subway line, and cut $718million in municipal transit support, placing the entire burden of financing the system on municipalities and leaving the TTC with a $95.8million/year funding shortfall. The TTC cut back service with a significant curtailment put into effect on February 18, 1996. Since then, the TTC has consistently been in financial difficulties. Service cuts were averted in 2007, though, when Toronto City Council voted to introduce new taxes to help pay for city services, including the TTC. As a result, since 2011, the TTC became the largest transit operator in Anglo-America not to receive provincial or state funding. The TTC has received federal funding for capital projects from as early as 2009. The TTC is also considered one of the costliest transit systems per fare price in North America. For the 2011 operating year, the TTC had a projected operating budget of $1.45billion. Revenue from fares covered approximately 70 percent of the budget, whereas the remaining 30 percent originated from the City. From 2009 through 2011, provincial and federal funding amounted to 0 percent of the budget. In contrast to this, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al receives approximately 10 percent of its operating budget from the Quebec provincial government, and OC Transpo receives 9 percent of its funding from the province. The fairness of preferentially funding transit in specific Canadian cities has been questioned by citizens.\nOn August 12, 2020, the Province of Ontario promised $404million for TTC operations to compensate for reduced ridership and revenue loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more funding to come later. The TTC projected a shortfall of $700million in 2020.\nOperations.\nBuses.\nBuses are a large part of TTC operations today. However, before about 1960, they played a minor role compared to streetcars. Buses began to operate in the city in 1921, and became necessary for areas without streetcar service. After an earlier experiment in the 1920s, trolley buses were used on a number of routes starting in 1947, but all trolley bus routes were converted to bus operation between 1991 and 1993. The TTC always used the term \"trolley coach\" to refer to its trackless electric vehicles. Hundreds of old buses have been replaced with the low-floor Orion VII, and the TTC has acquired many hybrid electric buses. The TTC's hybrid buses were first put on the road in 2006; these were followed by the newer 500 Orion VII Next Generation Hybrids in 2008. A new order brought the total number of hybrids to over 500, second only to New York City. Older TTC Orion VIIs from 2001 to 2006 feature the standard \"breadbox\" style, whereas newer buses, from 2007 onwards, feature Orion's new, more stylish body. With a total of 2,031 buses, the TTC is the third-largest transit bus operator in North America, behind the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City (more than 5,600) and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2,911).\nThe TTC also runs Wheel-Trans, a paratransit service for the physically disabled with special low-floor buses designed to accommodate wheelchairs and to make boarding easier for ambulatory customers with limited mobility.\nThe TTC ordered 153 Nova LFS Artic articulated buses with all newly ordered buses in service by January 2015. At long, the Nova LFS Artics hold about 112 passengers, compared with 65 on a standard bus.\nSome of the newer TTC buses have USB-A ports for passengers to charge their mobile devices.\nSubway.\nThe Toronto subway system consists of three lines:\nFrom 1985 until 2023, Line 3 Scarborough, a partly elevated light metro line served the district of Scarborough.\nThe three subway lines are served by 678 cars grouped in trains of four cars on Line 4 Sheppard, and six cars on Line 1 Yonge\u2013University and Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth. The three subway lines share non-revenue track connections and use the same technology. The rolling stock in use consists of the Toronto Rocket trains on Lines 1 and 4 and the T-series trains on Line 2. Line 3 Scarborough had a fleet of 28 S-series cars grouped into trains of four cars each and was not compatible with other subway lines, given that the S-series cars used . It shared no track connections or equipment. Due to the increasing difficulty of performing critical maintenance work on the S-series trains, the existing Line 3 Scarborough service was initially scheduled to be decommissioned permanently in November 2023; instead, the line closed four months ahead of schedule after a derailment on July 24, 2023. The line has been replaced by TTC bus service until the Line 2 Scarborough subway extension to Sheppard and McCowan opens for revenue service in 2030 at the earliest.\nAll subway lines provide service seven days a week from approximately 5:45\u00a0a.m. to 1:30\u00a0a.m. the following day (last train runs at approximately 1:45\u00a0a.m. in each direction) except for Sundays, when start of service is delayed until approximately 8:00\u00a0a.m. During the overnight periods, the subway and its stations are closed to enable maintenance at track level and in the stations themselves. Overnight service is provided by buses and streetcars operating above ground. These overnight routes are issued numbers in the 300-series and are referred to as Blue Night routes, indicated by a typical TTC bus stop sign with a blue band added.\nProjects under construction.\nLine 5 Eglinton, which uses light rail vehicles, is under construction. It will run underground in the central part of the line from west of Keele Street to Laird Drive, with most of the remainder of the route travelling at grade, though Don Valley station will be underground. The full first phase of the route will span across the city, from in York to Kennedy station in Scarborough.\nLine 6 Finch West is an , 18-stop light rail line under construction, extending west in a dedicated right-of-way lane from Finch West station on Line 1 Yonge\u2013University to Humber Polytechnic's North Campus in Etobicoke. The line is forecast to provide approximately 14.6million rides a year, or 40,000 a day, by 2031. It has an estimated cost of $1.2billion.\nThe Ontario Line, which is a rapid transit line and successor to the Relief Line, is expected to be completed by 2030. The Ontario government estimates the line's cost at $10.9billion for the stretch from Ontario Place to Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue East at Don Valley station (part of the under-construction Line 5). It is the largest single expansion in Toronto subway history.\nThe Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth extension is a subway extension, which will continue Line 2 east towards McCowan Road and north towards Scarborough City Centre and to a new terminal at the intersection of McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue. The $5.5-billion extension will replace the defunct Line 3 Scarborough and is expected to be complete in 2030 at the earliest.\nThe Eglinton Crosstown West extension will extend the under-construction Line 5 Eglinton west to Renforth station and Pearson International Airport by 2030 or 2031 and will be mostly underground. The line will travel through all six of Toronto's districts that were amalgamated in 1998 and bring the subway to Mississauga.\nFuture plans.\nThere is currently one priority TTC expansion plan:\nPrevious plans called for a second, eastward extension of Line 5 to the University of Toronto Scarborough campus, though this has since been replaced with plans for a separate Eglinton East LRT (EELRT), formerly known as the Scarborough Malvern LRT.\nMetrolinx is studying an extension of Line 4 Sheppard, to replace the former Sheppard East LRT project, which would likely connect with the Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth extension at McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue.\nStreetcars.\nToronto's streetcar system is one of the few in North America still operating along street-running tracks. It has been operating since the mid-19th century. Horsecar service started in 1861, and 600 V DC overhead electric service began in 1892. New TTC routes since the 1940s have generally been operated by other modes of transportation, and the less busy streetcar routes have also been converted. Streetcar routes are now focused on the downtown area, although two run farther from the core: one being on St. Clair Avenue, from Lake Ontario on average, served by the 512 St. Clair streetcar route, and another on Lake Shore Boulevard (the western portion of 501 Queen), which runs through the Etobicoke district nearly to the city limits with Mississauga at Etobicoke Creek in Long Branch.\nUp until 1995, the TTC operated a fleet of 765 PCC-type streetcars, 540 of which it purchased new. The rest were purchased as other cities sold their PCC streetcar fleets.\nFrom 1987 until September 2019, the TTC operated two-car Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV) streetcars, a longer version of the Canadian Light Rail Vehicle (CLRV) streetcars.\nFollowing the retirement of the TTC's CLRV streetcars on December 29, 2019, the entire TTC streetcar fleet consists of the low-floor Flexity Outlook vehicles from Bombardier Transportation, the first of which entered service on the 510 Spadina route on August 31, 2014.\nServices.\nFares.\nSince March 1, 2015, children 12 and under have been able to ride the TTC for free year-round. As of June 2, 2025, the TTC's fare payment system consists of cash fares, Presto cards and Presto tickets. Customers also have the option to pay the equivalent of the adult single-ride TTC Presto card fare prices by tapping a contactless credit or debit card on TTC Presto fare readers. TTC monthly passes and the 12-month pass are available for loading onto a Presto card, while TTC day passes are available through the limited use Presto tickets package. Since April 3, 2023, the adult cash fare and single-ride Presto tickets has been $3.35 for a single trip. Since April 3, 2023, the cost of adult single fares using a Presto card has been $3.30. The Fair Pass program allows those eligible for the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) or Ontario Works to receive a discount when using a Presto card.\nThe Presto card is an electronic unified contactless smart card\u2013based fare payment system, owned and managed by Metrolinx, for use across the TTC transit network, along with several other transit service providers throughout the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) including the Metrolinx-owned GO Transit, Union Pearson Express services and on OC Transpo in Ottawa. The TTC also provides limited-use paper Presto tickets, mainly for occasional riders, which come in 1-ride, 2-ride and day pass varieties. Users tap their Presto card or ticket on a Presto reader as they enter a TTC station or vehicle. Either their fare is automatically paid through stored value, verifies if the Presto user has a valid TTC transit pass on it, or validates the TTC's two-hour Presto transfer. Their card or ticket then acts as proof-of-payment (POP) to present to TTC staff such as fare inspectors, who carry hand-held devices to verify Presto fare payments, upon request. As of \u00a02018[ [update]], Presto readers are available at the entrances of all subway stations and on all buses and streetcars.\nUnlike the Presto card, Presto tickets can only be used on TTC services (subway and surface vehicles within the City of Toronto). They are not reloadable and cannot be used on any other transit service providers that use Presto.\nSchedules and route information.\nOn December 15, 2008, the TTC launched a new next vehicle arrival system (NVAS) to indicate the time of arrival of the next vehicle along a given route. All TTC streetcars have been upgraded with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and now operate with NVIS.\nReal-time route information can be accessed from the NVAS from the City of Toronto Open Data initiative via SMS by texting the stop number displayed on the bus/streetcar stop pole, or with an app that uses NVAS data.\nRoute information can also be accessed by phone. Individual route schedules are available online.\nAdditional TTC information is circulated by \"What's On\" and \"Rocket Rider / TTC Customer News\" pamphlets on some vehicles. Information can be accessed in person at the TTC head office (Davisville station at 1900 Yonge Street), as well as at a TTC Info Centre, which opened in 2018, at Union station. Twitter users can communicate with TTCHelps for inquiries.\nMost subway stations are equipped with OneStop media screens that display the time until the next train, and other information. The next vehicle feature is available on LCD screens in all stations. Since mid-2011, all buses and streetcars have had the tracking feature enabled, accessible free online and by SMS for commuters.\nOn February 3, 2010, the TTC launched an online trip planner, which allows commuters to plan their routes and transfers on the TTC's website. However, since its launch, the trip planner has remained in beta mode with many bugs remaining to be fixed. In October 2010, the TTC integrated its trip planner with Google Maps. Transit information in Toronto has been available in Apple Maps since the release of iOS 9 in September 2015, when Apple Inc. first launched support for public transit data.\nConnecting transit.\nConnecting GTA transit agencies.\nThe TTC connects with other transit systems of the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit, Union Pearson Express, MiWay, York Region Transit (YRT), Brampton Transit, and Durham Region Transit (DRT) are connected to the TTC via some of Toronto's subway stations, GO Transit's commuter rail stations, and other hubs like Toronto Pearson International Airport. In addition to Union Station, there are 6 other stations where the TTC subway network and GO Transit commuter rail lines intersect.\nSome bus routes of the surrounding local transit agencies run on Toronto streets along with TTC buses, mainly to reach TTC subway stations. Examples of this include YRT buses travelling on Yonge Street en route to Finch Bus Terminal, MiWay buses travelling on various streets in Etobicoke en route to Kipling Bus Terminal and DRT buses travelling on various streets in Scarborough en route to Scarborough Centre station. However, by law, other local transit agencies are prohibited from carrying passengers wholly within the City of Toronto. Therefore, YRT, DRT and MiWay buses can only drop off passengers inbound and pick up passengers outbound while within Toronto city limits.\nOriginally, there were no free or discounted transfers between suburban agencies (which still have separate fare structures) and the TTC. But on February 26, 2024, Ontario's One Fare Program, a GTA-wide fare integration program allowing free or discounted transfers between the TTC and other GTA transit systems (within either a two-hour or three-hour window), was implemented. However, the policy only applies to fare payments made with Presto, credit, or debit card; customers paying with cash are ineligible to receive free or discounted transfers and are still required to pay a double fare.\nConnecting inter-city transit agencies.\nVia Rail and Amtrak connect with the TTC at Union Station, while Ontario Northland, Megabus, TOK Coachlines and US-bound Greyhound intercity coaches connect with the TTC at the Union Station, Scarborough Centre, , and Yorkdale bus terminals.\nCellular and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nThe communication system used by surface vehicles is called the Communications and Information System. It was piloted in the 1970s, implemented in 1991, and is now deployed on all TTC surface vehicles.\nSubway wireless services.\nStarting in 2013, the TTC provided Wi-Fi access in subway stations through its TConnect service.\nIn August 2023, Rogers implemented 5G wireless service at all the TTC's downtown stations and within the tunnels between them.\nIn September 2023, the federal government imposed new licence conditions requiring that cellphone and data services be available on the entire subway network by the end of 2026 and that all mobile wireless carriers, including Telus and Bell, have access to it.\nAs of \u00a02023[ [update]], all downtown subway stations and some west-end stations, as well as the tunnels connecting them, had Rogers 5G wireless service. The service is available to customers of Rogers and Freedom Mobile; however, customers of other carriers (such as Bell and Telus) can make 911 calls. 5G wireless service is available between Bloor\u2013Yonge and Dupont stations on Line 1, and between Castle Frank and Keele stations on Line 2. The stations and tunnels between Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station and Sheppard West station on Line 1 have a non-5G service.\nIn December 2024, the TTC announced the discontinuation of the TConnect service on December 27, 2024, due to low usage.\nAccessibility.\nThe Wheel-Trans door-to-door service has been available since the mid-1970s. Since the 1990s, the TTC has focused on providing accessible services on conventional bus routes, the RT and subway. 56 of the 75 stations on Lines 1, 2, and 3 are wheel-chair accessible are equipped with elevators, and all stations on Line 4 are fully accessible. In December 2011, all bus routes became accessible with the retirement of the commission's last inaccessible buses. On August 31, 2014, the commission launched its new fleet of low-floor Bombardier's Flexity Outlook streetcars. With the decommissioning of the last of the commission's CLRV vehicles on December 29, 2019, all TTC streetcar routes are now served by low-floor Flexity vehicles.\nAs per \"Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act\" (AODA) guidelines, all surface vehicles and subway trains have been equipped with the on-board Automatic Next Stop Announcement System since February 2008. It operates over speakers indicating the next stop. A digital orange LED destination sign on streetcars and buses as well as the Toronto Rocket subway trains display the name of the upcoming streets/stations as the vehicle progresses on its route.\nAll TTC revenue service vehicles are equipped with external speakers that play automated announcements of the route and destination of vehicle travel.\nInfrastructure.\nStations, stops and terminals.\nMost TTC surface routes terminate at loops, side streets, or subway stations. The TTC is one of the few mass transit systems in Canada where many surface routes can be accessed inside a paid-fare zone common to other routes or subway lines. This feature allows boarding via the back doors at terminals, reduces the usage of paper transfers, and the need of operators to check for proof-of-payment. However, if people are caught entering fare-paid terminals illegally from the street, they could be fined $500 for fare evasion. With the exception of , , , , and , all subway stations' off-street terminals are within the fare-paid area.\nThe shelters in the system are installed and maintained under contracts with Astral Media (later became a part of by Bell Media) (with CBS Outdoor since 2006 and previously Viacom Media) and Toronto Transportation Services. Approximately 4,100 shelters are managed by Toronto Transportation. Some shelters are solar powered and include next vehicle arrival displays.\nThere are four versions of shelters found in the city:\nThere are ten sets (men and women) of public washrooms located on the TTC system, all at subway stations that are major transfer points, at the ends of subway lines, or former ends of subway lines. All (with the exception of and Vaughan Metropolitan Centre stations, which only connect with regional buses) are located within the fare paid area and thus available only to TTC passengers.\nHeadquarters and facilities.\nTTC buses and streetcars are operated out of a number of garages and carhouses located around the city and are serviced at several other facilities. The surface routes are divided into several divisions. Individual divisions have a manager, an on-duty mobile supervisor, a CIS communications centre, and a garage facility tasked with managing the division's vehicle fleet and routes.\nTTC Head Office is in the William McBrien Building, located at 1900 Yonge Street at Davisville Avenue, which opened in 1957. The Davisville station bus terminal occupies part of the building's ground floor. The previous TTC Headquarters was at Yonge and Front Streets in the Toronto Board of Trade Building, which was later demolished.\nThere are plans to relocate the head office to a yet-to-be-built site at 4050 Yonge Street near York Mills Road. The site is a commuter parking lot with a TTC entrance to York Mills station. Build Toronto is charged with helping the commission relocate, but it is facing political opposition from many mayoral candidates.\nCommuter parking lots.\nThe Toronto Parking Authority on behalf of the TTC operates 30 commuter parking lots, all at subway stations, with a total of 13,981 parking spaces. Effective April 1, 2009, it eliminated free parking for Metropass holders. All passengers using parking facilities during peak hours must now pay for the service. The rates vary by location from $2.00 to $7.00 between 5:00\u00a0a.m. and 3:00\u00a0p.m. on weekdays, with lots offering discounted or free parking at other times. Most TTC-owned lots are open (uncovered) parking lots; certain lots are located in covered garages, such as the Yorkdale lot, which is located in the namesake shopping centre's underground parking garage.\nSafety.\nSafety programs.\nSafety features provided by the TTC include:\nCrisis Link.\nIn June 2011, the TTC announced a new suicide prevention program called \"Crisis Link\" aimed at people who are in a station and in immediate danger of performing self-harm. Special speed dial buttons have been installed on payphones in station Designated Waiting Areas that \"link\" the caller to a 24-hour crisis counselling service provided by Distress Centres of Toronto. Signage has also been placed in high-risk areas of the station platform directing those at risk to use the service. The program includes 141 speed dial buttons on the system's payphones and 200 posters placed on station platforms.\nThisIsWhere initiative and SafeTTC mobile app.\nIn September 2017, the TTC created an iOS/iPadOS and Android app called ThisIsWhere that allows users to report harassment and other personal safety incidents to the TTC. The name was later changed to \"SafeTTC\" and launched on September 6, 2017.\nTransit Enforcement Unit.\nFrom 1997 to 2011, the TTC employed special constables, who were responsible for safety and security and had similar policing powers to Toronto Police Service officers. During the phase-out of the special constables, the Toronto Police reinstated its Transit Patrol Unit, which had been cancelled in the mid-1990s. The special constables were replaced by bylaw enforcement officers known as transit enforcement officers, as part of the TTC's Transit Enforcement Unit.\nThe negotiation between TTC and the Toronto Police Services Board took place in 2013 resulting in restored special constable status and peace officer authority.\nThere is a difference between special constables and fare inspectors. Fare inspectors have no authority to detain a person, and so it is possible to simply walk away with no repercussions. In contrast, special constables have the same authority as police officers.\nBylaws enforced.\nThe TTC's By-law No. 1 is a by-law governing the actions of passengers and employees while on Commission property. It can be enforced by a \"proper authority\" which is defined in the by-law as: \"an employee or agent of the TTC wearing a TTC uniform; an employee or agent of the TTC carrying an identification card issued by the TTC; or a municipal police officer.\" The by-law covers rules regarding fare payment and conduct while in the system. Effective October 12, 2009, a revised version of the by-law has been issued. Revisions include the restriction of placing feet or \"any object that may soil\" on seats, the prohibition against using offensive language (including via the user-generated displays at Pioneer Village station, which are part of the public art installation \"LightSpell\", although the displays have not yet been activated), and the provision that one must give up their seat to a person with a disability or pregnancy in priority seating areas.\nCommunications.\nThe TTC uses three primary voice and data communication systems. The first is the system used by Operations, Security and Maintenance. This system operates on five UHF conventional frequencies. Channels 1, 3, 4 and 5 are used for day-to-day operations, while Channel 2 is reserved for the Wheel-Trans service.\nThe second system, the Communications and Information System (CIS), is used by buses and streetcars, and employs transmission facilities throughout the city. Conceived in the late 1970s and fully implemented in 1991, it consists of a computer unit on board each bus and streetcar, called the Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP). This is attached to a transponder receiver, which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using a computational system known as dead reckoning. The TRUMP unit also allows vehicle and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as short turns and route adjustments. There is also the option of voice-based communication between the vehicle and CIS operators. With the introduction of NextBus technology to provide real-time arrival information, the CIS has been updated to use a combination of GPS data and the previous dead reckoning (signpost-based) system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on Bell Mobility's CDMA network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control.\nIn 2012, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). Implementation of the system, later named the Vehicle Information System &amp; Integrated Operations Network (VISION), began in 2016, with the contract for associated equipment awarded to Clever Devices ULC. After extensive testing, deployment of VISION on vehicles in revenue service began in the summer of 2018, with plans to fully equip the entire bus and streetcar fleet by 2019.\nThe third system, known as the \"wayside system\", consists of UHF MPT-1327 Trunking radio sets used by the three heavy-rail subway lines. They replaced older devices which communicated by the third rail, and are divided into separate systems representing their respective subway lines. This trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a single train, a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line. (Line 3 Scarborough uses a single channel UHF system, much the same as the system used by operations staff.)\nAll of these systems can be monitored by a scanner capable of the UHF Low band (406\u2013430\u00a0MHz). Numeric codes\u2014often referring to people or positions (299 Bloor \u2013 Subway Line mechanic at Bloor)\u2014are also announced through the radio and the overhead paging system. The TTC also has several \"Plans\" (\"Plan A\" through \"Plan G\") that are used in emergencies but are not announced on the PA system and only referred to on the radio.\nOneStop media system.\nThe TTC, in partnership with Pattison OneStop (formerly OneStop Media Group), have installed large LCD television screens in most subway stations throughout the system except on Line 3 Scarborough and at the Toronto\u2013York Spadina subway extension ( to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre) stations. The new media system replaced the old \"Subway Online\" system, which were decommissioned.\nThe signs feature third-party advertising, news headlines and weather information. From its inception in 2005 until December 31, 2017, the news feed and advertising for television programs were supplied under a contract with Bell Media's 24-hour local cable television news service, CP24. Since January 1, 2018, the service has been provided by Global Television Network's Toronto television station CIII-DT 41, which is owned by Corus Entertainment. The signs also provide TTC-specific information regarding service changes and delays, information pertaining to using the system, and Toronto Police Service alerts about suspects. The system can also be used when an Amber alert is issued, which also may include announcements via the PA system.\nIn September 2008, TMU station (then known as Dundas station) was the first to feature a \"next train\" announcement integrated into the signage. The system has been expanded to many other stations since its initial rollout. Since mid-July 2009, the majority of stations have been equipped with this service and since January 2018 \u2013 coinciding with a content provider switch from CP24 to Global News \u2013 the next train arrival time notices were also updated to provide the line number and the destination of the next train. The TYSSE stations have screens that display the arrival times for the next two or three trains. Unlike the older screens, these screens neither display news nor weather headlines provided by Global News.\nGovernance.\nAs an agency of the City of Toronto, the City has full authority over the TTC's mandate and structure. The TTC is responsible to Toronto City Council through its board, composed of members of council and citizens, led by the chair.\nConstituting legislation.\nThe \"Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act\" established the modern day \"Toronto Transit Commission\" from the \"Toronto Transportation Commission\" in 1954. When the \"City of Toronto Act\" was last updated in 2006, the TTC was continued under the updated act. Toronto Municipal Code, chapter 279 stipulates additional fiscal and policy requirements for the TTC, as well as sets out the requirements for the TTC board. The TTC itself regulates the use of its system via TTC By-law No. 1, the most current revision being the 2009 revision.\nBoard and chair.\nThe TTC board consists of ten members: six Toronto City Council members and four citizens. The citizen members are nominated through an independent public process by the Civic Appointments committee. The mayor of Toronto appoints the chair of the TTC, currently Jamaal Myers. The chair must be a member of Toronto City Council. The board elects a vice-chair from among its members.\nManagement and personnel.\nThe TTC has more than 12,000 employees. Most are operators, but the commission also employs supervisors, custodians and a wide range of skilled tradespeople who work on vehicles and critical subway and surface infrastructure.\nThe day-to-day operations of the TTC are managed by the chief executive officer (formerly the chief general manager or CGM). Mandeep Lali was appointed CEO in June 2025, after the departure of Rick Leary at the end of August 2024; Leary had succeeded Andy Byford in January 2018. \nIn 2022, TTC employees were surveyed by their union as part of Transit Worker Assault Awareness Day. 73 percent of those surveyed (out of approximately 3,100 people) reported experiencing workplace violence. In March 2023, Jennifer McKelvie, the deputy mayor of Toronto, requested section 269.01 of the Canadian \"Criminal Code\" be amended to include assault against transit workers.\nStation managers.\nIn 2013, the TTC assigned group station managers on most subway lines and hired an additional manager upon the opening of the Line 1 extension to Vaughan:\nLabour disputes.\nUnionized workers of the TTC workers have performed strike actions numerous times since 1952. At the request of Mayor Rob Ford and Toronto City Council, on March 30, 2011, the Province of Ontario passed legislation classifying the TTC an essential service, which removed the employees' right to strike. On May 8, 2023, a Superior Court judge overturned the designation on the basis that the TTC did not meet the judicial definition of an \"essential service\" and therefore the restrictions on striking were unconstitutional.\n2024 averted strike.\nA TTC strike was set to begin on June 7, 2024, at 12:01 a.m. if a deal between the TTC and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 was not reached. The previous April, union members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action if necessary, after their previous collective agreement expired at the end of March 2024. However, the TTC and the union reached a tentative agreement at approximately 11:30 p.m. on June 6, 2024, and so the strike was averted.\nThe key issues for the union and its members related to job security, protections against contracting out jobs, and improvements in benefits for active members and pensioners. The president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, Marvin Alfred, confirmed the next morning that a tentative agreement had been reached late the night before and that talks had continued until almost 4 a.m. \"What we have right now is a deal\", he said. \"We have something signed, but we're still preparing and making sure we can have something tangible for our membership,\" he told CBC Radio's \"Metro Morning\".\n2018 benefits fraud investigation.\nIn 2018, as a result of their involvement in a health insurance scam involving Healthy Fit, an orthotics shop, 223 employees were dismissed or forced to retire early, while ten faced criminal charges.\nSubsidiaries.\nBeside the main transit operations, the TTC has subsidiaries:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30983", "revid": "48932058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30983", "title": "Testosterone", "text": "Primary male sex hormone\nTestosterone is the primary male sex hormone and androgen in males. In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testicles and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. It is associated with increased aggression, sex drive, dominance, courtship display, and a wide range of behavioral characteristics. In addition, testosterone in both sexes is involved in health and well-being, where it has a significant effect on overall mood, cognition, social and sexual behavior, metabolism and energy output, the cardiovascular system, and in the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty, accumulation of adipose fat tissue within the body, anxiety and depression, sexual performance issues, and bone loss.\nExcessive levels of testosterone in men may be associated with hyperandrogenism, higher risk of heart failure, increased mortality in men with prostate cancer, and male pattern baldness.\nTestosterone is a steroid hormone from the androstane class containing a ketone and a hydroxyl group at positions three and seventeen respectively. It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites. It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. In humans and most other vertebrates, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. On average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about seven to eight times as great as in adult females. As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. Females are also more sensitive to the hormone.\nIn addition to its role as a natural hormone, testosterone is used as a medication to treat hypogonadism and breast cancer. Since testosterone levels decrease as men age, testosterone is sometimes used in older men to counteract this deficiency. It is also used illicitly to enhance physique and performance, for instance in athletes. The World Anti-Doping Agency lists it as S1 Anabolic agent substance \"prohibited at all times\".\nBiological effects.\nEffects on physiological development.\nIn general, androgens such as testosterone promote protein synthesis and thus growth of tissues with androgen receptors. Testosterone can be described as having anabolic and androgenic (virilising) effects, though these categorical descriptions are somewhat arbitrary, as there is a great deal of mutual overlap between them. The relative potency of these effects can depend on various factors and is a topic of ongoing research. Testosterone can either directly exert effects on target tissues or be metabolized by 5\u03b1-reductase into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or aromatized to estradiol (E2). Both testosterone and DHT bind to an androgen receptor; however, DHT has a stronger binding affinity than testosterone and may have more androgenic effect in certain tissues at lower levels.\nTestosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence. For postnatal effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.\nBefore birth.\nEffects before birth are divided into two categories, classified in relation to the stages of development.\nThe first period occurs between 4 and 6 weeks of the gestation. Examples include genital virilisation such as midline fusion, phallic urethra, scrotal thinning and rugation, and phallic enlargement; although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of dihydrotestosterone. There is also development of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.\nDuring the second trimester, androgen level is associated with sex formation. Specifically, testosterone, along with anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) promote growth of the Wolffian duct and degeneration of the M\u00fcllerian duct respectively. This period affects the femininization or masculinization of the fetus and can be a better predictor of feminine or masculine behaviours such as sex typed behaviour than an adult's own levels. Prenatal androgens apparently influence interests and engagement in gendered activities and have moderate effects on spatial abilities. Among women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a male-typical play in childhood correlated with reduced satisfaction with the female gender and reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood.\nEarly infancy.\nEarly infancy androgen effects are the least understood. In the first weeks of life for male infants, testosterone levels rise. The levels remain in a pubertal range for a few months, but usually reach the barely detectable levels of childhood by 4\u20137 months of age. The function of this rise in humans is unknown. It has been theorized that brain masculinization is occurring since no significant changes have been identified in other parts of the body. The male brain is masculinized by the aromatization of testosterone into estradiol, which crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier and enters the male brain, whereas female fetuses have \u03b1-fetoprotein, which binds the estrogen so that female brains are not affected.\nBefore puberty.\nBefore puberty, effects of rising androgen levels occur in both boys and girls. These include adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of skin and hair, acne, pubarche (appearance of pubic hair), axillary hair (armpit hair), growth spurt, accelerated bone maturation, and facial hair.\nPubertal.\nPubertal effects begin to occur when androgen has been higher than normal adult female levels for months or years. In males, these are usual late pubertal effects, and occur in women after prolonged periods of heightened levels of free testosterone in the blood. The effects include:\nAdult.\nTestosterone is necessary for normal sperm development. It activates genes in Sertoli cells, which promote differentiation of spermatogonia. It regulates acute hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (HPA axis) response under dominance challenge. Androgens including testosterone enhance muscle growth. Testosterone also regulates the population of thromboxane A2 receptors on megakaryocytes and platelets and hence platelet aggregation in humans.\nAdult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels might decrease in the later decades of adult life.\nThe brain is also affected by this sexual differentiation; the enzyme aromatase converts testosterone into estradiol that is responsible for masculinization of the brain in male mice. In humans, masculinization of the fetal brain appears, by observation of gender preference in patients with congenital disorders of androgen formation or androgen receptor function, to be associated with functional androgen receptors.\nThere are some differences between a male and female brain that may be due to different testosterone levels, one of them being size: the male human brain is, on average, larger.\nHealth effects.\nTestosterone does not appear to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. In people who have undergone testosterone deprivation therapy, testosterone increases beyond the castrate level have been shown to increase the rate of spread of an existing prostate cancer.\nConflicting results have been obtained concerning the importance of testosterone in maintaining cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, maintaining normal testosterone levels in elderly men has been shown to improve many parameters that are thought to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, such as increased lean body mass, decreased visceral fat mass, decreased total cholesterol, and improved glycemic control.\nHigh androgen levels are associated with menstrual cycle irregularities in both clinical populations and healthy women. There also can be effects in unusual hair growth, acne, weight gain, infertility, and sometimes even scalp hair loss. These effects are seen largely in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For women with PCOS, hormones like birth control pills can be used to help lessen the effects of this increased level of testosterone.\nAttention, memory, and spatial ability are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans. Preliminary evidence suggests that low testosterone levels may be a risk factor for cognitive decline and possibly for dementia of the Alzheimer's type, a key argument in life extension medicine for the use of testosterone in anti-aging therapies. Much of the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic relationship between spatial performance and circulating testosterone, where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on cognition.\nImmune system and inflammation.\nTestosterone deficiency is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and mortality, which are also sequelae of chronic inflammation. Testosterone plasma concentration inversely correlates to multiple biomarkers of inflammation including CRP, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, TNF alpha and endotoxin concentration, as well as leukocyte count. As demonstrated by a meta-analysis, substitution therapy with testosterone results in a significant reduction of inflammatory markers. These effects are mediated by different mechanisms with synergistic action. In androgen-deficient men with concomitant autoimmune thyroiditis, substitution therapy with testosterone leads to a decrease in thyroid autoantibody titres and an increase in thyroid's secretory capacity (SPINA-GT).\nMedical use.\nTestosterone is used as a medication for the treatment of male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. This is known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), which maintains serum testosterone levels in the normal range. Decline of testosterone production with age has led to interest in androgen replacement therapy. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful.\nTestosterone is included in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, which are the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is available as a generic medication. It can be administered as a cream or transdermal patch that is applied to the skin, by injection into a muscle, as a tablet that is placed in the cheek, or by ingestion.\nCommon side effects from testosterone medication include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in males. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease (though a randomized trial found no evidence of major adverse cardiac events compared to placebo in men with low testosterone), and behavioral changes. Women and children who are exposed may develop virilization. It is recommended that individuals with prostate cancer not use the medication. It can cause harm if used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n2020 guidelines from the American College of Physicians support the discussion of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low levels of testosterone who have sexual dysfunction. They recommend yearly evaluation regarding possible improvement and, if none, to discontinue testosterone; physicians should consider intramuscular treatments, rather than transdermal treatments, due to costs and since the effectiveness and harm of either method is similar. Testosterone treatment for reasons other than possible improvement of sexual dysfunction may not be recommended. Current clinical guidelines recommend comprehensive baseline evaluation including complete blood count, lipid panel, prostate-specific antigen, and cardiovascular risk assessment before initiating testosterone replacement therapy. Regular monitoring during treatment typically includes hematocrit levels every 3-6 months to prevent polycythemia, along with PSA monitoring in men over 40.\nBehavioural correlations.\nSexual arousal.\nTestosterone levels follow a circadian rhythm that peaks early each day, regardless of sexual activity.\nIn women, correlations may exist between positive orgasm experience and testosterone levels. Studies have shown small or inconsistent correlations between testosterone levels and male orgasm experience, as well as sexual assertiveness in both sexes.\nSexual arousal and masturbation in women produce small increases in testosterone concentrations. The plasma levels of various steroids significantly increase after masturbation in men and the testosterone levels correlate to those levels.\nMammalian studies.\nStudies conducted in rats have indicated that their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviours (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, but not when given low amounts of the same hormone. Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among humans with sexual arousal deficits such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder.\nEvery mammalian species examined demonstrated a marked increase in a male's testosterone level upon encountering a novel female. The reflexive testosterone increases in male mice is related to the male's initial level of sexual arousal.\nIn non-human primates, it may be that testosterone in puberty stimulates sexual arousal, which allows the primate to increasingly seek out sexual experiences with females and thus creates a sexual preference for females. Some research has also indicated that if testosterone is eliminated in an adult male human or other adult male primate's system, its sexual motivation decreases, but there is no corresponding decrease in ability to engage in sexual activity (mounting, ejaculating, etc.).\nIn accordance with sperm competition theory, testosterone levels are shown to increase as a response to previously neutral stimuli when conditioned to become sexual in male rats. This reaction engages penile reflexes (such as erection and ejaculation) that aid in sperm competition when more than one male is present in mating encounters, allowing for more production of successful sperm and a higher chance of reproduction.\nMales.\nIn men, higher levels of testosterone are associated with periods of sexual activity.\nMen who watch a sexually explicit movie have an average increase of 35% in testosterone, peaking at 60\u201390 minutes after the end of the film, but no increase is seen in men who watch sexually neutral films. Men who watch sexually explicit films also report increased motivation and competitiveness, and decreased exhaustion. A link has also been found between relaxation following sexual arousal and testosterone levels.\nFemales.\nAndrogens may modulate the physiology of vaginal tissue and contribute to female genital sexual arousal. Women's level of testosterone is higher when measured pre-intercourse vs. pre-cuddling, as well as post-intercourse vs. post-cuddling. There is a time lag effect when testosterone is administered, on genital arousal in women. In addition, a continuous increase in vaginal sexual arousal may result in higher genital sensations and sexual appetitive behaviors.\nTestosterone may prove to be an effective treatment in female sexual arousal disorders, and is available as a dermal patch. There is no FDA-approved androgen preparation for the treatment of androgen insufficiency; however, it has been used as an off-label use to treat low libido and sexual dysfunction in older women. Testosterone may be a treatment for postmenopausal women as long as they are effectively estrogenized.\nRomantic relationships.\nFalling in love has been linked with decreases in men's testosterone levels while mixed changes are reported for women's testosterone levels. There has been speculation that these changes in testosterone result in the temporary reduction of differences in behavior between the sexes. However, the testosterone changes observed do not seem to be maintained as relationships develop over time.\nMen who produce less testosterone are more likely to be in a relationship or married, and men who produce more testosterone are more likely to divorce. Marriage or commitment could cause a decrease in testosterone levels. Single men who have not had relationship experience have lower testosterone levels than single men with experience. It is suggested that these single men with prior experience are in a more competitive state than their non-experienced counterparts. Married men who engage in bond-maintenance activities such as spending the day with their spouse or child have no different testosterone levels compared to times when they do not engage in such activities. Collectively, these results suggest that the presence of competitive activities rather than bond-maintenance activities is more relevant to changes in testosterone levels.\nMen who produce more testosterone are more likely to engage in extramarital sex. Testosterone levels do not rely on physical presence of a partner; testosterone levels of men engaging in same-city and long-distance relationships are similar. Physical presence may be required for women who are in relationships for the testosterone\u2013partner interaction, where same-city partnered women have lower testosterone levels than long-distance partnered women.\nFatherhood.\nFatherhood decreases testosterone levels in men, suggesting that the emotions and behaviour tied to paternal care decrease testosterone levels. In humans and other species that utilize allomaternal care, paternal investment in offspring is beneficial to said offspring's survival because it allows the two parents to raise multiple children simultaneously. This increases the reproductive fitness of the parents because their offspring are more likely to survive and reproduce. Paternal care increases offspring survival due to increased access to higher quality food and reduced physical and immunological threats. This is particularly beneficial for humans since offspring are dependent on parents for extended periods of time and mothers have relatively short inter-birth intervals.\nWhile the extent of paternal care varies between cultures, higher investment in direct child care has been seen to be correlated with lower average testosterone levels as well as temporary fluctuations. For instance, fluctuation in testosterone levels when a child is in distress has been found to be indicative of fathering styles. If a father's testosterone levels decrease in response to hearing their baby cry, it is an indication of empathizing with the baby. This is associated with increased nurturing behavior and better outcomes for the infant.\nMotivation.\nTestosterone levels play a major role in risk-taking during financial decisions. Higher testosterone levels in men reduce the risk of becoming or staying unemployed. Research has also found that heightened levels of testosterone and cortisol are associated with an increased risk of impulsive and violent criminal behavior. On the other hand, elevated testosterone in men may increase their generosity, primarily to attract a potential mate.\nAggression and criminality.\nMost studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone. Nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with antisocial behavior and alcoholism. Many studies have been undertaken on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior, and feelings, and testosterone. About half of studies have found a relationship and about half, no relationship. Studies have found that testosterone facilitates aggression by modulating vasopressin receptors in the hypothalamus.\nThere are two theories on the role of testosterone in aggression and competition. The first is the challenge hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty, thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behavior which would include aggression. It is therefore the challenge of competition among males that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance, especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone. The same research found fathers (outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males.\nThe second theory is similar and known as \"evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory of male aggression\". Testosterone and other androgens have evolved to motivate men to pursue competition, even when doing so leads to risk. By doing so, individuals with masculinized brains are better able to survive and copulate with as many mates as possible. The masculinization of the brain is not just mediated by testosterone levels at the adult stage, but also testosterone exposure in the womb. Higher pre-natal testosterone indicated by a low digit ratio as well as adult testosterone levels increased risk of fouls or aggression among male players in a soccer game. Studies have found higher pre-natal testosterone or lower digit ratio to be correlated with higher aggression.\nThe rise in testosterone during competition predicted aggression in males, but not in females. In one experiment, subjects who interacted with handguns showed higher testosterone levels and aggression than those who interacted with toys. One study proposed that natural selection may have caused men to be more sensitive to situations in which their status is challenged, and that testosterone is the key factor that causes these situations to spark into aggression. Structural brain characteristics associated with testosterone levels have also been found to predict individuals' levels of aggression.\nThe \"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences\" has found that the use of anabolic steroids (which increases testosterone) among teenagers is correlated with increased likelihood of using violence. One study found that administering testosterone increased verbal aggression in some participants.\nA few studies indicate that the testosterone derivative estradiol might play an important role in male aggression. Estradiol is known to correlate with aggression in male mice. Moreover, the conversion of testosterone to estradiol regulates male aggression in sparrows during breeding season. Rats who were given anabolic steroids that increase testosterone were also more physically aggressive to provocation as a result of \"threat sensitivity\".\nThe relationship between testosterone and aggression may also function indirectly, as it has been proposed that testosterone does not amplify tendencies towards aggression, but rather amplifies whatever tendencies will allow an individual to maintain social status when challenged. In most animals, aggression is the means of maintaining social status. However, humans have multiple ways of obtaining status. This could explain why some studies find a link between testosterone and pro-social behaviour, if pro-social behaviour is rewarded with social status. Thus the link between testosterone and aggression and violence is due to these being rewarded with social status. The relationship may also be one of a \"permissive effect\" whereby testosterone does elevate aggression levels, but only in the sense of allowing average aggression levels to be maintained; chemically or physically castrating the individual will reduce aggression levels (though not eliminate them) but the individual only needs a small-level of pre-castration testosterone to have aggression levels to return to normal, which they will remain at even if additional testosterone is added. Testosterone may also simply exaggerate or amplify existing aggression; for example, chimpanzees who receive testosterone increases become more aggressive to chimps lower than them in the social hierarchy, but will still be submissive to chimps higher than them. Testosterone thus does not make the chimpanzee indiscriminately aggressive, but instead amplifies his pre-existing aggression towards lower-ranked chimps.\nIn humans, testosterone appears more to promote status-seeking and social dominance than simply increasing physical aggression. When controlling for the effects of belief in having received testosterone, women who have received testosterone make fairer offers than women who have not received testosterone.\nFairness.\nTestosterone might encourage fair behavior. For one study, subjects took part in a behavioral experiment where the distribution of a real amount of money was decided. The rules allowed both fair and unfair offers. The negotiating partner could subsequently accept or decline the offer. The fairer the offer, the less probable a refusal by the negotiating partner. If no agreement was reached, neither party earned anything. Test subjects with an artificially enhanced testosterone level generally made better, fairer offers than those who received placebos, thus reducing the risk of a rejection of their offer to a minimum. Two later studies have empirically confirmed these results. However men with high testosterone were significantly 27% less generous in an ultimatum game. This additional information could suggest, contrarily, that testosterone may encourage greed or selfishness. Fairer offers from test subjects with higher testosterone in the original study increase the likeliness of the offer being accepted by the negotiating partner, therefore decreasing the probability of both participants leaving without any money.\nBiological activity.\nFree testosterone.\nLipophilic hormones (soluble in lipids but not in water), such as steroid hormones, including testosterone, are transported in water-based blood plasma through specific and non-specific proteins. Specific proteins include sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and other sex steroids. Non-specific binding proteins include albumin. The part of the total hormone concentration that is not bound to its respective specific carrier protein is the free part. As a result, testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is called \"free testosterone\". Only the free amount of testosterone can bind to an androgenic receptor, which means it has biological activity. While a significant portion of testosterone is bound to SHBG, a small fraction of testosterone (1%-2%) is bound to albumin and the binding of testosterone to albumin is weak and can be reversed easily; as such, both albumin-bound and unbound testosterone are considered to be bioavailable testosterone. This binding plays an important role in regulating the transport, tissue delivery, bioactivity, and metabolism of testosterone. At the tissue level, testosterone dissociates from albumin and quickly diffuses into the tissues. The percentage of testosterone bound to SHBG is lower in men than in women. Both the free fraction and the one bound to albumin are available at the tissue level (their sum constitutes the bioavailable testosterone), while SHBG effectively and irreversibly inhibits the action of testosterone. The relationship between sex steroids and SHBG in physiological and pathological conditions is complex, as various factors may influence the levels of plasma SHBG, affecting bioavailability of testosterone.\nSteroid hormone activity.\nThe effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of multiple mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as dihydrotestosterone), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Androgens such as testosterone have also been found to bind to and activate membrane androgen receptors.\nFree testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b1-DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5\u03b1-reductase. 5\u03b1-DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.\nAndrogen receptors occur in many different vertebrate body system tissues, and both males and females respond similarly to similar levels. Greatly differing amounts of testosterone prenatally, at puberty, and throughout life account for a share of biological differences between males and females.\nThe bones and the brain are two important tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of aromatization to estradiol. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the epiphyses and conclusion of growth. In the central nervous system, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol. Estradiol rather than testosterone serves as the most important feedback signal to the hypothalamus (especially affecting LH secretion). In many mammals, prenatal or perinatal \"masculinization\" of the sexually dimorphic areas of the brain by estradiol derived from testosterone programs later male sexual behavior.\nNeurosteroid activity.\nTestosterone, via its active metabolite 3\u03b1-androstanediol, is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.\nTestosterone has been found to act as an antagonist of the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors for the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), with high affinity (around 5\u00a0nM). In contrast to testosterone, DHEA and DHEA sulfate have been found to act as high-affinity agonists of these receptors.\nTestosterone is an antagonist of the sigma-1 receptor (Ki = 1,014 or 201\u00a0nM). However, the concentrations of testosterone required for binding the receptor are far above even total circulating concentrations of testosterone in adult males (which range between 10 and 35\u00a0nM).\nBiochemistry.\nBiosynthesis.\nLike other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from cholesterol &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The first step in the biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17\u03b1-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3\u03b2-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.\nThe largest amounts of testosterone (&gt;95%) are produced by the testes in men, while the adrenal glands account for most of the remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, thecal cells of the ovaries, and, during pregnancy, by the placenta. In the testes, testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells. The male generative glands also contain Sertoli cells, which require testosterone for spermatogenesis. Like most hormones, testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood where much of it is transported bound to a specific plasma protein, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).\nRegulation.\nIn males, testosterone is synthesized primarily in Leydig cells. The number of Leydig cells in turn is regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In addition, the amount of testosterone produced by existing Leydig cells is under the control of LH, which regulates the expression of 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.\nThe amount of testosterone synthesized is regulated by the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013testicular axis &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. When testosterone levels are low, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released by the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. These latter two hormones stimulate the testis to synthesize testosterone. Finally, increasing levels of testosterone through a negative feedback loop act on the hypothalamus and pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH and FSH/LH, respectively.\nFactors affecting testosterone levels may include:\nDistribution.\nThe plasma protein binding of testosterone is 98.0 to 98.5%, with 1.5 to 2.0% free or unbound. It is bound 65% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 33% bound weakly to albumin.\nMetabolism.\nBoth testosterone and 5\u03b1-DHT are metabolized mainly in the liver. Approximately 50% of testosterone is metabolized via conjugation into testosterone glucuronide and to a lesser extent testosterone sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, respectively. An additional 40% of testosterone is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids androsterone and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5\u03b1- and 5\u03b2-reductases, 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17\u03b2-HSD, in that order. Androsterone and etiocholanolone are then glucuronidated and to a lesser extent sulfated similarly to testosterone. The conjugates of testosterone and its hepatic metabolites are released from the liver into circulation and excreted in the urine and bile. Only a small fraction (2%) of testosterone is excreted unchanged in the urine.\nIn the hepatic 17-ketosteroid pathway of testosterone metabolism, testosterone is converted in the liver by 5\u03b1-reductase and 5\u03b2-reductase into 5\u03b1-DHT and the inactive 5\u03b2-DHT, respectively. Then, 5\u03b1-DHT and 5\u03b2-DHT are converted by 3\u03b1-HSD into 3\u03b1-androstanediol and 3\u03b1-etiocholanediol, respectively. Subsequently, 3\u03b1-androstanediol and 3\u03b1-etiocholanediol are converted by 17\u03b2-HSD into androsterone and etiocholanolone, which is followed by their conjugation and excretion. 3\u03b2-Androstanediol and 3\u03b2-etiocholanediol can also be formed in this pathway when 5\u03b1-DHT and 5\u03b2-DHT are acted upon by 3\u03b2-HSD instead of 3\u03b1-HSD, respectively, and they can then be transformed into epiandrosterone and epietiocholanolone, respectively. A small portion of approximately 3% of testosterone is reversibly converted in the liver into androstenedione by 17\u03b2-HSD.\nIn addition to conjugation and the 17-ketosteroid pathway, testosterone can also be hydroxylated and oxidized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. 6\u03b2-Hydroxylation and to a lesser extent 16\u03b2-hydroxylation are the major transformations. The 6\u03b2-hydroxylation of testosterone is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP3A5 and is responsible for 75 to 80% of cytochrome P450-mediated testosterone metabolism. In addition to 6\u03b2- and 16\u03b2-hydroxytestosterone, 1\u03b2-, 2\u03b1/\u03b2-, 11\u03b2-, and 15\u03b2-hydroxytestosterone are also formed as minor metabolites. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 can also oxidize testosterone at the C17 position to form androstenedione.\nTwo of the immediate metabolites of testosterone, 5\u03b1-DHT and estradiol, are biologically important and can be formed both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues. Approximately 5 to 7% of testosterone is converted by 5\u03b1-reductase into 5\u03b1-DHT, with circulating levels of 5\u03b1-DHT about 10% of those of testosterone, and approximately 0.3% of testosterone is converted into estradiol by aromatase. 5\u03b1-Reductase is highly expressed in the male reproductive organs (including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymides), skin, hair follicles, and brain and aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue, bone, and the brain. As much as 90% of testosterone is converted into 5\u03b1-DHT in so-called androgenic tissues with high 5\u03b1-reductase expression, and due to the several-fold greater potency of 5\u03b1-DHT as an AR agonist relative to testosterone, it has been estimated that the effects of testosterone are potentiated 2- to 3-fold in such tissues.\nLevels.\nTotal levels of testosterone in the body have been reported as 264 to 916\u00a0ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter) in non-obese European and American men age 19 to 39\u00a0years, while mean testosterone levels in adult men have been reported as 630\u00a0ng/dL. Although commonly used as a reference range, some physicians have disputed the use of this range to determine hypogonadism. Several professional medical groups have recommended that 350\u00a0ng/dL generally be considered the minimum normal level, which is consistent with previous findings. Levels of testosterone in men decline with age. In women, mean levels of total testosterone have been reported to be 32.6\u00a0ng/dL. In women with hyperandrogenism, mean levels of total testosterone have been reported to be 62.1\u00a0ng/dL.\nMeasurement.\nIn measurements of testosterone in blood samples, different assay techniques can yield different results. Immunofluorescence assays exhibit considerable variability in quantifying testosterone concentrations in blood samples due to the cross-reaction of structurally similar steroids, leading to overestimating the results. In contrast, the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method is more desirable: it offers superior specificity and precision, making it a more suitable choice for this application.\nTestosterone's bioavailable concentration is commonly determined using the Vermeulen calculation or more precisely using the modified Vermeulen method, which considers the dimeric form of sex hormone-binding globulin.\nBoth methods use chemical equilibrium to derive the concentration of bioavailable testosterone: in circulation, testosterone has two major binding partners, albumin (weakly bound) and sex hormone-binding globulin (strongly bound). These methods are described in detail in the accompanying figure.\nDistribution.\nTestosterone has been detected at variably higher and lower levels among men of various nations and from various backgrounds, explanations for the causes of this have been relatively diverse.\nHistory and production.\nA testicular action was linked to circulating blood fractions\u00a0\u2013 now understood to be a family of androgenic hormones\u00a0\u2013 in the early work on castration and testicular transplantation in fowl by Arnold Adolph Berthold (1803\u20131861). Research on the action of testosterone received a brief boost in 1889, when the Harvard professor Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard (1817\u20131894), then in Paris, self-injected subcutaneously a \"rejuvenating elixir\" consisting of an extract of dog and guinea pig testicle. He reported in \"The Lancet\" that his vigor and feeling of well-being were markedly restored but the effects were transient, and Brown-S\u00e9quard's hopes for the compound were dashed. Suffering the ridicule of his colleagues, he abandoned his work on the mechanisms and effects of androgens in human beings.\nIn 1927, the University of Chicago's Professor of Physiologic Chemistry, Fred C. Koch, established easy access to a large source of bovine testicles\u00a0\u2013 the Chicago stockyards\u00a0\u2013 and recruited students willing to endure the tedious work of extracting their isolates. In that year, Koch and his student, Lemuel McGee, derived 20\u00a0mg of a substance from a supply of 40 pounds of bovine testicles that, when administered to castrated roosters, pigs and rats, re-masculinized them. The group of Ernst Laqueur at the University of Amsterdam purified testosterone from bovine testicles in a similar manner in 1934, but the isolation of the hormone from animal tissues in amounts permitting serious study in humans was not feasible until three European pharmaceutical giants\u00a0\u2013 Schering (Berlin, Germany), Organon (Oss, Netherlands) and Ciba\u00a0\u2013 began full-scale steroid research and development programs in the 1930s.\nThe Organon group in the Netherlands were the first to isolate the hormone, identified in a May 1935 paper \"On Crystalline Male Hormone from Testicles (Testosterone)\". They named the hormone \"testosterone\", from the stems of \"testicle\" and \"sterol\", and the suffix of \"ketone\". The structure was worked out by Schering's Adolf Butenandt, at the \"Chemisches Institut\" of Technical University in Gda\u0144sk.\nThe chemical synthesis of testosterone from cholesterol was achieved in August that year by Butenandt and Hanisch. Only a week later, the Ciba group in Zurich, Leopold Ruzicka (1887\u20131976) and A. Wettstein, published their synthesis of testosterone. These independent partial syntheses of testosterone from a cholesterol base earned both Butenandt and Ruzicka the joint 1939 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Testosterone was identified as 17\u03b2-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one (C19H28O2), a solid polycyclic alcohol with a hydroxyl group at the 17th carbon atom. This also made it obvious that additional modifications on the synthesized testosterone could be made, i.e., esterification and alkylation.\nThe partial synthesis in the 1930s of abundant, potent testosterone esters permitted the characterization of the hormone's effects, so that Kochakian and Murlin (1936) were able to show that testosterone raised nitrogen retention (a mechanism central to anabolism) in the dog, after which Allan Kenyon's group was able to demonstrate both anabolic and androgenic effects of testosterone propionate in eunuchoidal men, boys, and women. The period of the early 1930s to the 1950s has been called \"The Golden Age of Steroid Chemistry\", and work during this period progressed quickly.\nLike other androsteroids, testosterone is manufactured industrially from microbial fermentation of plant cholesterol (e.g., from soybean oil). In the early 2000s, the steroid market weighed around one million tonnes and was worth $10 billion, making it the 2nd largest biopharmaceutical market behind antibiotics.\nOther species.\nTestosterone is observed in most vertebrates. Testosterone and the classical nuclear androgen receptor first appeared in gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Agnathans (jawless vertebrates) such as lampreys do not produce testosterone but instead use androstenedione as a male sex hormone. Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone. The presence of these ubiquitous steroids in a wide range of animals suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.\nThe company was founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\nIn the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of \u00a02020[ [update]]. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.\nToyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient hybrid electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the original Toyota Prius in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt all-electric vehicles, instead focusing on the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like the Toyota Mirai, a technology that is much costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries in terms of adoption.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under five brands: Century, Daihatsu, Hino, Lexus and the namesake Toyota. The company also holds a 20% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.1% stake in Mazda, a 4.9% stake in Suzuki, a 4.6% stake in Isuzu, a 3.8% stake in Yamaha Motor Corporation, and a 2.8% stake in Panasonic, as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (FAW Toyota and GAC Toyota), the Czech Republic (TPCA), India (Toyota Kirloskar) and the United States (MTMUS).\nToyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where its stock is a component of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices.\nHistory.\n1920s\u20131930s.\nIn 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic loom. The principle of \"jidoka\", which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers, generating the starting capital for automobile development.\nUnder the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934. A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model. Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for \u00a52,900, \u00a5200 cheaper than the Ford truck. A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.\nIn April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed. The sales price was \u00a53,350, \u00a5400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars. The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May. In July, the company filled its first export order, with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China. On September 19, 1936, the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.\nVehicles were originally sold under the name \"Toyoda\" (\u30c8\u30e8\u30c0), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichir\u014d Toyoda. In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo. Of 27,000 entries, the winning entry was the three Japanese \"katakana\" letters for \"Toyoda\" in a circle. However, Rizaburo Toyoda, who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred \"Toyota\" () because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end), and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a \"murky\" or \"muddy\" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are \"clear\").\nSince \"toyoda\" literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd. Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.\n1940s.\nJapan was heavily damaged in World War II and Toyota's plants, which were used for the war effort, were not spared. On August 14, 1945, one day before the surrender of Japan, Toyota's Koromo Plant was bombed by the Allied forces. After the surrender, the U.S.-led occupying forces banned passenger car production in Japan. However, automakers like Toyota were allowed to begin building trucks for civilian use, in an effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. The U.S. military also contracted with Toyota to repair its vehicles.\nBy 1947, there was an emerging global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., who had been allies in World War II. U.S. priorities shifted (the \"Reverse Course\") from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the economy, and, to an extent, remilitarizing Japan. Under these new policies, in 1949, Japanese automakers were allowed to resume passenger car production, but at the same time, a new economic stabilization program to control inflation plunged the automotive industry into a serious shortage of funds, while many truck owners defaulted on their loans. Ultimately, the Bank of Japan, the central bank of the country, bailed out the company, with demands that the company institute reforms.\n1950s.\nAs the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. Meanwhile, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance. In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers. The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.\nToyota started developing its first full-fledged passenger car, the Toyopet Crown, in 1952. Prior to the Crown, Toyota had been outsourcing the design and manufacturing of auto bodies, which were then mounted on truck frames made by Toyota. The project was a major test for Toyota, who would need to build bodies and develop a new chassis that would be comfortable, but still stand up to the muddy, slow, unpaved roads common in Japan at the time. The project had been championed for many years by founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who died suddenly on March 27, 1952. The first prototypes were completed in June 1953 and began extensive testing, before the Crown went on sale in August 1955. The car was met with positive reviews from around the world.\nAfter the introduction of the Crown, Toyota began aggressively expanding into the export market; the company entered Saudi Arabia for the first time in 1955 with Land Cruisers, following an agreement reached with Abdul Latif Jameel (founder of his company of the same name); Toyota also brought Land Cruisers into neighboring Yemen in 1956. In 1958, Toyota established a production facility in Brazil, the company's first outside of Japan.\nToyota entered the United States market in 1958, attempting to sell the Toyopet Crown. The company faced problems almost immediately. The company had to confront for the first time how its name sounded to native speakers of the English language; namely, \"Toyota\" has the English word \"toy\" in its first syllable. Toyota Motor Sales, USA's first sales administrator James F. McGraw bluntly told his new Japanese supervisors after joining the company in 1959: \"'Toy' sounds like a toy and toys break\". The Crown was a flop in the U.S. market, with buyers finding it overpriced and underpowered (because it was designed for endurance on the bad roads of Japan, not high-speed performance on the good roads of America). In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in the early 1960s in favor of the Land Cruiser and the Tiara.\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.\n1960s\u20131970s.\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure. To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.\nToyota also found success in the United States in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. Toyota's first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% \"chicken tax\" on imported light trucks. By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff. Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks. The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas.\nIn Southeast Asia, Toyota made efforts to establish domestic production in the Philippines and Indonesia in early 1970s. In the Philippines, it partnered with local company Delta Motors Corporation. Toyota assisted Delta Motors with capital procurement and technology transfers. In 1973, Delta Motors commenced operations at a new plant, beginning local production of engine blocks for the Toyota Corona 12R engine and other parts. In Indonesia, Toyota established Toyota Astra Motor as a joint venture with local partner Astra International in 1971, and conducted significant retooling at the PT Gaya Motor assembly plant. The plant began assembling various models, including the Toyota Corona, Toyota Land Cruiser, large trucks, and the Toyota Corolla, with production surpassing 10,000 vehicles by 1973. For both countries, Toyota developed a basic utility vehicle (BUV) with the local partners to meet local needs and support technology transfers, in response to domestic production policies in Asia. The first prototype of the BUV was completed in January 1975. The BUV was launched as the Toyota Tamaraw in the Philippines in December 1976, and as the Toyota Kijang in June 1977. The vehicle was well received in both countries.\nThe energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry. Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars. Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned. This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.\nThe 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies. In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers. That included a stake in Hino Motors, a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in Daihatsu, a manufacturer of kei cars, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan. That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies.\n1980s.\nAfter the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s. In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America. The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America.\nAlso in 1981, Eiji Toyoda stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of the company's founder. Within months, Shoichiro started to merge Toyota's sales and production organizations, and in 1982 the combined companies became the Toyota Motor Corporation. The two groups were described as \"oil and water\" and it took years of leadership from Shoichiro to successfully combine them into one organization.\nIn Japan, Toyota offered mid-level luxury cars that were a class below the Crown and Century and offered hardtop coupes and sedans. The Supra, Mark II, Cresta and Chaser offered several trim packages with different engine displacements to provide buyers with annual road tax advantages. At the same time, sports cars like Celica, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno sold very well.\nEfforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company. Those talks broke down in July 1981. Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California. GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about The Toyota Way and the Toyota Production System. For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment. The plant would be led by Tatsuro Toyoda, the younger brother of company president Shoichiro Toyoda. The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986.\nToyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports. Conservative Toyota held on to rear-wheel-drive designs for longer than most; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front-wheel-drive cars in 1983, behind Nissan and Honda. In part due to this, Nissan's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year.\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets. Prior to the debut of Lexus, Toyota's two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion. The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.\n1990s.\nIn the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup, including a full-sized pickup, the T100 (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara. They would also launch newer iterations of their sports cars, namely the MR2, Celica, and Supra during this era.\nIn Japan, Toyota continued to cater to the growing demand for mid-level luxury cars and offered several conventional and pillared hardtops sedans at its Japanese dealership network. The Soarer, Mark II, Cresta, Chaser, Corona EXiV, and Carina ED found many buyers. At the same time, sports cars like the Supra, Celica, MR2, Corolla Levin, Sprinter Trueno, and even the subcompact Starlet GT reflected a time of prosperity.\nDecember 1997 saw the introduction of the first-generation Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car. The vehicle would be produced exclusively for the Japanese market for the first two years.\nWith a major presence in Europe, due to the success of Toyota Team Europe in motorsport, the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering, TMME, to help market vehicles in the continent. Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers. Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.\nToyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting. In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.\nOn September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.\nThe later half of the 1990s would also see the Toyoda brothers step back from the company their father had founded. In 1992, Shoichiro Toyoda would shift to become chairman, allowing his brother Tatsuro to become president, a job he held until his retirement in 1995. Shoichiro would step down as chairman in 1999. Both would retain honorary advisory roles in the company. Hiroshi Okuda would lead the company as president from 1995 until 1999 when he became chairman and the President's office would be filled by Fujio Cho.\n2000s.\nIn August 2000, exports began of the Prius. In 2001, Toyota acquired its long time partner, truck and bus manufacturer Hino Motors. In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot. A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003. Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005. Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.\nIn 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana. \"Motor Trend\" named the 2007 Toyota Camry \"Car of the Year\" for 2007. It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.\nThe company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.\nToyota was affected by the 2008 financial crisis and in December 2008 it had its first annual loss in 70 years. In January 2009, it announced the closure of all of its Japanese plants for 11 days to reduce output and stocks of unsold vehicles.\nIn October 2009, Toyota announced that they were establishing an office in South Korea and launched the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Prius and the RAV4 during the launching event at the Grand Hyatt Seoul.\nBetween 2009 and 2011, Toyota conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The recalls were to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped and to correct the possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal. At least 37 were killed in crashes allegedly related to unintended acceleration, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were recalled, Toyota was sued for personal injuries and wrongful deaths, paid US$ to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and paid a US$ criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image.\nAmid the unintended acceleration scandal, Katsuaki Watanabe stepped down as company president. He was replaced by Akio Toyoda, grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, on June 23, 2009. Akio had been with Toyota since 1984, working jobs in production, marketing and product development, and took a seat on the board of directors in 2000. Akio's promotion by the board marked the return of a member of the Toyoda family to the top leadership role for the first time since 1999.\n2010s.\nIn 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters. The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports. Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base. Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods.\nOn February 10, 2014, it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017. The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture, and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market. The company planned to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017, and retain its Altona plant for other functions. The workforce was expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300. Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors (Holden) followed suit, ending Australian production in 2016 and 2017 respectively.\nThe automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014, selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year. Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.\nIn August 2014, Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare-parts prices in China by up to 35%. The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota's Lexus spare-parts policies, as part of an industry-wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after-sales servicing.\nIn November 2015, the company announced that it would invest US$ over the next five years into artificial intelligence and robotics research. In 2016, Toyota invested in Uber. In 2020, a corporate governance report showed that Toyota owns 10.25 million shares of Uber, which was valued at $292.46 million as of March 30, 2020. According to Reuters, this was roughly 0.6 percent of Uber's outstanding shares.\nIn March 2016, Toyota partnered with Yanmar to create a fiberglass pleasure boat using Yanmar outboard marine diesel engines or Toyota inboard engines.\nIn August 2016, the company purchased all remaining assets of Daihatsu, making the manufacturer of small cars a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.\nOn August 27, 2018, Toyota announced an investment of US$ in Uber's autonomous cars.\nIn October 2019, Toyota backed the Trump Administration's proposal that federal authority should override California's ability to set its own emissions standards for automobiles. The proposal would reduce California's 2025 fuel efficiency standard from about 54.5 to 37 MPG. This shift by Toyota away from fuel efficiency damaged the company's reputation as a green brand.\n2020s.\nBy 2020, Toyota reclaimed its position as the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Volkswagen. It sold 9.528 million vehicles globally despite an 11.3% drop in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors.\nOn April 2, 2020, BYD and Toyota announced a new joint venture between the two companies called BYD Toyota EV Technology Co., Ltd., with the aim of \"developing BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) that appeal to customers.\"\nIn March 2021, Toyota, its subsidiary Hino, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.\nIn April 2021, Toyota said that it will buy Lyft's self-driving technology unit for $550 million and merge it with its newly created Woven Planet Holdings automation division.\nIn June 2021, the company defended its donations to the United States Republican lawmakers after they voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying it did not believe it was \"appropriate to judge members of Congress\" for that one vote. A report by Axios found that Toyota was the top donor to 2020 election objectors, by a substantial margin. The company then reversed course in July 2021 and ceased donations to election objectors, releasing a statement saying it understood that its PAC's donations to those objectors, which far outpaced those of any other company, \"troubled some stakeholders.\" Toyota resumed donations after a six-month pause.\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced that it would invest ($70 billion at 2021 exchange rate) in electric vehicles by 2030, launch 30 EV models worldwide by that year, and set a sales target of 3.5 million electric vehicles in 2030.\nToyota will increase its software engineer intake to around 40% to 50% of all technical hires from the second quarter of 2022, the move plans to address a transformation to so-called CASE \u2014 connected, autonomous, shared and electric \u2014 technologies in an environment of intensifying global competition.\nIn 2021, Toyota told some of its suppliers to increase their semiconductor inventory levels from the conventional three months to five months in response to the COVID-19 chip shortage. The \"just-in-time\" supply chain in which parts are only delivered when necessary, had already been revised after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, lifting inventories across the entire procurement network. The time it takes Toyota to turn over its inventory increased by around 40% during the past ten years, to 36.36 days as of March\u00a02021[ [update]].\nIn June 2022, Toyota recalled 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles due to worries that their wheels could fall off during driving. It was discovered that the bolts on the bZ4X's wheels could loosen up to the point where the wheel simply detaches from the car, causing a loss of control over the vehicle and possible accident.\nIn August 2022, Toyota pledged up to $5.6 billion towards electric vehicle battery production and announced an increase in investment in its plant near Greensboro, North Carolina. Also in 2022, Toyota managed to maintain its position as the world's best-selling automaker for the third year in a row.\nIn 2022, Toyota signed a \u00a3 deal with the British government to develop hydrogen-powered pickup trucks. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is investing \u00a3 in the research scheme, based at Burnaston, with a further \u00a3 coming through the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC).\nIn January 2023, Toyota CEO and President Akio Toyoda announced that he was stepping down and passing the position on to Koji Sato. Akio is the great-grandson of company founder Rizaburo Toyoda. Sato had previously run Lexus, Toyota's luxury car brand. The change is set to take effect on April 1, 2023.\nIn 2023, after negotiating with the unions, Toyota implemented the largest increase in employee wages in 20 years.\nIn July 2024, Toyota announced plans to build an electric car cell plant in Fukuoka and export them to the rest of Asia.\nIn October 18 2024, Toyota announced to return to Formula 1 after a 15-year absence, partnering with the US-based Haas team.\nIn November 2024, Toyota and Joby Aviation completed an air taxi test flight in Japan using an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Toyota had invested $394 million to Joby as part of a strategic alliance on commercial manufacturing.\nIn June 2025, Toyota announced to raise its prices for some vehicles sold in the US by an average of $270 from July 2025 as the US government imposed a 25% tariff on the imported vehicle parts.\nIn October 2025, Toyota announced that it would spinoff the Century nameplate into its own independent marque, which is to be focused on low-production and hand-built ultra-luxury vehicles. Chairman Akio Toyoda explained that this was done to further define the Century brand from Lexus, Toyota's mass-production luxury marque.\nBoard of directors.\nList of former chairmen.\n\"In 1950, Toyota was split into Toyota Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Sales Co. (sales arm of Toyota); the two companies merged in 1982 to create one unified company, with then-Toyota Motor Co. President Eiji Toyoda becoming chairman. Chairmen listed prior to 1982 below were for the pre-merger Toyota Motor Co. only.\"\nList of former presidents.\n\"Similar to the chairman position, in 1982 the then-Toyota Motor Sales Co. President Shoichiro Toyoda becoming President. President's listed prior to 1982 below were for the pre-merger Toyota Motor Co. only.\"\nProduct line.\nToyota officially lists approximately 70 different models sold under its namesake brand, including sedans, coupes, vans, trucks, hybrids, and crossovers. Many of these models are produced as passenger sedans, which range from the subcompact Toyota Yaris, compact Corolla, to mid-size Camry and full-size Avalon. Minivans include the Innova, Alphard/Vellfire, Sienna, and others. Several small cars, such as the xB and tC, were sold under the Scion brand.\nSUVs and crossovers.\nToyota SUV and crossover line-up grew quickly in the late 2010s to 2020s due to the market shift to SUVs. Toyota crossovers range from the subcompact Yaris Cross and C-HR, compact Corolla Cross and RAV4, to midsize Harrier/Venza and Kluger/Highlander. Other crossovers include the Raize, Urban Cruiser. Toyota SUVs range from the midsize Fortuner to full-size Land Cruiser. Other SUVs include the Rush, Prado,\n4Runner, and Sequoia.\nPickup trucks.\nToyota first entered the pickup truck market in 1947 with the SB that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the RK (renamed in 1959 as the Stout) and in 1968 by the compact Hilux. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable. Extended cab and crew cab versions were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market in various cab lengths, with gasoline or diesel engines, and 2WD and 4WD versions.\nIn North America, the Hilux became a major model for the company, leading the company to launch the Tacoma in 1995. The Tacoma was based on the Hilux, but with a design intended to better suit the needs of North American consumers who often use pickup trucks as personal vehicles. The design was a success and the Tacoma became the best-selling compact pickup in North America.\nAfter the success of its compact Hilux pickups in North America, Toyota decided to enter the full-size pickup market, which was traditionally dominated by domestic automakers. The company introduced the T100 for the 1993 US model year. The T100 had a full-size long bed, but suspension and engine characteristics were similar to that of a compact pickup. Sales were disappointing and the T100 was criticized for having a small V6 engine (especially compared to the V8 engines common in American full-size trucks), lacking an extended-cab version, being too small, and too expensive (because of the 25% tariff on imported trucks). In 1995, Toyota added the more powerful V6 engine from the new Tacoma to the T100 and also added an extended cab version. In 1999, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger Tundra, which would be built in the US with a V8 engine and styling that more closely matched other American full-size trucks.\nLuxury vehicles.\nIn the Japanese home market, Toyota has two flagship models: the Crown premium sedans and SUVs and the Century limousine.\nIn the 1980s, Toyota wanted to expand its luxury car offerings but realized that existing Japanese-market flagship models had little global appeal and could not compete with established brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar or the Acura and Infiniti marquees being launched by Japanese competitors.\nBefore the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in markets outside of Japan. The company developed the brand and its vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion. The Lexus LS flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coup\u00e9, convertible and SUV models.\nThe Lexus brand was introduced to the Japanese market in 2005, previously all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque.\nThe Century brand was spun off in 2025.\nBuses.\nThe Toyota Coaster is a minibus introduced in 1969 that seats 17 passengers. The Coaster is widely used in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, the Caribbean, and South America to operate as public transportation. The Toyota HiAce is also sometimes used as a minibus.\nTechnology.\nHybrid electric vehicles.\nToyota is the world's leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe, and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles, with the introduction of the XW10 Toyota Prius in 1997. The company's hybrid technology is called Hybrid Synergy Drive, and it was later applied to many vehicles in Toyota's product lineup, starting first with the Camry and the technology was also brought to the luxury Lexus division.\nAs of \u00a02020[ [update]], Toyota Motor Corporation sells 44 Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models in over 90 countries and regions around the world, and the carmaker has sold over 15 million hybrid vehicles since 1997. The Prius family is the world's top-selling hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle nameplate with almost 4 million units sold worldwide as of January 2017.\nHydrogen fuel-cell.\nIn 2002, Toyota began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production SUV. Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor bus. Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv. The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of under the Japanese JC08 test cycle. Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.\nIn August 2012, Toyota announced its plans to start retail sales of a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan in California in 2015. Toyota expects to become a leader in this technology. The prototype of its first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will be exhibited at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, and in the United States at the January 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.\nToyota's first hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles to be sold commercially, the Toyota Mirai (Japanese for \"future\"), was unveiled at the November 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show. In January 2015, it was announced that production of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle would increase from 700 units in 2015 to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and 3,000 in 2017. Sales in Japan began in December 2014. Retail sales in the U.S. began in August 2015, initially only in California. The market release in Europe is slated for September 2015, and initially will be available only in the UK, Germany, and Denmark, followed by other countries in 2017.\nIn 2015, Toyota released 5,600 patents for free use until 2020, hoping to promote global development of hydrogen fuel-cell technology.\nSince the mid-2010s, Toyota has increased its focus on building hydrogen powered trucks. It first showcased a heavy-duty semi-truck tractor in 2017 and in 2023 announced a kit to convert existing diesel-powered truck engines to use hydrogen. In late 2022, the company signed an \u00a3 government deal with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to help it develop a hydrogen-powered Hilux pickup truck.\nPlug-in hybrids.\nThe Prius Plug-In Hybrid Concept was exhibited in late 2009, and shortly after, a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began. The vehicles were leased to fleet and government customers, and were equipped with data tracking devices to allow Toyota to monitor the car's performance. The vehicle was based on the third-generation Toyota Prius and outfitted with two additional lithium-ion batteries beyond the normal hybrid battery pack. The additional batteries were used to operate the car with minimal use of the internal combustion engine until they are depleted, at which point they are disengaged from the system. They are not used in tandem with the main hybrid battery pack.\nAfter the conclusion of the demonstration program, the production version of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid was unveiled in September 2011. The production Prius Plug-in had a maximum electric-only speed of , and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the vehicle as having a range of in blended mode (mostly electric, but supplemented by the internal combustion engine). Toyota ultimately only did a small production run with 75,400 vehicles being produced between 2012 and 2016.\nThe second-generation Prius Plug-in (renamed the Prius Prime in the US) was unveiled in early 2016. Unlike the prior generation, where the plug-in battery was limited by being added to the existing Prius, this model would be developed in tandem with the fourth-generation Prius, allowing Toyota to increase the range to , with a top speed of , without needing the assistance of the internal combustion engine. The second-generation Prius Plug-in went on sale starting in late 2016, with Toyota expecting to sell up to 60,000 units globally per year.\nA second plug-in hybrid model, the Toyota RAV4 PHV (RAV4 Prime in the US) was unveiled in December 2019. The vehicle has an EPA-estimated of all-electric range and generates a combined , enabling it to be Toyota's second fastest car currently in production (behind the GR Supra 3.0 sports car). Sales started in mid-2020.\nBattery electric vehicles.\nToyota has been criticized for being slow to add battery electric vehicles to its lineup. It has been publicly skeptical of battery-electric vehicles, instead focusing on hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and actively lobbying against government mandates to transition to zero-emissions vehicles.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], only a small proportion of the vehicles the company sells are of battery electric, which has prompted criticism by some environmental and public interest groups. The company plans to increase its sales of electric vehicles to 3.5 million per year by 2030. However, the company has stated that it believes other technologies, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will continue to play a role in the future of the company.\nToyota created the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV (Electric Vehicle) as a compliance car after the California Air Resources Board mandated in the late 1990s that every automaker offer a zero-emissions vehicle. A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California from 1997 to 2003, when the state dropped its mandate under legal pressure from lawsuits filed by automakers.\nA second generation of the RAV4 EV was developed in 2010 as part of a deal with Tesla. The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from Tesla. The RAV4 EV had a limited production run with just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014. According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".\nStarting in 2009, Toyota introduced three generations of concept electric vehicles called the FT-EV built on a modified Toyota iQ platform. In late-2012, the company announced plans to build a production version of the car called the Toyota iQ EV (Scion iQ EV in the US, Toyota eQ in Japan), but ultimately production was cut back to 100 cars for special fleet use in Japan and the U.S. only.\nIn late 2012, Toyota announced that it would back away from fully electric vehicles, after producing less than 5,000. At the time, the company's vice chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, said: \"\"The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society's needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge\".\"\nA shift in Toyota's formerly battery-agnostic posture could be seen as early as 2016, when Toyota's CFO Takahiko Ijichi \"sent a strong signal that Toyota soon plans to jump on the battery bandwagon and make electric cars despite expressing skeptical views about their range and charging times,\" as the Wall Street Journal wrote. Toyota said it would make and sell battery-electric vehicles if and where regulations and markets demand.\nA year later, Toyota outlined its electric-vehicle plans for between 2020 and 2030 to the press in Tokyo, saying it would introduce \"more than 10\" battery-electric vehicles worldwide by the early 2020s, beginning in China, and later in Japan, Europe, the US and India.\nIn April 2019, Toyota introduced the C-HR EV, its first mass-produced pure electric model in China along with an identical twin called the IZOA EV. It went on sale in April 2020 and May 2020 respectively. Nikkei reported in October 2020 that Toyota had only sold less than 2,000 units in the first eight months of the year.\nToyota introduced the C+pod in late 2020, a 2-seater kei car with an estimated range of and a top speed of .\nIn December 2020, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda stated that electric cars are excessively \"hyped\" and that, in Japan, they would not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions since electricity is mostly generated by burning coal and natural gas in the country. He also said that the infrastructure needed for Japan to switch fully to EVs would cost between $135 billion and $358 billion and switching only to EVs would cost millions of jobs and make cars less affordable.\nIn April 2021, Toyota revealed the bZ4X, an electric crossover SUV that will be the first vehicle built on a dedicated electric platform called e-TNGA when it goes on sale in mid-2022. It is the first model of the bZ (\"beyond Zero\") series of battery electric vehicles. The company has also stated that there will be seven \"bZ\" models to be launched globally out of 15 BEV models by 2025.\nIn June 2021, Transport &amp; Environment ranked Toyota as the least ready OEM to transition to battery electric vehicles by 2030, stating: \"Toyota has not set a target for 2030 and it plans to produce just 10% BEVs in 2025. It is expected to rely on polluting hybrid technologies.\"\nIn December 2021, Toyota announced in Tokyo plans for 30 battery-electric models by 2030, to sell 3.5 million BEVs per year by that date, and that its premium-brand Lexus will be 100% battery-operated by 2030 in North America, Europe, and China. The company announced investments of $70 billion into the company's electrification.\nIn a session in parallel with the G-7 Meeting 2023 May, Akio Toyoda said that battery electric vehicles are not solely the future, instead offering a mix of battery electric, internal combustion engine-equipped and hydrogen cars.\nToyota has been developing solid-state batteries in partnership with Panasonic, in which the company has more than a thousand patents covering solid-state batteries by late 2020. The technology has been implemented on the Toyota LQ concept. Toyota hopes the technology could increase efficiency of battery electric vehicles by 30 percent, which in turn would reduce battery costs by the same amount.\nAutonomous vehicles.\nToyota is also regarded as lagging when it comes to developing smart car technology. Although the company unveiled its first self-driving test vehicle in 2017, and has been developing its own self-driving technology named \"Chauffeur\" (intended for full self-driving) and \"Guardian\" (a driver assist system), neither of these has been introduced into any production vehicles.\nThe company had set up a large research and development operation by 2018, spending almost US$4 billion to start an autonomous vehicle research institute in California's Silicon Valley and another \u00a5300 billion on a similar research institute in Tokyo that would partner with fellow Toyota Group companies and automotive suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.\nToyota has also been collaborating with autonomous vehicle technology developers and, in some cases, purchasing the companies. Toyota has acquired the autonomous vehicle division of ride-hailing service Lyft for $550 million, invested a total of US$1 billion in competing ride-hailing service Uber's self-driving vehicle division, invested $400 million in autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai, and announced a partnership with Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy to build a \"Smart Car Ecosystem.\"\nIn December 2020, Toyota showcased the 20-passenger \"e-Palette\" shared autonomous vehicle, which saw its first major use at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Toyota has announced it intends to have the vehicle available for commercial applications before 2025.\nSince February 2021, Toyota has been building the \"Woven City\" which it calls a \"175-acre high tech, sensor-laden metropolis\" at the foot of Mount Fuji. When completed in 2024, the Woven City will be used to run tests on autonomous vehicles for deliveries, transport and mobile shops, with the city's residents participating in the living laboratory experiment.\nMotorsports.\nToyota has been involved in many global motorsports series, providing vehicles, engines and other auto parts under both the Toyota and Lexus brands.\nToyota Gazoo Racing (GR) is Toyota's performance brand that is used in many of the world's major motorsports contests. Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, competes in the FIA World Endurance Championship, while the Finland-based Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT participates in the FIA World Rally Championship. Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa competes in the Dakar Rally. Between 2002 and 2009, the Toyota Racing team competed in Formula One. Toyota won the highest class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans 5 consecutive times from 2018 to 2022, competing with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid and Toyota GR010 Hybrid.\nToyota Racing Development USA (TRD USA) is responsible for participation in major motorsports contests in the United States including NASCAR, NHRA, Indy Racing League and Formula Drift.\nToyota also makes engines and other auto parts for other Japanese motorsports including Super Formula, Super GT, Formula 3, and Toyota Racing Series.\nFinancial services.\nThe business known as Toyota Financial Services covers more than 30 countries and regions, including Japan. Financial services operations are coordinated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Toyota Financial Services Corporation (TFSC), which has overall responsibility for the financial services subsidiaries globally.\nThe first TFS operation commenced in Sydney, Australia, in 1982 as Toyota Finance Australia Limited and was soon followed by operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Oceania.\nTFS has constructed a global network that covers approximately 90% of the markets in which Toyota sells its vehicles. Mainly concentrated on auto loans, leases and Toyota dealer floorplan requirements, TFS provides auto sales financing to approximately 11.6 million customers, globally. Toyota Financial Service Corporation via its U.S. subsidiary \"Toyota Motor Credit Corporation\" owns Toyota Financial Savings Bank, an ILC chartered bank in Henderson, NV.\nTFS offers its customers financial services that include auto sales financing, credit cards, retail sales of corporate bonds and investment trusts, and insurance.\nKazakhstan.\nIn Kazakhstan, as of July 2021, the company ranks second in terms of assets () among microfinance organizations in the country.\nNon-automotive activities.\nAerospace.\nToyota is a minority shareholder in Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, having invested US$ in the new venture which will produce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, slated for first deliveries in 2017. Toyota has also studied participation in the general aviation market and contracted with Scaled Composites to produce a proof of concept aircraft, the TAA-1, in 2002.\nPleasure boats.\nIn 1997, building on a previous partnership with Yamaha Marine, Toyota created \"Toyota Marine\", building private ownership motorboats, currently sold only in Japan. A small network in Japan sells the luxury craft at 54 locations, called the \"Toyota Ponam\" series, and in 2017, a boat was labeled under the Lexus brand name starting May 26, 2017.\nPhilanthropy.\nToyota works with nonprofits to improve their processes and operations such as the Food Bank For New York City.\nRobotics.\nIn 2004, Toyota showcased its trumpet-playing robot. Toyota has been developing multitask robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. Designed for use with wheelchairs, it \"allows a person to control an electric wheelchair accurately, almost in real-time\", with his or her mind. The thought controls allow the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement of just 125\u00a0milliseconds. Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, a 'robotic astronaut'.\nIn 2017, the company introduced T-HR3, a humanoid robot with the ability to be remotely controlled. The robot can copy the motions of a connected person. The 2017 version used wires for the connection but the 2018 version used 5G from a distance up to .\nSewing machine brand.\nAisin, another member of the Toyota Group of companies, uses the same Toyota wordmark logo to market its home-use sewing machines. Aisin was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda after he founded the Toyota Motor Corporation. According to Aisin, he was so pleased with the first sewing machine, he decided to apply the same Toyota branding as his auto business, despite the companies being independent from each other.\nCarbon removal.\nToyota Ventures, along with JetBlue Technology Ventures and Parley for the Oceans, is among the corporate investors that have invested $40 million in the Air Company, a carbon negative vodka distiller and perfume and hand sanitizer manufacturer that uses heterogeneous catalysis to convert captured carbon into ethanol.\nEnvironmental initiatives.\nToyota states it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and it has set a goal to reduce its overall carbon emissions by 90% by 2050, compared to 2010 levels.\nThe company has invested heavily in solar energy, with a goal to install solar panels on the rooftops of all its dealerships worldwide by 2050. In addition, Toyota has partnered with various renewable energy companies to promote the use of wind and solar power, including a recent partnership with ENEOS Corporation to develop hydrogen refueling stations in Japan.\nToyota has launched a program called \"Global Environmental Challenge\" 2050 which is a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing the environmental impact of Toyota's operations. The challenge includes six environmental goals that Toyota aims to achieve by 2050, including reducing carbon emissions, minimizing water usage, promoting the recycling and reuse of materials, and promoting the use of renewable energy. The company has also implemented a variety of initiatives to promote sustainability across its supply chain, including efforts to reduce waste, water usage, and promote sustainable agriculture. For example, Toyota has implemented a zero-waste initiative at its manufacturing plants, aiming to send zero waste to landfills.\nControversies.\nCorrosion lawsuit.\nIn November 2016, Toyota agreed to pay $3.4 billion to settle allegations that roughly one-and-a-half million of its Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia pickup trucks and SUVs had been outfitted with frames prone to corrosion and perforation. According to court papers, the corrosion could reach levels high enough to compromise the vehicle's structural integrity.\nDeath from overwork.\nOn February 9, 2002, Kenichi Uchino, aged 30 years, a quality control manager, collapsed then died at work. On January 2, 2006, an unnamed chief engineer of the Camry Hybrid, aged 45 years, died from heart failure in his bed.\nFines for environmental breaches.\nIn 2003, Toyota was fined $34 million for violating the United States Clean Air Act, as 2.2 million vehicles it sold had defective smog-control computers.\nIn January 2021, Toyota was fined $180 million for delays in reporting emissions-related defects to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) between 2005 and 2015. The acting U.S. attorney said that the delays \"likely led to delayed or avoided emissions-related recalls\", although Toyota stated that despite the delays in reporting the issues to the EPA, it had notified customers and fixed the cars with the emissions defects. At the time, this was the biggest civil penalty ever levied for violating the EPA's emission reporting requirements.\n2009\u20132011 unintended acceleration recalls.\nBetween 2009 and 2011 Toyota, under pressure from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), conducted recalls of millions of vehicles after reports that several drivers experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, in November 2009, was to prevent a front driver's side floor mat from sliding into the foot pedal well, causing the pedals to become trapped. The second recall, in January 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mats and may be caused by possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal. Worldwide, approximately 9 million cars and trucks were impacted by the recalls.\nNHTSA received reports of a total of 37 deaths allegedly related to unintended acceleration, although an exact number was never verified. As a result of the problems, Toyota faced nearly 100 lawsuits from the families of those killed, drivers who were injured, vehicle owners who lost resale value, and investors who saw a drop in the value of their shares. While most of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits were settled confidentially, Toyota did spend more than US$ to settle a class action lawsuit to compensate owners for lost resale value, and the company agreed to pay a US$ criminal penalty to the United States government over accusations that it had intentionally hid information about safety defects from the public and had made deceptive statements to protect its brand image. The penalty was the largest ever levied against a car company.\nTakata airbag recalls.\nToyota was impacted by a recall of faulty airbag inflators made by Takata. The inflators can explode, shooting metal fragments into the vehicle cabin. Millions of vehicles produced between 2000 and 2014 were impacted by the recall, with some needing multiple repairs. As of January\u00a02024[ [update]], over 100 million Takata air bag inflators worldwide have been recalled by more than 20 carmakers.\nJune 2010 Chinese labour strike.\nOn June 21, 2010, a Chinese labor strike happened in Tianjin Toyoda Gosei Co, Tianjin. Workers demanded better wages and treatment.\nExtremist usage.\nIn 2015, U.S. officials asked Toyota how the Islamic State was in possession of so many Toyota trucks. Toyota cars have also been documented to have been used by other extremist organizations such as the Taliban, Hamas, Al-shabab and Somali pirates. Toyota representatives have said the company has a strict policy to not sell vehicles to potential purchasers who may use or modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities and that it cannot track aftermarket sales and that it has worked with the U.S Treasury to brief them on Toyota's supply chain on the Middle East.\nMisleading marketing.\nIn its marketing, Toyota has often referred to its non-plug-in hybrid vehicles as \"self-charging hybrid\" vehicles. The use of the term has caused some criticism that this is misleading, as some consumers were led to erroneously believe that these vehicles charge their batteries on their own when the vehicles are not used. Complaints about self-charging hybrid advertising were recorded in Ireland, although the complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland. However, in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Authority banned the adverts outright in Norway, stating: \"It is misleading to give the impression that the power to the hybrid battery is free of charge, since the electricity produced by the car has consumption of gasoline as a necessary condition.\"\nElectric vehicle website IrishEVs criticised Toyota Ireland for paying University College Dublin to conduct a study of only seven examples of their hybrid cars over seven days to make a press release about the efficiency of the vehicles. The website also criticised Toyota Ireland for using opinion polls to substantiate a claim about their CO2 emissions on Twitter.\nSafety-related misconduct by Daihatsu.\nIn April 2023, it was revealed that Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu had cheated by rigging some models to perform better in crash tests than actual production cars. The vehicles in question had a notch in the interior panel of the front door which avoided the possibility of the collision creating a sharp edge that could have injured an occupant when the side airbag deployed. This notch was present on the tested vehicles but not on vehicles sold to the public.\nThe issue affected four models, the Toyota Yaris Ativ (also known as the Vios), Perodua Axia, Toyota Agya, and an undisclosed upcoming product. No recall was conducted over the issue.\nIn December 2023, Daihatsu halted shipments of 64 models, including two dozens branded as Toyota, after safety investigations uncovered misconduct far greater in scope than previously expected. In some models, the test speeds and results of headrest impact tests were falsified. In models such as the TownAce and Pixis Joy, the airbag control unit used in testing was different from the part installed on vehicles sold to the public. Affected markets included Japan as well as Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam.\nOn January 29, 2024, Koji Sato publicly apologized to customers, dealers and suppliers for the flawed testing.\nCorporate affairs.\nToyota is headquartered in the city of Toyota, which was named Koromo until 1951, when it changed its name to match the automaker. Toyota City is located in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a four-story building that has been described as \"modest\". In 2013, company CEO Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city.\nSurrounding the headquarters are the 14-story Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant (which was established in 1938). Toyota and its Toyota Group affiliates operate a total of 17 manufacturing facilities in Aichi Prefecture and a total of 32 plants in Japan.\nToyota also operates offices in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and Nakamura-ku, Nagoya.\nFinancial performance.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], Toyota was the world's largest car company with revenues exceeding US$400 billion. For the fiscal year 2024, Toyota reported earnings of \u00a54.9 trillion, with an annual revenue of \u00a545.1 trillion, an increase of 21.4% over the previous fiscal cycle, largely due to foreign exchange rate effects, as Toyota generates most of its sales abroad.\nLargest shareholders.\nIn March 2023, 13.93% of Toyota's shares were held by individual investors, 39.04% of shares were owned by financial institutions and brokerages, 25.2% of shares were owned by other corporate entities and the remaining 21.83% were owned by foreign corporate entities and others. The largest shareholders in 2023 were:\nWorldwide presence.\nOutside of Japan, as one of the world's largest automotive manufacturer by production volume, Toyota has factories in most parts of the world. The company assembles vehicles in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.\nAdditionally, the company also has joint venture, licensed, or contract factories in China, France, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, the United States, and Vietnam.\nNorth America.\nToyota Motor North America is headquartered in Plano, Texas, and operates as a holding company for all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Toyota's operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and the current company was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota's corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region. While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.\nToyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi. In 2018, Toyota and Mazda announced a joint venture plant that will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama, starting in 2021.\nIt has started producing larger trucks, such as the new Tundra, to go after the full-size pickup market in the United States. Toyota is also pushing hybrid electric vehicle in the US such as the Prius, Camry Hybrid, Highlander Hybrid, and various Lexus products. Toyota never introduced diesel motor options in its North American products, including pickup trucks.\nToyota Canada Inc., which is part of Toyota Motor North America, handles marketing, sales, and distribution in Canada. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada operates three assembly plants: two in Cambridge, Ontario and one in Woodstock, Ontario. In 2006, Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people and producing 2,000 trucks annually.\nEurope/Western Asia.\nToyota Motor Europe is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, and oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Europe and western Asia. Toyota's operations in Europe began in 1963. Toyota has a significant presence in Europe with nine production facilities in Kol\u00edn, Czech Republic, Burnaston, England, Deeside, England, Onnaing, France, Jelcz-Laskowice, Poland, Wa\u0142brzych, Poland, Ovar, Portugal, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and Arifiye, Turkey. Toyota also operates a joint venture plant with Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot in Valenciennes, France.\nAustralia.\nIn 1963, Australia was one of the first countries to assemble Toyotas outside Japan. However, in February 2014, Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers to announce the end of production in Australia. The closure of Toyota's Australian plant was completed on October 3, 2017, and had produced a total 3,451,155 vehicles. At its peak in October 2007, Toyota manufactured 15,000 cars a month. Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.\nCompany strategy.\nThe Toyota Way.\nThe Toyota Way is a set of principles and behaviors that underlie the company's approach to management and production (which is further defined as the Toyota Production System).\nThe company has been developing its corporate philosophy since 1948 and passing it on as implicit knowledge to new employees, but as the company expanded globally, leaders officially identified and defined the Toyota Way in 2001. Toyota summarized it under two main pillars: continuous improvement and respect for people. Under the continuous improvement pillar are three principles: challenge (form a long-term vision), kaizen (a continual improvement process), and genchi genbutsu (\"go and see\" the process to make correct decisions). Under the respect for people pillar are two principles: respect and teamwork.\nIn 2004, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a University of Michigan professor of industrial engineering, published \"The Toyota Way\". In his book, Liker calls the Toyota Way \"a system designed to provide the tools for people to continually improve their work.\" According to Liker, there are 14 principles of The Toyota Way that can be organized into four themes: (1) long-term philosophy, (2) the right process will produce the right results, (3) add value to the organization by developing your people, and (4) continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning. The 14 principles are further defined in the Wikipedia article on The Toyota Way.\nToyota Production System.\nThe Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would become known as lean manufacturing. The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: just-in-time (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and Jidoka (automation with a human touch).\nThe origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: \nAfter developing the Toyota Production System in its own facilities, the company began teaching the system to its parts suppliers in the 1990s. Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions. The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.\nLogo and branding.\nIn 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\", which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota ().\nAs the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, \"TOYOTA.\"\nToyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\". The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.\nFor the Japanese market, the Toyota logo tends to be relegated to the back of the vehicle only - the more prominent badging on the grille is typically model specific, with Corollas receiving a stylized \"C\" and the Crown a crown badge, for instance.\nIn countries or regions using traditional Chinese characters, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\". In countries using simplified Chinese characters (e.g. China and Singapore), Toyota is written as \"\u4e30\u7530\" (pronounced as \"F\u0113ngti\u00e1n\" in Mandarin Chinese and \"H\u0254ng Tshan\" in Minnanese). These are the same characters as the founding family's name \"Toyoda\" in Japanese.\nToyota still uses the katakana character logo as its corporate emblem in Japan, including on the headquarters building, and some special edition models still use the \"TOYOTA\" wordmark on the grille as a nod to the company's heritage.\nOn July 15, 2015, the company was delegated its own generic top-level domain, .toyota.\nSport sponsorships.\nToyota sponsors several teams and has purchased naming rights for several venues, and even competitions, including:\nAs of 2017[ [update]], Toyota is an official sponsor of Cricket Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the Australian Football League.\nIn March 2015, Toyota became a sponsor for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in the form of supplying vehicles and communications between vehicles, starting in 2018. In May 2024, Toyota announced that it will not be extending the contract after the 2024 games in Paris, due the company reportedly being unhappy with how the IOC has used its sponsorship money. Toyota hopes to retain its contract with the International Paralympic Committee.\nToyota had previously sponsored football clubs Fortuna K\u00f6ln (1998\u20132000), Valencia (2003\u20132008), Fiorentina (1999\u20132002 and 2004\u20132010), Perugia (2002\u20132004), Catania (2003\u20132004), Valenciennes (2005\u20132012), and Red Star Belgrade (2005-2008).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wraplinks\""}
{"id": "30985", "revid": "47929967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30985", "title": "Tabloid (newspaper format)", "text": "Type of newspaper\nA tabloid is a newspaper format characterized by its compact size, smaller than a broadsheet. The term originates from the 19th century, when the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Co. used the term to describe compressed pills, later adopted by newspapers to denote condensed content. There are two main types of tabloid newspaper: red tops and compact, distinguished by editorial style.\nRed top tabloids are distinct from broadsheet newspapers, which traditionally cater to more affluent, educated audiences with in-depth reporting and analysis. However, the line between tabloids and broadsheets has blurred in recent decades, as many broadsheet newspapers have adopted tabloid or compact formats to reduce costs and attract readers.\nGlobally, the tabloid format has been adapted to suit regional preferences and media landscapes. In countries like Germany and Australia, tabloids such as \"Bild\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\" have significant readerships and political clout.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tabloid\" comes from the name given by the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Co. to the compressed tablets they marketed as \"Tabloid\" pills in the late 1880s. The word \"tabloid\" was soon applied to other small compressed items. A 1902 item in London's \"Westminster Gazette\" noted, \"The proprietor intends to give in tabloid form all the news printed by other journals.\" Thus, by 1901, \"tabloid journalism\" originally meant condensed stories in a simplified, easily absorbed format. Later, by 1918, \"tabloid\" was also being used to refer to smaller sheet newspapers that contained the condensed stories.\nTypes.\nTabloid newspapers, especially in the United Kingdom, vary widely in their target market, political alignment, editorial style, and circulation. Thus, various terms have been coined to describe the subtypes of this versatile paper format. There are, broadly, two main types of tabloid newspaper: \"red top\" and \"compact\". The distinction is largely of editorial style; both red top and compact tabloids span the width of the political spectrum from socialism to capitalist conservatism, although red-top tabloids, on account of their historically working-class target market, generally embrace populism to some degree. Red top tabloids are so named due to their tendency, in British and Commonwealth usage, to have their mastheads printed in red ink; the term \"compact\" was coined to avoid the connotation of the word \"tabloid\", which implies a red top tabloid, and has lent its name to tabloid journalism, which is journalism after the fashion of red top reporters.\nRed top tabloids.\nRed top tabloids, named after their distinguishing red mastheads, employ a form of writing known as tabloid journalism; this style emphasizes features such as sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and junk food news. Celebrity gossip columns which appear in red top tabloids and focus on their sexual practices, misuse of narcotics, and the private aspects of their lives often border on, and sometimes cross the line of defamation.\nRed tops tend to be written with a simplistic, straightforward vocabulary and grammar; their layout usually gives greater prominence to the picture than to the word. The writing style of red top tabloids is often accused of sensationalism and extreme political bias; red tops have been accused of deliberately igniting controversy and selectively reporting on attention-grabbing stories, or those with shock value. In the extreme case, tabloids have been accused of lying or misrepresenting the truth to increase circulation.\nExamples of British red top newspapers include \"The Sun\", the \"Daily Star\" and the \"Daily Mirror\". Although not using red mastheads, the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Daily Express\" also use the 'tabloid journalism' model.\nCompact tabloids.\nIn contrast to red-top tabloids, compacts use an editorial style more closely associated with broadsheet newspapers. In fact, most compact tabloids formerly used the broadsheet paper size, but changed to accommodate reading in tight spaces, such as on a crowded commuter bus or train. The term \"compact\" was coined in the 1970s by the \"Daily Mail\", one of the earlier newspapers to make the change, although it now once again calls itself a tabloid. The purpose behind this was to avoid the association of the word \"tabloid\" with the flamboyant, salacious editorial style of the red top newspaper.\nThe early converts from broadsheet format made the change in the 1970s; two British papers that took this step at the time were the \"Daily Mail\" and the \"Daily Express\". In 2003, \"The Independent\" also made the change for the same reasons, quickly followed by \"The Scotsman\" and \"The Times\". On the other hand, \"The Morning Star\" had always used the tabloid size, but stands in contrast to both the red top papers and the former broadsheets; although \"The Morning Star\" emphasizes hard news, it embraces socialism and is circulated mostly among blue-collar labourers.\nCompact tabloids, just like broadsheet- and Berliner-format newspapers, span the political spectrum from progressive to conservative and from capitalist to socialist.\nInternational use.\nAfrica.\nIn Morocco, \"Maroc Soir\", launched in November 2005, is published in tabloid format.\nIn South Africa, the Bloemfontein-based daily newspaper \"Volksblad\" became the first serious broadsheet newspaper to switch to tabloid, but only on Saturdays. Despite the format being popular with its readers, the newspaper remains broadsheet on weekdays. This is also true of Pietermaritzburg's daily, \"The Witness\" in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The \"Daily Sun\", published by Naspers, has since become South Africa's biggest-selling daily newspaper and is aimed primarily at the black working class. It sells over 500,000 copies per day, reaching approximately 3,000,000 readers. Besides offering a sometimes satirical view of the seriousness of mainstream news, the \"Daily Sun\" also covers fringe theories and paranormal claims such as tikoloshes, ancestral visions and all things supernatural. It is also published as the \"Sunday Sun\".\nIn Mauritius, the popular afternoon newspaper \"Le Mauricien\" shifted from tabloid (1908\u20132008) to the Berliner format (2008\u20132013) and now adopts a compact format with 32 pages during the week and 48 pages on Saturday.\nAsia.\nIn Bangladesh, the Daily became the first and is now the largest circulated Bengali language tabloid in the world.\nIn Georgia, the weekly English-language newspaper \"The Financial\" switched to a compact format in 2005 and doubled the number of pages in each issue. Other Georgian-language newspapers have tested compact formats in the early 1990s.\nTabloid journalism is still an evolving concept in India's print media. The first tabloid, \"Blitz\" was started by Russi Karanjia on February 1, 1941, with the words \"Our Blitz, India's Blitz against Hitler!\". \"Blitz\" was first published in English and then branched out with Hindi, Marathi and Urdu versions. In 1974, Russi's daughter Rita founded the \"Cine Blitz\" magazine. In 2005, \"Times of India\" brought out a dedicated Mumbai tabloid newspaper, \"Mumbai Mirror\", which gives prominence to Mumbai-related stories and issues. \"Tehelka\" started as a news portal in 2000. It broke the story about match-fixing in Indian and International Cricket and the sting operation on defence deals in the Indian Army. In 2007, it closed shop and reappeared in tabloid form, and has been appreciated for its brand of investigative journalism. Other popular tabloid newspapers in English media are \"Mid-Day\", an afternoon newspaper published out of and dedicated to Mumbai and business newspapers like \"MINT\". There are numerous tabloids in most of India's official languages. There is an all youth tabloid by the name of TILT \u2013 The ILIKE Times.\nIn Indonesia, tabloids include Bola, \"GO\" (Gema Olahraga, defunct), \"Soccer\" (defunct), \"Fantasy\" (defunct), \"Buletin Sinetron\" (defunct), \"Pro TV\" (defunct), \"Citra\" (defunct), \"Genie\", \"Bintang Indonesia (Indonesian Stars)\", \"Nyata\", \"Wanita Indonesia\" (Women of Indonesia), \"Cek and Ricek\", and \"Nova\".\nIn Oman, \"TheWeek\" is a free, 48-page, all-colour, independent weekly published from Muscat in the Sultanate of Oman. Oman's first free newspaper was launched in March 2003 and has now gone on to gather what is believed to be the largest readership for any publication in Oman. Ms Mohana Prabhakar is the managing editor of the publication. \"TheWeek\" is audited by BPA Worldwide, which has certified its circulation as being a weekly average of 50,300.\nIn Pakistan, \"Khabrain\" is a tabloid newspaper popular within the lower middle class. This news group introduced a new paper, \"Naya Akhbar\" which is comparably more sensational. At the local level, many sensational tabloids can be seen but, unlike \"Khabrain\" or other big national newspapers, they are distributed only on local levels in districts.\nTabloids in the Philippines are usually written in local languages, like Tagalog or Bisaya, one of the listed top Tagalog tabloids is \"Bulgar\", but some are written in English, like the \"People's Journal\" and \"Tempo\". Like their common journalistic connotations, Philippine tabloids usually report sensationalist crime stories and celebrity gossip, and some tabloids feature topless photos of girls. Several tabloids are vernacular counterparts of English broadsheet newspapers by the same publisher, like \"Pilipino Star Ngayon\" (\"The Philippine Star\"), \"Bandera\" (\"Philippine Daily Inquirer\"), and \"Balita\" (\"Manila Bulletin\"). In the Southern Philippines, a new weekly tabloid, \"The Mindanao Examiner\", now includes media services, such as photography and video production, into its line as a source to finance the high cost of printing and other expenses. It is also into independent film making.\nEurope.\nThe Berliner format, used by many prominent European newspapers, is sized between the tabloid and the broadsheet. In a newspaper context, the term \"Berliner\" is generally used only to describe size, not to refer to other qualities of the publication. The biggest tabloid (and newspaper in general) in Europe, by circulation, is Germany's \"Bild\", with around 2.5 million copies (down from above 5 million in the 1980s). Although its paper size is bigger, its style was copied from the British tabloids.\nIn Denmark, tabloids in the British sense are known as 'formiddagsblade' (before-noon newspapers), the two biggest being \"BT\" and . The old more serious newspaper \"Berlingske Tidende\" shifted from broadsheet to tabloid format in 2006, while keeping the news profile intact.\nIn Finland, the biggest newspaper and biggest daily subscription newspaper in the Nordic countries changed its size from broadsheet to tabloid on 8 January 2013.\nIn France, the \"Nice Matin\" (or \"Le Dauphin\u00e9\"), a popular Southern France newspaper changed from Broadsheet to Tabloid on 8 April 2006. They changed the printing format in one day after test results showed that 74% liked the Tabloid format compared to Broadsheet. But the most famous tabloid dealing with crime stories is \"Le Nouveau D\u00e9tective,\" created in the early 20th century. This weekly tabloid has a national circulation.\nIn the Netherlands, several newspapers have started publishing tabloid versions of their newspapers, including one of the major 'quality' newspapers, NRC Handelsblad, with \"nrc\u2022next\" (ceased 2021) in 2006. Two free tabloid newspapers were also introduced in the early 2000s, 'Metro and Sp!ts (ceased 2014), mostly for distribution in public transportation. In 2007, a third and fourth free tabloid appeared, 'De Pers' (ceased 2012) and 'DAG' (ceased 2008). De Telegraaf, came in broadsheet but changed to tabloid in 2014.\nIn Norway, close to all newspapers have switched from the broadsheet to the tabloid format, which measures 280 x 400\u00a0mm. The three biggest newspapers are \"Dagbladet\", \"VG\", and \"Aftenposten\".\nIn Poland, the newspaper \"Fakt\", sometimes \"Super Express\" is considered as tabloid.\nIn the United Kingdom, three previously broadsheet daily newspapers\u2014\"The Times\", \"The Scotsman\" and \"The Guardian\"\u2014have switched to tabloid size in recent years, and two\u2014\"Daily Express\" and \"Daily Mail\"\u2014in former years, although \"The Times\" and \"The Scotsman\" call the format \"compact\" to avoid the down-market connotation of the word \"tabloid\". Similarly, when referring to the down-market tabloid newspapers the alternative term \"red-top\" (referring to their traditionally red-coloured mastheads) is increasingly used, to distinguish them from the up- and middle-market compact newspapers. The Morning Star also comes in tabloid format; however, it avoids celebrity stories, and instead favours issues relating to labour unions.\nNorth America.\nIn Canada many newspapers of Postmedia's \"Sun\" brand are in tabloid format including \"The Province\", a newspaper for the British Columbia market. The Canadian publisher Black Press publishes newspapers in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta in both tabloid ( wide by deep) and what it calls \"tall tab\" format, where the latter is wide by deep, larger than tabloid but smaller than the broadsheets it also publishes.\nIn the United States, daily tabloids date back to the founding of the \"New York Daily News\" in 1919, followed by the \"New York Daily Mirror\", and the \"New York Evening Graphic\" in the 1920s. Competition among those three for crime, sex and celebrity news was considered a scandal to the mainstream press of the day. The tabloid format is used by a number of respected and indeed prize-winning American papers. Prominent U.S. tabloids include the \"New York Post\", the \"Daily News\" and \"Newsday\" in New York, the \"San Francisco Examiner\", \"The Bakersfield Californian\" and \"La Opini\u00f3n\" in California, \"The Jersey Journal\" and \"The Trentonian\" in New Jersey, the \"Philadelphia Daily News\", the \"Delaware County Daily Times\" and \"The Citizens' Voice\", \"The Burlington Free Press\", the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", and the \"Boston Herald\". US tabloids that ceased publication include Denver's \"Rocky Mountain News\".\nOceania.\nIn Australia, tabloids include \"The Advertiser\", the \"Herald Sun\", \"The Sun-Herald\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The Courier Mail\", \"The West Australian\", \"The Mercury\", \"the Hamilton Spectator\", \"The Portland Observer\", \"The Casterton News\" and \"The Melbourne Observer\".\nSouth America.\nIn Argentina, one of the country's two main newspapers, \"Clar\u00edn\", is a tabloid.\nIn Brazil, many newspapers are tabloids, including sports daily \"Lance!\" (which circulates in cities such as Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo), most publications currently and formerly owned by Grupo RBS (especially the Porto Alegre daily \"Zero Hora\"), and, in March 2009, Rio de Janeiro-based \"O Dia\" switched to tabloid from broadsheet, though, several years later, it reverted to being a broadsheet. Its sister publication, \"Meia Hora\" has always been a tabloid, but in slightly smaller format than \"O Dia\" and \"Lance!\".\nAs a weekly alternative newspaper.\nThe more recent usage of the term 'tabloid' refers to weekly or semi-weekly newspapers in tabloid format. Many of these are essentially straightforward newspapers, publishing in tabloid format, because subway and bus commuters prefer to read smaller-size newspapers due to lack of space.\nThese newspapers are distinguished from the major daily newspapers, in that they purport to offer an \"alternative\" viewpoint, either in the sense that the paper's editors are more locally oriented, or that the paper is editorially independent from major media conglomerates.\nOther factors that distinguish \"alternative\" weekly tabloids from the major daily newspapers are their less-frequent publication, and that they are usually free to the user, since they rely on ad revenue. Alternative weekly tabloids may concentrate on local and neighbourhood-level issues, and on entertainment in bars, theatres, or other such venues.\nAlternative tabloids can be positioned as upmarket (quality) newspapers, to appeal to the better-educated, higher-income sector of the market; as middle-market (popular); or as downmarket (sensational) newspapers, which emphasize sensational crime stories and celebrity gossip. In each case, the newspapers will draw their advertising revenue from different types of businesses or services. An upmarket weekly's advertisers are often organic grocers, boutiques, and theatre companies while a downmarket's may have those of trade schools, supermarkets, and the sex industry. Both usually contain ads from local bars, auto dealers, movie theaters, and a classified ads section.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30988", "revid": "50863518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30988", "title": "Tibetan Buddhism", "text": "Form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet and around the world\nTibetan Buddhism is a form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet, Bhutan and Mongolia. It also has a sizable number of adherents in the areas surrounding the Himalayas, including the Indian regions of Ladakh, Darjeeling, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as in Nepal. Smaller groups of practitioners can be found in Central Asia, some regions of China such as Northeast China, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and some regions of Russia, such as Tuva, Buryatia, and Kalmykia.\nTibetan Buddhism evolved as a form of Mahayana Buddhism stemming from the latest stages of Buddhism (which included many Vajrayana elements). It thus preserves many Indian Buddhist tantric practices of the post-Gupta early medieval period (500\u20131200 CE), along with numerous native Tibetan developments. In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, founded by Kublai Khan, who ruled China, Mongolia, and parts of Siberia. In the Modern era, Tibetan Buddhism has spread outside of Asia because of the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora (1959 onwards). As the Dalai Lama escaped to India, the Indian subcontinent is also known for its renaissance of Tibetan Buddhism monasteries, including the rebuilding of the three major monasteries of the Gelug tradition.\nApart from classical Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist practices like the ten perfections, Tibetan Buddhism also includes tantric practices, such as deity yoga and the Six Dharmas of Naropa, as well as methods that are seen as transcending tantra, like Dzogchen. Its main goal is Buddhahood. The primary language of scriptural study in this tradition is classical Tibetan.\nTibetan Buddhism has four major schools, namely Nyingma (8th century), Kagyu (11th century), Sakya (1073), and Gelug (1409). The Jonang is a smaller school that exists, and the Rim\u00e9 movement (19th century), meaning \"no sides\", is a more recent non-sectarian movement that attempts to preserve and understand all the different traditions. The predominant spiritual tradition in Tibet before the introduction of Buddhism was Bon, which has been strongly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism (particularly the Nyingma school). While each of the four major schools is independent and has its own monastic institutions and leaders, they are closely related and intersect with common contact and dialogue. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNomenclature.\nThe native Tibetan term for Buddhism is \"The Dharma of the insiders\" (\"nang chos\") or \"The Buddha Dharma of the insiders\" (\"nang pa sangs rgyas pa'i chos\"). \"Insider\" means someone who seeks the truth not outside but within the nature of mind. This is contrasted with other forms of organized religion, which are termed \"chos lugs\" (dharma system)\".\" For example, Christianity is termed \"Yi shu'i chos lugs\" (Jesus dharma system)\".\"\nWesterners unfamiliar with Tibetan Buddhism initially turned to China for understanding. In Chinese, the term used is \"Lamaism\" (literally, \"doctrine of the lamas\": \"lama jiao\") to distinguish it from a then-traditional Chinese Buddhism ( \"fo jiao\"). The term was taken up by western scholars, including Hegel, as early as 1822. Insofar as it implies a discontinuity between Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, the term has been discredited.\nAnother term, \"Vajray\u0101na\" (Tibetan: \"dorje tegpa\") is occasionally misused for Tibetan Buddhism. More accurately, Vajray\u0101na signifies a certain subset of practices and traditions that are not only part of Tibetan Buddhism but also prominent in other Buddhist traditions such as Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Shingon in Japan.\nIn the west, the term \"Indo-Tibetan Buddhism\" has become current in acknowledgement of its derivation from the latest stages of Buddhist development in northern India. \"Northern Buddhism\" is sometimes used to refer to Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, for example, in the Brill \"Dictionary of Religion.\"\nAnother term, \"Himalayan\" Buddhism is sometimes used to indicate how this form of Buddhism is practiced not just in Tibet but throughout the Himalayan Regions.\nThe Provisional Government of Russia, by a decree of 7 July 1917, prohibited the appellation of Buryat and Kalmyk Buddhists as \"Lamaists\" in official papers. After the October revolution the term \"Buddho-Lamaism\" was used for some time by the Bolsheviks with reference to Tibetan Buddhism, before they finally reverted, in the early 1920s, to a more familiar term \"Lamaism\", which remains in official and scholarly usage in Russia to this day.\nHistory.\nPre\u20136th century.\nCenturies after Buddhism originated in India, the Mahayana Buddhism arrived in China through the Silk Route in 1st century CE via Tibet.\nDuring the 3rd century CE, Buddhism began to spread into the Tibetan region, and its teachings affected the Bon religion in the Kingdom of Zhangzhung.\nFirst dissemination (7th\u20139th centuries).\nWhile some stories depict Buddhism in Tibet before this period, the religion was formally introduced during the Tibetan Empire (7th\u20139th century CE). Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures from India were first translated into Tibetan under the reign of the Tibetan king Songts\u00e4n Gampo (618\u2013649 CE). This period also saw the development of the Tibetan writing system and classical Tibetan.\nIn the 8th century, King Trisong Detsen (755\u2013797 CE) established it as the official religion of the state and commanded his army to wear robes and study Buddhism. Trisong Detsen invited Indian Buddhist scholars to his court, including Padmasambh\u0101va (8th century CE) and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (725\u2013788), who are considered the founders of Nyingma (\"The Ancient Ones)\", the oldest tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Padmasambhava, who is considered by the Tibetans as Guru Rinpoche (\"Precious Master\"), is also credited with building the first monastery building named \"Samye\" around the late 8th century. According to some legend, it is noted that he pacified the Bon demons and made them the core protectors of Dharma. Modern historians also argue that Trisong Detsen and his followers adopted Buddhism as an act of international diplomacy, especially with the major power of those times such as China, India, and states in Central Asia that had strong Buddhist influence in their culture.\nYeshe Tsogyal, the most important female in the Nyingma Vajrayana lineage, was a member of Trisong Detsen's court and became Padmasambhava's student before gaining enlightenment. Trisong Detsen also invited the Chan master Moheyan to transmit the Dharma at Samye Monastery. Some sources state that a debate ensued between Moheyan and the Indian master Kamala\u015b\u012bla, without consensus on the victor, and some scholars consider the event to be fictitious.\nEra of fragmentation (9th\u201310th centuries).\nA reversal in Buddhist influence began under King Langdarma (r. 836\u2013842), and his death was followed by the so-called \"Era of Fragmentation\", a period of disunity during the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed and civil wars ensued.\nIn spite of this loss of state power and patronage however, Buddhism survived and thrived in Tibet. According to Geoffrey Samuel this was because \"Tantric (Vajrayana) Buddhism came to provide the principal set of techniques by which Tibetans dealt with the dangerous powers of the spirit world [...] Buddhism, in the form of Vajrayana ritual, provided a critical set of techniques for dealing with everyday life. Tibetans came to see these techniques as vital for their survival and prosperity in this life.\" This includes dealing with the local gods and spirits (\"sadak\" and \"shipdak),\" which became a specialty of some Tibetan Buddhist lamas and ngagpas (\"mantrikas\", mantra specialists).\nSecond dissemination (10th\u201312th centuries).\nThe late 10th and 11th centuries saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet with the founding of \"New Translation\" (\"Sarma\") lineages as well as the appearance of \"hidden treasures\" (\"terma\") literature which reshaped the Nyingma tradition.\nIn 1042 the Bengali saint, Ati\u015ba (982\u20131054) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king and further aided dissemination of Buddhist values in Tibetan culture and in consequential affairs of state.\nHis erudition supported the translation of major Buddhist texts, which evolved into the canons of Bka'-'gyur (Translation of the Buddha Word) and Bstan-'gyur (Translation of Teachings). The \"Bka'-'gyur\" has six main categories: (1) Tantra, (2) Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101, (3) Ratnak\u016b\u1e6da S\u016btra, (4) Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra, (5) Other sutras, and (6) Vinaya. The \"Bstan-'gyur\" comprises 3,626 texts and 224 volumes on such things as hymns, commentaries and supplementary tantric material.\nAti\u015ba's chief disciple, Dromt\u00f6n founded the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, one of the first Sarma schools. The Sakya (\"Grey Earth\") school, was founded by Kh\u00f6n K\u00f6nchok Gyelpo (1034\u20131102), a disciple of the great scholar, Drogmi Sh\u0101kya. It is headed by the Sakya Trizin, and traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Vir\u016bpa.\nOther influential Indian teachers include Tilopa (988\u20131069) and his student N\u0101rop\u0101 (probably died ca. 1040). Their teachings, via their student Marpa, are the foundations of the Kagyu (\"Oral lineage\") tradition\",\" which focuses on the practices of Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 and the Six Dharmas of N\u0101rop\u0101. One of the most famous Kagyu figures was the hermit Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. The Dagpo Kagyu was founded by the monk Gampopa who merged Marpa's lineage teachings with the monastic Kadam tradition.\nAll the sub-schools of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism surviving today, including the Drikung Kagyu, the Drukpa Kagyu and the Karma Kagyu, are branches of the Dagpo Kagyu. The Karma Kagyu school is the largest of the Kagyu sub-schools and is headed by the Karmapa.\nMongol dominance (13th\u201314th centuries).\nTibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of Inner Asia, especially the Mongols, and Tibetan and Mongolian Buddhism influenced each other. This was done with the help of Kublai Khan and Mongolian theologians influenced by the Church of the East.\nThe Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240 and 1244. They eventually annexed Amdo and Kham and appointed the great scholar and abbot Sakya Pandita (1182\u20131251) as Viceroy of Central Tibet in 1249.\nIn this way, Tibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, with the Sakya hierarchy retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols retained structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. Tibetan Buddhism was adopted as the \"de facto\" state religion by the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368) of Kublai Khan.\nIt was also during this period that the Tibetan Buddhist canon was compiled, primarily led by the efforts of the scholar But\u00f6n Rinchen Drup (1290\u20131364). A part of this project included the carving of the canon into wood blocks for printing, and the first copies of these texts were kept at Narthang monastery.\nTibetan Buddhism in China was also syncretized with Chinese Buddhism and Chinese folk religion.\nFrom family rule to Ganden Phodrang government (14th\u201318th centuries).\nWith the decline and end of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Tibet regained independence and was ruled by successive local families from the 14th to the 17th century.\nJangchub Gyalts\u00e4n (1302\u20131364) became the strongest political family in the mid 14th century. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419) founded the Gelug school which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history. The Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the Gelug school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. The Ganden Tripa is an appointed office and not a reincarnation lineage. The position can be held by an individual for seven years and this has led to more Ganden Tripas than Dalai Lamas.\nInternal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions, led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.\nIn 1565, the Rinpungpa family was overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse, which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama's in the 1640s.\nIn China, Tibetan Buddhism continued to be patronized by the elites of the Ming Dynasty. According to David M. Robinson, during this era, Tibetan Buddhist monks \"conducted court rituals, enjoyed privileged status and gained access to the jealously guarded, private world of the emperors\". The Ming Yongle Emperor (r. 1402\u20131424) promoted the carving of printing blocks for the Kangyur, now known as \"the Yongle Kanjur\", and seen as an important edition of the collection.\nThe Ming Dynasty also supported the propagation of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia during this period. Tibetan Buddhist missionaries also helped spread the religion in Mongolia. It was during this era that Altan Khan the leader of the T\u00fcmed Mongols, converted to Buddhism, and allied with the Gelug school, conferring the title of Dalai Lama to Sonam Gyatso in 1578.\nDuring a Tibetan civil war in the 17th century, Sonam Choephel (1595\u20131657 CE), the chief regent of the 5th Dalai Lama, conquered and unified Tibet to establish the \"Ganden Phodrang\" government with the help of the G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut Mongols. The \"Ganden Phodrang\" and the successive Gelug tulku lineages of the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas maintained regional control of Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.\nQing rule (18th\u201320th centuries).\nThe Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912) established a Chinese rule over Tibet after a Qing expeditionary force defeated the Dzungars (who controlled Tibet) in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty supported Tibetan Buddhism, especially the Gelug sect, during most of their rule. The reign of the Qianlong Emperor (respected as the Emperor Manjushri) was the high mark for this promotion of Tibetan Buddhism in China, with the visit of the 6th Panchen Lama to Beijing, and the building of temples in the Tibetan style, such as Xumi Fushou Temple, the Puning Temple and Putuo Zongcheng Temple (modeled after the potala palace).\nThis period also saw the rise of the Rim\u00e9 movement, a 19th-century nonsectarian movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some Bon scholars. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, scholars such as Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820\u20131892) and Jamg\u00f6n Kongtr\u00fcl (1813\u20131899) compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. The Rim\u00e9 movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the \"Rinchen Terdzod\" and the \"Sheja Dz\u00f6\".\nDuring the Qing, Tibetan Buddhism also remained the major religion of the Mongols under Qing rule (1635\u20131912), as well as the state religion of the Kalmyk Khanate (1630\u20131771), the Dzungar Khanate (1634\u20131758) and the Khoshut Khanate (1642\u20131717).\n20th century.\nIn 1912, following the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Tibet became de facto independent under the 13th Dalai Lama government based in Lhasa, maintaining the current territory of what is now called the Tibetan Autonomous Region.\nDuring the Republic of China (1912\u20131949), the \"Chinese Tantric Buddhist Revival Movement\" () took place, and important figures such as Nenghai (, 1886\u20131967) and Master Fazun (, 1902\u20131980) promoted Tibetan Buddhism and translated Tibetan works into Chinese. This movement was severely damaged during the Cultural Revolution, however.\nAfter the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet was annexed by China in 1950. In 1959 the 14th Dalai Lama and a great number of clergy and citizenry fled the country, to settle in India and other neighbouring countries. The events of the Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376) saw religion as one of the main political targets of the Chinese Communist Party, and most of the several thousand temples and monasteries in Tibet were destroyed, with many monks and lamas imprisoned. During this time, private religious expression, as well as Tibetan cultural traditions, were suppressed. Much of the Tibetan textual heritage and institutions were destroyed, and monks and nuns were forced to disrobe.\nAfter 1980, under the leadership of Tulku Yanban Shire Jangtsen (Karma Rinpoche), Changlei Monastery was gradually rebuilt.\nOutside of Tibet, however, there has been a renewed interest in Tibetan Buddhism in places such as Nepal and Bhutan.\nMeanwhile, the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in the Western world was accomplished by many of the refugee Tibetan Lamas who escaped Tibet, such as Akong Rinpoche and Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa who in 1967 were founders of Kagyu Samye Ling the first Tibetan Buddhist Centre to be established in the West.\nAfter the liberalization policies in China during the 1980s, the religion began to recover with some temples and monasteries being reconstructed. Tibetan Buddhism is now an influential religion in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and overseas Chinese communities. However, the Chinese government retains strict control over Tibetan Buddhist Institutions in the PRC. Quotas on the number of monks and nuns are maintained, and their activities are closely supervised.\nWithin the Tibetan Autonomous Region, violence against Buddhists has been escalating since 2008. Widespread reports document the arrests and disappearances of nuns and monks, while the Chinese government classifies religious practices as \"gang crime\". Reports include the demolition of monasteries, forced disrobing, forced reeducation, and detentions of nuns and monks, especially those residing at Yarchen Gar's center, the most highly publicized.\n21st century.\nToday, Tibetan Buddhism is adhered to widely in the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, northern Nepal, Kalmykia (on the north-west shore of the Caspian), Siberia (Tuva and Buryatia), the Russian Far East and northeast China. It is the state religion of Bhutan. The Indian regions of Sikkim and Ladakh, both formerly independent kingdoms, are also home to significant Tibetan Buddhist populations, as are the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh (which includes Dharamshala and the district of Lahaul-Spiti), West Bengal (the hill stations of Darjeeling and Kalimpong) and Arunachal Pradesh. Religious communities, refugee centers and monasteries have also been established in South India.\nThe 14th Dalai Lama is the leader of the Tibetan government in exile which was initially dominated by the Gelug school, however, according to Geoffrey Samuel:The Dharamsala administration under the Dalai Lama has nevertheless managed, over time, to create a relatively inclusive and democratic structure that has received broad support across the Tibetan communities in exile. Senior figures from the three non-Gelukpa Buddhist schools and from the Bonpo have been included in the religious administration, and relations between the different lamas and schools are now on the whole very positive. This is a considerable achievement, since the relations between these groups were often competitive and conflict-ridden in Tibet before 1959, and mutual distrust was initially widespread. The Dalai Lama's government at Dharamsala has also continued under difficult circumstances to argue for a negotiated settlement rather than armed struggle with China.\nIn the wake of the Tibetan diaspora, Tibetan Buddhism has also gained adherents in the West and throughout the world. Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and centers were first established in Europe and North America in the 1960s, and most are now supported by non-Tibetan followers of Tibetan lamas. Some of these westerners went on to learn Tibetan, undertake extensive training in the traditional practices and have been recognized as lamas. Fully ordained Tibetan Buddhist Monks have also entered Western societies in other ways, such as working academia.\nSamuel sees the character of Tibetan Buddhism in the West as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...that of a national or international network, generally centred around the teachings of a single individual lama. Among the larger ones are the FPMT, which I have already mentioned, now headed by Lama Zopa and the child-reincarnation of Lama Yeshe; the New Kadampa, in origin a break-away from the FPMT; the Shambhala Buddhist network, deriving from Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa's organization and now headed by his son; and the networks associated with Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche (the Dzogchen Community) and Sogyal Rinpoche (Rigpa).\nTeachings.\nTibetan Buddhism upholds classic Buddhist teachings such as the four noble truths (Tib. \"pakp\u00e9 denpa shyi\"), anatman (not-self, \"bdag med\"), the five aggregates (\"phung po\") karma and rebirth, and dependent arising (\"rten cing \u2019brel bar \u2019byung ba\"). They also uphold various other Buddhist doctrines associated with Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism (\"theg pa chen po\") as well as the tantric Vajray\u0101na tradition.\nBuddhahood and Bodhisattvas.\nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na goal of spiritual development is to achieve the enlightenment of Buddhahood in order to help all other sentient beings attain this state. This motivation is called \"bodhicitta\" (mind of awakening)\u2014an altruistic intention to become enlightened for the sake of all sentient beings. \"Bodhisattvas\" (Tib. \"jangchup semba,\" literally \"awakening hero\") are revered beings who have conceived the will and vow to dedicate their lives with \"bodhicitta\" for the sake of all beings.\nWidely revered Bodhisattvas in Tibetan Buddhism include Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri, Vajrapani, and Tara. The most important Buddhas are the five Buddhas of the Vajradhatu mandala as well as the Adi Buddha (first Buddha), called either Vajradhara or Samantabhadra.\nBuddhahood is defined as a state free of the obstructions to liberation as well as those to omniscience (\"sarvaj\u00f1ana\"). When one is freed from all mental obscurations, one is said to attain a state of continuous bliss mixed with a simultaneous cognition of emptiness, the true nature of reality. In this state, all limitations on one's ability to help other living beings are removed. Tibetan Buddhism teaches methods for achieving Buddhahood more quickly (known as the Vajray\u0101na path).\nIt is said that there are countless beings who have attained Buddhahood. Buddhas spontaneously, naturally and continuously perform activities to benefit all sentient beings. However it is believed that one's \"karma\" could limit the ability of the Buddhas to help them. Thus, although Buddhas possess no limitation from their side on their ability to help others, sentient beings continue to experience suffering as a result of the limitations of their own former negative actions.\nAn important schema which is used in understanding the nature of Buddhahood in Tibetan Buddhism is the \"Trikaya\" (Three bodies) doctrine.\nThe Bodhisattva path.\nA central schema for spiritual advancement used in Tibetan Buddhism is that of the five paths (Skt. \"pa\u00f1cam\u0101rga\"; Tib. \"lam nga\") which are:\nThe schema of the five paths is often elaborated and merged with the concept of the \"bhumis\" or the bodhisattva levels.\nLamrim.\n\"Lamrim\" (\"stages of the path\") is a Tibetan Buddhist schema for presenting the stages of spiritual practice leading to liberation. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of \"lamrim\", presented by different teachers of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug schools (the Sakya school uses a different system named \"Lamdre\"). However, all versions of the \"lamrim\" are elaborations of Ati\u015ba's 11th-century root text \"A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment\" (\"Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa\").\nAtisha's \"lamrim\" system generally divides practitioners into those of \"lesser\", \"middling\" and \"superior\" scopes or attitudes:\nAlthough \"lamrim\" texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways and with different emphasis depending on the school and tradition it belongs to. Gampopa and Tsongkhapa expanded the short root-text of Ati\u015ba into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like karma, rebirth, Buddhist cosmology and the practice of meditation are gradually explained in logical order.\nVajray\u0101na.\nTibetan Buddhism incorporates Vajray\u0101na (\"Vajra vehicle\"), \"Secret Mantra\" (Skt. \"Guhyamantra\") or Buddhist Tantra, which is espoused in the texts known as the Buddhist Tantras (dating from around the 7th century CE onwards).\nTantra (Tib. \"rgyud\", \"continuum\") generally refers to forms of religious practice which emphasize the use of unique ideas, visualizations, mantras, and other practices for inner transformation. The Vajrayana is seen by most Tibetan adherents as the fastest and most powerful vehicle for enlightenment because it contains many skillful means (\"upaya\") and because it takes the effect (Buddhahood itself, or Buddha nature) as the path (and hence is sometimes known as the \"effect vehicle\", \"phalayana\").\nAn important element of Tantric practice are tantric deities and their mandalas. These deities come in peaceful (\"shiwa\") and fierce (\"trowo\") forms.\nTantric texts also generally affirm the use of sense pleasures and other defilements in Tantric ritual as a path to enlightenment, as opposed to non-Tantric Buddhism which affirms that one must renounce all sense pleasures. These practices are based on the theory of transformation which states that negative or sensual mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. As the \"Hevajra Tantra\" states:\nThose things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.\nAnother element of the Tantras is their use of transgressive practices, such as drinking taboo substances such as alcohol or sexual yoga. While in many cases these transgressions were interpreted only symbolically, in other cases they are practiced literally.\nPhilosophy.\nThe Indian Buddhist Madhyamaka (\"Middle Way\" or \"Centrism\") philosophy, also called \"\u015a\u016bnyav\u0101da\" (the emptiness doctrine) is the dominant Buddhist philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism. In Madhyamaka, the true nature of reality is referred to as \"\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101\", which is the fact that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence (\"svabhava\"). Madhyamaka is generally seen as the highest philosophical view by most Tibetan philosophers, but it is interpreted in numerous different ways.\nThe other main Mahayana philosophical school, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra has also been very influential in Tibetan Buddhism, but there is more disagreement among the various schools and philosophers regarding its status. While the Gelug school generally sees Yog\u0101c\u0101ra views as either false or provisional (i.e. only pertaining to conventional truth), philosophers in the other three main schools, such as Ju Mipham and Sakya Chokden, hold that Yog\u0101c\u0101ra ideas are as important as Madhyamaka views.\nIn Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism, Buddhist philosophy is traditionally propounded according to a hierarchical classification of four classical Indian philosophical schools, known as the \"four tenets\" (Tib. \"drubta shyi\", Sanskrit: siddh\u0101nta). While the classical tenets-system is limited to four tenets (Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, Sautr\u0101ntika, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, and Madhyamaka), there are further sub-classifications within these different tenets (see below). This classification does not include Theravada, the only surviving of the 18 classical schools of Buddhism. It also does not include other Indian Buddhist schools, such as Mahasamghika and Pudgalavada.\nTwo tenets belong to the path referred to as the Hinayana (\"lesser vehicle\") or Sravakayana (\"the disciples' vehicle\"), and are both related to the north Indian Sarvastivada tradition:\nThe other two tenets are the two major Indian Mahayana philosophies:\nThe tenet systems are used in monasteries and colleges to teach Buddhist philosophy in a systematic and progressive fashion, each philosophical view being seen as more subtle than its predecessor. Therefore, the four tenets can be seen as a gradual path from a rather easy-to-grasp, \"realistic\" philosophical point of view, to more and more complex and subtle views on the ultimate nature of reality, culminating in the philosophy of the M\u0101dhyamikas, which is widely believed to present the most sophisticated point of view. Non-Tibetan scholars point out that historically, Madhyamaka predates Yogacara, however.\nTexts and study.\nStudy of major Buddhist Indian texts is central to the monastic curriculum in all four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Memorization of classic texts as well as other ritual texts is expected as part of traditional monastic education. Another important part of higher religious education is the practice of formalized debate.\nThe canon was mostly finalized in the 13th century, and divided into two parts, the Kangyur (containing sutras and tantras) and the Tengyur (containing \"shastras\" and commentaries). The Nyingma school also maintains a separate collection of texts called the Nyingma Gyubum, assembled by Ratna Lingpa in the 15th century and revised by Jigme Lingpa.\nAmong Tibetans, the main language of study is classical Tibetan, however, the Tibetan Buddhist canon was also translated into other languages, such as Mongolian and Manchu.\nDuring the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, many texts from the Tibetan canon were also translated into Chinese.\nNumerous texts have also recently been translated into Western languages by Western academics and Buddhist practitioners.\nSutras.\nAmong the most widely studied sutras in Tibetan Buddhism are Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras such as the \"Perfection of Wisdom\" or \"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" sutras, and others such as the \"Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra,\" and the \"Sam\u0101dhir\u0101ja S\u016btra.\"\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, the two authoritative systems of Mahayana Philosophy (viz. that of Asa\u1e45ga \u2013 Yogacara and that of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna \u2013 Madhyamaka) are based on specific Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras: the \"Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana S\u016btra\" and the \"Questions of Ak\u1e63ayamati\" (\"Ak\u1e63ayamatinirde\u015ba S\u016btra\") respectively. Furthermore, according to Thupten Jinpa, for Tsongkhapa, \"at the heart of these two hermeneutical systems lies their interpretations of the Perfection of Wisdom s\u016btras, the archetypal example being the \"Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines\".\"\nTreatises of the Indian masters.\nThe study of Indian Buddhist treatises called \"shastras\" is central to Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism. Some of the most important works are those by the six great Indian Mahayana authors which are known as the Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones (Tib. \"gyen druk chok nyi\", Wyl. \"rgyan drug mchog gnyis\"), the six being: Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dignaga, and Dharmakirti and the two being: Gunaprabha and Shakyaprabha (or Nagarjuna and Asanga depending on the tradition).\nSince the late 11th century, traditional Tibetan monastic colleges generally organized the exoteric study of Buddhism into \"five great textual traditions\" (\"zhungchen-nga\"). \nOther important texts.\nAlso of great importance are the \"Five Treatises of Maitreya\" including the influential \"Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga\", a compendium of the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" literature, and the \"Mahayanasutralankara\", a text on the Mahayana path from the Yogacara perspective, which are often attributed to Asanga. Practiced focused texts such as the \"Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra\" and Kamala\u015b\u012bla's \"Bh\u0101van\u0101krama\" are the major sources for meditation.\nWhile the Indian texts are often central, original material by key Tibetan scholars is also widely studied and collected into editions called \"sungbum\". The commentaries and interpretations that are used to shed light on these texts differ according to tradition. The Gelug school for example, use the works of Tsongkhapa, while other schools may use the more recent work of Rim\u00e9 movement scholars like Jamgon Kongtrul and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso.\nA corpus of extra-canonical scripture, the treasure texts (\"terma\") literature is acknowledged by Nyingma practitioners, but the bulk of the canon that is not commentary was translated from Indian sources. True to its roots in the \"P\u0101la\" system of North India, however, Tibetan Buddhism carries on a tradition of eclectic accumulation and systematisation of diverse Buddhist elements, and pursues their synthesis. Prominent among these achievements have been the Stages of the Path and mind training literature, both stemming from teachings by the Indian scholar Ati\u015ba.\nTantric literature.\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the Buddhist Tantras are divided into four or six categories, with several sub-categories for the highest Tantras.\nIn the Nyingma, the division is into \"Outer Tantras\" (Kriyayoga, Charyayoga, Yogatantra); and \"Inner Tantras\" (Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga/Dzogchen), which correspond to the \"Anuttarayoga-tantra\". For the Nyingma school, important tantras include the \"Guhyagarbha Tantra\", the \"Guhyasamaja Tantra,\" the \"Kulayar\u0101ja Tantra\" and the 17 Dzogchen Tantras.\nIn the Sarma schools, the division is:\nThe root tantras themselves are almost unintelligible without the various Indian and Tibetan commentaries, therefore, they are never studied without the use of the tantric commentarial apparatus.\nTransmission and realization.\nThere is a long history of oral transmission of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by lineage holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of a mantra, for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in Asanga's visions of Maitreya.\nAn emphasis on oral transmission as more important than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them. Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha in the case of a \"sutra\" or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.\nPractices.\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, practices are generally classified as either Sutra (or \"P\u0101ramit\u0101y\u0101na\") or Tantra (\"Vajray\u0101na or Mantray\u0101na\"), though exactly what constitutes each category and what is included and excluded in each is a matter of debate and differs among the various lineages. According to Tsongkhapa for example, what separates Tantra from Sutra is the practice of Deity yoga. Furthermore, the adherents of the Nyingma school consider Dzogchen to be a separate and independent vehicle, which transcends both sutra and tantra.\nWhile it is generally held that the practices of Vajray\u0101na are not included in Sutray\u0101na, all Sutray\u0101na practices are common to Vajray\u0101na practice. Traditionally, Vajray\u0101na is held to be a more powerful and effective path, but potentially more difficult and dangerous and thus they should only be undertaken by the advanced who have established a solid basis in other practices.\nP\u0101ramit\u0101.\nThe \"p\u0101ramit\u0101s\" (perfections, transcendent virtues) is a key set of virtues which constitute the major practices of a bodhisattva in non-tantric Mahayana. They are:\nThe practice of \"d\u0101na\" (giving) while traditionally referring to offerings of food to the monastics can also refer to the ritual offering of bowls of water, incense, butter lamps and flowers to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on a shrine or household altar. Similar offerings are also given to other beings such as hungry ghosts, dakinis, protector deities, and local divinities.\nLike other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of the five precepts and bodhisattva vows is part of Tibetan Buddhist moral (\"sila\") practice. In addition to these, there are also numerous sets of Tantric vows, termed samaya, which are given as part of Tantric initiations.\nCompassion (\"karu\u1e47\u0101\") practices are also particularly important in Tibetan Buddhism. One of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the \"Bodhisattvacary\u0101vat\u0101ra\" by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled \"Meditative Concentration\", Shantideva describes meditation on Karun\u0101 as thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Strive at first to meditate upon the sameness of yourself and others. In joy and sorrow all are equal; Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself. The hand and other limbs are many and distinct, But all are one\u2014the body to kept and guarded. Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows, are, like me, all one in wanting happiness. This pain of mine does not afflict or cause discomfort to another's body, and yet this pain is hard for me to bear because I cling and take it for my own. And other beings' pain I do not feel, and yet, because I take them for myself, their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear. And therefore I'll dispel the pain of others, for it is simply pain, just like my own. And others I will aid and benefit, for they are living beings, like my body. Since I and other beings both, in wanting happiness, are equal and alike, what difference is there to distinguish us, that I should strive to have my bliss alone?\"\nA popular compassion meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is \"tonglen\" (sending and taking love and suffering respectively). Practices associated with Chenrezig (Avalokiteshvara), also tend to focus on compassion.\nSamatha and Vipa\u015byan\u0101.\nThe 14th Dalai Lama defines meditation (\"bsgom pa\") as \"familiarization of the mind with an object of meditation.\" Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhism follows the two main approaches to meditation or mental cultivation (\"bhavana\") taught in all forms of Buddhism, \u015bamatha (Tib. \"Shine\") and vipa\u015byan\u0101 (\"lhaktong\").\nThe practice of \u015bamatha (calm abiding) is one of focusing one's mind on a single object such as a Buddha figure or the breath. Through repeated practice one's mind gradually becomes more stable, calm and happy. It is defined by Takpo Tashi Namgyal as \"fixing the mind upon any object so as to maintain it without distraction...focusing the mind on an object and maintaining it in that state until finally it is channeled into one stream of attention and evenness.\" The nine mental abidings is the main progressive framework used for \u015bamatha in Tibetan Buddhism.\nOnce a meditator has reached the ninth level of this schema they achieve what is termed \"pliancy\" (Tib. \"shin tu sbyangs pa\", Skt. \"prasrabdhi\"), defined as \"a serviceability of mind and body such that the mind can be set on a virtuous object of observation as long as one likes; it has the function of removing all obstructions.\" This is also said to be very joyful and blissful for the body and the mind.\nThe other form of Buddhist meditation is vipa\u015byan\u0101 (clear seeing, higher insight), which in Tibetan Buddhism is generally practiced after having attained proficiency in \u015bamatha. This is generally seen as having two aspects, one of which is analytic meditation, which is based on contemplating and thinking rationally about ideas and concepts. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions. The other type of vipa\u015byan\u0101 is a non-analytical, \"simple\" yogic style called \"tr\u00f6meh\" in Tibetan, which means \"without complication\".\nA meditation routine may involve alternating sessions of vipa\u015byan\u0101 to achieve deeper levels of realization, and samatha to consolidate them.\nPreliminary practices.\nVajray\u0101na is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be the fastest method for attaining Buddhahood but for unqualified practitioners it can be dangerous. To engage in it one must receive an appropriate initiation (also known as an \"empowerment\") from a lama who is fully qualified to give it. The aim of preliminary practices (\"ng\u00f6ndro\") is to start the student on the correct path for such higher teachings. Just as Sutray\u0101na preceded Vajray\u0101na historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones.\nPreliminary practices include all \"Sutray\u0101na\" activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principal stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic bodhicitta wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without the basis of these three in particular to practice Vajray\u0101na can be like a small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.\nThe most widespread preliminary practices include: taking refuge, prostration, Vajrasattva meditation, mandala offerings and guru yoga. The merit acquired in the preliminary practices facilitates progress in Vajray\u0101na. While many Buddhists may spend a lifetime exclusively on sutra practices, an amalgam of the two to some degree is common. For example, in order to train in calm abiding, one might visualize a tantric deity.\nGuru yoga.\nAs in other Buddhist traditions, an attitude of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized. At the beginning of a public teaching, a \"lama\" will do prostrations to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources. By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.\nThere is a general sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a \"lama\". A student may have taken teachings from many authorities and revere them all as \"lamas\" in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru.\nOne particular feature of the Tantric view of teacher student relationship is that in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, one is instructed to regard one's guru as an awakened Buddha.\nEsotericism and vows.\nIn Vajray\u0101na particularly, Tibetan Buddhists subscribe to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated do not seek and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a mandala may be less public than that of a deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajray\u0101na is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.\nBuddhism has always had a taste for esotericism since its earliest period in India. Tibetans today maintain greater or lesser degrees of confidentiality also with information on the \"vinaya\" and emptiness specifically. In Buddhist teachings generally, too, there is caution about revealing information to people who may be unready for it.\nPracticing tantra also includes the maintaining of a separate set of vows, which are called \"Samaya (dam tshig)\". There are various lists of these and they may differ depending on the practice and one's lineage or individual guru. Upholding these vows is said to be essential for tantric practice and breaking them is said to cause great harm.\nRitual.\nThere has been a \"close association\" between the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the temporal in Tibet. The term for this relationship is \"chos srid zung 'brel.\" Traditionally Tibetan lamas have tended to the lay populace by helping them with issues such as protection and prosperity. Common traditions have been the various rites and rituals for mundane ends, such as purifying one's karma, avoiding harm from demonic forces and enemies, and promoting a successful harvest. Divination and exorcism are examples of practices a lama might use for this.\nRitual is generally more elaborate than in other forms of Buddhism, with complex altar arrangements and works of art (such as mandalas and thangkas), many ritual objects, hand gestures (\"mudra\"), chants, and musical instruments.\nA special kind of ritual called an initiation or empowerment (Sanskrit: \"Abhiseka\", Tibetan: \"Wangkur\") is central to Tantric practice. These rituals consecrate a practitioner into a particular Tantric practice associated with individual mandalas of deities and mantras. Without having gone through initiation, one is generally not allowed to practice the higher Tantras.\nAnother important ritual occasion in Tibetan Buddhism is that of mortuary rituals which are supposed to assure that one has a positive rebirth and a good spiritual path in the future. Of central importance to Tibetan Buddhist \"Ars moriendi\" is the idea of the bardo (Sanskrit: \"antar\u0101bhava\"), the intermediate or liminal state between life and death. Rituals and the readings of texts such as the \"Bardo Thodol\" are done to ensure that the dying person can navigate this intermediate state skillfully. Cremation and sky burial are traditionally the main funeral rites used to dispose of the body.\nMantra.\nThe use of (mainly Sanskrit) prayer formulas, incantations or phrases called mantras (Tibetan: \"sngags\") is another widespread feature of Tibetan Buddhist practice. So common is the use of mantras that Vajrayana is also sometimes called \"Mantray\u0101na\" (the mantra vehicle). Mantras are widely recited, chanted, written or inscribed, and visualized as part of different forms of meditation. Each mantra has symbolic meaning and will often have a connection to a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva. Each deity's mantra is seen as symbolizing the function, speech and power of the deity.\nTibetan Buddhist practitioners repeat mantras like Om Mani Padme Hum in order to train the mind, and transform their thoughts in line with the divine qualities of the mantra's deity and special power. Tibetan Buddhists see the etymology of the term mantra as meaning \"mind protector\", and mantras is seen as a way to guard the mind against negativity.\nAccording to Lama Zopa Rinpoche:Mantras are effective because they help keep your mind quiet and peaceful, automatically integrating it into one-pointedness. They make your mind receptive to very subtle vibrations and thereby heighten your perception. Their recitation eradicates gross negativities and the true nature of things can then be reflected in your mind's resulting clarity. By practising a transcendental mantra, you can in fact purify all the defiled energy of your body, speech, and mind.Mantras also serve to focus the mind as a samatha (calming) practice as well as a way to transform the mind through the symbolic meaning of the mantra. In Buddhism, it is important to have the proper intention, focus and faith when practicing mantras, if one does not, they will not work. Unlike in Hinduism, mantras are not believed to have inherent power of their own, and thus without the proper faith, intention and mental focus, they are just mere sounds. Thus according to the Tibetan philosopher Jamgon Ju Mipham:\nif a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like non-conceptual wish-fulfilling jewels. Infusing one's being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon reflected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon's reflection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one's being.\nMantras are part of the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism, such as Deity Yoga and are recited and visualized during tantric sadhanas. Thus, Tsongkhapa says that mantra \"protects the mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions\". This is because in Tibetan Buddhist Tantric praxis, one must develop a sense that everything is divine.\nTantric sadhana and yoga.\nIn what is called \"higher yoga tantra\" the emphasis is on various spiritual practices, called yogas (\"naljor\") and sadhanas (\"druptap\") which allow the practitioner to realize the true nature of reality.\n\"Deity Yoga\" (Tibetan: \"lha'i rnal 'byor\"; Sanskrit: \"Devata-yoga\") is a fundamental practice of Vajrayana Buddhism involving visualization of mental images consisting mainly of Buddhist deities such as Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and fierce deities, along mantra repetition. According to Geoffrey Samuel:If Buddhahood is a source of infinite potentiality accessible at any time, then the Tantric deities are in a sense partial aspects, refractions of that total potentiality. Visualizing one of these deities, or oneself identifying with one of them, is not, in Tibetan Tantric thought, a technique to worship an external entity. Rather, it is a way of accessing or tuning into something that is an intrinsic part of the structure of the universe\u2014as of course is the practitioner him or herself.Deity yoga involves two stages, the generation stage (\"utpattikrama\") and the completion stage (\"nispannakrama\"). In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity (\"yidam\"), its mandala and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality.\nIn the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization ultimate reality. Completion stage practices can also include subtle body energy practices, such as \"tummo\" (lit. \"Fierce Woman\", Skt. \"ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101l\u012b,\" inner fire), as well as other practices that can be found in systems such as the Six Yogas of Naropa (like Dream Yoga, Bardo Yoga and Phowa) and the Six Vajra-yogas of Kalacakra.\nDzogchen and Mahamudra.\nAnother form of high level Tibetan Buddhist practice are the meditations associated with the traditions of Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 (\"Great Seal\") and Dzogchen (\"Great Perfection\"). These traditions focus on direct experience of the very nature of reality, which is variously termed \"dharmakaya\", buddha nature, or the \"basis' (\"gzhi\"). These techniques do not rely on deity yoga methods but on direct pointing-out instruction from a master and are often seen as the most advanced form of Buddhist practice. The instructions associated with these approaches to meditation and realization are collectively referred to as mind teachings since both provide practical guidance on the \"recognition of the nature of mind.\"\nThe views and practices associated with Dzogchen and Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 are also often seen as the culmination of the Buddhist path. In some traditions, they are seen as a separate vehicle to liberation. In the Nyingma school (as well as in Bon), Dzogchen is considered to be a separate and independent vehicle (also called Atiyoga), as well as the highest of all vehicles. Similarly, in Kagyu, Mah\u0101mudr\u0101 is sometimes seen as a separate vehicle, the \"Sahajayana\" (Tibetan: \"lhen chig kye pa\"), also known as the vehicle of self-liberation.\nInstitutions and clergy.\nBuddhist monasticism is an important part of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, all the major and minor schools maintain large monastic institutions based on the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya (monastic rule) and many religious leaders come from the monastic community. That being said, there are also many religious leaders or teachers (called \"Lamas\" and \"Gurus\") which are not celibate monastics. According to Geoffrey Samuel this is where \"religious leadership in Tibetan Buddhism contrasts most strongly with much of the rest of the Buddhist world.\"\nAccording to Namkhai Norbu, in Tibet, Tibetan lamas had four main types of lifestyles:\nthose who were monks, living in monasteries; those who lived a lay life, with their homes in villages; lay masters who lived as tent-dwelling nomads, travelling with their disciples, in some cases following their herds; and those who were yogis, often living in caves.\nLamas are generally skilled and experienced tantric practitioners and ritual specialists in a specific initiation lineage and may be laypersons or monastics. They act not just as teachers, but as spiritual guides and guardians of the lineage teachings that they have received through a long and intimate process of apprenticeship with their Lamas.\nTibetan Buddhism also includes a number of lay clergy and lay tantric specialists, such as \"Ngagpas\" (Skt. \"mantr\u012b\"), \"Gomchens\", \"Serkyims\", and \"Ch\u00f6dpas\" (practitioners of Ch\u00f6d). According to Samuel, in the more remote parts of the Himalayas, communities were often led by lay religious specialists. Thus, while the large monastic institutions were present in the regions of the Tibetan plateau which were more centralized politically, in other regions they were absent and instead smaller \"gompas\" and more lay oriented communities prevailed.\nSamuel outlines four main types of religious communities in Tibet:\nIn some cases a lama is the leader of a spiritual community. Some lamas gain their title through being part of particular family which maintains a lineage of hereditary lamas (and are thus often laypersons). One example is the Sakya family of Kon, who founded the Sakya school and another is the hereditary lamas of Mindrolling monastery.\nIn other cases, lamas may be seen as \"t\u00fclkus\" (\"incarnations\"). T\u00fclkus are figures which are recognized as reincarnations of a particular bodhisattva or a previous religious figure. They are often recognized from a young age through the use of divination and the use of the possessions of the deceased lama, and therefore are able to receive extensive training. They are sometimes groomed to become leaders of monastic institutions. Examples include the Dalai Lamas and the Karmapas, each of which are seen as key leaders in their respective traditions.\nThe system of incarnate lamas is popularly held to be a Tibetan alteration to Indian Buddhism.\nAnother title unique to Tibetan Buddhism is that of Tert\u00f6n (treasure discoverer), who are considered capable of revealing or discovering special revelations or texts called Termas (lit.\u2009'hidden treasure'). They are also associated with the idea of \"beyul\" (\"hidden valleys\"), which are power places associated with deities and hidden religious treasures.\nTibetan teachers, including the Dalai Lamas, occasionally consult oracles for advice.\nWomen in Tibetan Buddhism.\nWomen in Tibetan society, though still unequal, tended to have a relatively greater autonomy and power than in surrounding societies. This might be because of the smaller household sizes and low population density in Tibet. Women traditionally took many roles in Tibetan Buddhism, from lay supporters, to monastics, lamas and tantric practitioners.\nThere is evidence for the importance of female practitioners in Indian Tantric Buddhism and pre-modern Tibetan Buddhism. At least one major lineage of tantric teachings, the Shangpa Kagyu, traces itself to Indian female teachers and there have been a series of important female Tibetan teachers, such as Yeshe Tsogyal and Machig Labdr\u00f6n. It seems that even though it might have been more difficult for women to become serious tantric yoginis, it was still possible for them to find lamas that would teach them high tantric practices.\nSome Tibetan women become lamas by being born in one of the hereditary lama families such as Mindrolling Jets\u00fcn Khandro Rinpoche and Sakya Jets\u00fcn Kushok Chimey Luding. There have also been cases of influential female lamas who were also tert\u00f6ns, such as Sera Khandro, Tare Lhamo and Ayu Khandro.\nSome of these figures were also tantric consorts (\"sangyum, kandroma\") with male lamas, and thus took part in the sexual practices associated with the highest levels of tantric practice.\nEastern nuns.\nWhile monasticism is practiced there by women, it is much less common (2 percent of the population in the 20th century compared to 12 percent of men). Nuns were also much less respected by Tibetan society than monks and may receive less lay support than male monastics.\nTraditionally, Tibetan Buddhist nuns were also not \"fully ordained\" as bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs (who take the full set of monastic vows in the Vinaya). When Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet. Despite an absence of ordination there, bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs did travel to Tibet. A notable example was the Sri Lankan nun Candram\u0101l\u012b, whose work with \u015ar\u012bj\u00f1\u0101na ( Wylie: \"dpal ye shes\") resulted in the tantric text \"\u015ar\u012bcandram\u0101la Tantrar\u0101ja\".\nThere are accounts of fully ordained Tibetan women, such as the Samding Dorje Phagmo (1422\u20131455), who was once ranked the highest female master and tulku in Tibet, but very little is known about the exact circumstances of their ordination.\nIn the modern era, Tibetan Buddhist nuns have taken full ordinations through East Asian Vinaya lineages. The Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination. The official lineage of Tibetan Buddhist bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs recommenced on 23 June 2022 in Bhutan when 144 nuns, most of them Butanese, were fully ordained.\nWestern nuns and lamas.\nBuddhist author Michaela Haas notes that Tibetan Buddhism is undergoing a sea change in the West, with women playing a much more central role.\nFreda Bedi was a British woman who was the first Western woman to take ordination in Tibetan Buddhism, which occurred in 1966. Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n was the first American woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\nIn 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in America, Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont, was officially consecrated. It offers novice ordination and follows the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism. The abbot of the Vajra Dakini nunnery is Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, who is the first bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b in the Drikung lineage of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004. The Vajra Dakini Nunnery does not follow The Eight Garudhammas.\nIn April 2011, the Institute for Buddhist Dialectical Studies (IBD) in Dharamsala, India, conferred the degree of geshe, a Tibetan Buddhist academic degree for monastics, on Kelsang Wangmo, a German nun, thus making her the world's first female geshe. In 2013 Tibetan women were able to take the geshe exams for the first time. In 2016 twenty Tibetan Buddhist nuns became the first Tibetan women to earn geshe degrees.\nJetsunma Ahkon Lhamo gained international attention in the late 1980s as the first Western woman to be a Penor Rinpoche enthroned tulku within the Nyingma Palyul.\nMajor lineages.\nThe Tibetan Rime (non-sectarian) scholar Jamgon Kongtrul, in his \"Treasury of Knowledge,\" outlines the \"Eight Great Practice Lineages\" which were transmitted to Tibet. His approach is not concerned with \"schools\" or sects, but rather focuses on the transmission of crucial meditation teachings. They are:\nTibetan Buddhist schools.\nThere are various schools or traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. The four main traditions overlap markedly, such that \"about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same\". Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha. On questions of philosophy, there has historically been disagreement regarding the nature of Yogacara and Buddha-nature teachings (and whether these are of expedient meaning or ultimate meaning), which still colours the current presentations of \"sunyata\" (emptiness) and ultimate reality.\nThe 19th century Rim\u00e9 movement downplayed these differences, as still reflected in the stance of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who states that there are no fundamental differences between these schools. However, there are still philosophical disagreements between the different traditions, such as the debate regarding rangtong and shentong interpretations of Madhyamaka philosophy.\nThe four major schools are sometimes divided into the Nyingma (or \"Old Translation\") and Sarma (or \"New Translation\") traditions, which follow different canons of scripture (the Nyingma Gyubum along with Termas and the Tengyur-Kangyur respectively).\nEach school also traces itself to a certain lineage going back to India as well as certain important Tibetan founders. While all the schools share most practices and methods, each school tends to have a certain preferred focus (see table below). Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and Red Hat (non-Gelug) sects.\nThe features of each major school (along with one influential minor school, Jonang) is as follows:\nIn his work, \"The Four Dharma Traditions of the Land of Tibet\", Mipham Rinpoche described the four main schools as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is another minor sect, the Bodong school. This tradition was founded in 1049 by the Kadam teacher Mudra Chenpo, who also established the Bodong E Monastery. Its most famous teacher was Bodong Penchen L\u00e9nam Gyelchok (1376\u20131451) who authored over one hundred and thirty-five volumes. This tradition is also known for maintaining a female tulku lineage of incarnated lamas called the Samding Dorje Phagmo.\nWhile Yungdrung Bon considers itself a separate religion with pre-Buddhist origins, and it is considered as non-Buddhist by the main Tibetan traditions, it shares so many similarities and practices with mainstream Tibetan Buddhism that some scholars such as Geoffrey Samuel see it as \"essentially a variant of Tibetan Buddhism\". Yungdrung Bon is closely related to Nyingma Buddhism, and includes Dzogchen teachings, similar deities, rituals and forms of monasticism.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage as a result of the Seebeck effect, and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are widely used as temperature sensors.\nCommercial thermocouples are inexpensive, interchangeable, are supplied with standard connectors, and can measure a wide range of temperatures. In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, thermocouples are self-powered and require no external form of excitation. The main limitation with thermocouples is accuracy; system errors of less than one degree Celsius (\u00b0C) can be difficult to achieve.\nThermocouples are widely used in science and industry. Applications include temperature measurement for kilns, gas turbine exhaust, diesel engines, and other industrial processes. Thermocouples are also used in homes, offices and businesses as the temperature sensors in thermostats, and also as flame sensors in safety devices for gas-powered appliances.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrinciple of operation.\nIn 1821, the German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck discovered that a magnetic needle held near a circuit made up of two dissimilar metals got deflected when one of the dissimilar metal junctions was heated. At the time, Seebeck referred to this consequence as thermo-magnetism. The magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use, the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures. The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire being used. Generally, the voltage is in the microvolt range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement. Although very little current flows, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction. Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a thermopile, is common.\nThe standard configuration of a thermocouple is shown in the figure. The dissimilar conductors contact at the measuring (aka hot) junction and at the reference (aka cold) junction. The thermocouple is connected to the electrical system at its reference junction. The figure shows the measuring junction on the left, the reference junction in the middle and represents the rest of the electrical system as a voltage meter on the right.\nThe temperature \"T\"sense is obtained via \na characteristic function \"E\"(\"T\") for the type of thermocouple which requires inputs: measured voltage \"V\" and reference junction temperature \"T\"ref. The solution to the equation \"E\"(\"T\"sense) = \"V\" + \"E\"(\"T\"ref) yields \"T\"sense. Sometimes these details are hidden inside a device that packages the reference junction block (with \"T\"ref thermometer), voltmeter, and equation solver.\nSeebeck effect.\nThe Seebeck effect refers to the development of an electromotive force across two points of an electrically conducting material when there is a temperature difference between those two points.\nUnder open-circuit conditions where there is no internal current flow, the gradient of voltage (formula_1) is directly proportional to the gradient in temperature (formula_2):\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is a temperature-dependent material property known as the Seebeck coefficient.\nThe standard measurement configuration shown in the figure shows four temperature regions and thus four voltage contributions:\nThe first and fourth contributions cancel out exactly, because these regions involve the same temperature change and an identical material.\nAs a result, formula_5 does not influence the measured voltage.\nThe second and third contributions do not cancel, as they involve different materials.\nThe measured voltage turns out to be\nformula_14\nwhere formula_15 and formula_16 are the Seebeck coefficients of the conductors attached to the positive and negative terminals of the voltmeter, respectively (chromel and alumel in the figure).\nCharacteristic function.\nThe thermocouple's behaviour is captured by a characteristic function formula_17, which needs only to be consulted at two arguments:\nformula_18\nIn terms of the Seebeck coefficients, the characteristic function is defined by\nformula_19\nThe constant of integration in this indefinite integral has no significance, but is conventionally chosen such that formula_20.\nThermocouple manufacturers and metrology standards organizations such as NIST provide tables of the function formula_17 that have been measured and interpolated over a range of temperatures, for particular thermocouple types (see \"External links\" section for access to these tables).\nReference junction.\nTo obtain the desired measurement of formula_8, it is not sufficient to just measure formula_23.\nThe temperature at the reference junctions formula_6 must also be known.\nTwo strategies are often used here:\nIn both cases the value formula_26 is calculated, then the function formula_17 is searched for a matching value. The argument where this match occurs is the value of formula_8:\nformula_29.\nPractical concerns.\nThermocouples ideally should be very simple measurement devices, with each type being characterized by a precise formula_17 curve, independent of any other details.\nIn reality, thermocouples are affected by issues such as alloy manufacturing uncertainties, aging effects, and circuit design mistakes/misunderstandings.\nCircuit construction.\nA common error in thermocouple construction is related to cold junction compensation. If an error is made on the estimation of formula_31, an error will appear in the temperature measurement. For the simplest measurements, thermocouple wires are connected to copper far away from the hot or cold point whose temperature is measured; this reference junction is then assumed to be at room temperature, but that temperature can vary. Because of the nonlinearity in the thermocouple voltage curve, the errors in formula_31 and formula_33 are generally unequal values. Some thermocouples, such as Type B, have a relatively flat voltage curve near room temperature, meaning that a large uncertainty in a room-temperature formula_31 translates to only a small error in formula_33.\nJunctions should be made in a reliable manner, but there are many possible approaches to accomplish this.\nFor low temperatures, junctions can be brazed or soldered; however, it may be difficult to find a suitable flux and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.\nReference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with screw terminal blocks.\nFor high temperatures, the most common approach is the spot weld or crimp using a durable material.\nOne common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added EMFs.\nThis may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction. In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature; therefore, no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.\nA thermocouple produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise measurements of this signal require an amplifier with low input offset voltage and with care taken to avoid thermal EMFs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.\nMetallurgical grades.\nWhile a thermocouple wire type is often described by its chemical composition, the actual aim is to produce a pair of wires that follow a standardized formula_17 curve.\nImpurities affect each batch of metal differently, producing variable Seebeck coefficients.\nTo match the standard behaviour, thermocouple wire manufacturers will deliberately mix in additional impurities to \"dope\" the alloy, compensating for uncontrolled variations in source material.\nAs a result, there are standard and specialized grades of thermocouple wire, depending on the level of precision demanded in the thermocouple behaviour.\nPrecision grades may only be available in matched pairs, where one wire is modified to compensate for deficiencies in the other wire.\nA special case of thermocouple wire is known as \"extension grade\", designed to carry the thermoelectric circuit over a longer distance.\nExtension wires follow the stated formula_17 curve but for various reasons they are not designed to be used in extreme environments and so they cannot be used at the sensing junction in some applications.\nFor example, an extension wire may be in a different form, such as highly flexible with stranded construction and plastic insulation, or be part of a multi-wire cable for carrying many thermocouple circuits.\nWith expensive noble metal thermocouples, the extension wires may even be made of a completely different, cheaper material that mimics the standard type over a reduced temperature range.\nAging.\nThermocouples are often used at high temperatures and in reactive furnace atmospheres. In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by thermocouple aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a thermocouple that is used to measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the thermocouple circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage will differ, resulting in error.\nAged thermocouples are only partly modified; for example, being unaffected in the parts outside the furnace. For this reason, aged thermocouples cannot be taken out of their installed location and recalibrated in a bath or test furnace to determine error. This also explains why error can sometimes be observed when an aged thermocouple is pulled partly out of a furnace\u2014as the sensor is pulled back, aged sections may see exposure to increased temperature gradients from hot to cold as the aged section now passes through the cooler refractory area, contributing significant error to the measurement. Likewise, an aged thermocouple that is pushed deeper into the furnace might sometimes provide a more accurate reading if being pushed further into the furnace causes the temperature gradient to occur only in a fresh section.\nTypes.\nCertain combinations of alloys have become popular as industry standards. Selection of the combination is driven by cost, availability, convenience, melting point, chemical properties, stability, and output. Different types are best suited for different applications. They are usually selected on the basis of the temperature range and sensitivity needed. Thermocouples with low sensitivities (B, R, and S types) have correspondingly lower resolutions. Other selection criteria include the chemical inertness of the thermocouple material and whether it is magnetic or not. Standard thermocouple types are listed below with the positive electrode (assuming formula_38) first, followed by the negative electrode.\nNickel-alloy thermocouples.\nType E.\nType E (chromel\u2013constantan) has a high output (68\u00a0\u03bcV/\u00b0C), which makes it well suited to cryogenic use. Additionally, it is non-magnetic.\nWide range is \u2212270\u00a0\u00b0C to +740\u00a0\u00b0C\nand narrow range is \u2212110\u00a0\u00b0C to +140\u00a0\u00b0C.\nType J.\nType J (iron\u2013constantan) has a more restricted range (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +1200\u00a0\u00b0C) than type K but higher sensitivity of about 50\u00a0\u03bcV/\u00b0C. The Curie point of the iron (770\u00a0\u00b0C) causes a smooth change in the characteristic, which determines the upper-temperature limit. Note, the European/German Type L is a variant of the type J, with a different specification for the EMF output (reference DIN 43712:1985-01).\nThe positive wire is made of hard iron, while the negative wire consists of softer copper-nickel. Due to its iron content, the J-type is slightly heavier and the positive wire is magnetic. It is highly vulnerable to corrosion in reducing atmospheres, which can lead to significant degradation of the thermocouple's performance.\nType K.\nType K (chromel\u2013alumel) is the most common general-purpose thermocouple with a sensitivity of approximately 41\u00a0\u03bcV/\u00b0C. It is inexpensive, and a wide variety of probes are available in its \u2212200\u00a0\u00b0C to +1350\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212330\u00a0\u00b0F to +2460\u00a0\u00b0F) range. Type K was specified at a time when metallurgy was less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may vary considerably between samples. One of the constituent metals, nickel, is magnetic; a characteristic of thermocouples made with magnetic material is that they undergo a deviation in output when the material reaches its Curie point, which occurs for type K thermocouples at around 150\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThey operate very well in oxidizing atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen with a small amount of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as \"green rot\", due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).\nHydrogen in the atmosphere is the usual cause of green rot. At high temperatures, it can diffuse through solid metals or an intact metal thermowell. Even a sheath of magnesium oxide insulating the thermocouple will not keep the hydrogen out.\nGreen rot does not occur in atmospheres sufficiently rich in oxygen, or oxygen-free. A sealed thermowell can be filled with inert gas, or an oxygen scavenger (e.g. a sacrificial titanium wire) can be added. Alternatively, additional oxygen can be introduced into the thermowell. Another option is using a different thermocouple type for the low-oxygen atmospheres where green rot can occur; a type N thermocouple is a suitable alternative.\nType M.\nType M (82%Ni/18%Mo\u201399.2%Ni/0.8%Co, by weight) are used in vacuum furnaces for the same reasons as with type C (described below). Upper temperature is limited to 1400\u00a0\u00b0C. It is less commonly used than other types.\nType N.\nType N (Nicrosil\u2013Nisil) thermocouples are suitable for use between \u2212270\u00a0\u00b0C and +1300\u00a0\u00b0C, owing to its stability and oxidation resistance. Sensitivity is about 39\u00a0\u03bcV/\u00b0C at 900\u00a0\u00b0C, slightly lower compared to type K.\nDesigned at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) of Australia, by Noel A. Burley, type-N thermocouples overcome the three principal characteristic types and causes of thermoelectric instability in the standard base-metal thermoelement materials:\nThe Nicrosil and Nisil thermocouple alloys show greatly enhanced thermoelectric stability relative to the other standard base-metal thermocouple alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the thermoelectric instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially oxidize to form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.\nType N thermocouples are suitable alternative to type K for low-oxygen conditions where type K is prone to green rot. They are suitable for use in vacuum, inert atmospheres, oxidizing atmospheres, or dry reducing atmospheres. They do not tolerate the presence of sulfur.\nType T.\nType T (copper\u2013constantan) thermocouples are suited for measurements in the \u2212200 to 350\u00a0\u00b0C range. Often used as a differential measurement, since only copper wire touches the probes. Since both conductors are non-magnetic, there is no Curie point and thus no abrupt change in characteristics. Type-T thermocouples have a sensitivity of about 43\u00a0\u03bcV/\u00b0C. Note that copper has a much higher thermal conductivity than the alloys generally used in thermocouple constructions, and so it is necessary to exercise extra care with thermally anchoring type-T thermocouples. A similar composition is found in the obsolete Type U in the German specification DIN 43712:1985-01.\nPlatinum/rhodium-alloy thermocouples.\nTypes B, R, and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinum/rhodium alloy for each conductor. These are among the most stable thermocouples, but have lower sensitivity than other types, approximately 10\u00a0\u03bcV/\u00b0C. Type B, R, and S thermocouples are usually used only for high-temperature measurements due to their high cost and low sensitivity. For type R and S thermocouples, HTX platinum wire can be used in place of the pure platinum leg to strengthen the thermocouple and prevent failures from grain growth that can occur in high temperature and harsh conditions.\nType B.\nType B (70%Pt/30%Rh\u201394%Pt/6%Rh, by weight) thermocouples are suited for use at up to 1800\u00a0\u00b0C. Type-B thermocouples produce the same output at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 42\u00a0\u00b0C, limiting their use below about 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The emf function has a minimum around 21\u00a0\u00b0C (for 21.020262\u00a0\u00b0C emf=-2.584972 \u03bcV), meaning that cold-junction compensation is easily performed, since the compensation voltage is essentially a constant for a reference at typical room temperatures.\nType R.\nType R (87%Pt/13%Rh\u2013Pt, by weight) thermocouples are used 0 to 1600\u00a0\u00b0C. Type R Thermocouples are quite stable and capable of long operating life when used in clean, favorable conditions. When used above 1100\u00a0\u00b0C ( 2000\u00a0\u00b0F), these thermocouples must be protected from exposure to metallic and non-metallic vapors. Type R is not suitable for direct insertion into metallic protecting tubes. Long term high temperature exposure causes grain growth which can lead to mechanical failure and a negative calibration drift caused by Rhodium diffusion to pure platinum leg as well as from Rhodium volatilization. This type has the same uses as type S, but is not interchangeable with it.\nType S.\nType S (90%Pt/10%Rh\u2013Pt, by weight) thermocouples, similar to type R, are used up to 1600\u00a0\u00b0C. Before the introduction of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), precision type-S thermocouples were used as the practical standard thermometers for the range of 630\u00a0\u00b0C to 1064\u00a0\u00b0C, based on an interpolation between the freezing points of antimony, silver, and gold. Starting with ITS-90, platinum resistance thermometers have taken over this range as standard thermometers.\nTungsten/rhenium-alloy thermocouples.\nThese thermocouples are well-suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. Typical uses are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as vacuum furnaces. They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of embrittlement. A typical range is 0 to 2315\u00a0\u00b0C, which can be extended to 2760\u00a0\u00b0C in inert atmosphere and to 3000\u00a0\u00b0C for brief measurements.\nPure tungsten at high temperatures undergoes recrystallization and becomes brittle. Therefore, types C and D are preferred over type G in some applications.\nIn presence of water vapor at high temperature, tungsten reacts to form tungsten(VI) oxide, which volatilizes away, and hydrogen. Hydrogen then reacts with tungsten oxide, after which water is formed again. Such a \"water cycle\" can lead to erosion of the thermocouple and eventual failure. In high temperature vacuum applications, it is therefore desirable to avoid the presence of traces of water.\nAn alternative to tungsten/rhenium is tungsten/molybdenum, but the voltage\u2013temperature response is weaker and has minimum at around 1000\u00a0K.\nThe thermocouple temperature is limited also by other materials used. For example beryllium oxide, a popular material for high temperature applications, tends to gain conductivity with temperature; a particular configuration of sensor had the insulation resistance dropping from a megaohm at 1000\u00a0K to 200 ohms at 2200\u00a0K. At high temperatures, the materials undergo chemical reaction. At 2700\u00a0K beryllium oxide slightly reacts with tungsten, tungsten-rhenium alloy, and tantalum; at 2600\u00a0K molybdenum reacts with BeO, tungsten does not react. BeO begins melting at about 2820\u00a0K, magnesium oxide at about 3020\u00a0K.\nType C.\n(95%W/5%Re\u201374%W/26%Re, by weight) maximum temperature will be measured by type-c thermocouple is 2329\u00a0\u00b0C.\nOthers.\nChromel\u2013gold/iron-alloy thermocouples.\nIn these thermocouples (chromel\u2013gold/iron alloy), the negative wire is gold with a small fraction (0.03\u20130.15 atom percent) of iron. The impure gold wire gives the thermocouple a high sensitivity at low temperatures (compared to other thermocouples at that temperature), whereas the chromel wire maintains the sensitivity near room temperature. It can be used for cryogenic applications (1.2\u2013300 K and even up to 600 K). Both the sensitivity and the temperature range depend on the iron concentration. The sensitivity is typically around 15 \u03bcV/K at low temperatures, and the lowest usable temperature varies between 1.2 and 4.2 K.\nType P (noble-metal alloy) or \"Platinel II\".\nType P (55%Pd/31%Pt/14%Au\u201365%Au/35%Pd, by weight) thermocouples give a thermoelectric voltage that mimics the type K over the range 500\u00a0\u00b0C to 1400\u00a0\u00b0C, however they are constructed purely of noble metals and so shows enhanced corrosion resistance. This combination is also known as Platinel II.\nPlatinum/molybdenum-alloy thermocouples.\nThermocouples of platinum/molybdenum-alloy (95%Pt/5%Mo\u201399.9%Pt/0.1%Mo, by weight) are sometimes used in nuclear reactors, since they show a low drift from nuclear transmutation induced by neutron irradiation, compared to the platinum/rhodium-alloy types.\nIridium/rhodium alloy thermocouples.\nThe use of two wires of iridium/rhodium alloys can provide a thermocouple that can be used up to about 2000\u00a0\u00b0C in inert atmospheres.\nPure noble-metal thermocouples Au\u2013Pt, Pt\u2013Pd.\nThermocouples made from two different, high-purity noble metals can show high accuracy even when uncalibrated, as well as low levels of drift. Two combinations in use are gold\u2013platinum and platinum\u2013palladium. Their main limitations are the low melting points of the metals involved (1064\u00a0\u00b0C for gold and 1555\u00a0\u00b0C for palladium). These thermocouples tend to be more accurate than type S, and due to their economy and simplicity are even regarded as competitive alternatives to the platinum resistance thermometers that are normally used as standard thermometers.\nHTIR-TC (High Temperature Irradiation Resistant) thermocouples.\nHTIR-TC offers a breakthrough in measuring high-temperature processes. Its characteristics are: durable and reliable at high temperatures, up to at least 1700\u00a0\u00b0C; resistant to irradiation; moderately priced; available in a variety of configurations - adaptable to each application; easily installed. Originally developed for use in nuclear test reactors, HTIR-TC may enhance the safety of operations in future reactors. This thermocouple was developed by researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).\nComparison of types.\nThe table below describes properties of several different thermocouple types. Within the tolerance columns, \"T\" represents the temperature of the hot junction, in degrees Celsius. For example, a thermocouple with a tolerance of \u00b10.0025\u00d7\"T\" would have a tolerance of \u00b12.5\u00a0\u00b0C at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. \nEach cell in the Color Code columns depicts the end of a thermocouple cable, showing the jacket color and the color of the individual leads. The background color represents the color of the connector body.\nThermocouple insulation.\nWires insulation.\nThe wires that make up the thermocouple must be insulated from each other everywhere, except at the sensing junction. Any additional electrical contact between the wires, or contact of a wire to other conductive objects, can modify the voltage and give a false reading of temperature.\nPlastics are suitable insulators for low temperatures parts of a thermocouple, whereas ceramic insulation can be used up to around 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. Other concerns (abrasion and chemical resistance) also affect the suitability of materials.\nWhen wire insulation disintegrates, it can result in an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple is used in the closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.\nTable of insulation materials.\nTemperature ratings for insulations may vary based on what the overall thermocouple construction cable consists of.\nNote: T300 is a new high-temperature material that was recently approved by UL for 300\u00a0\u00b0C operating temperatures.\nApplications.\nThermocouples are suitable for measuring over a large temperature range, from \u2212270 up to 3000\u00a0\u00b0C (for a short time, in inert atmosphere). Applications include temperature measurement for kilns, gas turbine exhaust, diesel engines, other industrial processes and fog machines. They are less suitable for applications where smaller temperature differences need to be measured with high accuracy, for example the range 0\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C with 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C accuracy. For such applications thermistors, silicon bandgap temperature sensors and resistance thermometers are more suitable.\nSteel industry.\nType B, S, R and K thermocouples are used extensively in the steel and iron industries to monitor temperatures and chemistry throughout the steel making process. Disposable, immersible, type S thermocouples are regularly used in the electric arc furnace process to accurately measure the temperature of steel before tapping. The cooling curve of a small steel sample can be analyzed and used to estimate the carbon content of molten steel.\nGas appliance safety.\nMany gas-fed heating appliances such as ovens and water heaters make use of a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple is placed in the pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.\nWhere the probe may be easily placed above the flame, a rectifying sensor may often be used instead. With part ceramic construction, they may also be known as flame rods, flame sensors or flame detection electrodes.\nSome combined main burner and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to within the range of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10\u201312 mV, 0.2\u20130.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the \"press and hold for x minutes\" in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.\nSome systems, known as millivolt control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both open and close the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed to ensure that the main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.\nOut of concern about energy wasted by the standing pilot flame, designers of many newer appliances have switched to an electronically controlled pilot-less ignition, also called intermittent ignition. With no standing pilot flame, there is no risk of gas buildup should the flame go out, so these appliances do not need thermocouple-based pilot safety switches. As these designs lose the benefit of operation without a continuous source of electricity, standing pilots are still used in some appliances. The exception is later model instantaneous (aka \"tankless\") water heaters that use the flow of water to generate the current required to ignite the gas burner; these designs also use a thermocouple as a safety cut-off device in the event the gas fails to ignite, or if the flame is extinguished.\nThermopile radiation sensors.\nThermopiles are used for measuring the intensity of incident radiation, typically visible or infrared light, which heats the hot junctions, while the cold junctions are on a heat sink. It is possible to measure radiative intensities of only a few \u03bcW/cm2 with commercially available thermopile sensors. For example, some laser power meters are based on such sensors; these are specifically known as thermopile laser sensor.\nThe principle of operation of a thermopile sensor is distinct from that of a bolometer, as the latter relies on a change in resistance.\nManufacturing.\nThermocouples can generally be used in the testing of prototype electrical and mechanical apparatus. For example, switchgear under test for its current carrying capacity may have thermocouples installed and monitored during a heat run test, to confirm that the temperature rise at rated current does not exceed designed limits.\nPower production.\nA thermocouple can produce current to drive some processes directly, without the need for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a thermocouple is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the Peltier effect).\nThermocouples can be connected in series to form a thermopile, where all the hot junctions are exposed to a higher temperature and all the cold junctions to a lower temperature. The output is the sum of the voltages across the individual junctions, giving larger voltage and power output. In a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, the radioactive decay of transuranic elements as a heat source has been used to power spacecraft on missions too far from the Sun to use solar power.\nThermopiles heated by kerosene lamps were used to run batteryless radio receivers in isolated areas. There are commercially produced lanterns that use the heat from a candle to run several light-emitting diodes, and thermoelectrically powered fans to improve air circulation and heat distribution in wood stoves.\nProcess plants.\nChemical production and petroleum refineries will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures associated with a process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of thermocouple leads will be brought to a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second thermocouple of each circuit. The temperature of the block is in turn measured by a thermistor. Simple computations are used to determine the temperature at each measured location.\nThermocouple as vacuum gauge.\nA thermocouple can be used as a vacuum gauge over the range of approximately 0.001 to 1 torr absolute pressure. In this pressure range, the mean free path of the gas is comparable to the dimensions of the vacuum chamber, and the flow regime is neither purely viscous nor purely molecular. In this configuration, the thermocouple junction is attached to the centre of a short heating wire, which is usually energised by a constant current of about 5\u00a0mA, and the heat is removed at a rate related to the thermal conductivity of the gas.\nThe temperature detected at the thermocouple junction depends on the thermal conductivity of the surrounding gas, which depends on the pressure of the gas. The potential difference measured by a thermocouple is proportional to the square of pressure over the low- to medium-vacuum range. At higher (viscous flow) and lower (molecular flow) pressures, the thermal conductivity of air or any other gas is essentially independent of pressure. The thermocouple was first used as a vacuum gauge by Voege in 1906. The mathematical model for the thermocouple as a vacuum gauge is quite complicated, as explained in detail by Van Atta, but can be simplified to:\n formula_39\nwhere \"P\" is the gas pressure, \"B\" is a constant that depends on the thermocouple temperature, the gas composition and the vacuum-chamber geometry, \"V\"0 is the thermocouple voltage at zero pressure (absolute), and \"V\" is the voltage indicated by the thermocouple.\nThe alternative is the Pirani gauge, which operates in a similar way, over approximately the same pressure range, but is only a 2-terminal device, sensing the change in resistance with temperature of a thin electrically heated wire, rather than using a thermocouple.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nThermocouple data tables:"}
{"id": "30992", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30992", "title": "Thermistor", "text": "Type of resistor whose resistance varies with temperature\nA thermistor is a semiconductor type of resistor in which the resistance is strongly dependent on temperature. The word \"thermistor\" is a portmanteau of \"thermal\" and \"resistor\". The varying resistance with temperature allows these devices to be used as temperature sensors, or to control current as a function of temperature. Some thermistors have decreasing resistance with temperature, while other types have increasing resistance with temperature. This allows them to be used for limiting current to cold circuits, e.g. for inrush current protection, or for limiting current to hot circuits, e.g. to prevent thermal runaway. \nThermistors are categorized based on their conduction models. \"Negative-temperature-coefficient\" (NTC) thermistors have \"less\" resistance at \"higher\" temperatures, while \"positive-temperature-coefficient\" (PTC) thermistors have \"more\" resistance at \"higher\" temperatures.\nNTC thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiters and temperature sensors, while PTC thermistors are used as self-resetting overcurrent protectors and self-regulating heating elements. The operational temperature range of a thermistor is dependent on the probe type and is typically between .\nTypes.\nDepending on materials used, thermistors are classified into two types:\nThermistors are generally produced using powdered metal oxides. With vastly improved formulas and techniques over the past 20 years, NTC thermistors can now achieve accuracies over wide temperature ranges such as \u00b10.1\u00a0\u00b0C or \u00b10.2\u00a0\u00b0C from 0\u00a0\u00b0C to 70\u00a0\u00b0C with excellent long-term stability. NTC thermistor elements come in many styles such as axial-leaded glass-encapsulated (DO-35, DO-34 and DO-41 diodes), glass-coated chips, epoxy-coated with bare or insulated lead wire and surface-mount, as well as thin film versions. The typical operating temperature range of a thermistor is \u221255\u00a0\u00b0C to +150\u00a0\u00b0C, though some glass-body thermistors have a maximal operating temperature of +300\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThermistors differ from resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) in that the material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a greater precision within a limited temperature range, typically \u221290\u00a0\u00b0C to 130\u00a0\u00b0C.\nBasic operation.\nAssuming, as a first-order approximation, that the relationship between resistance and temperature is linear, then\n formula_1\nwhere\n formula_2, change in resistance,\n formula_3, change in temperature,\n formula_4, first-order temperature coefficient of resistance.\nDepending on type of the thermistor in question the formula_4 may be either positive or negative.\nIf formula_4 is positive, the resistance increases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a \"positive-temperature-coefficient\" (\"PTC\") \"thermistor\", or \"posistor\". There are two types of PTC resistor\u00a0\u2013 \"switching thermistor\" and \"silistor\". If formula_4 is negative, the resistance decreases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a \"negative-temperature-coefficient\" (\"NTC\") \"thermistor\". Resistors that are not thermistors are designed to have a formula_4 as close to 0 as possible so that their resistance remains nearly constant over a wide temperature range.\nInstead of the temperature coefficient \"k\", sometimes the \"temperature coefficient of resistance\" formula_9 (\"alpha sub T\") is used. It is defined as\n formula_10\nThis formula_9 coefficient should not be confused with the formula_12 parameter below.\nConstruction and materials.\nThermistors are typically built by using metal oxides. They're typically pressed into a bead, disk, or cylindrical shape and then encapsulated with an impermeable material such as epoxy or glass.\nNTC thermistors are manufactured from oxides of the iron group of metals: e.g. chromium (CrO, Cr2O3), manganese (e.g. MnO), cobalt (CoO), iron (iron oxides), and nickel (NiO, Ni2O3). these oxides form a ceramic body with terminals composed of conductive metals such as silver, nickel, and tin.\nPTC thermistors are usually prepared from barium (Ba), strontium, or lead titanates (e.g. PbTiO3).\nThermistors can also be produced by resonant acoustic mixing of the previously mentioned oxides, followed by a sintering process. This effort reduces production time and can eliminate the calcination step entirely.\nSteinhart\u2013Hart equation.\nIn practical devices, the linear approximation model (above) is accurate only over a limited temperature range. Over wider temperature ranges, a more complex resistance\u2013temperature transfer function provides a more faithful characterization of the performance. The Steinhart\u2013Hart equation is a widely used third-order approximation:\n formula_13\nwhere \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" are called the Steinhart\u2013Hart parameters and must be specified for each device. \"T\" is the absolute temperature, and \"R\" is the resistance. The equation is not dimensionally correct, since a change in the units of R results in an equation with a different form, containing a formula_14 term. In practice, the equation gives good numerical results for resistances expressed in, for example, ohms (\u03a9) or kiloohms, but the coefficients a, b, and c must be stated with reference to that particular unit. To give resistance as a function of temperature, the above cubic equation in formula_15 can be solved, the real root of which is given by\nformula_16\nwhere\nformula_17\nThe error in the Steinhart\u2013Hart equation is generally less than 0.02\u00a0\u00b0C in the measurement of temperature over a 200\u00a0\u00b0C range. As an example, typical values for a thermistor with a resistance of 3\u00a0k\u03a9 at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C = 298.15\u00a0K, R in \u03a9) are:\nformula_18\n\"B\" or \"\u03b2\" parameter equation.\nNTC thermistors can also be characterised with the \"B\" (or \"\u03b2\") parameter equation, which is essentially the Steinhart\u2013Hart equation with formula_19, formula_20 and formula_21,\n formula_22\nwhere the temperatures and the \"B\" parameter are in kelvins, and \"R\"0 is the resistance of the thermistor at temperature \"T\"0 (25\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0= 298.15\u00a0K). Solving for \"R\" yields\n formula_23\nor, alternatively,\n formula_24\nwhere formula_25.\nThis can be solved for the temperature:\n formula_26\nThe \"B\"-parameter equation can also be written as formula_27. This can be used to convert the function of resistance vs. temperature of a thermistor into a linear function of formula_28 vs. formula_29. The average slope of this function will then yield an estimate of the value of the \"B\" parameter.\nConduction model.\nNTC (negative temperature coefficient).\nMany NTC thermistors are made from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or cast chip of semiconducting material such as sintered metal oxides. They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active charge carriers by promoting them into the \"conduction band\". The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe2O3) with titanium (Ti) doping an \"n-type\" semiconductor is formed and the charge carriers are electrons. In materials such as nickel oxide (NiO) with lithium (Li) doping a \"p-type\" semiconductor is created, where holes are the charge carriers.\nThis is described in the formula\n formula_30\nwhere\n formula_31 = electric current (amperes),\n formula_32 = density of charge carriers (count/m3),\n formula_33 = cross-sectional area of the material (m2),\n formula_34 = drift velocity of electrons (m/s),\n formula_35 = charge of an electron (formula_36 coulomb).\nOver large changes in temperature, calibration is necessary. Over small changes in temperature, if the right semiconductor is used, the resistance of the material is linearly proportional to the temperature. There are many different semiconducting thermistors with a range from about 0.01\u00a0kelvin to 2,000\u00a0kelvins (\u2212273.14\u00a0\u00b0C to 1,700\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe IEC standard symbol for a NTC thermistor includes a \"\u2212t\u00b0\" under the rectangle.\nPTC (positive temperature coefficient).\nMost PTC thermistors are made from doped polycrystalline ceramic (containing barium titanate (BaTiO3) and other compounds) which have the property that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature. Barium titanate is ferroelectric and its dielectric constant varies with temperature. Below the Curie point temperature, the high dielectric constant prevents the formation of potential barriers between the crystal grains, leading to a low resistance. In this region the device has a small negative temperature coefficient. At the Curie point temperature, the dielectric constant drops sufficiently to allow the formation of potential barriers at the grain boundaries, and the resistance increases sharply with temperature. At even higher temperatures, the material reverts to NTC behaviour.\nAnother type of thermistor is a silistor (a thermally sensitive silicon resistor). Silistors employ silicon as the semiconductive component material. Unlike ceramic PTC thermistors, silistors have an almost linear resistance-temperature characteristic. Silicon PTC thermistors have a much smaller drift than an NTC thermistor. They are stable devices which are hermetically sealed in an axial leaded glass encapsulated package.\nBarium titanate thermistors can be used as self-controlled heaters; for a given voltage, the ceramic will heat to a certain temperature, but the power used will depend on the heat loss from the ceramic.\nThe dynamics of PTC thermistors being powered lends to a wide range of applications. When first connected to a voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. In the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions an appropriately chosen thermistor is connected in series with the degaussing coil. This results in a smooth current decrease for an improved degaussing effect. Some of these degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor (and reduce the resulting current) further.\nAnother type of PTC thermistor is the polymer PTC, which is sold under brand names such as \"Polyswitch\" \"Semifuse\", and \"Multifuse\". This consists of plastic with carbon grains embedded in it. When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a conductive path through the device. When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing the resistance of the device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. Like the BaTiO3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. PTC thermistors \"latch\" into a hot / high resistance state: once hot, they stay in that high resistance state, until cooled.\nThe effect can be used as a primitive latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with one thermistor cool, and the other thermistor hot.\nThe IEC standard symbol for a PTC thermistor includes a \"+t\u00b0\" under the rectangle.\nSelf-heating effects.\nWhen a current flows through a thermistor, it generates heat, which raises the temperature of the thermistor above that of its environment. If the thermistor is being used to measure the temperature of the environment, this electrical heating may introduce a significant error (an observer effect) if a correction is not made. Alternatively, this effect itself can be exploited. It can, for example, make a sensitive air-flow device employed in a sailplane rate-of-climb instrument, the electronic variometer, or serve as a timer for a relay as was formerly done in telephone exchanges.\nThe electrical power input to the thermistor is just\n formula_37\nwhere \"I\" is current, and \"V\" is the voltage drop across the thermistor. This power is converted to heat, and this heat energy is transferred to the surrounding environment. The rate of transfer is well described by Newton's law of cooling:\n formula_38\nwhere \"T\"(\"R\") is the temperature of the thermistor as a function of its resistance \"R\", formula_39 is the temperature of the surroundings, and \"K\" is the \"dissipation constant\", usually expressed in units of milliwatts per degree Celsius. At equilibrium, the two rates must be equal:\n formula_40\nThe current and voltage across the thermistor depend on the particular circuit configuration. As a simple example, if the voltage across the thermistor is held fixed, then by Ohm's law we have formula_41, and the equilibrium equation can be solved for the ambient temperature as a function of the measured resistance of the thermistor:\n formula_42\nThe dissipation constant is a measure of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass-bead thermistor are 1.5\u00a0mW/\u00b0C in still air and 6.0\u00a0mW/\u00b0C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow-rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.\nThe power dissipated in a thermistor is typically maintained at a very low level to ensure insignificant temperature measurement error due to self-heating. However, some thermistor applications depend upon significant \"self-heating\" to raise the body temperature of the thermistor well above the ambient temperature, so the sensor then detects even subtle changes in the thermal conductivity of the environment. Some of these applications include liquid-level detection, liquid-flow measurement and air-flow measurement.\nHistory.\nThe first NTC thermistor was discovered in 1833 by Michael Faraday, who reported on the semiconducting behavior of silver sulfide. Faraday noticed that the resistance of silver sulfide decreased dramatically as temperature increased. This was also the first documented observation of a semiconducting material.\nBecause early thermistors were difficult to produce and applications for the technology were limited, commercial production of thermistors did not begin until the 1930s. A commercially viable thermistor was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e.g. the bulb of a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the pyrometric sensor in an infrared thermometer) in which some change occurs with a change in temperature; and (2) some means of converting this change into a numerical value (e.g. the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital readout on an infrared model). Thermometers are widely used in technology and industry to monitor processes, in meteorology, in medicine (\"medical thermometer\"), and in scientific research.\nA standard scale.\nWhile an individual thermometer is able to measure degrees of hotness, the readings on two thermometers cannot be compared unless they conform to an agreed scale. Today there is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. Internationally agreed temperature scales are designed to approximate this closely, based on fixed points and interpolating thermometers. The most recent official temperature scale is the International Temperature Scale of 1990. It extends from to approximately .\nHistory.\nSparse and conflicting historical records make it difficult to pinpoint the invention of the thermometer to any single person or date with certitude. In addition, given the many parallel developments in the thermometer's history and its many gradual improvements over time, the instrument is best viewed not as a single invention, but an evolving technology.\nAncient developments.\nEarly pneumatic devices and ideas from antiquity provided inspiration for the thermometer's invention during the Renaissance period.\nPhilo of Byzantium.\nIn the 3rd century BC, Philo of Byzantium documented his experiment with a tube submerged in a container of liquid on one end and connected to an air-tight, hollow sphere on the other. When air in the sphere is heated with a candle or by exposing it to the sun, expanding air exits the sphere and generates bubbles in the vessel. As air in the sphere cools, a partial vacuum is created, sucking liquid up into the tube. Any changes in the position of the liquid will now indicate whether the air in the sphere is getting hotter or colder.\nTranslations of Philo's experiment from the original ancient Greek were utilized by Robert Fludd sometime around 1617 and used as the basis for his air thermometer.\nHero of Alexandria.\nIn his book, \"Pneumatics\", Hero of Alexandria (10\u201370 AD) provides a recipe for building a \"Fountain which trickles by the Action of the Sun's Rays,\" a more elaborate version of Philo's pneumatic experiment but which worked on the same principle of heating and cooling air to move water around. Translations of the ancient work \"Pneumatics\" were introduced to late 16th century Italy and studied by many, including Galileo Galilei, who had read it by 1594.\nFirst temperature scale with a fixed point.\nThe Roman Greek physician Galen is given credit for introducing two concepts important to the development of a scale of temperature and the eventual invention of the thermometer. First, he had the idea that hotness or coldness may be measured by \"degrees of hot and cold.\" He also conceived of a fixed reference temperature, a mixture of equal amounts of ice and boiling water, with four degrees of heat above this point and four degrees of cold below. 16th century physician Johann Hasler developed body temperature scales based on Galen's theory of degrees to help him mix the appropriate amount of medicine for patients.\nLate Renaissance developments.\nThermoscope.\nIn the late 16th and early 17th centuries, several European scientists, notably Galileo Galilei and Italian physiologist Santorio Santorio, developed devices with an air-filled glass bulb, connected to a tube, partially filled with water. As the air in the bulb warms or cools, the height of the column of water in the tube falls or rises, allowing an observer to compare the current height of the water to previous heights to detect relative changes of the heat in the bulb and its immediate environment. Such devices, with no scale for assigning a numerical value to the height of the liquid, are referred to as a \"thermoscope\" because they provide an observable indication of sensible heat (the modern concept of temperature was yet to arise).\nAir thermometer.\nThe difference between a thermoscope and a thermometer is that the latter has a scale.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A thermometer is simply a thermoscope with a scale. ... I propose to regard it as axiomatic that a \u201cmeter\u201d must have a scale or something equivalent. ... If this is admitted, the problem of the invention of the thermometer becomes more straightforward; that of the invention of the thermoscope remains as obscure as ever.\u2014\u200a\nGiven this, Middleton claimed that the possible inventors of the thermometer are Galileo, Santorio, Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel, or British mathematician Robert Fludd. Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the thermometer, there is no surviving document that he actually produced any such instrument.\nThe first clear diagram of a thermoscope was published in 1617 by Giuseppe Biancani (1566 \u2013 1624); the first showing a scale and thus constituting a thermometer was by Santorio Santorio in 1625. This was a vertical tube, closed by a bulb of air at the top, with the lower end opening into a vessel of water. The water level in the tube was controlled by the expansion and contraction of the air, so it was what we would now call an air thermometer.\nCoining of \"thermometer\".\nThe word thermometer (in its French form) first appeared in 1624 in \"La R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation Math\u00e9matique\" by Jean Leurechon, who describes one with a scale of 8 degrees. The word comes from Ancient Greek \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (\"therm\u00f3s\"), meaning \"warmth\", and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (\"m\u00e9tron\"), meaning \"measure\".\nSealed liquid-in-glass thermometer.\nThe above instruments suffered from the disadvantage that they were also barometers, i.e. sensitive to air pressure. In 1629, Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, a student of Galileo and Santorio in Padua, published what is apparently the first description and illustration of a sealed liquid-in-glass thermometer. It is described as having a bulb at the bottom of a sealed tube partially filled with brandy. The tube had a numbered scale. Delmedigo did not claim to have invented this instrument. Nor did he name anyone else as its inventor. In about 1654, Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1610\u20131670) did produce such an instrument, the first modern-style thermometer, dependent on the expansion of a liquid and independent of air pressure. Many other scientists experimented with various liquids and designs of thermometer. However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique \u2014 there was no standard scale.\nEarly attempts at standardization.\nEarly attempts at standardization added a single reference point such as the freezing point of water. The use of two references for graduating the thermometer is said to have been introduced by Joachim Dalence in 1668, although Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) in 1665 had already suggested the use of graduations based on the melting and boiling points of water as standards and, in 1694, Carlo Rinaldini (1615\u20131698) proposed using them as fixed points along a universal scale divided into degrees. In 1701, Isaac Newton (1642\u20131726/27) proposed a scale of 12 degrees between the melting point of ice and body temperature.\nPrecision thermometry.\nIn 1714, scientist and inventor Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit invented a reliable thermometer, using mercury instead of alcohol and water mixtures. In 1724, he proposed a temperature scale which now (slightly adjusted) bears his name. In 1742, Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744) proposed a scale with zero at the boiling point and 100 degrees at the freezing point of water, though the scale which now bears his name has them the other way around. French entomologist Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur invented an alcohol thermometer and, temperature scale in 1730, that ultimately proved to be less reliable than Fahrenheit's mercury thermometer.\nThe first physician to use thermometer measurements in clinical practice was Herman Boerhaave (1668\u20131738). In 1866, Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt (1836\u20131925) invented a clinical thermometer that produced a body temperature reading in five minutes as opposed to twenty.\nRegistering.\nTraditional thermometers were all non-registering thermometers. That is, the thermometer did not hold the temperature reading after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. Determining the temperature of a pot of hot liquid required the user to leave the thermometer in the hot liquid until after reading it. If the non-registering thermometer was removed from the hot liquid, then the temperature indicated on the thermometer would immediately begin changing to reflect the temperature of its new conditions (in this case, the air temperature). Registering thermometers are designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place. Mechanical registering thermometers hold either the highest or lowest temperature recorded until manually re-set, e.g., by shaking down a mercury-in-glass thermometer, or until an even more extreme temperature is experienced. Electronic registering thermometers may be designed to remember the highest or lowest temperature, or to remember whatever temperature was present at a specified point in time.\nThermometers increasingly use electronic means to provide a digital display or input to a computer.\nPhysical principles of thermometry.\nThermometers may be described as empirical or absolute. Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale. Empirical thermometers are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute thermometers as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as thermometers at all they must agree with absolute thermometers and with each other in the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all thermometers agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures. For any two empirical thermometers, this does not require that the relation between their numerical scale readings be linear, but it does require that relation to be strictly monotonic. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers.\nAs it is customarily stated in textbooks, taken alone, the so-called \"zeroth law of thermodynamics\" fails to deliver this information, but the statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics by James Serrin in 1977, though rather mathematically abstract, is more informative for thermometry: \"Zeroth Law \u2013 There exists a topological line formula_1 which serves as a coordinate manifold of material behaviour. The points formula_2 of the manifold formula_1 are called 'hotness levels', and formula_1 is called the 'universal hotness manifold'.\" To this information there needs to be added a sense of greater hotness; this sense can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Another way of identifying hotter as opposed to colder conditions is supplied by Planck's principle, that when a process of isochoric adiabatic work is the sole means of change of internal energy of a closed system, the final state of the system is never colder than the initial state; except for phase changes with latent heat, it is hotter than the initial state.\nThere are several principles on which empirical thermometers are built, as listed in the section of this article entitled \"Primary and secondary thermometers\". Several such principles are essentially based on the constitutive relation between the state of a suitably selected particular material and its temperature. Only some materials are suitable for this purpose, and they may be considered as \"thermometric materials\". Radiometric thermometry, in contrast, can be only slightly dependent on the constitutive relations of materials. In a sense then, radiometric thermometry might be thought of as \"universal\". This is because it rests mainly on a universality character of thermodynamic equilibrium, that it has the universal property of producing blackbody radiation.\nThermometric materials.\nThere are various kinds of empirical thermometer based on material properties.\nMany empirical thermometers rely on the constitutive relation between pressure, volume and temperature of their thermometric material. For example, mercury expands when heated.\nIf it is used for its relation between pressure and volume and temperature, a thermometric material must have three properties:\n(1) Its heating and cooling must be rapid. That is to say, when a quantity of heat enters or leaves a body of the material, the material must expand or contract to its final volume or reach its final pressure and must reach its final temperature with practically no delay; some of the heat that enters can be considered to change the volume of the body at constant temperature, and is called the latent heat of expansion at constant temperature; and the rest of it can be considered to change the temperature of the body at constant volume, and is called the specific heat at constant volume. Some materials do not have this property, and take some time to distribute the heat between temperature and volume change.\n(2) Its heating and cooling must be reversible. That is to say, the material must be able to be heated and cooled indefinitely often by the same increment and decrement of heat, and still return to its original pressure, volume and temperature every time. Some plastics do not have this property;\n(3) Its heating and cooling must be monotonic. That is to say, throughout the range of temperatures for which it is intended to work,\n(a) at a given fixed pressure,\neither (i) the volume increases when the temperature increases, or else (ii) the volume decreases when the temperature increases;\nbut not (i) for some temperatures and (ii) for others; or\n(b) at a given fixed volume,\neither (i) the pressure increases when the temperature increases, or else (ii) the pressure decreases when the temperature increases;\nbut not (i) for some temperatures and (ii) for others.\nAt temperatures around about 4\u00a0\u00b0C, water does not have the property (3), and is said to behave anomalously in this respect; thus water cannot be used as a material for this kind of thermometry for temperature ranges near 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nGases, on the other hand, all have the properties (1), (2), and (3)(a)(\u03b1) and (3)(b)(\u03b1). Consequently, they are suitable thermometric materials, and that is why they were important in the development of thermometry.\nConstant volume thermometry.\nAccording to Preston (1894/1904), Regnault found constant pressure air thermometers unsatisfactory, because they needed troublesome corrections. He therefore built a constant volume air thermometer. Constant volume thermometers do not provide a way to avoid the problem of anomalous behaviour like that of water at approximately 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nRadiometric thermometry.\nPlanck's law very accurately quantitatively describes the power spectral density of electromagnetic radiation, inside a rigid walled cavity in a body made of material that is completely opaque and poorly reflective, when it has reached thermodynamic equilibrium, as a function of absolute thermodynamic temperature alone. A small enough hole in the wall of the cavity emits near enough blackbody radiation of which the spectral radiance can be precisely measured. The walls of the cavity, provided they are completely opaque and poorly reflective, can be of any material indifferently. \nPrimary and secondary thermometers.\nA thermometer is called primary or secondary based on how the raw physical quantity it measures is mapped to a temperature. As summarized by Kauppinen et al., \"For primary thermometers the measured property of matter is known so well that temperature can be calculated without any unknown quantities. Examples of these are thermometers based on the equation of state of a gas, on the velocity of sound in a gas, on the thermal noise voltage or current of an electrical resistor, and on the angular anisotropy of gamma ray emission of certain radioactive nuclei in a magnetic field.\"\nIn contrast, \"Secondary thermometers are most widely used because of their convenience. Also, they are often much more sensitive than primary ones. For secondary thermometers knowledge of the measured property is not sufficient to allow direct calculation of temperature. They have to be calibrated against a primary thermometer at least at one temperature or at a number of fixed temperatures. Such fixed points, for example, triple points and superconducting transitions, occur reproducibly at the same temperature.\"\nCalibration.\nThermometers can be calibrated either by comparing them with other calibrated thermometers or by checking them against known fixed points on the temperature scale. The best known of these fixed points are the melting and boiling points of pure water. (Note that the boiling point of water varies with pressure, so this must be controlled.)\nThe traditional way of putting a scale on a liquid-in-glass or liquid-in-metal thermometer was in three stages:\nOther fixed points used in the past are the body temperature (of a healthy adult male) which was originally used by Fahrenheit as his upper fixed point ( to be a number divisible by 12) and the lowest temperature given by a mixture of salt and ice, which was originally the definition of . (This is an example of a frigorific mixture.) As body temperature varies, the Fahrenheit scale was later changed to use an upper fixed point of boiling water at .\nThese have now been replaced by the defining points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990, though in practice the melting point of water is more commonly used than its triple point, the latter being more difficult to manage and thus restricted to critical standard measurement. Nowadays manufacturers will often use a thermostat bath or solid block where the temperature is held constant relative to a calibrated thermometer. Other thermometers to be calibrated are put into the same bath or block and allowed to come to equilibrium, then the scale marked, or any deviation from the instrument scale recorded. For many modern devices calibration will be stating some value to be used in processing an electronic signal to convert it to a temperature.\nPrecision, accuracy, and reproducibility.\nThe \"precision\" or \"resolution\" of a thermometer is simply to what fraction of a degree it is possible to make a reading. For high temperature work it may only be possible to measure to the nearest 10\u00a0\u00b0C or more. Clinical thermometers and many electronic thermometers are usually readable to 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C. Special instruments can give readings to one thousandth of a degree. However, this precision does not mean the reading is true or accurate, it only means that very small changes can be observed.\nA thermometer calibrated to a known fixed point is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. The invention of the technology to measure temperature led to the creation of scales of temperature. In between fixed calibration points, interpolation is used, usually linear. This may give significant differences between different types of thermometer at points far away from the fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a platinum resistance thermometer, so these two will disagree slightly at around 50\u00a0\u00b0C. There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the capillary tube varies in diameter.\nFor many purposes reproducibility is important. That is, does the same thermometer give the same reading for the same temperature (or do replacement or multiple thermometers give the same reading)? Reproducible temperature measurement means that comparisons are valid in scientific experiments and industrial processes are consistent. Thus if the same type of thermometer is calibrated in the same way its readings will be valid even if it is slightly inaccurate compared to the absolute scale.\nAn example of a reference thermometer used to check others to industrial standards would be a platinum resistance thermometer with a digital display to 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C (its precision) which has been calibrated at 5 points against national standards (\u221218, 0, 40, 70, 100\u00a0\u00b0C) and which is certified to an accuracy of \u00b10.2\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAccording to British Standards, correctly calibrated, used and maintained liquid-in-glass thermometers can achieve a measurement uncertainty of \u00b10.01\u00a0\u00b0C in the range 0 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C, and a larger uncertainty outside this range: \u00b10.05\u00a0\u00b0C up to 200 or down to \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C, \u00b10.2\u00a0\u00b0C up to 450 or down to \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.\n Utilizing the property of thermal expansion of various phases of matter.\n Pairs of solid metals with different expansion coefficients can be used for bi-metal mechanical thermometers. Another design using this principle is Breguet's thermometer.\n Some liquids possess relatively high expansion coefficients over a useful temperature ranges thus forming the basis for an alcohol or mercury thermometer. Alternative designs using this principle are the reversing thermometer and Beckmann differential thermometer.\n As with liquids, gases can also be used to form a gas thermometer.\n Vapour pressure thermometer\n Galileo thermometer\n Some compounds exhibit thermochromism at distinct temperature changes. Thus by tuning the phase transition temperatures for a series of substances the temperature can be quantified in discrete increments, a form of digitization. This is the basis for a liquid crystal thermometer.\n Band edge thermometry (BET) takes advantage of the temperature-dependence of the band gap of semiconductor materials to provide very precise optical (\"i.e.\" non-contact) temperature measurements. BET systems require a specialized optical system, as well as custom data analysis software.\n All objects above absolute zero emit blackbody radiation for which the spectra is directly proportional to the temperature. This property is the basis for a pyrometer or infrared thermometer and thermography. It has the advantage of remote temperature sensing; it does not require contact or even close proximity unlike most thermometers. At higher temperatures, blackbody radiation becomes visible and is described by the colour temperature. For example a glowing heating element or an approximation of a star's surface temperature.\n Phosphor thermometry\n Fiber optical thermometer\n Resistance thermometer which use materials such as Balco alloy\n Thermistor\n Coulomb blockade thermometer\n Thermocouples are useful over a wide temperature range from cryogenic temperatures to over 1000\u00b0C, but typically have an error of \u00b10.5-1.5\u00b0C.\n Silicon bandgap temperature sensors are commonly found packaged in integrated circuits with accompanying ADC and interface such as I2C. Typically they are specified to work within about \u201450 to 150\u00b0C with accuracies in the \u00b10.25 to 1\u00b0C range but can be improved by binning.\n Quartz thermometer\n Chemical shift is temperature dependent. This property is used to calibrate the thermostat of NMR probes, usually using methanol or ethylene glycol. This can potentially be problematic for internal standards which are usually assumed to have a defined chemical shift (e.g 0 ppm for TMS) but in fact exhibit a temperature dependence.\n Above the Curie temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic material exhibits an inverse temperature dependence. This phenomenon is the basis of a magnetic cryometer.\nApplications.\nThermometers utilize a range of physical effects to measure temperature. Temperature sensors are used in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications, especially measurement systems. Temperature systems are primarily either electrical or mechanical, occasionally inseparable from the system which they control (as in the case of a mercury-in-glass thermometer). Thermometers are used in roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist. Indoors, thermistors are used in climate control systems such as air conditioners, freezers, heaters, refrigerators, and water heaters. Galileo thermometers are used to measure indoor air temperature, due to their limited measurement range.\nSuch liquid crystal thermometers (which use thermochromic liquid crystals) are also used in mood rings and used to measure the temperature of water in fish tanks.\nFiber Bragg grating temperature sensors are used in nuclear power facilities to monitor reactor core temperatures and avoid the possibility of nuclear meltdowns.\nNanothermometry.\nNanothermometry is an emergent research field dealing with the knowledge of temperature in the sub-micrometric scale. Conventional thermometers cannot measure the temperature of an object which is smaller than a micrometre, and new methods and materials have to be used. Nanothermometry is used in such cases. Nanothermometers are classified as luminescent thermometers (if they use light to measure temperature) and thermometers (systems where thermometric properties are not directly related to luminescence).\nCryometer.\nThermometers used specifically for low temperatures.\nMedical.\nVarious thermometric techniques have been used throughout history such as the Galileo thermometer to thermal imaging.\nMedical thermometers such as mercury-in-glass thermometers, infrared thermometers, pill thermometers, and liquid crystal thermometers are used in health care settings to determine if individuals have a fever or are hypothermic.\nFood and food safety.\nThermometers are important in food safety, where food at temperatures within can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours which could lead to foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.\nCooking thermometers are important for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular meat thermometers are used to aid in cooking meat to a safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.\nCandy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.\nEnvironmental.\nAlcohol thermometers, infrared thermometers, mercury-in-glass thermometers, recording thermometers, thermistors, and Six's thermometers (maximum-minimum thermometer) are used in meteorology and climatology in various levels of the atmosphere and oceans. Aircraft use thermometers and hygrometers to determine if atmospheric icing conditions exist along their flight path. These measurements are used to initialize weather forecast models. Thermometers are used in roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist and indoors in climate control systems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The school's adherents, termed Therav\u0101dins (anglicized from Pali \"therav\u0101d\u012b\"), have preserved their version of the Buddha's teaching or \"Dhamma\" in the P\u0101li Canon for over two millennia. As of 2010, Theravada is the second largest branch of Buddhism with 36% Buddhists belonging to Theravada, compared to 53% to Mahayana.\nThe P\u0101li Canon is the most complete Buddhist canon surviving in a classical Indian language, P\u0101li, which serves as the school's sacred language and \"lingua franca\". In contrast to Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na, Therav\u0101da tends to be conservative in matters of doctrine (\"pariyatti\") and monastic discipline (\"vinaya\"). One element of this conservatism is the fact that Therav\u0101da rejects the authenticity of the Mahayana sutras (which appeared c.\u20091st century BCE onwards). Consequently, Therav\u0101da generally does not recognize the existence of many Buddhas and bodhisattvas believed by the Mah\u0101y\u0101na school, such as Amit\u0101bha and Vairocana, because they are not found in their scriptures.\nTherav\u0101da derives from Indian Sthavira nik\u0101ya (an early Buddhist school). This tradition developed significantly in India and Sri Lanka from the 3rd century BCE onward, particularly with the writing down of the P\u0101li Canon and the growth of its commentarial literature. From both India, as its historical origin, and Sri Lanka, as its principal center of development, the Therav\u0101da tradition subsequently spread to Southeast Asia, where it became the dominant form of Buddhism. Therav\u0101da is the official religion of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Cambodia, and the main dominant Buddhist variant found in Laos and Thailand. It is practiced by minorities in India, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, North Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan. The diaspora of all of these groups, as well as converts around the world, also embrace and practice Therav\u0101da Buddhism.\nDuring the modern era, new developments have included Buddhist modernism, the Vipassana movement which reinvigorated Therav\u0101da meditation practice, the growth of the Thai Forest Tradition which reemphasized forest monasticism and the spread of Therav\u0101da westward to places such as India and Nepal, along with Buddhist immigrants and converts in the European Union and in the United States.\nHistory.\nPre-modern.\nThe Therav\u0101da school descends from the Vibhajjav\u0101da, a division within the Sth\u0101vira nik\u0101ya, one of the two major orders that arose after the first schism in the Indian Buddhist community. Therav\u0101da sources trace their tradition to the Third Buddhist council when elder Moggaliputta-Tissa is said to have compiled the \"Kathavatthu\", an important work which lays out the Vibhajjav\u0101da doctrinal position.\nAided by the patronage of Mauryan kings like Ashoka, this school spread throughout India and reached Sri Lanka through the efforts of missionary monks like Mahinda. In Sri Lanka, it became known as the Tambapa\u1e47\u1e47iya (and later as Mah\u0101vih\u0101rav\u0101sins) which was based at the Great Vihara (Mahavihara) in Anuradhapura (the ancient Sri Lankan capital). According to Therav\u0101da sources, another one of the Ashokan missions was also sent to \"Suva\u1e47\u1e47abh\u016bmi\" (\"The Golden Land\"), which may refer to Southeast Asia.\nBy the first century BCE, Therav\u0101da Buddhism was well established in the main settlements of the Kingdom of Anuradhapura. The Pali Canon, which contains the main scriptures of the Therav\u0101da, was committed to writing in the first century BCE. Throughout the history of ancient and medieval Sri Lanka, Therav\u0101da was the main religion of the Sinhalese people and its temples and monasteries were patronized by the Sri Lankan kings, who saw themselves as the protectors of the religion.\nOver time, two other sects split off from the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition, the Abhayagiri and Jetavana. While the Abhayagiri sect became known for the syncretic study of Mahayana and Vajrayana texts, as well as the Therav\u0101da canon, the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition did not accept these new scriptures. Instead, Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra scholars like Buddhaghosa focused on the exegesis of the Pali scriptures and on the Abhidhamma. These Therav\u0101da sub-sects often came into conflict with each other over royal patronage. The reign of Par\u0101kramab\u0101hu I (1153\u20131186) saw an extensive reform of the Sri Lankan sangha after years of warfare on the island. Par\u0101kramab\u0101hu created a single unified sangha which came to be dominated by the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra sect.\nEpigraphical evidence has established that Therav\u0101da Buddhism became a dominant religion in the Southeast Asian kingdoms of Sri Ksetra and Dvaravati from about the 5th century CE onwards. The oldest surviving Buddhist texts in the P\u0101li language are gold plates found at Sri Ksetra dated circa the 5th to 6th century. Before the Therav\u0101da tradition became the dominant religion in Southeast Asia, Mah\u0101y\u0101na, Vajrayana and Hinduism were also prominent.\nStarting at around the 11th century, Sinhalese Therav\u0101da monks and Southeast Asian elites led a widespread conversion of most of mainland Southeast Asia to the Therav\u0101din Mahavihara school. The patronage of monarchs such as the Burmese king Anawrahta (Pali: Aniruddha, 1044\u20131077) and the Thai king Ram Khamhaeng (floruit. late 13th century) was instrumental in the rise of Therav\u0101da Buddhism as the predominant religion of Burma and Thailand.\nBurmese and Thai kings saw themselves as Dhamma Kings and as protectors of the Therav\u0101da faith. They promoted the building of new temples, patronized scholarship, monastic ordinations and missionary works as well as attempted to eliminate certain non-Buddhist practices like animal sacrifices. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Therav\u0101da also became established as the state religion in Cambodia and Laos. In Cambodia, numerous Hindu and Mah\u0101y\u0101na temples, most famously Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, were transformed into Therav\u0101din monasteries.\nModern history.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Therav\u0101da Buddhists came into direct contact with western ideologies, religions and modern science. The various responses to this encounter have been called \"Buddhist modernism\". In the British colonies of Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and Burma (Myanmar), Buddhist institutions lost their traditional role as the prime providers of education (a role that was often filled by Christian schools). In response to this, Buddhist organizations were founded which sought to preserve Buddhist scholarship and provide a Buddhist education. Anagarika Dhammapala, Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera and Henry Steel Olcott (one of the first American western converts to Buddhism) were some of the main figures of the Sri Lankan Buddhist revival. Two new monastic orders were formed in the 19th century, the Amarapura Nik\u0101ya and the R\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1a Nik\u0101ya.\nIn Burma, an influential modernist figure was king Mindon Min (1808\u20131878), known for his patronage of the Fifth Buddhist council (1871) and the Tripi\u1e6daka tablets at Kuthodaw Pagoda (still the world's largest book) with the intention of preserving the Buddha Dhamma. Burma also saw the growth of the \"Vipassana movement\", which focused on reviving Buddhist meditation and doctrinal learning. Ledi Sayadaw (1846\u20131923) was one of the key figures in this movement. After independence, Myanmar held the Sixth Buddhist council (Vesak 1954 to Vesak 1956) to create a new redaction of the P\u0101li Canon, which was then published by the government in 40 volumes. The Vipassana movement continued to grow after independence, becoming an international movement with centers around the world. Influential meditation teachers of the post-independence era include U Narada, Mahasi Sayadaw, Sayadaw U Pandita, Nyanaponika Thera, Webu Sayadaw, U Ba Khin and his student S.N. Goenka.\nMeanwhile, in Thailand (the only Therav\u0101da nation to retain its independence throughout the colonial era), the religion became much more centralized, bureaucratized and controlled by the state after a series of reforms promoted by Thai kings of the Chakri dynasty. King Mongkut (r. 1851\u20131868) and his successor Chulalongkorn (1868\u20131910) were especially involved in centralizing sangha reforms. Under these kings, the sangha was organized into a hierarchical bureaucracy led by the Sangha Council of Elders (Pali: \"Mah\u0101thera Sam\u0101gama\"), the highest body of the Thai sangha. Mongkut also led the creation of a new monastic order, the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, which kept a stricter monastic discipline than the rest of the Thai sangha (this included not using money, not storing up food and not taking milk in the evening). The Dhammayuttika movement was characterized by an emphasis on the original Pali Canon and a rejection of Thai folk beliefs which were seen as irrational. Under the leadership of Prince Wachirayan Warorot, a new education and examination system was introduced for Thai monks.\nThe 20th century also saw the growth of \"forest traditions\" which focused on forest living and strict monastic discipline. The main forest movements of this era are the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition and the Thai Forest Tradition, founded by Ajahn Mun (1870\u20131949) and his students.\nTherav\u0101da Buddhism in Cambodia and Laos went through similar experiences in the modern era. Both had to endure French colonialism, destructive civil wars and oppressive communist governments. Under French Rule, French indologists of the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient became involved in the reform of Buddhism, setting up institutions for the training of Cambodian and Lao monks, such as the Ecole de Pali which was founded in Phnom Penh in 1914\".\" While the Khmer Rouge effectively destroyed Cambodia's Buddhist institutions, after the end of the communist regime the Cambodian Sangha was re-established by monks who had returned from exile. In contrast, communist rule in Laos was less destructive since the Pathet Lao sought to make use of the sangha for political ends by imposing direct state control. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the official attitudes toward Buddhism began to liberalise in Laos and there was a resurgence of traditional Buddhist activities such as merit-making and doctrinal study.\nThe modern era also saw the spread of Therav\u0101da Buddhism around the world and the revival of the religion in places where it remains a minority faith. Some of the major events of the spread of modern Therav\u0101da include:\nTexts.\nP\u0101li Tipi\u1e6daka.\nAccording to Kate Crosby, for Therav\u0101da, the P\u0101li Tipi\u1e6daka, also known as the P\u0101li Canon is \"the highest authority on what constitutes the Dhamma (the truth or teaching of the Buddha) and the organization of the Sangha (the community of monks and nuns).\"\nThe language of the Tipi\u1e6daka, P\u0101li, is a middle-Indic language which is the main religious and scholarly language in Therav\u0101da. This language may have evolved out of various Indian dialects, and is related to, but not the same as, the ancient language of Magadha.\nAn early form of the Tipi\u1e6daka may have been transmitted to Sri Lanka during the reign of Ashoka, which saw a period of Buddhist missionary activity. After being orally transmitted (as was the custom for religious texts in those days) for some centuries, the texts were finally committed to writing in the 1st century BCE. Therav\u0101da is one of the first Buddhist schools to commit its Tipi\u1e6daka to writing. The recension of the Tipi\u1e6daka which survives today is that of the Sri Lankan Mahavihara sect.\nThe oldest manuscripts of the Tipi\u1e6daka from Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia date to the 15th Century, and they are incomplete. Complete manuscripts of the four Nikayas are only available from the 17th Century onwards. However, fragments of the Tipi\u1e6daka have been found in inscriptions from Southeast Asia, the earliest of which have been dated to the 3rd or 4th century. According to Alexander Wynne, \"they agree almost exactly with extant P\u0101li manuscripts. This means that the P\u0101li Tipi\u1e6daka has been transmitted with a high degree of accuracy for well over 1,500 years.\"\nThere are numerous editions of the Tipi\u1e6daka, some of the major modern editions include the Pali Text Society edition (published in Roman script), the Burmese Sixth Council edition (in Burmese script, 1954\u201356) and the Thai Tipi\u1e6daka edited and published in Thai script after the council held during the reign of Rama VII (1925\u201335). There is also a Khmer edition, published in Phnom Penh (1931\u201369).\nThe P\u0101li Tipitaka consists of three parts: the Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Of these, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is believed to be a later addition to the collection, its composition dating from around the 3rd century BCE onwards. The P\u0101li Abhidhamma was not recognized outside the Therav\u0101da school. There are also some texts which were late additions that are included in the fifth Nikaya, the \"Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya\" ('Minor Collection'), such as the \"Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga\" (possibly c. 3rd to 1st century BCE) and the \"Buddhava\u1e43sa\" (c. 1st and 2nd century BCE).\nThe main parts of the Sutta Pitaka and some portions of the Vinaya show considerable overlap in content with the Agamas, the parallel collections used by non-Therav\u0101da schools in India which are preserved in Chinese and partially in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tibetan, as well as the various non-Therav\u0101da Vinayas. On this basis, these Early Buddhist texts (i.e. the Nikayas and parts of the Vinaya) are generally believed to be some of the oldest and most authoritative sources on the doctrines of pre-sectarian Buddhism by modern scholars.\nMuch of the material in the earlier portions is not specifically \"Therav\u0101dan\", but the collection of teachings that this school's adherents preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, while the Therav\u0101dans may have added texts to their Tipi\u1e6daka (such as the Abhidhamma texts and so on), they generally did not tamper with the earlier material.\nThe historically later parts of the canon, mainly the Abhidhamma and some parts of the Vinaya, contain some distinctive elements and teachings which are unique to the Therav\u0101da school and often differ from the Abhidharmas or Vinayas of other early Buddhist schools. For example, while the Therav\u0101da Vinaya contains a total of 227 monastic rules for bhikkhus, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (used in East Asian Buddhism) has a total of 253 rules for bhikkhus (though the overall structure is the same). These differences arose from the systematization and historical development of doctrines and monasticism in the centuries after the death of the Buddha.\nThe Abhidhamma-pitaka contains \"a restatement of the doctrine of the Buddha in strictly formalized language.\" Its texts present a new method, the Abhidhamma method, which attempts to build a single consistent philosophical system (in contrast with the suttas, which present numerous teachings given by the Buddha to particular individuals according to their needs). Because the Abhidhamma focuses on analyzing the internal lived experience of beings and the intentional structure of consciousness, it has often been compared to a kind of phenomenological psychology by numerous modern scholars such as Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi and Alexander Piatigorsky.\nThe Therav\u0101da school has traditionally held the doctrinal position that the canonical Abhidhamma Pitaka was actually taught by the Buddha himself. Modern scholarship in contrast, has generally held that the Abhidhamma texts date from the 3rd century BCE onwards. However some scholars, such as Frauwallner, also hold that the early Abhidhamma texts developed out of exegetical and catechetical work which made use of doctrinal lists which can be seen in the suttas, called \"matikas.\"\nNon-canonical literature.\nThere are numerous Therav\u0101da works which are important for the tradition even though they are not part of the Tipi\u1e6daka. Perhaps the most important texts apart from the Tipi\u1e6daka are the works of the influential scholar Buddhaghosa (4th\u20135th century CE), known for his P\u0101li commentaries (which were based on older Sri Lankan commentaries of the Mahavihara tradition). He is also the author of a very important compendium of Therav\u0101da doctrine, the \"Visuddhimagga\". Other figures like Dhammapala and Buddhadatta also wrote Therav\u0101da commentaries and other works in Pali during the time of Buddhaghosa. While these texts do not have the same scriptural authority in Therav\u0101da as the Tipi\u1e6daka, they remain influential works for the exegesis of the Tipi\u1e6daka.\nAn important genre of Therav\u0101din literature is shorter handbooks and summaries, which serve as introductions and study guides for the larger commentaries. Two of the more influential summaries are Sariputta Thera's \"P\u0101limuttakavinayavinicchayasa\u1e45gaha,\" a summary of Buddhaghosa's Vinaya commentary and Anuruddha's \"Abhidhamma\u1e6d\u1e6dhasa\u1e45gaha\" (a \"Manual of Abhidhamma\").\nThroughout the history of Therav\u0101da, Therav\u0101da monks also produced other works of P\u0101li literature such as historical chronicles (like the \"Dipavamsa\" and the \"Mahavamsa\"), hagiographies, poetry, P\u0101li grammars, and \"sub-commentaries\" (that is, commentaries on the commentaries).\nWhile P\u0101li texts are symbolically and ritually important for many Therav\u0101dins, most people are likely to access Buddhist teachings through vernacular literature, oral teachings, sermons, art and performance as well as films and Internet media. According to Kate Crosby, \"there is a far greater volume of Therav\u0101da literature in vernacular languages than in P\u0101li.\"\nAn important genre of Therav\u0101din literature, in both P\u0101li and vernacular languages, are the Jataka tales, stories of the Buddha's past lives. They are very popular among all classes and are rendered in a wide variety of media formats, from cartoons to high literature. The Vessantara J\u0101taka is one of the most popular of these.\nOther Buddhist texts.\nMost Therav\u0101da Buddhists generally consider Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist scriptures to be apocryphal, meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha. Consequently, Therav\u0101din generally does not recognize the existence of many Buddhas and bodhisattvas believed by the \"Mah\u0101y\u0101na\" school, such as Amit\u0101bha and Vairocana, because they are not found in the canonical scriptures.\nDoctrine (\"pariyatti\").\nCore teachings.\nThe core of Therav\u0101da Buddhist doctrine is contained in the P\u0101li Canon, the only complete collection of early Buddhist Texts surviving in a classical Indic language. The fundamentals of Theravadin Buddhism are shared by the other early Buddhist schools and Mahayana traditions. They include central concepts such as: \nMain doctrinal differences with other Buddhist traditions.\nThe orthodox standpoints of Therav\u0101da in comparison to other Buddhist denominations are presented in the \"Kathavatthu\" (Points of Controversy), as well as in other works by commentators like Buddhaghosa.\nTraditionally, Therav\u0101da maintains the following key doctrinal positions, though not all Therav\u0101dins agree with the traditional points of view:\nAbhidhamma philosophy.\nTherav\u0101da scholastics developed a systematic exposition of the Buddhist doctrine called the Abhidhamma. In the P\u0101li Nikayas, the Buddha teaches through an analytical method in which experience is explained using various conceptual groupings of physical and mental processes called \"dhammas\". Examples of lists of dhammas taught by the Buddha include the twelve sense 'spheres' or ayatanas, the five aggregates or khandha, and the eighteen elements of cognition or dhatus.\nTherav\u0101da traditionally promotes itself as the \"Vibhajjav\u0101da\" \"teaching of analysis\" and as the heirs to the Buddha's analytical method. Expanding this model, Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma scholasticism concerned itself with analyzing \"ultimate truth\" (\"paramattha-sacca\"), which it sees as being composed of \"all possible\" dhammas and their relationships. The central theory of the Abhidhamma is thus known as the \"dhamma theory\". \"Dhamma\" has been translated as \"factors\" (Collett Cox), \"psychic characteristics\" (Bronkhorst), \"psycho-physical events\" (Noa Ronkin), and \"phenomena\" (Nyanaponika Thera).\nAccording to the Sri Lankan scholar Y. Karunadasa, a dhammas (\"principles\" or \"elements\") are \"those items that result when the process of analysis is taken to its ultimate limits\". However, this does not mean that they have an independent existence, for it is \"only for the purposes of description\" that they are postulated. Noa Ronkin defines dhammas as \"the constituents of sentient experience; the irreducible 'building blocks' that make up one's world, albeit they are not static mental contents and certainly not substances.\" Thus, while in Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma, dhammas are the ultimate constituents of experience, they are not seen as substances, essences or independent particulars, since they are empty (\"su\u00f1\u00f1a\") of a self (\"att\u0101\") and conditioned. This is spelled out in the \"Patisambhidhamagga\", which states that dhammas are empty of svabhava (\"sabhavena su\u00f1\u00f1am\").\nAccording to Ronkin, the canonical P\u0101li Abhidhamma remains pragmatic and psychological, and \"does not take much interest in ontology\" in contrast with the Sarvastivada tradition. Paul Williams also notes that the Abhidhamma remains focused on the practicalities of insight meditation and leaves ontology \"relatively unexplored\". Ronkin does note, however, that later Therav\u0101da sub-commentaries (\"\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101\") do show a doctrinal shift towards ontological realism from the earlier epistemic and practical concerns.\nOn the other hand, Y. Karunadasa contends that the tradition of realism goes back to the earliest discourses, as opposed to developing only in later Theravada sub-commentaries:\nIf we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and, the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein.\nThe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma holds that there is a total of 82 possible types of dhammas, 81 of which are conditioned (\"sankhata\"), while one is unconditioned, which is \"nibbana\". The 81 conditioned dhammas are divided into three broad categories: consciousness (\"citta\"), associated mentality (\"cetasika\") and materiality, or physical phenomena (\"rupa\"). Since no dhamma exists independently, every single dhamma of consciousness, known as a \"citta\", arises associated (\"sampayutta\") with at least seven mental factors (\"cetasikas\"). In Abhidhamma, all awareness events are thus seen as being characterized by intentionality and never exist in isolation. Much of Abhidhamma philosophy deals with categorizing the different consciousnesses and their accompanying mental factors as well as their conditioned relationships (\"paccaya\").\nCosmology.\nThe P\u0101li Tipi\u1e6daka outlines a hierarchical cosmological system with various planes of existence (\"bhava\") into which sentient beings may be reborn depending on their past actions. Good actions lead one to the higher realms, and bad actions lead to the lower realms. However, even for the gods (\"devas\") in the higher realms like Indra, there is still death, loss and suffering.\nThe main categories of the planes of existence are:\nThese various planes of existence can be found in countless world systems (\"loka-dhatu\"), which are born, expand, contract, and are destroyed in a cyclical nature across vast expanses of time (measures in kappas). This cosmology is similar to other ancient Indian systems, such as the Jain cosmology. This entire cyclical multiverse of constant birth and death is called samsara. Outside of this system of samsara is \"nibbana\" (lit.\u2009'vanishing, quenching, blowing out'), a deathless (\"amata\") and transcendent reality, which is a total and final release (\"vimutti\") from all suffering (\"dukkha\") and rebirth.\nSoteriology and Buddhology.\nAccording to Therav\u0101da doctrine, release from suffering (i.e. \"nibbana\") is attained in four stages of awakening (\"bodhi\"):\nIn Therav\u0101da Buddhism, a Buddha is a sentient being who has discovered the path out of samsara by themselves, has reached Nibbana, and then makes the path available to others by teaching (known as \"turning the wheel of the Dhamma\"). A Buddha is also believed to have extraordinary powers and abilities (\"abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\"), such as the ability to read minds and fly through the air.\nThe Therav\u0101da canon depicts Gautama Buddha as the most recent Buddha in a line of previous Buddhas stretching back for aeons. They also mention the future Buddha, named Metteyya. Traditionally, the Therav\u0101da school also rejects the idea that there can be numerous Buddhas active in the world simultaneously. \nRegarding how a sentient being becomes a Buddha, the Therav\u0101da school also presents this path. Indeed, according to Buddhaghosa, there are three main soteriological paths: the path of the Buddhas (\"buddhay\u0101na\"); the way of the individual Buddhas (\"paccekabuddhay\u0101na\"); and the way of the disciples (\"s\u0101vakay\u0101na\").\nHowever, unlike in Mahayana Buddhism, the Therav\u0101da holds that the Buddha path is not for everyone and that beings on the Buddha path (\"bodhisattas\") are quite rare. While in Mahayana, bodhisattas refers to beings who have developed the wish to become Buddhas, Therav\u0101da (like other early Buddhist schools), defines a bodhisatta as someone who has resolved (\"abhin\u012bh\u0101ra\") to become a Buddha in front of a living Buddha, and has also received a confirmation from that Buddha that they will reach Buddhahood. \"Cariy\u0101pi\u1e6daka\" is a Therav\u0101da text which focuses on the path of the Buddhas, while the \"Nid\u0101nakath\u0101\" and the \"Buddhava\u1e43sa\" are also Therav\u0101da texts which discuss the Buddha's path.\nModern developments.\nThe modern era saw new developments in Therav\u0101da scholarship due to the influence of Western thought. As Donald K. Swearer writes: Although monastic education is still grounded in the study of Buddhist texts, doctrine, and the Pali language, the curricula of monastic colleges and universities also reflect subject matter and disciplines associated with Western education.Buddhist modernist trends can be traced to figures like Anagarika Dhammapala, King Mongkut, and the first prime minister of Burma U Nu. They promoted a form of Buddhism that was compatible with rationalism and science, and opposed to superstition and certain folk practices. Walpola Rahula's \"What the Buddha Taught\" is seen by scholars as an introduction to modernist Buddhist thought, and the book continues to be widely used in universities.\nAnother modern phenomenon is Buddhist philosophers who received an education in the West, such as K. N. Jayatilleke (a student of Wittgenstein at Cambridge) and Hammalawa Saddhatissa (who received his Phd at Edinburgh), going on to write modern works on Buddhist philosophy (\"Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge\", 1963 and \"Buddhist Ethics\", 1987 respectively). Henepola Gunaratana is another modern Therav\u0101da scholar who studied philosophy in the West (at the American University). The modern encounter with Christian missionaries also led to new debates (such as the Panadura debate) and doctrinal works written in defense of Buddhism or attacking Christian ideas, such as Gunapala Dharmasiri's \"A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God\" (1988).\nThere have also been several modern Therav\u0101da scholars who have taken a historical-critical perspective on Therav\u0101da literature and doctrine, attempting to understand its historical development. Some of these figures, such as David Kalupahana, Buddhadasa, and Bhikkhu Sujato, have criticized traditional Therav\u0101da commentators like Buddhaghosa for their doctrinal innovations which differ in significant ways from the early Buddhist texts.\nThe modern era also saw new Buddhist works on topics which pre-modern Buddhists avoided, such as socially engaged Buddhism and Buddhist economics. Thinkers such as Buddhadasa, Sulak Sivaraksa, Prayudh Payutto, Neville Karunatilake, and Padmasiri de Silva have written on these topics. Modern scholarship in Western languages by Western Buddhist monks such as Nyanatiloka, Nyanaponika, Nyanamoli, Bhikkhu Bodhi, and Analayo is another recent development in the Therav\u0101da world.\nPractice (\"pa\u1e6dipatti\").\nTextual basis.\nIn the P\u0101li Canon, the path (\"magga\") or way (\"patipada\") of Buddhist practice is described in various ways, one of the most widely used frameworks in Therav\u0101da is the Noble Eightfold Path:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Noble Eightfold Path can also be summarized as the Three Noble Disciplines of s\u012bla (moral conduct or discipline), Sam\u0101dhi (meditation or concentration) and Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (understanding or wisdom).\nTherav\u0101da orthodoxy takes the seven stages of purification as outlined in the \"Visuddhimagga\" as the basic outline of the path to be followed. The \"Visuddhimagga\", a Sinhala Therav\u0101da doctrinal \"summa\" written in the fifth century by Buddhaghosa, became the orthodox account of the Therav\u0101da path to liberation in Sri Lanka after the 12th century and this influence spread to other Therav\u0101da nations. It gives the sequence of seven purifications, in three sections:\nThis basic outline is based on the threefold discipline. The emphasis is on understanding the three marks of existence, which removes ignorance. Understanding destroys the ten fetters and leads to Nibbana.\nTherav\u0101dins believe that every individual is personally responsible for achieving their own self-awakening and liberation, each being responsible for their own karma (actions and consequences). Applying knowledge acquired through direct experience and personal realization is more heavily emphasized than beliefs about the nature of reality as revealed by the Buddha.\nMoral conduct.\nGiving (Dana) is an important Buddhist virtue. The community of monastics is seen as the most meritorious field of karmic fruitfulness.\nS\u012bla, meaning moral conduct, is mainly defined as right speech, right action, and right livelihood. It is primarily understood through the doctrine of kamma. In Therav\u0101da, one's previous intentional actions strongly influence one's present experience. Whatever intended actions are carried out will have future consequences, whether in this life or subsequent lives. Intention is central to the idea of kamma. Actions done with good intentions, even if they have bad results, will not have negative kammic consequences.\nSeveral sets of precepts or moral trainings (\"sikkh\u0101pada\") guide right action. After taking Refuge in the Triple Gems, lay Therav\u0101din Buddhists traditionally take the Five precepts (whether for life or for a limited time) in the presence of Sangha. Laypeople also sometimes take an extended set of Eight precepts, which includes chastity during sacred days of observance such as Uposatha.\nPerforming good deeds is another important feature of Therav\u0101din Buddhist ethics. Doing so is said to make \"merit\" (pu\u00f1\u00f1a), which results in a better rebirth. The \"ten wholesome actions\" is a common list of good deeds:\nMeditation.\nMeditation (P\u0101li: \"Bh\u0101van\u0101,\" literally \"causing to become\" or cultivation) means the positive cultivation of one's mind.\nForms.\nTherav\u0101da Buddhist meditation practice varies considerably in technique and objects. Currently, there are also various traditions of Therav\u0101da meditation practice, such as the Burmese Vipassana tradition, the Thai Forest Tradition, the esoteric \"Bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na\" ('ancient practices'), the Burmese Weikza tradition, Dhammakaya meditation and the Western Insight Meditation movement.\nTherav\u0101da Buddhist meditation practices or Bhavana (mental cultivation) are categorized into two broad categories: Samatha bhavana (calming), and Vipassan\u0101 bhavana (investigation, insight). Originally these referred to effects or qualities of meditation, but after the time of Buddhaghosa, they also referred to two distinct meditation types or paths (\"y\u0101na\").\n\"Samatha\" (\"calm\") consists of meditation techniques in which the mind is focused on a single object, thought, or gatha, leading to \"Sam\u0101dhi\"'. In traditional Therav\u0101da it is considered to be the base for \"vipassan\u0101\" (\"insight\"). In the Therav\u0101da-tradition, as early as the P\u0101li Nikayas, the four \"jh\u0101nas\" are regarded as a \"samatha\"-practice. The eighth and final step of the Eightfold Path, Right Samadhi, is often defined as the four jhanas. In the P\u0101li Nikayas, Jh\u0101nas are described as preceding the awakening insight of the Buddha, which turned him into an awakened being. Yet the interpretation of \"jhana\" as single-pointed concentration and calm may be a later re-interpretation in which the original aim of \"jhana\" was lost.\n\"Vipassana\" (\"insight\", \"clear seeing\") refers to practices that aim to develop an inner understanding or knowledge of the nature of phenomena (\"dhammas\"), especially the characteristics of \"dukkha\", \"anatta\" and \"anicca\", which are seen as being universally applicable to all constructed phenomena (\"sankhata-dhammas\"). \"Vipassana\" is also described as insight into dependent origination, the five aggregates, the sense spheres and the Four Noble Truths. It is the primary focus of the modernist Burmese Vipassana movement. In western countries it is complemented with the four divine abidings, the development of loving-kindness and compassion.\n\"Vipassana\" practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of \"sila\", morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires. The practitioner then engages in \"anapanasati\", mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the Satipatthana Sutta as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then simply to watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short. In the \"New Burmese Method\" the practitioner pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitaka, noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (\"breathing, breathing\"), without engaging the phenomenon with conceptual thinking. By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena the meditator becomes aware of how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five \"skandhas\" and \"pa\u1e6diccasamupp\u0101da\". The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness. This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into dukkha, anatta, and anicca. When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general without necessarily naming them.\nAccording to Vajiran\u0101\u1e47a Mahathera, writing from a traditional and text-based point of view, in the P\u0101li Canon whether one begins the practice by way of samatha or by way of vipassan\u0101 is generally seen as depending on one's temperament. According to Vajiran\u0101\u1e47a Mahathera, it is generally held that there are two kinds of individuals. Those of a passionate disposition (or those who enter the path by faith) attain Arahatship through vipassan\u0101 preceded by samatha. Those of a skeptical disposition (or those who enter by way of wisdom or the intellect) achieve it through samatha preceded by vipassan\u0101.\nAims of meditation.\nTraditionally, the ultimate goal of the practice is to achieve mundane and supramundane wisdom. Mundane wisdom is the insight in the three marks of existence. The development of this insight leads to four supramundane paths and fruits, these experiences consist a direct apprehension of Nibbana. Supramundane (\"lokuttara)\" wisdom refers to that which transcends the world of samsara.\nApart from nibbana, there are various reasons why traditional Therav\u0101da Buddhism advocates meditation, including a good rebirth, supranormal powers, combating fear and preventing danger. Recent modernist Therav\u0101dins have tended to focus on the psychological benefits and psychological well-being.\nHistorical development and sources.\nThe practice of Therav\u0101da meditation can be traced back to the 5th century exegete Buddhaghosa, who systematized the classic Therav\u0101da meditation, dividing them into samatha and vipassana types and listing 40 different forms (known as \"kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nas\", \"workplaces\") in his magnum opus, the Visuddhimagga. This text has remained central for the study and practice of Therav\u0101da meditation. Buddhaghosa's commentary on the \"Satipatthana sutta\" (\"Bases of mindfulness discourse\"), as well as the source text itself, are also another important source for meditation in this tradition. Buddhaghosa's work drew heavily on the Pali suttas as well as the Pali Abhidhamma. Kate Crosby notes that Buddhaghosa's work also \"explicitly refers to the contemporaneous existence of secret meditation manuals but not to their content.\"\nRegarding post Visuddhimagga Therav\u0101da meditation, according to Kate Crosby, In the period between the Visuddhimagga and the present, there have been numerous meditation texts, both manuals and descriptive treatises. Many of the texts found in manuscript collections relate to meditation, some on a single, simple subject such as the recollection of the qualities of the Buddha, others more complex. Little research has been done to assess their variety. One difficulty is that meditation manuals as such are often in a mixture of a classical language, that is, Pali, and a vernacular that may or may not be a currently used language. Also, actual manuals often contain prompts or reminders rather than an in-depth explanation. In recent years it has emerged that there is still extant a relatively high number of manuals and related texts pertaining to a system of meditation called \u2013 among other things \u2013 bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na or yog\u0101vacara. Its core text, the M\u016bla-kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na \"original, fundamental or basic meditation practice,\" circulated under a number of different titles, or without a title, throughout the Tai\u2013Lao\u2013Khmer and Sri Lankan Buddhist worlds. Some versions of this text are simple lists of kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na and from that perspective look entirely in accord with the Visuddhimagga or Theravada Abhidhamma texts. Other versions contain extensive narratives, explanations of symbolism, and of the somatic locations involved in the practice that make it clear that we are dealing with techniques of practice not described in the Canon or Visuddhimagga.According to Crosby, the esoteric bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na or yog\u0101vacara meditation tradition was the dominant form of meditation in the Therav\u0101da world during the 18th century, and may date as far back as the 16th century. Crosby notes that this tradition of meditation involved a rich collection of symbols, somatic methods and visualizations which included \"the physical internalisation or manifestation of aspects of the Theravada path by incorporating them at points in the body between the nostril and navel.\" In spite of the novel elements in this meditation tradition, close study of bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na texts reveals that they are closely connected to Theravada Abhidhamma and the works of Buddhaghosa. Modernist reforms which emphasized Pali Canon study, a shift in state support to other traditions and modern wars in Indochina led to this tradition's decline, and it now only survives in a few Cambodian and Thai temples. \nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, the Therav\u0101da world saw a modernist revival and reinvention of meditation practice, as exemplified by the Burmese Vipassana movement. According to Buswell \"vipassana,\" \"appears to have fallen out of practice\" by the 10th century, due to the belief that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of \"Maitreya\". The practice was revived in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by Medawi (1728\u20131816) and by later figures such as Ledi Sayadaw and Mah\u0101s\u012b Sayadaw during the 19th and 20th centuries. These Burmese figures re-invented \"vipassana\"-meditation and developed simplified meditation techniques, based on the \"Satipatthana sutta\", the \"Visuddhimagga\", and other texts, emphasizing \"satipatthana\" and bare insight. These techniques were globally popularized by the Vipassana movement in the second half of the 20th century.\nSimilar revival movements developed in Thailand, such as the Thai forest tradition and Dhammakaya meditation. These traditions are influenced by the older bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na forms. Thailand and Cambodia also saw attempts to preserve and revive the ancient \"bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na\" tradition of meditation. In Sri Lanka, the new Buddhist traditions of the Amarapura and R\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1a Nik\u0101yas developed their own meditation forms based on the Pali Suttas, the Visuddhimagga, and other manuals, while bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na mostly disappeared by the end of the 19th century.\nThough the \"Vipassana movement\" has popularised meditation both in traditional Therav\u0101da countries among the laity, and in western countries, \"meditation plays a minor if not negligible role in the lives of the majority of Therav\u0101da monks.\" Meditation is especially popular laypersons, especially during special religious holidays or in their old age, when they have more free time to spend at the temple. Buddhist modernists tend to present Buddhism as rational and scientific, and this has also affected how Vipassana meditation has been taught and presented. This has led in some quarters to a playing down of older non-empirical elements of Therav\u0101da, associated with 'superstition'. Strains of older, traditional Therav\u0101da meditation known as \"bor\u0101n kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na\" still exist, but this tradition has mostly been eclipsed by the Buddhist modernist meditation movements.\nOther practices.\nLaypersons and monks also perform various types of religious practices daily or during Buddhist holidays. One of these is keeping a Buddhist shrine with a picture or statue of the Buddha for devotional practice in one's home, mirroring the larger shrines at temples. It is common to offer candles, incense, flowers and other objects to these shrine. Gestures of respect are also done in front of Buddha images and shrines, mainly the respectful salutation with the hands (\"a\u00f1jalikamma\"), and the five-limb prostration (\"pa\u00f1c'anga-vandana\").\nBuddhist forms of chanting is also widely practiced by both monks and laypersons, who may recite famous phrases such as the taking of refuge, the Metta Sutta and the Mangala Sutta in front of their shrine. Chanting may also be part of the practice of recollection (anussati), which refers to contemplating various topics such as the sublime qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha or the five subjects for daily recollection. This may be done as part of a daily puja ritual.\nAnother important religious practice for the devout is the keeping of special religious holidays known as Uposatha which are based on a lunar calendar. Laypersons commonly take the eight precepts while visiting a temple or monastery and commit to focusing on Buddhist practice for the day.\nStudy (\"ganthadhura\") of the Buddhist texts and listening to Dhamma talks by monks or teachers are also important practices.\nLay and monastic life.\nDistinction between lay and monastic life.\nTraditionally, Therav\u0101da Buddhism has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a lay person and the practices undertaken by ordained monks (in ancient times, there was a separate body of practices for nuns). While the possibility of significant attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the Therav\u0101da, it generally occupies a position of less prominence than in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving Nibbana. The view that Therav\u0101da, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a monastic tradition has, however, been disputed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some Western scholars have erroneously tried to claim that Mah\u0101y\u0101na is primarily a religion for laymen and Therav\u0101da is a primarily monastic religion. Both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Therav\u0101da have as their foundation strong monastic communities, which are almost identical in their regulations. Schools of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism without monastic communities of fully ordained monks and nuns are relatively recent and atypical developments, usually based on cultural and historical considerations rather than differences in fundamental doctrine. Both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Therav\u0101da also provided a clear and important place for lay followers.\u2014\u200a\nThis distinction between ordained monks and laypeople\u00a0\u2013 as well as the distinction between those practices advocated by the P\u0101li Canon, and the folk religious elements embraced by many monks\u00a0\u2013 have motivated some scholars to consider Therav\u0101da Buddhism to be composed of multiple separate traditions, overlapping though still distinct. Most prominently, the anthropologist Melford Spiro in his work \"Buddhism and Society\" separated Burmese Therav\u0101da into three groups: Apotropaic Buddhism (concerned with providing protection from evil spirits), Kammatic Buddhism (concerned with making merit for a future birth), and Nibbanic Buddhism (concerned with attaining the liberation of Nibbana, as described in the Tipitaka). He stresses that all three are firmly rooted in the P\u0101li Canon. These categories are not accepted by all scholars, and are usually considered non-exclusive by those who employ them.\nThe role of lay people has traditionally been primarily occupied with activities that are commonly termed \"merit-making\" (falling under Spiro's category of kammatic Buddhism). Merit-making activities include offering food and other basic necessities to monks, making donations to temples and monasteries, burning incense or lighting candles before images of the Buddha, chanting protective or scriptural verses from the Pali Canon, building roads and bridges, charity to the needy and providing drinking water to strangers along roadside. Some lay practitioners have always chosen to take a more active role in religious affairs, while still maintaining their lay status. Dedicated lay men and women sometimes act as trustees or custodians for their temples, taking part in the financial planning and management of the temple. Others may volunteer significant time in tending to the mundane needs of local monks (by cooking, cleaning, maintaining temple facilities, etc.). Study of the P\u0101li scriptures and the practice of meditation are less common among the lay community in the past, though in the 20th century these areas have become more popular to the lay community, especially in Thailand.\nA number of senior monastics in the Thai Forest Tradition, including Buddhadasa, Ajahn Maha Bua, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Pasanno, and Ajahn Jayasaro, have begun teaching meditation retreats outside of the monastery for lay disciples. Ajahn Sumedho, a disciple of Ajahn Chah, founded the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in Hertfordshire, which has a retreat center specifically for lay retreats. Sumedho extended this to Harnham in Northumberland as Aruna Ratanagiri under the present guidance of Ajahn Munindo, another disciple of Ajahn Chah.\nLay devotee.\nIn P\u0101li the word for a male lay devotee is Upasaka and a female devotee is Upasika. One of the duties of the lay followers, as taught by the Buddha, is to look after the needs of the monk/nuns. They are to see that the monk/nuns do not suffer from lack of the four requisites: food, clothing, shelter and medicine. As neither monks nor nuns are allowed to have an occupation, they depend entirely on the laity for their sustenance. In return for this charity, they are expected to lead exemplary lives.\nIn Myanmar and Thailand, the monastery was and is still regarded as a seat of learning. Therav\u0101din monasteries have been providing free education to many children since ancient times. In fact, today about half of the primary schools in Thailand are located in monasteries. Religious rituals and ceremonies held in a monastery are always accompanied by social activities. In times of crisis, it is to the monks that people bring their problems for counsel and monks often took up the role of mediators in most disputes. Traditionally, a ranking monk will deliver a sermon four times a month: when the moon waxes and wanes and the day before the new and full moons. The laity also have a chance to learn meditation from the monks during these times.\nIt is also possible for a lay disciple to become enlightened. As Bhikkhu Bodhi notes, \"The Suttas and commentaries do record a few cases of lay disciples attaining the final goal of Nirvana. However, such disciples either attain Arahantship on the brink of death or enter the monastic order soon after their attainment. They do not continue to dwell at home as Arahant householders, for dwelling at home is incompatible with the state of one who has severed all craving.\"\nIn the modern era, it is now common for lay disciples to practice meditation, attend lay meditation centers and even aim for awakening. The impetus for this trend began in Myanmar and was supported by prime minister U Nu who himself established the International Meditation Center (IMC) in Yangon. Modern lay teachers such as U Ba Khin (who was also the Accountant General of the Union of Burma) promoted meditation as part of a laypersons daily routine. According to Donald K Swearer, another development in modern Therav\u0101da is \"the formation of lay Buddhist associations that have partially assumed the social service responsibilities formerly associated with the monastery\". These include social service and activist organizations such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association of Colombo, the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, the Sarvodaya Shramadana of A. T. Ariyaratne, the NGO's founded by Sulak Sivaraksa such as Santi Pracha.\nMonastic vocation.\nTherav\u0101da sources dating back to medieval Sri Lanka (2nd century BCE to 10th century CE) such as the Mahavamsa show that monastic roles in the tradition were often seen as being in a polarity between urban monks (Sinhala: , P\u0101li: \"g\u0101mavas\u012b\") on one end and rural forest monks (Sinhala: , Pali: \"ara\u00f1\u00f1avasi, nagaravasi\", also known as \"Tapassin\") on the other. The ascetic focused monks were known by the names \"Pamsukulikas\" (rag robe wearers) and \"Ara\u00f1\u00f1ikas\" (forest dwellers).\nThe Mahavamsa mentions forest monks associated with the Mahavihara. The P\u0101li Dhammapada Commentary mentions another split based on the \"duty of study\" and the \"duty of contemplation\". This second division has traditionally been seen as corresponding with the city \u2013 forest split, with the city monks focusing on the vocation of books (\"ganthadhura\") or learning (\"pariyatti\") while the forest monks leaning more towards meditation (\"vipassanadhura\") and practice (\"patipatti\"). However this opposition is not consistent, and urban monasteries have often promoted meditation while forest communities have also produced excellent scholars, such as the Island Hermitage of Nyanatiloka.\nScholar monks generally undertake the path of studying and preserving Therav\u0101da's P\u0101li literature. Forest monks tend to be the minority among Therav\u0101da sanghas and also tend to focus on asceticism (\"dhutanga\") and meditative praxis. They view themselves as living closer to the ideal set forth by the Buddha, and are often perceived as such by lay folk, while at the same time often being on the margins of the Buddhist establishment and on the periphery of the social order.\nWhile this divide seems to have been in existence for some time in the Therav\u0101da school, only in the 10th century is a specifically forest monk monastery, mentioned as existing near Anuradhapura, called \"Tapavana\". This division was then carried over into the rest of Southeast Asia as Therav\u0101da spread.\nToday there are forest based traditions in most Therav\u0101da countries, including the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition, the Thai Forest Tradition as well as lesser known forest based traditions in Burma and Laos, such as the Burmese forest based monasteries (\"taw\"yar\") of the Pa Auk Sayadaw. In Thailand, forest monks are known as \"phra thudong\" (ascetic wandering monks) or \"phra thudong kammathan\" (wandering ascetic meditator).\nOrdination.\nThe minimum age for ordaining as a Buddhist monk is 20 years, which is calculated from conception. Those under this age can perform traditional ceremonies such as \"shinbyu,\" in Myanmar, in order to ordain as novices (s\u0101ma\u1e47era). Novices shave their heads, wear the yellow robes, and observe the Ten Precepts. While there is no explicit minimum age for novices prescribed in the scriptures, it is traditionally accepted that boys as young as seven can be accepted for ordination. This tradition echoes the story of the Buddha's son, Rahula, who was allowed to become a novice at the age of seven. Both monks and nuns are expected to adhere to a specific code of discipline, of which monks follow 227 rules, and nuns follow 311.\nIn most Therav\u0101da countries, it is a common practice for young men to ordain as monks for a fixed period of time. In Thailand and Myanmar, young men typically ordain for the retreat during Vassa, the three-month monsoon season, though shorter or longer periods of ordination are not rare. Traditionally, temporary ordination was even more flexible among Laotians. Once they had undergone their initial ordination as young men, Laotian men were permitted to temporarily ordain again at any time, though married men were expected to seek their wife's permission. Throughout Southeast Asia, there is little stigma attached to leaving the monastic life. Monks regularly leave the robes after acquiring an education, or when compelled by family obligations or ill health.\nOrdaining as a monk, even for a short period, is seen as having many virtues. In many Southeast Asian cultures, it is seen as a means for a young man to \"repay his gratitude\" to his parents for their work and effort in raising him, because the merit from his ordination is dedicated for their well-being. Thai men who have ordained as a monk may be seen as more mature and suitable husbands by Thai women, who refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning \"ripe\" to indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage. Particularly in rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally offered peasant boys an opportunity to receive free education in temple schools with sponsorship and accommodation.\nIn Sri Lanka, temporary ordination is not practised, and a monk leaving the order is frowned upon but not condemned. The continuing influence of the caste system in Sri Lanka plays a role in the taboo against temporary or permanent ordination as a bhikkhu in some orders. Though Sri Lankan orders are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during their time as monks may act (or be treated) in a way that would not be in line with the expected duties and privileges of their caste.\nFor those born in Western countries who wish to become Buddhist monks or nuns, it is possible to undertake the lifestyle in their home countries, among other Buddhist monastics in Western countries, or to travel and take up residence in a Buddhist monastery in Asian countries such as Sri Lanka or Thailand. In countries where Buddhism is deeply rooted, it can often be easier to adhere to the lifestyle of a monk or nun, as it requires considerable discipline to successfully live by the non-secular rules and regulations for which Buddhist practices are known. For instance, Therav\u0101da monastics are typically required to abstain from activities such as working, handling money, listening to music and cooking. Such obligations can be especially challenging in non-Buddhist societies.\nSome of the more well-known Therav\u0101din monks are Ajahn Mun, Ajahn Chah, Ledi Sayadaw, Webu Sayadaw, Narada Maha Thera, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Buddhadasa, Mahasi Sayadaw, Nyanatiloka Mahathera, Nyanaponika Thera, Preah Maha Ghosananda, U Pandita, Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Khemadhammo, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Sucitto, Ajahn Jayasaro, Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Walpola Rahula Thero, Henepola Gunaratana, Bhaddanta \u0100ci\u1e47\u1e47a, Bhante Yogavacara Rahula, Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro, K. Sri Dhammananda, Sayadaw U Tejaniya and Bhikkhu Analayo.\nMonastic practices.\nThe practices usually vary in different sub-schools and monasteries within Therav\u0101da. But in the most orthodox forest monastery, the monk usually models his practice and lifestyle on that of the Buddha and his first generation of disciples by living close to nature in forest, mountains and caves. Forest monasteries still keep alive the ancient traditions through following the Buddhist monastic code of discipline in all its detail and developing meditation in secluded forests.\nIn a typical daily routine at the monastery during the 3-month vassa period, the monk will wake up before dawn and will begin the day with group chanting and meditation. At dawn the monks will go out to surrounding villages bare-footed on alms-round and will have the only meal of the day before noon by eating from the bowl by hand. Most of the time is spent on Dhamma study and meditation. Sometimes the abbot or a senior monk will give a Dhamma talk to the visitors. Laity who stay at the monastery will have to abide by the traditional eight Buddhist precepts.\nThe life of the monk or nun in a community is much more complex than the life of the forest monk. In the Buddhist society of Sri Lanka, most monks spend hours every day in taking care of the needs of lay people such as preaching \"bana,\" accepting alms, officiating funerals, teaching \"dhamma\" to adults and children in addition to providing social services to the community.\nAfter the end of the Vassa period, many of the monks will go out far away from the monastery to find a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their umbrella tents and where it is suitable for the work of self-development. When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along. These generally consist of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and a candle lantern.\nThe monks do not fix their times for walking and sitting meditation, for as soon as they are free, they just start doing it; nor do they determine for how long they will go on to meditate. Some of them sometimes walk from dusk to dawn whereas at other times they may walk from between two and seven hours. Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation.\nThose monks who have been able to achieve a high level of attainment will be able to guide the junior monks and lay Buddhists toward the four degrees of spiritual attainment.\nBhikkhunis.\nA few years after the arrival of Mahinda, the bhikkhu Sa\u1e45ghamitt\u0101, who is also believed to have been the daughter of Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka. She ordained the first nuns in Sri Lanka. In 429, by request of China's emperor, nuns from Anuradhapura were sent to China to establish the order there, which subsequently spread across East Asia. The pr\u0101timok\u1e63a of the nun's order in East Asian Buddhism is the Dharmaguptaka, which is different from the pr\u0101timok\u1e63a of the current Therav\u0101da school; the specific ordination of the early Sangha in Sri Lanka not known, although the Dharmaguptaka sect originated with the Sth\u0101vir\u012bya as well.\nThe nun's order subsequently died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century and in Burma in the 13th century. It had already died out around the 10th century in other Therav\u0101din areas. Novice ordination has also disappeared in those countries. Therefore, women who wish to live as renunciates in those countries must do so by taking eight or ten precepts. Neither laywomen nor formally ordained, these women do not receive the recognition, education, financial support or status enjoyed by Buddhist men in their countries. These \"precept-holders\" live in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. In particular, the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. Japan is a special case as, although it has neither the bhikkhuni nor novice ordinations, the precept-holding nuns who live there do enjoy a higher status and better education than their precept-holder sisters elsewhere, and can even become Zen priests. In Tibet there is currently no bhikkhuni ordination, but the Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.\nIn 1996, 11 selected Sri Lankan women were ordained fully as Therav\u0101da bhikkhunis by a team of Therav\u0101da monks in concert with a team of Korean nuns in India. There is disagreement among Therav\u0101da vinaya authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. The Dambulla chapter of the Siam Nikaya in Sri Lanka also carried out a nun's ordination at this time, specifically stating their ordination process was a valid Therav\u0101din process where the other ordination session was not. This chapter has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns since then. This has been criticized by leading figures in the Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya, and the governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has declared that there can be no valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.\nIn 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun; when she received full ordination in 2000, her dwelling became America's first Therav\u0101da Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara.\nA 55-year-old Thai Buddhist 8-precept white-robed maechee nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first woman to receive the going-forth ceremony of a novice (and the gold robe) in Thailand, in 2002. On 28 February 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive bhikkhuni ordination as a Therav\u0101da nun.\nDhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. The Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law passed in 1928 banning women's full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter to laws protecting freedom of religion. However, Thailand's two main Therav\u0101da Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks.\nIn 2009 in Australia four women received bhikkhuni ordination as Therav\u0101da nuns, the first time such ordination had occurred in Australia. It was performed in Perth, Australia, on 22 October 2009 at Bodhinyana Monastery. Abbess Vayama together with Venerables Nirodha, Seri, and Hasapanna were ordained as Bhikkhunis by a dual Sangha act of Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis in full accordance with the P\u0101li Vinaya.\nIn 2010, in the US, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Therav\u0101da tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. Henepola Gunaratana and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.\nThe first bhikkhuni ordination in Germany, the ordination of German woman Samaneri Dhira, occurred on 21 June 2015 at Anenja Vihara.\nIn Indonesia, the first Therav\u0101da ordination of bhikkhunis in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung in West Java. Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.\nMonastic orders.\nTherav\u0101da monks typically belong to a particular \"nikaya\", variously referred to as monastic orders or fraternities. These different orders do not typically develop separate doctrines, but may differ in the manner in which they observe monastic rules. These monastic orders represent lineages of ordination, typically tracing their origin to a particular group of monks that established a new ordination tradition within a particular country or geographic area. \nIn Myanmar, all the monastic orders are called gaing () or ga\u1e47a () instead of nik\u0101ya, although some orders include Nik\u0101ya () in addition to Gaing in their names. Currently, it is prohibited by law to establish gaings other than the nine major gaings sanctioned in 1980. Other monastic orders and sects have to merge with these nine gaings, while some sects are totally banned.\nIn Sri Lanka caste plays a major role in the division into nikayas. Some Therav\u0101da Buddhist countries appoint or elect a sangharaja, or Supreme Patriarch of the Sangha, as the highest ranking or seniormost monk in a particular area, or from a particular nikaya. The demise of monarchies has resulted in the suspension of these posts in some countries, but patriarchs have continued to be appointed in Thailand. Cambodia ended the practice of appointing a sangharaja for some time, but the position was later restored, though it lapsed again.\nImpact on modern society.\nTherav\u0101da Buddhism's emphasis on mindfulness and meditation practices has influenced modern society by promoting mental well-being and stress reduction techniques leading to the integration of mindfulness in various therapeutic and self-improvement programs. Additionally, its teachings on ethical conduct and compassion continue to inspire individuals and organizations to prioritize moral values and social responsibility in their actions and decision-making. The emphasis on ethical conduct in Theravada Buddhism encourages individuals to lead virtuous lives. This includes refraining from actions that harm others, such as lying, stealing, and harming living beings. These principles promote personal integrity and honesty in modern society. Buddhism encourages the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness (metta) towards all sentient beings. In contemporary society, these teachings inspire individuals and organizations to prioritize social responsibility, charitable activities, and humanitarian efforts aimed at alleviating suffering and promoting the welfare of others. Theravada Buddhism places significant emphasis on self-awareness and self-transformation. Practitioners are encouraged to explore the nature of the self (anatta), impermanence (anicca), and the nature of suffering (dukkha). These teachings have inspired individuals in modern society to embark on journeys of self-discovery, self-improvement, and personal growth. The teachings on mindfulness and the impermanence of life have provided individuals with effective tools for coping with stress and life's challenges. In today's fast-paced and often stressful world, these teachings offer valuable strategies for maintaining balance and emotional stability. This journey of mindfulness and mental health has been strengthened by top institutions encouraging the idea of mindfulness and the effects it has on people. The mindfulness classes/courses/programs provided by many top universities and institutions such as Yale, Stanford, etc. to their students, staff, and general public have benefited them\nDemographics.\nTherav\u0101da Buddhism is practiced in the following countries and by people worldwide:\nToday, Therav\u0101dins number over 150\u00a0million worldwide, and during the past few decades Therav\u0101da Buddhism has begun to take root in the West and in the Buddhist revival in India.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrinted sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, having eye color is a \"character\" of an organism, while blue, brown and hazel versions of eye color are \"traits\". The term \"trait\" is generally used in genetics, often to describe the phenotypic expression of different combinations of alleles in different individual organisms within a single population, such as the famous purple vs. white flower coloration in Gregor Mendel's pea plants. By contrast, in systematics, the term \"character state\" is employed to describe features that represent fixed diagnostic differences among taxa, such as the absence of tails in great apes, relative to other primate groups.\nDefinition.\nA phenotypic trait is an obvious, observable, and measurable characteristic of an organism; it is the expression of genes in an observable way. An example of a phenotypic trait is a specific hair color or eye color. Underlying genes, that make up the genotype, determine the hair color, but the hair color observed is the phenotype. \nThe phenotype is dependent on the genetic make-up of the organism, but is also influenced by the environmental conditions that the organism was subjected to during its ontogenetic development, including various epigenetic processes. \nRegardless of the degree of influence of genotype versus environment, the phenotype encompasses all of the characteristics of an organism, including traits at multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from behavior and evolutionary history of life traits (e.g., litter size), through morphology (e.g., body height and composition), physiology (e.g., blood pressure), cellular characteristics (e.g., membrane lipid composition, mitochondrial densities), components of biochemical pathways, and even messenger RNA.\nGenetic origin of traits in diploid organisms.\nDifferent phenotypic traits are caused by different forms of genes, or alleles, which arise by mutation in a single individual and are passed on to successive generations.\nBiochemistry of dominance and extensions to expression of traits.\nThe biochemistry of the intermediate proteins determines how they interact in the cell. Therefore, biochemistry predicts how different combinations of alleles will produce varying traits.\nExtended expression patterns seen in diploid organisms include facets of incomplete dominance, codominance, and multiple alleles. Incomplete dominance is the condition in which neither allele dominates the other in one heterozygote. Instead the phenotype is intermediate in heterozygotes. Thus you can tell that each allele is present in the heterozygote. Codominance refers to the allelic relationship that occurs when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygote, and both phenotypes are seen simultaneously. Multiple alleles refers to the situation when there are more than 2 common alleles of a particular gene. Blood groups in humans is a classic example. The ABO blood group proteins are important in\ndetermining blood type in humans, and this is determined by different alleles of the one locus.\nContinuum versus categorical traits.\nSchizotypy is an example of a psychological phenotypic trait found in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Studies have shown that gender and age influences the expression of schizotypal traits. For instance, certain schizotypal traits may develop further during adolescence, whereas others stay the same during this period.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Four models were made: the Trabant 500, Trabant 600, Trabant 601, and the Trabant 1.1. The first model, the 500, was a relatively modern car when it was introduced.\nIt featured detachable duroplast body panels on a galvanised steel unibody chassis, front-wheel drive, a transverse two-stroke engine, and independent suspension. Because this 1950s design remained largely unchanged until the introduction of the last model, the Trabant 1.1 in 1990, the Trabant became symbolic of the former East Germany's stagnant economy and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in general. Called \"a spark plug with a roof\", 3,096,999 Trabants were produced. Older models have been sought by collectors in the United States due to their low cost and fewer restrictions on the importation of antique cars. The Trabant also gained a following among car tuning and rallying enthusiasts.\nOverview.\nThe German word \"Trabant\", derived from Middle High German \"drabant\", means 'satellite' or 'companion'. The car's name was inspired by the Soviet Sputnik satellite. The cars are often referred to as \"Trabbi\" or \"Trabi\". Produced without major changes for nearly 30 years, the Trabant became the most common automobile in East Germany. It came to symbolise the country during the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, as images of East Germans crossing the border into West Germany were broadcast around the globe.\nManufactured by a state monopoly, a Trabant took about ten years to acquire. East German buyers were placed on a waiting list of up to thirteen years. The waiting time depended on their proximity to Berlin, the capital. Official state price was 7,450 GDR marks and the demand to production ratio was forty three to one (1989). The free market price for a second-hand one was more than twice the price of a new one.\nThe Trabant had a steel frame, with the roof, boot lid, bonnet, wings and doors made of duroplast, a hard plastic made from recycled cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins from the East German dye industry. It was the second car with a body made of recycled material; the first was the AWZ P70 Zwickau, produced from 1955 to 1959. The material was durable, and the average lifespan of a Trabant was 28 years.\nThe Trabant's build quality was poor, and it was loud and slow.\nThe car had four principal variants:\nThe engine for the 500, 600 and the original 601 was a small two-stroke engine with two cylinders, accounting for the vehicle's modest performance. Its curb weight was about . When it ceased production in 1989, the Trabant delivered from displacement.\nIt took 21 seconds to accelerate from zero to its top speed of .\nThe engine produced a very smoky exhaust and was a significant source of air pollution \u2013 nine times the hydrocarbons and five times the carbon-monoxide emissions of the average 2007 European car. Its fuel consumption was . Since the engine was two-stroke, oil had to be added to the fuel tank at a 50:1 (or 33:1) ratio of fuel to oil at each fill-up. Contemporary gas stations in countries where two-stroke engines were common sold a premixed gas-oil mixture at the pump. Because the Trabant had no fuel pump, its fuel tank was above the engine so fuel could reach the carburettor by gravity; this increased the risk of fire in front-end accidents. Earlier models had no fuel gauge, and a dipstick was inserted into the tank to determine how much fuel remained.\nKnown for its dull colour scheme and cramped, uncomfortable ride, the Trabant is an object of ridicule for many Germans and is regarded as symbolic of the fall of the Eastern Bloc. Known as a \"spark plug with a roof\" because of its small size, the car did gain public affection.\nIts design remained essentially unchanged from its introduction in the late 1950s, and the last model was introduced in 1990. The 1980s model had no tachometer, no indicator for either the headlights or turn signals, no fuel gauge, no rear seat belts, no external fuel door, and drivers had to pour a mix of gasoline and oil into a tank located directly under the bonnet/hood. For comparison, the West German Volkswagen Beetle received a number of updates (including improvements in efficiency) over a similar period, although, with imported components, the 1990 Trabant 1.1 did have major changes including the engine (VW Polo engine) and increasing fuel efficiency.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nVEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau had its origins in the former Auto Union/DKW business which had operated out of the site prior to the war, and the company's first products were essentially copies of pre-war DKW designs. Following the partition of Germany, Auto Union re-established itself in West Germany (ultimately evolving into Audi), leaving VEB Sachsenring with the two stroke engine inherited from DKW.\nThe Trabant was the result of a planning process which had been intended to design a three-wheeled motorcycle. In German, \"Trabant\" is an astronomical term for a moon (or other natural satellite) of a celestial body.\nFull production.\nThe first of the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a relatively advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s, many small West European cars (such as the Renault 4CV) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely mounted engine and front-wheel drive in an era when many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.\nThe Trabant's air-cooled, engine\u2014upgraded to in 1962\u201363\u2014was derived from a pre-war DKW design with minor alterations during its production run. The first Saab car had a larger (764 cc), water-cooled, two-cylinder two-stroke engine. Wartburg, an East German manufacturer of larger sedans, also used a water-cooled, three-cylinder, one-litre, two-stroke DKW engine.\nThe original Trabant, introduced in 1958, was the P 50. Trabant's base model, it shared a large number of interchangeable parts with the latest 1.1s. The 500\u00a0cc, P50 evolved into a version with a fully synchronised gearbox in 1960, and received a , engine in 1962 as the P 60.\nThe updated P601 was introduced in 1964. It was essentially a facelift of the P 60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear and the original P50 underpinnings. The model remained nearly unchanged until the end of its production except for the addition of 12V electricity, rear coil springs and an updated dashboard for later models.\nThe Trabant's designers expected production to extend until 1967 at the latest, and East German designers and engineers created a series of more-sophisticated prototypes intended to replace the P601; several are displayed at the Dresden Transport Museum. Each proposal for a new model was rejected by the East German government due to shortages of the raw materials required in larger quantities for the more-advanced designs. As a result, the Trabant remained largely unchanged for more than a quarter-century. Also unchanged was its production method, which was extremely labour-intensive.\nProduction started from 34,000 per year in 1964, reached 100,000 in 1973, and was up to a high of 150,000 in 1989.\nThe Trabant 1.1 was a 601 with a better-performing , VW Polo engine. With a slightly modified look (including a floor-mounted gearshift), it was quieter and cleaner than its predecessor. The 1.1 had front disc brakes, and its wheel assembly was borrowed from Volkswagen. It was produced from 1989 to 1991, in parallel with the two-stroke P601. Except for the engine and transmission, many parts from older P50s, P60s and 601s were compatible with the 1.1.\n1989\u20131991.\nIn mid-1989, thousands of East Germans began loading their Trabants with as much as they could carry and drove to Hungary or Czechoslovakia en route to West Germany\u2013the so-called \"Trabi Trail\". Many had to get special permission to drive their Trabants into West Germany. The cars did not meet West German emissions standards and polluted the air at four times the European average.\nA licensed version of the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the Trabant's two-stroke engine, the result of a trade agreement between East and West Germany. The first prototypes were built in 1988, with pre-series cars appearing in 1989, but series production only began in May 1990 - By which time the two German states had already agreed to reunification. The locally built EA111-series engine was given the model code BM\u00a0820 by the East Germans; the plant also made 1.3-litre versions for the Wartburg 1.3 (BM\u00a0860) and the Barkas utility vehicle (BM\u00a0880). The model, the Trabant 1.1, also had minor improvements to its brake and signal lights, a renovated grille, and MacPherson struts instead of a leaf-spring-suspended chassis.\nBy April 1991, after only eleven months, the Trabant 1.1 was discontinued. In total, 3.7 million Trabant vehicles had been produced. However, it soon became apparent that there was no place for the Trabant in a reunified German economy. Its inefficient, labour-intensive production line had only survived thanks to government subsidies.\nThe Zwickau factory in Mosel (where the Trabant was manufactured) was sold to Volkswagen AG; the rest of the company became HQM Sachsenring GmbH. Volkswagen redeveloped the Zwickau factory into a centre for engine production; it also produces some Volkswagen Golfs and Passats.\n1990s and later.\nAccording to Richard Leiby, the Trabant had become \"a symbol of the technological and social backwardness of the East German state.\" Trabants became a symbol of the GDR's serious flaws in the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when many were abandoned by their Eastern owners who migrated west. Unlike the Lada Niva, \u0160koda Estelle, Polski Fiat (design licensed from the Italian car manufacturer) and Yugo, the Trabant had negligible sales in Western Europe.\nA Trabant could be bought for as little as a few Deutsche Marks during the early 1990s, and many were given away. Although prices recovered as they became collector's items, they remain inexpensive cars. In her \"Bodywork\" project, performance artist Liz Cohen transformed a 1987 Trabant into a 1973 Chevrolet El Camino. The Trabant was planned to return to production in Uzbekistan as the Olimp during the late 1990s, but only one model was produced.\nFormer Bulgarian Foreign Minister and Atlantic Club of Bulgaria founding president Solomon Passy owned a Trabant which was blessed by Pope John Paul II in 2002 and in which he took NATO Secretaries General Manfred W\u00f6rner, George Robertson, and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer for rides. In 2005, Passy donated the vehicle (which had become symbolic of Bulgaria's NATO accession) to the National Historical Museum of Bulgaria. In 1997, the Trabant was celebrated for passing the moose test without rolling over, as the Mercedes-Benz W168 had; a Thuringian newspaper's headline read, \"Come and get us, moose! Trabi passes A-Class killer test\".\nThe Trabant entered the world of diplomacy in 2007 when Steven Fisher, deputy head of mission at the British Embassy in Budapest, used a 1.1 (painted as close to British racing green as possible) as his diplomatic car. American Trabant owners celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall with the Parade of Trabants, an annual early-November rally held in Washington, D.C. The event, sponsored by the privately owned International Spy Museum, includes street tours in Trabants, rides, live German music and displays about East Germany.\nPlanned reintroduction.\nThe Herpa company, a Bavarian miniature-vehicle manufacturer, bought the rights to the Trabant name and showed a scale model of a \"newTrabi\" at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. Plans for production included a limited run, possibly with a BMW engine. A Trabant nT model was unveiled two years later in Frankfurt.\nThe Trabant nT consortium includes Herpa, the German specialized-auto-parts manufacturer IndiKar and the German automobile-engineering company IAV. The group was looking for investment, design and production in the Trabant's original hometown of Zwickau, with sales \"in 2012\". The Trabant nT electric car would be equipped with a asynchronous motor powered by a lithium-ion battery.\nPrototype and concepts.\nDozens of prototypes have been created over the years that have not gone into mass production.\nNon official prototypes:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31015", "revid": "50724764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31015", "title": "Teletubbies", "text": "British children's television series\nTeletubbies is a British children's television series created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport for the BBC. The programme focuses on four differently coloured characters known as the Teletubbies, named after the television screens on their bellies. Recognised throughout popular culture for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the head of each character, the Teletubbies communicate mostly through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to toddlers.\nThe series rapidly became a commercial success in Britain and abroad. It won multiple BAFTA awards and was nominated for two Daytime Emmys throughout its run. A single based on the show's theme song reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1997 and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks, selling over a million copies. By October 2000, the franchise generated over \u00a31billion ($) in merchandise sales.\nThough the original run ended in 2001, a rebooted series was green-lit in 2014. The reboot premiered on CBeebies in the United Kingdom and on the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States. The reboot ran for 120 episodes, with the last episode airing on the Nick Jr. Channel on 17 August 2018.\nPlot.\nThe programme takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls audible in the background. The main shelter of the four Teletubbies is an earth house known as the \"Tubbytronic Superdome\" implanted in the ground and accessed through a hole at the top or an especially large semicircular door at the dome's foot. The Teletubbies co-exist with a number of strange contraptions such as the Voice Trumpets and the group's anthropomorphic blue vacuum cleaner (\"Noo-Noo\"). The show's colourful psychedelic setting was designed specifically to appeal to the attention spans of infants and unlock different sections of the mind while also educating young children of transitions that can be expected in life.\nAn assortment of rituals is performed throughout the course of every episode, such as the playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, mishaps caused by the Noo-Noo, the footage of children displayed on the screens on the Teletubbies' stomachs, and the magical event that occurs once per episode. The event differs each time; it is often caused inexplicably and is frequently strange yet whimsical. Each episode is closed by the Voice Trumpets and the narrator. The disappointed, reluctant, but obedient Teletubbies bid farewell to the viewer as they go back to the Tubbytronic Superdome while the Sun Baby sets.\nRelease.\nOn 31 March 1997, the first episode of \"Teletubbies\" aired on BBC2 on the CBBC programming block. It filled a time slot previously held by \"Playdays\". This schedule change initially received backlash from parents, but the show was not moved. The programme's unconventional format quickly received attention from the media, and it was attracting two million viewers per episode by August. In February 1998, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" noted that it had \"reached cult status\" in less than a year on the air.\n\"Teletubbies\" has been aired in over 120 countries in 45 different languages. In the United States, the series airs on Nickelodeon's sister channel, the Nick Jr. Channel. Episodes were also released through the Nick Jr. mobile application and on-demand services. The original series returned to the United States on 25 May 2016, when every episode was added to the Noggin streaming service, including episodes that had never aired in America before. It aired on PBS Kids in the United States from 6 April 1998 to 29 August 2008. BBC Studios channels carry the series in most of Africa, Asia and Poland. A Spanish dub airs on Clan in Spain. In Greece, the series airs on Nickelodeon Greece. NPO Zappelin carries the show in the Netherlands and MTVA airs it in Hungary. In Australia and New Zealand, the series airs on CBeebies Australia and ABC Kids. JimJam's Benelux feed airs the series and Ultra airs it in Serbia. \"Teletubbies\" also airs on SIC in Portugal and e-Junior in the Middle East. In Singapore, the series aired over-the-air on Premiere 12 six days a week, attracting by mid-1998 an audience of 78,000 viewers, and twice a week on cable, on the Eureka Learning Channel. The series also gave a notable subscription drive for Singapore Television Twelve's magazine, owing to Teletubby plush toys sweepstakes.\nA redubbed version of the 2015 reboot premiered on Netflix on 14 November 2022 featuring Tituss Burgess.\nProduction.\nThe show was created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport after the BBC requested their pitch for a show aimed at preschoolers. Inspired by Davenport's interest in astronauts, specifically Apollo 11 and the first Moon landing, as well as their concern about \"how children were reacting to the increasingly technological environment of the late 1990s\", the two put together a pitch which the BBC picked up.\nFinding a shooting location was a challenge, as they wanted to film the production outside but were unable to locate a place \"with a suitable bowl-like dip\". They ended up filming on a farm in Wimpstone, Warwickshire, where they had previously shot \"Tots TV\". Due to problems with a previous television show shooting at the location, the shooting was protested by the locals, although they calmed down after being assured that \"it was a low-key children's programme and no one would be aware of the filming\". After the show took off, though, its popularity caused the land to be overrun by the press. In 2013, due to the continued trespassing, its owner, Rosemary Harding, had the location filled with water and turned into a small pond: \"People were jumping fences and crossing cattle fields. We're glad to see the back of it.\"\nAccording to Davenport, the press was particularly interested in getting photos of the actors in their Teletubby costumes without their heads on. Eventually, the team took measures to secure their privacy, including blindfolding visitors coming to the set and creating a tent for the actors to change in secret.\nThe artist who originally drew the characters that would become the Teletubbies was the illustrator and caricaturist Jonathan Hills, who also designed digital images for television programmes including \"Poirot\". In 2022 a sample from a collection of original drawings were presented by Hills' widow Lucy on the BBC show \"Antiques Roadshow\". The collection was valued, by expert Mark Hill, at up to \u00a380,000.\nPromotion.\nMerchandising.\nGolden Bear Toys distributed the first line of \"Teletubbies\" dolls shortly after the programme's debut. They were sold internationally, with talking toys available in multiple languages. Hasbro signed on to develop a new range of products in 1998. In 1999, Microsoft UK released a set of interactive \"ActiMates\" toys based on the characters. The Rasta Imposta company introduced \"Teletubbies\" costumes for children and adults in the same year. Two educational video games featuring the characters were also released throughout the series' run.\n\"Teletubbies\" dolls were the top-selling Christmas toy in 1997. Demand outstripped supply at most retailers, reportedly prompting many shops to ration them to one per customer. In some cases, shoppers camped outside stores overnight in hopes of purchasing \"Teletubbies\" merchandise. Fights over the toys broke out among parents and collectors on occasion. Over one million dolls were sold in Britain by 25 December of that year, with Golden Bear representatives estimating that sales could have reached three million if supplies had been available. The plush toys were named \"Toy of the Year\" by the British Association of Toy Retailers in 1998.\nKids' meal tie-ins have been released at fast-food restaurants throughout North America. In May 1999, Burger King distributed a set of six \"Teletubbies\" plush toys. They also included chicken nuggets shaped like the characters on their menu for a brief period of time. Keychains modelled after the characters were available at McDonald's in April 2000. These promotions became controversial among adults who believed they were intended to attract toddlers to high-fat food. Psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint considered the deals \"troubling\". He voiced his opinion on the matter publicly, but did not take action against the companies.\nTwo kiddie rides featuring the characters were manufactured by Jolly Roger. They were available at some amusement parks and arcades, such as Chuck E. Cheese's and Fantasy Island.\nOverseas \"Teletubbies\" merchandise sales throughout the 1990s delivered \u20ac136 million in profits for the BBC. By the time of the programme's cancellation, \"Teletubbies\" toys had generated over \u00a3200 million in revenue for co-creator Anne Wood alone. In 2005, Chris Hastings and Ben Jones of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called \"Teletubbies\" \"the most lucrative show in BBC television history.\"\nIn 2021, WildBrain, who owns the Teletubbies brand, launched a Teletubbies Pride Collection, with merchandise proceeds going towards efforts to expand LGBTQ images and inclusion in children\u2019s and family programming.\nLive events.\nTo commemorate the tenth anniversary of the premiere of \"Teletubbies\", a series of events took place from March to April 2007. The characters headlined an invitation-only event in London on 21 March 2007. They appeared in New York City's Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, and Apollo Theater. They were also interviewed on NBC's \"The Today Show\" in an episode that included the first televised appearance of the actors without their costumes. A partnership was formed with Isaac Mizrahi in which Mizrahi designed Teletubbies-inspired bags to be auctioned off to benefit charities. A new line of clothing was launched at the Pop-Up Shop and other speciality stores. New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg announced 28 March 2007 \"Teletubbies Day\" and gave the key to the city to the Teletubbies. Following their show in New York, the Teletubbies went on their first live European tour, performing in London, Paris, Bremen, Darmstadt, Halle, Hamburg, K\u00f6ln, and Hannover.\nIn January 2016, costumed \"Teletubbies\" characters appeared at the American International Toy Fair. In April 2016, the series' premiere on the Greek Nickelodeon channel was advertised with a series of appearances by the Teletubbies at malls throughout Athens. This began with a live show at Avenue Mall on 16 April, which featured both the Teletubbies and a host from the network. Throughout May 2016, the characters appeared on various breakfast television programmes to promote the upcoming series debut on the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nCommon Sense Media's Emily Ashby found that \"while the show's examples of cooperative play, wonder, and simple joys are gentle and pleasing, the creatures can still be a little grating to parents watching along.\" Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" stated in her review that the episodes \"offer a genuinely appealing combination: cute and slightly surreal.\"\nUpon the show's release, some critics feared that the characters' use of babbling in place of complete sentences would negatively affect young viewers' ability to communicate. The \"Daily Mirror\" reported in 1997 that many parents objected to its \"goo-goo style\" and \"said the show was a bad influence on their children.\" Marina Krcmar, a professor of communication at the Wake Forest University, told interviewers in 2007 that \"toddlers learn more from an adult speaker than they do from a program such as \"Teletubbies\".\" However, Paul McCann of \"The Independent\" defended this aspect of the show, stating that \"\"Teletubbies\" upsets those who automatically assume that progressive and creative learning is trendy nonsense. Those who believe that education should be strictly disciplined and functional, even when you're 18 months old. Thankfully \"Teletubbies\" isn't for them. It's for kids.\"\nThe programme's magical event that features a cut-out lion chasing a cut-out bear was deemed inappropriate for children by parents for its unsettling tone, cinematography, and music. It was subsequently banned in several countries. A revised version of the sketch was aired several years later with adjusted editing and voice acting.\nAlthough the programme is aimed at children between the ages of one and four, it had a substantial cult following with older generations, mainly university and college students. The mixture of bright colours, unusual designs, repetitive non-verbal dialogue, ritualistic format, and occasional forays into physical comedy appealed to many who perceived the programme as having psychedelic qualities. Shortly after the premiere of the show, at Imperial College London, the campus activities calendar included airtimes and episode highlights.\nTinky Winky controversy.\nControversy arose in 1999 concerning Tinky Winky and him carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's handbag (although he was first \"outed\" by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter from July 1997 to \"The Face\"). He aroused the interest of Jerry Falwell in 1999 when Falwell alleged that the character was a \"gay role model\". Falwell issued an attack in his \"National Liberty Journal\", citing a \"Washington Post\" \"In/out\" column which stated that lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres was \"out\" as the chief national gay representative, while trendy Tinky Winky was \"in\". He warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a covert homosexual symbol, because \"he is purple, the gay pride colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle: the gay pride symbol.\" The BBC made an official response, explaining that \"Tinky Winky is simply a sweet, technological baby with a magic bag.\" Kenn Viselman of Itsy-Bitsy Entertainment commented, \"He's not gay. He's not straight. He's just a character in a children's series.\"\nIn May 2007, Polish Ombudsman for Children Ewa Sowi\u0144ska revisited the matter, and planned to order an investigation. \"I noticed that he has a woman's handbag, but I didn't realise he's a boy\", Sowi\u0144ska said in a public statement. She asked her office's psychologists to look into the allegations. After the research in late 2007, she stated: \"The opinion of a leading sexologist, who maintains that this series has no negative effects on a child's psychology, is perfectly credible. As a result, I have decided that it is no longer necessary to seek the opinion of other psychologists.\"\nDespite the objections, the \"Independent on Sunday\"'s editors included Tinky Winky as the only fictional character in the 2008 inaugural \"Happy List\", alongside 99 real-life adults recognised for making Britain a better and happier place.\nIn response to this controversy, the gay community embraced the Teletubbies, with Tinky Winky leading pride parades and being featured on restaurant menus with themed items. In 2021, WildBrain, owner of the Teletubbies brand, declared their support for the LGBTQ+ community with the statement \"Teletubbies Love Pride.\" The company released a limited collection of merchandise with proceeds supporting GLAAD. In a statement, WildBrain said, \"The Teletubbies have always embraced their own offbeat quirkiness and sense of style. This Pride Month, we're celebrating that 'love who you are' spirit through our Collection of ready-to-rave fashion that makes Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po very proud.\" This was followed up by a 30-piece gender-fluid adult fashion collection commemorating Pride 2022.\nOther media.\nCD single.\nIn December 1997, BBC Studios released a CD single from the series, based on the show's theme song, called \"Teletubbies say 'Eh-oh!'\" It is the only single from \"Teletubbies\", making the characters a one-hit wonder in the United Kingdom. The song was written by Andrew McCrorie-Shand and Andrew Davenport, and produced by McCrorie-Shand and Steve James. The single reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1997, and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks after its release.\nGames.\nIn 1998, BBC Multimedia released \"Play with the Teletubbies\" for Microsoft Windows. It was later ported to the PlayStation in 2000, and was later released in the United States by Knowledge Adventure.\nIn December 2017, \"Teletubbies Play Time\" was released worldwide for mobile devices by Built Games.\nSpinoffs.\n\"Teletubbies Everywhere\".\nTeletubbies Everywhere is a spin-off of \"Teletubbies\" that aired on CBeebies on 11 February 2002. In the United States, the segment premiered on 20 January 2003 on PBS Kids, usually replacing the original first half of the Teletubbies episodes.\n\"Teletubbies Everywhere\" are 10-minute episodes that teach about colours, shapes, numbers, simple concepts such as up and down or big and small, and culture.\n\"Teletubbies Everywhere\" does not take place in Teletubbyland. Instead, it takes place in a variety of coloured backgrounds that change between segments. Each episode follows the same format which includes 4\u20135 segments (between the intro and ending).\n\"Tiddlytubbies\" animated web series.\nIn 2018, a spin-off animated web series featuring the Tiddlytubbies characters debuted on the official Teletubbies YouTube channel. These shorts are animated by WildBrain Spark Studios, a subsidiary of WildBrain that produces content for the WildBrain Spark network.\n\"Teletubbies: Ready, Steady, Go!\".\nA CGI-animated music-focused spin-off titled \"Teletubbies: Ready, Steady, Go!\", produced by WildBrain Spark Studios, premiered in September 2021 and was eventually pre-sold overseas.\nThe series tied into an album that was released digitally and on CD on 15 October 2021, and was made to prepare for the franchise's 25th Anniversary. Universal Music Canada and Virgin Music Label &amp; Artist Services handled global distribution rights to the album.\n\"Teletubbies: Let's Go!\".\nA CGI-animated spin-off called \"Teletubbies: Let's Go!\" was announced by WildBrain on 15 September 2022. and premiered in October of that year on the show's YouTube channel. As with the other online spin-offs, it was produced by WildBrain Spark Studios, and consists of 52 five-minute shorts.\nThe spin-off was also pre-sold internationally, with ITV obtaining UK broadcast rights.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In this role, TT continues Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT or TD), which succeeded ephemeris time (ET). TT shares the original purpose for which ET was designed, to be free of the irregularities in the rotation of Earth.\nThe unit of TT is the SI second, the definition of which is based currently on the caesium atomic clock, but TT is not itself defined by atomic clocks. It is a theoretical ideal, and real clocks can only approximate it.\nTT is distinct from the time scale often used as a basis for civil purposes, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). TT is indirectly the basis of UTC, via International Atomic Time (TAI). Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, TT is 32.184 s ahead of TAI.\nHistory.\nA definition of a terrestrial time standard was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976 at its XVI General Assembly and later named \"Terrestrial Dynamical Time\" (TDT). It was the counterpart to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), which was a time standard for Solar system ephemerides, to be based on a dynamical time scale. Both of these time standards turned out to be imperfectly defined. Doubts were also expressed about the meaning of 'dynamical' in the name TDT.\nIn 1991, in Recommendation IV of the XXI General Assembly, the IAU redefined TDT, also renaming it \"Terrestrial Time\". TT was formally defined in terms of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), defined by the IAU on the same occasion. TT was defined to be a linear scaling of TCG, such that the unit of TT is the \"SI second on the geoid\", i.e. the rate approximately matched the rate of proper time on the Earth's surface at mean sea level. Thus the exact ratio between TT time and TCG time was formula_1, where formula_2 was a constant and formula_3 was the gravitational potential at the geoid surface, a value measured by physical geodesy. In 1991 the best available estimate of formula_4 was .\nIn 2000, the IAU very slightly altered the definition of TT by adopting an exact value, \"L\"G =.\nCurrent definition.\nTT differs from Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) by a constant rate. Formally it is defined by the equation\nformula_5\nwhere TT and TCG are linear counts of SI seconds in Terrestrial Time and Geocentric Coordinate Time respectively, formula_4 is the constant difference in the rates of the two time scales, and formula_7 is a constant to resolve the epochs (see below). formula_4 is defined as exactly . Due to the term formula_1 the rate of TT is very slightly slower than that of TCG.\nThe equation linking TT and TCG more commonly has the form given by the IAU,\nformula_10\nwhere formula_11 is the TCG time expressed as a Julian date (JD). The Julian Date is a linear transformation of the raw count of seconds represented by the variable TCG, so this form of the equation is not simplified. The use of a Julian Date specifies the epoch fully. The above equation is often given with the Julian Date for the epoch, but that is inexact (though inappreciably so, because of the small size of the multiplier formula_4). The value is exactly in accord with the definition.\nTime coordinates on the TT and TCG scales are specified conventionally using traditional means of specifying days, inherited from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of Earth. Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used. For continuity with their predecessor Ephemeris Time (ET), TT and TCG were set to match ET at around Julian Date (1977-01-01T00Z). More precisely, it was defined that TT instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 and TCG instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 exactly correspond to the International Atomic Time (TAI) instant 1977-01-01T00:00:00.000. This is also the instant at which TAI introduced corrections for gravitational time dilation.\nTT and TCG expressed as Julian Dates can be related precisely and most simply by the equation\nformula_13\nwhere formula_14 is exactly.\nRealizations.\nTT is a theoretical ideal, not dependent on a particular realization. For practical use, physical clocks must be measured and their readings processed to estimate TT. A simple offset calculation is sufficient for most applications, but in demanding applications, detailed modeling of relativistic physics and measurement uncertainties may be needed.\nTAI.\nThe main realization of TT is supplied by TAI. The BIPM TAI service, performed since 1958, estimates TT using measurements from an ensemble of atomic clocks spread over the surface and low orbital space of Earth. TAI is canonically defined retrospectively, in monthly bulletins, in relation to the readings shown by that particular group of atomic clocks at the time. Estimates of TAI are also provided in real time by the institutions that operate the participating clocks. Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, the TAI realization of TT is defined thus:\nformula_15\nThe offset 32.184\u00a0s arises from history. The atomic time scale A1 (a predecessor of TAI) was set equal to UT2 at its conventional starting date of 1 January 1958, when \u0394\"T\" (ET \u2212 UT) was about 32 seconds. The offset 32.184 seconds was the 1976 estimate of the difference between Ephemeris Time (ET) and TAI, \"to provide continuity with the current values and practice in the use of Ephemeris Time\".\nTAI is never revised once published and TT(TAI) has small errors relative to TT(BIPM), on the order of 10-50 microseconds.\nThe GPS time scale has a nominal difference from atomic time (TAI \u2212 GPS time = +19 seconds), so that TT \u2248 GPS time + 51.184 seconds. This realization introduces up to a microsecond of additional error, as the GPS signal is not precisely synchronized with TAI, but GPS receiving devices are widely available.\nTT(BIPM).\nApproximately annually since 1992, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) has produced better realizations of TT based on reanalysis of historical TAI data. BIPM's realizations of TT are named in the form \"TT(BIPM08)\", with the digits indicating the year of publication. They are published in the form of a table of differences from TT(TAI), along with an extrapolation equation that may be used for dates later than the table. The latest as of \u00a02024[ [update]] is TT(BIPM23).\nPulsars.\nResearchers from the International Pulsar Timing Array collaboration have created a realization TT(IPTA16) of TT based on observations of an ensemble of pulsars up to 2012. This new pulsar time scale is an independent means of computing TT. The researchers observed that their scale was within 0.5 microseconds of TT(BIPM17), with significantly lower errors since 2003. The data used was insufficient to analyze long-term stability, and contained several anomalies, but as more data is collected and analyzed, this realization may eventually be useful to identify defects in TAI and TT(BIPM).\nOther standards.\nTT is in effect a continuation of (but is more precisely uniform than) the former Ephemeris Time (ET). It was designed for continuity with ET, and it runs at the rate of the SI second, which was itself derived from a calibration using the second of ET (see, under Ephemeris time, Redefinition of the second and Implementations). The JPL ephemeris time argument Teph is within a few milliseconds of TT.\nTT is slightly ahead of UT1 (a refined measure of mean solar time at Greenwich) by an amount known as \u0394\"T\" = TT \u2212 UT1. \u0394\"T\" was measured at +67.6439 seconds (TT ahead of UT1) at 0\u00a0h UTC on 1\u00a0January 2015; and by retrospective calculation, \u0394\"T\" was close to zero about the year 1900. \u0394\"T\" is expected to continue to increase, with UT1 becoming steadily (but irregularly) further behind TT in the future. In fine detail, \u0394\"T\" is somewhat unpredictable, with 10-year extrapolations diverging by 2-3 seconds from the actual value.\nRelativistic relationships.\nObservers in different locations, that are in relative motion or at different altitudes, can disagree about the rates of each other's clocks, owing to effects described by the theory of relativity. As a result, TT (even as a theoretical ideal) does not match the proper time of all observers.\nIn relativistic terms, TT is described as the proper time of a clock located on the geoid (essentially mean sea level).\nHowever,\nTT is now actually defined as a coordinate time scale.\nThe redefinition did not quantitatively change TT, but rather made the existing definition more precise. In effect it defined the geoid (mean sea level) in terms of a particular level of gravitational time dilation relative to a notional observer located at infinitely high altitude.\nThe present definition of TT is a linear scaling of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), which is the proper time of a notional observer who is infinitely far away (so not affected by gravitational time dilation) and at rest relative to Earth. TCG is used to date mainly for theoretical purposes in astronomy. From the point of view of an observer on Earth's surface the second of TCG passes in slightly less than the observer's SI second. The comparison of the observer's clock against TT depends on the observer's altitude: they will match on the geoid, and clocks at higher altitude tick slightly faster.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prototype was finished in 1946.\nHistory.\nAfter World War II, Tatra continued its pre-war business of building passenger cars in addition to commercial vehicles and military vehicles. The factory was nationalised in 1946, two years before the Communist takeover. Although production of pre-war models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan, was designed in 1946-47 by Josef Chalupa, Vladim\u00edr Popel\u00e1\u0159, Franti\u0161ek Kardaus, and Hans Ledwinka. The name of the car celebrated the new Communist planned economy but also referred to aeroplane inspiration ('\u00e9roplan' means aeroplane in colloquial Czech).\nOriginally, the 600 was known as the Tatra 107, continuing from Tatra's previous aerodynamic cars- the 77, 87, and 97- as it was intended as a newer, smaller, and cheaper version to replace the outdated Tatra 57. Tatra switched to a new numbering system after WWII, with all car model codes beginning with 600; as a result, the Tatra 107 became the Tatra 600.\nAfter two prototypes, \"Ambro\u017e\" (December 1946) and \"Josef\" (March 1947), the 600 went into mass production in 1948. In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the Skoda Auto plant in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, leaving Tatra to concentrate on truck assembly. This was quite unpopular with the workforce at both plants: as a result, Skoda built Tatraplans for one year only before the model was discontinued in 1952.\nThe Tatraplan had a monocoque streamlined ponton-styled 6-seat fastback saloon body with front suicide doors and a drag coefficient (Cd) of just 0.32. It was powered by an air-cooled flat-four cylinder, 1,952\u00a0cc rear-mounted engine. 6,342 were made, 2,100 of them in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav. In 2010, in the UK, the Tatraplan won the 'Classic Car of the Year' competition in the 1940s category.\nA modified 600 convertible with a Sodomka-built body was presented to Josef Stalin by Antonin Zapototsky on 22 December, 1949. As of 2019 it was on display in the Technicke Muzeum Tatra in Koprivnice.\nNotes.\nStreamlined Tatras\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It premiered from April to September 1996, on TV Tokyo. Sony's anime satellite channel, Animax also aired the series, both in Japan and on its various worldwide networks, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. It was licensed for Region 1 release by Bandai Entertainment.\nThe series follows a high school girl named Hitomi, who finds herself pulled from Earth to the planet Gaea when a boy named Van appears on the high school track while battling a dragon. In Gaea, she is caught in the middle of a war as the Zaibach Empire attempts to take over Gaea. Van (King of Fanelia), with aid from Allen (an Asturian Knight), commands his mystical mech Escaflowne in the struggle to stop the Zaibach Empire. Hitomi's fortune telling powers blossom in Gaea as she becomes the key to awakening Escaflowne and to stopping Zaibach's plans.\nWhile the anime series was in production, two very different manga series retellings were also developed and released: a version of the story entitled \"The Vision of Escaflowne\" and a retelling titled \"Hitomi \u2014 The Vision of Escaflowne\". In addition, a second manga adaptation called \"Escaflowne \u2014 Energist's Memories\" was released as a single volume in 1997. The story was novelized in a series of six light novels by Yumiko Tsukamoto. An anime film, entitled simply \"Escaflowne\", was released in June 2000. Four CD soundtracks and a drama CD have also been released in relation to the series.\nPlot.\nGaea is an alternate world that was created from the combined wishes of the inhabitants of Atlantis when it started to sink into the ocean. On Gaea, Earth is known as the Mystic Moon. Gaea's size, mass, atmospheric composition, temperature belts, and even seasons are the same as Earth\u2019s. The series focuses on Hitomi Kanzaki and her adventures after she is transported to the world of Gaea, a mysterious planet where she can see Earth and its moon in the sky. Hitomi's latent psychic powers are enhanced on Gaea and she quickly becomes embroiled in the conflicts between the Zaibach Empire led by Emperor Isaac Dornkirk and the several peaceful countries that surround it. The conflicts are brought about by the Zaibach Empire's quest to revive the legendary power from the ancient city of Atlantis. As the series progresses, many of the characters' pasts and motivations, as well as the history of Atlantis and the true nature of the planet Gaea, are revealed.\nProduction.\nShoji Kawamori first proposed the series after a trip to Nepal, during which he visited the foggy mountain region and pictured a hidden world where an epic focusing on both fate and destiny should be set. When he returned, he proposed the series to Bandai Visual and Sunrise. According to Kawamori, his pitch for the series was simple: \"if \"Macross\" was robotic mecha and love songs, why not a story about robotic mecha and divining powers?\". He worked with Bandai producer Minoru Takanashi to finish fleshing out the original idea. They researched various mysteries for inspiration, particularly stories centered on the mythical land of Atlantis and the Bermuda Triangle. As the series began taking shape, they changed the lead character from a male, to a high school girl as the lead character. Nobuteru Yuki was hired as the character designer, and tasked with crafting a design for Hitomi and the rest of the cast. He would later state that Hitomi was his favorite character because it was the first one he would ever design completely from scratch rather than simply being adapted from an existing medium. Initially, Folken and Dilandau were a single enemy commander, but as the story was fleshed out, the creators felt the series would be more interesting if there were two with very different personalities.\nInitially, Yasuhiro Imagawa was brought on board to direct. He is credited with coining the word \"escaflowne\", a Latin-based derivative of the word \"escalation\", that would be used in the title. Imagawa imagined a series that was heavily male-oriented and would feature a shapely heroine and dramatic battles. However, he left the project before production started to direct \"Mobile Fighter G Gundam\". Without a director, the series was put on hold and Kawamori left to work on other projects. After two years, Sunrise revisited the project and brought in relative newcomer Kazuki Akane as the new director. To broaden the potential audience, Akane decided to add more girl-oriented elements to the series. The suggestive elements were removed, several of the male characters were given more \"beautiful boy\" appearances, and the plot element around the tarot cards were added. Akane also redesigned Hitomi, taking her from a curvy, air-headed, long-haired girl with glasses to a slim, athletic, short-haired and more intelligent and confident girl. With the series character designs finalized and the story set, Yoko Kanno was selected to write the songs for the series, including the background songs which she co-wrote with her then-husband Hajime Mizoguchi, with whom she had previously collaborated on the soundtrack for \"Please Save My Earth\". Initially they found it difficult to score the series as the plot itself was still being reworked around the new concept, but the plot changes were finished in time for them to prepare the score and give the film the desired final \"epic touch.\" 16-year-old Maaya Sakamoto, fresh from a small role in the anime adaptation of \"Mizuiro Jidai\", was selected not only as the voice of Hitomi, but also to sing the \"Escaflowne\" theme song. Kanno is noted as saying that Sakamoto is an ideal interpreter of her work. After this project, they continued to collaborate on many other works and some consider her work on \"The Vision of Escaflowne\" to be the launching point of Sakamoto's career.\nIt is said as the series entered into production, the budget required it be cut down to twenty-six episodes before work began on the final scripts and the animation. However the director disputes this in a Panel Q&amp;A for Funimation's Kickstarter, where he states the series was always supposed to be 26 episodes. This is clarified by Shoji Kawamori in the Special Edition Booklet for \"Escaflowne\", in which he states the original pitch was 39 episodes in 1990, but this version never went into production, it was also radically different in concept and tone. The production really began in 1994 where the show solidified its fantasy aspects and the final format., In an interview during this time Kawamori had said he was unsure what form Escaflowne would take, but eventually it was set on a 26 episode TV anime. In the retail Japanese video release, some of the extended scenes were restored to the first seven episodes.\nMedia.\nAnime.\n\"The Vision of Escaflowne\" premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo on April 2, 1996, where it aired weekly until it completed its twenty-six-episode run on September 24, 1996. Bandai Entertainment's North American division, which licensed the series for home video distribution under its AnimeVillage label, first released the series with English subtitles, across eight VHS volumes, including a box set, from September 15 to December 15, 1998. In August 2000, Fox Kids Network began broadcasting the series in the United States. Produced by Saban Entertainment under license by Bandai Entertainment, these dubbed episodes were heavily edited to remove footage, add new \"flashback\" sequences to remind the audience of the events that just occurred, and to heavily downplay the role of Hitomi in the series. The first episode was skipped altogether, and the series soundtrack produced by Yoko Kanno was partially replaced with more techno rearrangements by Inon Zur. This modified version of the series was canceled after ten episodes due to \"low ratings\". Fox explained that they edited to meet their own target audience, to comply with broadcast standards, and to fit the allowed timeslot. The Canadian television channel YTV acquired Fox's dubbed version of the series for broadcast. Following Fox's planned broadcast schedule, they premiered the series on September 11, 2000, with the second episode. YTV aired all of the episodes Fox Kids dubbed, concluding with the series true first episode in February 2001. Bandai began releasing the dubbed version to VHS in 2000, discontinuing the releases in February 2001 after only four volumes had been released.\nBandai later released the entire series, unedited and in the original episode order, to Region 1 DVD. Spanning eight volumes, the releases include the original Japanese audio tracks with optional English subtitles, and the uncut English dubbed track. Bandai also later released the series in several different box sets, including a Limited Edition set released on July 23, 2002, a \"Perfect Collection\"\u2014which included the \"Escaflowne\" feature-length movie\u2014released October 26, 2004, and an \"Anime Legends\" box set on April 11, 2006. At Otakon 2013, Funimation (later Crunchyroll, LLC) had announced that they have acquired both licenses to \"The Vision of Escaflowne\" and the movie. On February 27, 2016, Funimation launched a Kickstarter campaign to re-dub the Escaflowne TV series using the HD materials from Sunrise, with the goal of $150,000, with it raising over the goal at $318,784. Three pieces of theme music are used for the series. , performed by Maaya Sakamoto, is used for the series opening theme for the entire series, except the first episode in which no opening sequence is used. Performed by Hiroki Wada, \"Mystic Eyes\" is used for the ending theme for the first twenty-five episodes, while the final episode uses Yoko Kanno's instrumental piece . In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the series was made available in its Funimation dub on Channel 4 via All 4. From November 2022 to January 2024, the series streamed on ITV Hub, along with its successor platform, ITVX.\nSoundtracks.\nMaaya Sakamoto voiced the main character of Hitomi Kanzaki and performed the opening theme song \"Yakusoku wa Iranai\" and other songs from the series. Yoko Kanno and Hajime Mizoguchi composed and produced the series' musical themes and background, incorporating a variety of styles including contemporary, classical, and Gregorian chant. Four CD soundtracks have been released in Japan by Victor Entertainment. \"Escaflowne: Over the Sky\" was released on June 5, 1996, with sixteen tracks, including the series' full opening and ending themes. The second CD, \"Escaflowne Original Soundtrack 2\", was released on July 24, 1996, and contained an additional seventeen tracks.\nReleased on September 28, 1996, \"Escaflowne Original Soundtrack 3\" contained an additional fifteen tracks. The fourth CD soundtrack, \"The Vision of Escaflowne: Lovers Only\", was released in on January 22, 1997, and contained twenty tracks, including the original TV length opening and ending themes and the ending theme used for the final episode of the series. Despite the relative popularity of the soundtracks, they were not licensed for release outside Japan for some time and were only available by importing them. However, all 4 soundtracks can now be currently purchased digitally via iTunes.\nManga.\nThree alternate retellings of \"The Vision of Escaflowne\" have been released in manga form, with first two manga series developed at the same time as the anime. Due to the radical changes in the anime series during production, these two manga series are very different from the original anime series and each other. The first series, also titled \"The Vision of Escaflowne\" was one of the first manga series to appear in the then new \"Sh\u014dnen Ace\" magazine from Kadokawa Shoten. Despite the anime series itself being on hold, Sunrise gave artist Katsu Aki the existing production and character designs, resulting in the first series having the heavy manga feel and curvaceous Hitomi that was originally planned for the anime series. Given free rein to change the story however he wanted, Aki's version is a violent saga focused primarily on fighting and has Hitomi transforming into a \"curvaceous nymph\" that is the power source of the mecha Escaflowne. The series premiered in \"Sh\u014dnen Ace\"'s first issue on October 24, 1994, and ran until November 26, 1997. The thirty-four chapters were collected and published by Kadokawa across eight \"tank\u014dbon\" volumes. It was licensed for released in North America by Tokyopop with the first volume released on July 8, 2003. The Tokyopop English editions were also imported for distribution in Australia by Madman Entertainment."}

The tertiary structure will have a single polypeptide chain \"backbone\" with one or more protein secondary structures, the protein domains. Amino acid side chains and the backbone may interact and bond in a number of ways. The interactions and bonds of side chains within a particular protein determine its tertiary structure. The protein tertiary structure is defined by its atomic coordinates. These coordinates may refer either to a protein domain or to the entire tertiary structure. A number of these structures may bind to each other, forming a quaternary structure.\nHistory.\nThe science of the tertiary structure of proteins has progressed from one of hypothesis to one of detailed definition. Although Emil Fischer had suggested proteins were made of polypeptide chains and amino acid side chains, it was Dorothy Maud Wrinch who incorporated geometry into the prediction of protein structures. Wrinch demonstrated this with the \"Cyclol\" model, the first prediction of the structure of a globular protein. Under favorable conditions, such as confident knowledge of secondary structure, contemporary methods are sometimes able to predict the tertiary structure of small proteins (&lt;120 residues) \"de novo\" to within 5 \u00c5 (0.5\u00a0nm).\nDeterminants.\nStability of native states.\nA protein folded into its native state or native conformation typically has a lower Gibbs free energy (a combination of enthalpy and entropy) than the unfolded conformation. A protein will tend towards low-energy conformations, which will determine the protein's fold in the cellular environment. Because many similar conformations will have similar energies, protein structures are dynamic, fluctuating between these similar structures.\nGlobular proteins have a core of hydrophobic amino acid residues and a surface region of water-exposed, charged, hydrophilic residues. This arrangement may stabilize interactions within the tertiary structure. For example, in secreted proteins, which are not bathed in cytoplasm, disulfide bonds between cysteine residues help to maintain the tertiary structure. There is a commonality of stable tertiary structures seen in proteins of diverse function and diverse evolution. For example, the TIM barrel, named for the enzyme triosephosphateisomerase, is a common tertiary structure as is the highly stable, dimeric, coiled coil structure. Hence, proteins may be classified by the structures they hold. Databases of proteins which use such a classification include \"SCOP\" and \"CATH\".\nFolding kinetics may trap a protein in a high-energy conformation, i.e. a high-energy intermediate conformation blocks access to the lowest-energy conformation. The high-energy conformation may contribute to the function of the protein. For example, the influenza hemagglutinin protein is a single polypeptide chain which when activated, is proteolytically cleaved to form two polypeptide chains. The two chains are held in a high-energy conformation. When the local pH drops, the protein undergoes an energetically favorable conformational rearrangement that enables it to penetrate the host cell membrane.\nSome tertiary protein structures may exist in long-lived states that are not the expected most stable state. For example, many serpins (serine protease inhibitors) show this metastability. They undergo a conformational change when a loop of the protein is cut by a protease.\nChaperone proteins.\nIt is commonly assumed that the native state of a protein is also the most thermodynamically stable and that a protein will reach its native state, given its chemical kinetics, before it is translated. Protein chaperones within the cytoplasm of a cell assist a newly synthesised polypeptide to attain its native state. Some chaperone proteins are highly specific in their function, for example, protein disulfide isomerase; others are general in their function and may assist most globular proteins, for example, the prokaryotic GroEL/GroES system of proteins and the homologous eukaryotic heat shock proteins (the Hsp60/Hsp10 system).\nCytoplasmic environment.\nPrediction of protein tertiary structure relies on knowing the protein's primary structure and comparing the possible predicted tertiary structure with known tertiary structures in protein data banks. This only takes into account the cytoplasmic environment present at the time of protein synthesis to the extent that a similar cytoplasmic environment may also have influenced the structure of the proteins recorded in the protein data bank.\nLigand binding.\nThe structure of a protein, such as an enzyme, may change upon binding of its natural ligands, for example a cofactor. In this case, the structure of the protein bound to the ligand is known as holo structure, while the unbound protein has an apo structure.\nStructure stabilized by the formation of weak bonds between amino acid side chains\n- Determined by the folding of the polypeptide chain on itself (nonpolar residues are located\ninside the protein, while polar residues are mainly located outside)\n- Envelopment of the protein brings the protein closer and relates a-to located in distant regions of the sequence\n- Acquisition of the tertiary structure leads to the formation of pockets and sites suitable for the recognition and\nthe binding of specific molecules (biospecificity).\nDetermination.\nThe knowledge of the tertiary structure of soluble globular proteins is more advanced than that of membrane proteins because the former are easier to study with available technology.\nX-ray crystallography.\nX-ray crystallography is the most common tool used to determine protein structure. It provides high resolution of the structure but it does not give information about protein's conformational flexibility.\nNMR.\nProtein NMR gives comparatively lower resolution of protein structure. It is limited to smaller proteins. However, it can provide information about conformational changes of a protein in solution.\nCryogenic electron microscopy.\nCryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can give information about both a protein's tertiary and quaternary structure. It is particularly well-suited to large proteins and symmetrical complexes of protein subunits.\nDual polarisation interferometry.\nDual polarisation interferometry provides complementary information about surface captured proteins. It assists in determining structure and conformation changes over time.\nPrediction algorithm.\nThe Folding@home project at the University of Pennsylvania is a distributed computing research effort which uses approximately 5 petaFLOPS (\u224810 x86 petaFLOPS) of available computing. It aims to find an algorithm which will consistently predict protein tertiary and quaternary structures given the protein's amino acid sequence and its cellular conditions.\nA list of software for protein tertiary structure prediction can be found at List of protein structure prediction software.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The event entered local folklore and residents reported for decades afterwards that the area still smelled of molasses on hot summer days.\nFlood.\nMolasses can be fermented to produce ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages and a key component in munitions. The disaster occurred at the Purity Distilling Company facility at 529Commercial Street near Keany Square. A considerable amount of molasses had been stored there by the company, which used the harborside Commercial Street tank to offload molasses from ships and store it for later transfer by pipeline to the Purity ethanol plant situated between Willow Street and Evereteze Way in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The molasses tank stood tall and in diameter, and contained as much as .\nOn January 15, 1919, temperatures in Boston had risen above , climbing rapidly from the frigid temperatures of the preceding days, and the previous day, a ship had delivered a fresh load of molasses, which had been warmed to decrease its viscosity for transfer. Possibly due to the thermal expansion of the older, colder molasses already inside the tank, the tank burst open and collapsed at approximately 12:30p.m. Witnesses reported that they felt the ground shake and heard a roar as it collapsed, a long rumble similar to the passing of an elevated train; others reported a tremendous crashing, a deep growling, \"a thunderclap-like bang!\", and a sound like a machine gun as the rivets shot out of the tank.\nThe density of molasses is about , 40 percent more dense than water, resulting in the molasses having a great deal of potential energy. The collapse translated this energy into a wave of molasses high at its peak, moving at . The wave was of sufficient force to drive steel panels of the burst tank against the girders of the adjacent Boston Elevated Railway's Atlantic Avenue structure and tip a streetcar momentarily off the El's tracks. Stephen Puleo describes how nearby buildings were swept off their foundations and crushed. Several blocks were flooded to a depth of . Puleo quotes a \"Boston Post\" report:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled about the wreckage[...] Here and there struggled a form\u2014whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was[...] Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper. The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings\u2014men and women\u2014suffered likewise.\nAs molasses is a non-Newtonian fluid, its viscosity changes under stress, thinning and flowing quickly under pressure and heat. During the flood, this shear-thinning resulted in unexpected speed. A 2013 article in \"Scientific American\" stated: \"A wave of molasses does not behave like a wave of water. [...] A wave of molasses is even more devastating than a typical tsunami. In 1919 the dense wall of syrup surging from its collapsed tank initially moved fast enough to sweep people up and demolish buildings, only to settle into a more gelatinous state that kept people trapped.\"The \"Boston Globe\" reported that people \"were picked up by a rush of air and hurled many feet\". Others had debris hurled at them from the rush of sweet-smelling air. A truck was picked up and hurled into Boston Harbor. After the initial wave, the molasses became viscous, exacerbated by the cold temperatures, trapping those caught in the wave and making it even more difficult to rescue them. About 150 people were injured, and 21 people and several horses were killed. Some were crushed and drowned by the molasses or by the debris that it carried within. The wounded included people, horses, and dogs; coughing fits became one of the most common ailments after the initial blast. Edwards Park wrote of one child's experience in a 1983 article for \"Smithsonian\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Anthony di Stasio, walking homeward with his sisters from the Michelangelo School, was picked up by the wave and carried, tumbling on its crest, almost as though he were surfing. Then he grounded and the molasses rolled him like a pebble as the wave diminished. He heard his mother call his name and couldn't answer, his throat was so clogged with the smothering goo. He passed out, then opened his eyes to find three of his four sisters staring at him.\nAftermath.\nFirst to the scene were 116 cadets under the direction of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from , a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy) that was docked nearby at the playground pier. The cadets ran several blocks toward the accident and entered into the knee-deep flood of molasses to pull out the survivors, while others worked to keep curious onlookers from getting in the way of the rescuers. The Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and Navy personnel soon arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and feeding the exhausted workers. Many of these people worked through the night, and the injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims, and four days elapsed before they stopped searching; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses that they were hard to recognize. Other victims were swept into Boston Harbor and were found three to four months after the disaster.\nIn the wake of the accident, 119 residents brought a class-action lawsuit against the United States Industrial Alcohol Company (USIA), which had bought Purity Distilling in 1917. It was one of the first class-action suits in Massachusetts and is considered a milestone in paving the way for modern corporate regulation. The company claimed that the tank had been blown up by anarchists because some of the alcohol produced was to be used in making munitions, but a court-appointed auditor found USIA responsible after three years of hearings, and the company ultimately paid out $628,000 in damages ($ in 2024, adjusted for inflation). Relatives of those killed reportedly received around $7,000 per victim (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nCleanup.\nCleanup crews used salt water from a fireboat to wash away the molasses and sand to absorb it, and the harbor was brown with molasses until summer. The cleanup in the immediate area took weeks, with several hundred people contributing to the effort, and it took longer to clean the rest of Greater Boston and its suburbs. Rescue workers, cleanup crews, and sight-seers had tracked molasses through the streets and spread it to subway platforms, to the seats inside trains and streetcars, to pay telephone handsets, into homes, and to countless other places. It was reported that \"Everything that a Bostonian touched was sticky.\"\nCauses.\nSeveral factors might have contributed to the disaster. The first factor is that the tank may have leaked from the very first day that it was filled in 1915. The tank was also constructed poorly and tested insufficiently, and carbon dioxide production might have raised the internal pressure due to fermentation in the tank. Warmer weather the previous day would have assisted in building this pressure, as the air temperature rose from over that period. The failure occurred from a manhole cover near the base of the tank, and a fatigue crack there possibly grew to the point of criticality.\nThe tank had been filled to capacity only eight times since it was built a few years previously, putting the walls under an intermittent, cyclical load. Several authors say that the Purity Distilling Company was trying to out-race prohibition, as the 18th amendment was ratified the next day (January 16, 1919) and took effect one year later. An inquiry after the disaster revealed that Arthur Jell, USIA's treasurer, neglected basic safety tests while overseeing construction of the tank, such as filling it with water insufficient to check for leaks, and ignored warning signs such as groaning noises each time the tank was filled. He had no architectural or engineering experience. When filled with molasses, the tank leaked so badly that it was painted brown to hide the leakage. Local residents collected leaked molasses for their homes. A 2014 investigation applied modern engineering analysis and found that the steel was half as thick as it should have been for a tank of its size even with the lower standards they had at the time. Another issue was that the steel lacked manganese and was made more brittle as a result. The tank's rivets were also apparently flawed, and cracks first formed at the rivet holes.\nIn 2016, a team of scientists and students at Harvard University conducted extensive studies of the disaster, gathering data from many sources, including 1919 newspaper articles, old maps, and weather reports. The student researchers also studied the behavior of cold corn syrup flooding a scale model of the affected neighborhood. The researchers concluded that the reports of the high speed of the flood were credible.\nTwo days before the disaster, warmer molasses had been added to the tank, reducing the viscosity of the fluid. When the tank collapsed, the fluid cooled quickly as it spread, until it reached Boston's winter evening temperatures and the viscosity increased dramatically. The Harvard study concluded that the molasses cooled and thickened quickly as it rushed through the streets, hampering efforts to free victims before they suffocated.\nArea today.\nUnited States Industrial Alcohol did not rebuild the tank. The property formerly occupied by the molasses tank and the North End Paving Company became a yard for the Boston Elevated Railway (predecessor to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). It is now the site of a city-owned recreational complex, officially named Langone Park, featuring a Little League Baseball field, a playground, and bocce courts. Immediately to the east is the larger Puopolo Park, with additional recreational facilities.\nA small plaque at the entrance to Puopolo Park, placed by the Bostonian Society, commemorates the disaster. The plaque, titled \"Boston Molasses Flood\", reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On January 15, 1919, a molasses tank at 529 Commercial Street exploded under pressure, killing 21 people. A 40-foot wave of molasses buckled the elevated railroad tracks, crushed buildings and inundated the neighborhood. Structural defects in the tank combined with unseasonably warm temperatures contributed to the disaster.\nThe accident has since become a staple of local culture, not only for the damage the flood brought, but also for the sweet smell that filled the North End for decades after the disaster. According to journalist Edwards Park, \"The smell of molasses remained for decades a distinctive, unmistakable atmosphere of Boston.\"\nOn January 15, 2019, for the 100th anniversary of the event, a ceremony was held in remembrance. Ground-penetrating radar was used to identify the exact location of the tank from 1919. The concrete slab base for the tank remains in place approximately below the surface of the baseball diamond at Langone Park. Attendees of the ceremony stood in a circle marking the edge of the tank. The 21 names of those who died in, or as a result of, the flood were read aloud.\nMany laws and regulations governing construction were changed as a direct result of the disaster, including requirements for oversight by a licensed architect and civil engineer.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Critics frequently rank him as one of the best poets of his generation and one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. He was appointed Poet Laureate in 1984 and held the office until his death. In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked Hughes fourth on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".\nHughes married fellow poet, American Sylvia Plath, in 1956. They lived together in the United States and then in England, in a tumultuous relationship. They had two children before separating in 1962. Plath ended her life in 1963.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHughes was born at 1 Aspinall Street, in Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to William Henry (1894\u20131981) and Edith (n\u00e9e Farrar) Hughes (1898\u20131969). He was raised among the local farms of the Calder Valley and on the Pennine moorland. The third child, Hughes had a brother Gerald (1920\u20132016), who was ten years older. Next came their sister Olwyn Marguerite Hughes (1928\u20132016), who was two years older than Ted. \nOne of their mother's ancestors, Nicholas Ferrar, had founded the Little Gidding community. Most of the more recent generations of the family had worked in the clothing and milling industries in the area. \nHughes's father, William, a joiner, was of Irish descent. He had enlisted with the Lancashire Fusiliers in the First World War and fought at Ypres. He narrowly escaped being killed; he was saved when a bullet hit him but lodged in a pay book in his breast pocket. He was one of just 17 men of his regiment to return from the Dardanelles Campaign (1915\u201316). \nThe stories of Flanders fields filled Hughes's childhood imagination (later described in the poem \"Out\"). Hughes noted, \"my first six years shaped everything\".\nHughes loved hunting and fishing, swimming, and picnicking with his family. He attended the Burnley Road School until he was seven. After his family moved to Mexborough, he attended Schofield Street Junior School. His parents ran a newsagent's and tobacconist's shop in the town. \nIn \"Poetry in Making\", Hughes recalled that he was fascinated by animals, collecting, and drawing toy lead creatures. He acted as retriever when his elder brother gamekeeper shot magpies, owls, rats, and curlews. He grew up amid the harsh realities of working farms in the valleys and on the moors. \nDuring his time in Mexborough, he explored Manor Farm at Old Denaby. He later said that he came to know it \"better than any place on earth\". His earliest poem \"The Thought Fox\", and earliest story \"The Rain Horse\", were recollections of the area. At the age of about 13 a friend, John Wholey, took Hughes to his home at Crookhill Lodge, on the Crookhill estate above Conisbrough. There the boys could fish and shoot. Hughes became close to the Wholey family and learnt a lot about wildlife from Wholey's father, the head gardener and gamekeeper on the estate. Hughes came to view fishing as an almost religious experience.\nHughes attended Mexborough Secondary School (later Grammar School), where a succession of teachers encouraged him to write, and develop his interest in poetry. Teachers Miss McLeod and Pauline Mayne introduced him to the poets Gerard Manley Hopkins and T.S. Eliot. Hughes was also mentored by teacher John Fisher, and his own sister Olwyn, who was well versed in poetry. Future poet Harold Massingham also attended this school and was mentored by Fisher. In 1946, one of Hughes's early poems, \"Wild West\", and a short story were published in the grammar school magazine \"The Don and Dearne\". He published further poems in 1948. By 16, he had no other thought than being a poet.\nDuring the same year, Hughes won an open exhibition in English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but chose to do his national service first. His two years of national service (1949\u20131951) passed comparatively easily. Hughes was stationed as a ground wireless mechanic in the RAF on an isolated three-man station in east Yorkshire. During this time, he had little to do but \"read and reread Shakespeare and watch the grass grow\". He learnt many of the plays by heart and memorised great quantities of W. B. Yeats's poetry.\nCareer.\nIn 1951 Hughes initially studied English at Pembroke College under M.\u00a0J.\u00a0C. Hodgart, an authority on balladic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart's supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the \"terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus\" of literary tradition. He wrote, \"I might say, that I had as much talent for Leavis-style dismantling of texts as anyone else, I even had a special bent for it, nearly a sadistic streak there, but it seemed to me not only a foolish game, but deeply destructive of myself.\" In his third year, he transferred to Anthropology and Archaeology, both of which would later inform his poetry. He did not excel as a scholar, receiving only a third-class grade in Part I of the Anthropology and Archaeology Tripos in 1954. \nHis first published poetry appeared in \"Chequer\". A poem, \"The little boys and the seasons\", written during this time, was published in \"Granta\", under the pseudonym Daniel Hearing.\nAfter university, living in London and Cambridge, Hughes had many varied jobs including working as a rose gardener, a nightwatchman, and a reader for the British film company J. Arthur Rank. He worked at London Zoo as a washer-upper, a post that offered plentiful opportunities to observe animals at close quarters. \nOn 25 February 1956, Hughes and his friends held a party to launch \"St. Botolph's Review\", which had a single issue. In it, Hughes had four poems. At the party, he met American poet Sylvia Plath, who was studying at Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship. She had already published extensively, won multiple awards, and came to the party specifically to meet Hughes and his fellow poet Lucas Myers. Hughes and Plath felt a great mutual attraction, but they did not meet again for another month, when Plath passed through London on her way to Paris. She visited him again on her return three weeks later.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nCold, delicately as the dark snow,\nA fox's nose touches twig, leaf;\nTwo eyes serve a movement, that now\nAnd again now, and now, and now\nSets neat prints into the snow\nBetween trees, and warily a lame\nShadow lags by stump and in hollow\nOf a body that is bold to come\nAcross clearings, an eye,\nA widening deepening greenness,\nBrilliantly, concentratedly,\nComing about its own business\nTill, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox\nIt enters the dark hole of the head.\nThe window is starless still; the clock ticks,\nThe page is printed.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe last four stanzas of \"The Thought Fox\" from \"The Hawk in the Rain\", 1957\nHughes and Plath were married on 16 June 1956, at St George the Martyr, Holborn, four months after they had first met. They chose the date, Bloomsday, in honour of Irish writer James Joyce. Plath's mother was the only wedding guest. The couple spent most of their honeymoon at Benidorm, in Alicante on Spain's Costa Blanca.\nHughes's biographers note that Plath did not tell him about her history of depression and suicide attempts until much later. Reflecting later in \"Birthday Letters\", Hughes commented that early on he could see chasms of difference between himself and Plath, but that in the first years of their marriage they both felt happy and supported, avidly pursuing their writing careers.\nOn returning to Cambridge, they lived at 55 Eltisley Avenue. That year they each had poems published in \"The Nation\", \"Poetry\", and \"The Atlantic\". Plath typed up Hughes's manuscript for his collection \"Hawk in the Rain\", which won a competition run by the Poetry centre of the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York. The first prize was publication by Harper. Hughes gained widespread critical acclaim after the book's release in September 1957, including a Somerset Maugham Award. The work favoured hard-hitting trochees and spondees reminiscent of Middle English \u2014 a style he used throughout his career \u2014 over the more genteel latinate sounds.\nThe couple moved to the United States in 1957 so that Plath could take a teaching position at her alma mater, Smith College. During this time, Hughes taught at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In 1958, they met artist Leonard Baskin, who would later illustrate many of Hughes's books, including \"Crow\". \nThe couple returned to England in 1959, staying for a short while back in Heptonstall and then finding a small flat in Primrose Hill, London. They were both writing: Hughes was working on programmes for the BBC as well as producing essays, articles, reviews, and talks. During this time, he wrote the poems that would later be published in \"Recklings\" (1966) and \"Wodwo\" (1967). \nIn March 1960, his book \"Lupercal\" was published, and it won the Hawthornden Prize. He found he was being labelled as the poet of the wild, writing only about animals. Hughes began to seriously explore myth and esoteric practices including shamanism, alchemy and Buddhism, with The Tibetan Book of the Dead being a particular focus in the early 1960s. He believed that imagination could heal dualistic splits in the human psyche, and poetry was the language of that work.\nHughes and Plath had two children, Frieda Hughes (b. 1960) and Nicholas Hughes (1962\u20132009). In 1961, they bought the house Court Green, in North Tawton, Devon. \nIn the summer of 1962, Hughes began an affair with Assia Wevill, who had been subletting the Primrose Hill flat with her husband. Under the cloud of his affair, Hughes and Plath separated in the autumn of 1962. Plath moved back to London and set up life in a new flat with the children.\nLetters written by Plath between 18 February 1960 and 4 February 1963, unseen until 2017, accuse Hughes of physically abusing her, including an incident two days before she miscarried their second child in 1961.\nDeath of Sylvia Plath.\nBeset by depression made worse by her husband's affair and with a history of suicide attempts, Plath took her own life on 11 February 1963. \nHughes dramatically wrote in a letter to an old friend of Plath's from Smith College, \"That's the end of my life. The rest is posthumous.\" Some people argued that Hughes had driven Plath to suicide. Plath's gravestone in Heptonstall was repeatedly vandalized. Some people were aggrieved that \"Hughes\" is written on her stone and attempted to chisel it off, leaving only the name \"Sylvia Plath\".\nPlath's poem \"The Jailer\", in which the speaker condemns her husband's brutality, was included in the 1970 anthology \"\". Poet Robin Morgan published a poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath. \nThere were lawsuits resulting from the controversy. Morgan's 1972 book \"Monster\", which contained that poem was banned. Underground, pirated editions of it were published. Other radical feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath's name. In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, a battle raged in the letters pages of \"The Guardian\" and \"The Independent\". In \"The Guardian\" on 20 April 1989, Hughes wrote the article \"The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace\":\nIn the years soon after [Plath's] death, when scholars approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early... If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech... The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know.\nAs Plath's widower, Hughes became the executor of Plath's personal and literary estates. He oversaw the posthumous publication of her manuscripts, including \"Ariel\" (1965). Some critics were dissatisfied by his choice of poem order and omissions in the book. Others, who were critical of Hughes personally, argued that he had essentially driven Plath to suicide and should not be responsible for her literary legacy. He claimed to have destroyed the final volume of Plath's journal, detailing their last few months together. In his foreword to \"The Journals of Sylvia Plath\", he defends his actions as a consideration for the couple's young children.\nFollowing Plath's suicide, Hughes wrote two poems, \"The Howling of Wolves\" and \"Song of a Rat\". He did not write poetry again for three years. He broadcast extensively, wrote critical essays, and became involved in running Poetry International with Patrick Garland and Charles Osborne, in the hopes of connecting English poetry with the rest of the world. \nIn 1966, he wrote poems to accompany Leonard Baskin's illustrations of crows, which became the epic narrative \"The Life and Songs of the Crow\", one of the works for which Hughes is best known. Hughes did not finish the \"Crow\" sequence until after his work \"Cave Birds\" was published in 1975. In 1967, while living with Wevill, Hughes produced two sculptures of a jaguar, one of which he gave to his brother and one to his sister. Gerald Hughes' sculpture, branded with the letter 'A' on its forehead, was offered for sale in 2012.\nOn 23 March 1969, six years after Plath's suicide, Assia Wevill took her own life by the same method: asphyxiation from a gas stove. Wevill also killed her child, Alexandra Tatiana Elise (nicknamed Shura), the four-year-old daughter of Hughes, born on 3 March 1965. These deaths resulted in reports that Hughes had been abusive to both Plath and Wevill. \n1970\u20131998.\nIn August 1970, Hughes married a second time, to Carol Orchard, a nurse. They were together until his death. Heather Clark in her biography of Plath, \"Red Comet\" (2021), observed that Hughes \"would never be faithful to a woman after he left Plath\". \nHughes bought a house known as Lumb Bank near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, while still maintaining the property at Court Green. He also began cultivating a small farm near Winkleigh, Devon, called \"Moortown\"; he used this name as the title of one of his poetry collections. Later he served as the president of the charity Farms for City Children, established by his friend Michael Morpurgo in Iddesleigh.\nIn 1970 Hughes and his sister Olwyn set up the Rainbow Press. Between 1971 and 1981, it published sixteen titles, comprising poems by Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Ruth Fainlight, Thom Gunn, and Seamus Heaney. The works were printed by Daedalus Press in Norfolk,&lt;ref name=\"ann.skea/Hughes-Press\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rampant Lions Press, and the John Roberts Press.\nHughes was appointed Poet Laureate in December 1984, following Sir John Betjeman. A collection of his animal poems for children had been published by Faber earlier that year, \"What is the Truth?\", illustrated by R. J. Lloyd. For that work he won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award. \nHughes wrote many works for children. He also collaborated closely with Peter Brook and the National Theatre Company. He dedicated himself to the Arvon Foundation, which promotes writing education and has run residential writing courses at Lumb Bank. \nIn 1993, Hughes made a rare television appearance for Channel 4, reading passages from his 1968 novel \"The Iron Man\". He was featured in the 1994 documentary \"Seven Crows A Secret\".\nIn early 1994, increasingly alarmed by the decline of fish in rivers local to his Devonshire home, Hughes became involved in conservation activism. He was one of the founding trustees of the Westcountry Rivers Trust, a charity established to restore rivers through catchment-scale management and a close relationship with local landowners and riparian owners.\nHughes was appointed a member of the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II just before he died. He had continued to live at the house in Devon, until suffering a fatal heart attack on 28 October 1998 while undergoing hospital treatment for colon cancer in Southwark, London. \nOn 3 November 1998, his funeral was held at North Tawton church, and he was cremated in Exeter. Speaking at the funeral, fellow poet Seamus Heaney, said: \n\"No death outside my immediate family has left me feeling more bereft. No death in my lifetime has hurt poets more. He was a tower of tenderness and strength, a great arch under which the least of poetry's children could enter and feel secure. His creative powers were, as Shakespeare said, still crescent. By his death, the veil of poetry is rent and the walls of learning broken.\"\nOn 16 March 2009, Nicholas Hughes, the son of Hughes and Plath, died by suicide in his home in Alaska. He had suffered from depression.\nIn January 2013, Carol Hughes announced that she would write a memoir of their marriage. \"The Times\" headlined its story \"Hughes's widow breaks silence to defend his name\" and observed that \"for more than 40 years she has kept her silence, never once joining in the furious debate that has raged around the late Poet Laureate since the suicide of his first wife, the poet Sylvia Plath.\"\nHughes's brother Gerald published a memoir late in 2014, \"Ted and I: A Brother's Memoir\". \"Kirkus Reviews\" described it as \"a warm recollection of a lauded poet\".\nWork.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nCrow Blacker Than Ever\nWhen God, disgusted with man,\nTurned towards heaven,\nAnd man, disgusted with God,\nTurned towards Eve,\nThings looked like falling apart.\nBut Crow Crow\nCrow nailed them together,\nNailing heaven and earth together-\nSo man cried, but with God's voice.\nAnd God bled, but with man's blood.\nThen heaven and earth creaked at the joint\nWhich became gangrenous and stank-\nA horror beyond redemption.\nThe agony did not diminish.\nMan could not be man nor God God.\nThe agony\nGrew.\nCrow\nGrinned\nCrying: \"This is my Creation,\"\nFlying the black flag of himself.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"Crow: From the Life and Songs of the Crow\", 1970\nHughes's first collection, \"The Hawk in the Rain\" (1957), attracted considerable critical acclaim. In 1959 he won the Galbraith prize, which brought $5,000. His most significant work is perhaps \"Crow\" (1970), which whilst it has been widely praised also divided critics, combining an apocalyptic, bitter, cynical and surreal view of the universe with what sometimes appeared simple, childlike verse. Crow was edited several times across Hughes' career. Within its opus he created a cosmology of the totemic Crow who was simultaneously God, Nature and Hughes' alter ego. The publication of \"Crow\" shaped Hughes' poetic career as distinct from other forms of English Nature Poetry.\nIn a 1971 interview with \"The London Magazine\", Hughes cited his main influences as including Blake, Donne, Hopkins, and Eliot. He mentioned also Schopenhauer, Robert Graves's book \"The White Goddess\", and \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\".\nHughes worked for 10 years on a prose poem, \"Gaudete\", which he hoped to have made into a film. It tells the story of the vicar of an English village who is carried off by elemental spirits, and replaced in the village by his enantiodromic double, a changeling, fashioned from a log, who nevertheless has the same memories as the original vicar. The double is a force of nature who organises the women of the village into a \"love coven\" in order that he may father a new messiah. When the male members of the community discover what is going on, they murder him. The epilogue consists of a series of lyrics spoken by the restored priest in praise of a nature goddess, inspired by Robert Graves's \"White Goddess\". It was printed in 1977. Hughes was very interested in the relationship between his poetry and the book arts, and many of his books were produced by notable presses and in collaborative editions with artists, for instance with Leonard Baskin.\nIn addition to his own poetry, Hughes wrote a number of translations of European plays, mainly classical ones. His \"Tales from Ovid\" (1997) contains a selection of free verse translations from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". He also wrote both poetry and prose for children, one of his most successful books being \"The Iron Man\", written to comfort his children after their mother Sylvia Plath's suicide. It later became the basis of Pete Townshend's 1989 , and of the 1999 animated film \"The Iron Giant\", the latter of which is dedicated to his memory. \nHughes was appointed Poet Laureate in 1984 following the death of John Betjeman. It was later known that Hughes was second choice for the appointment. Philip Larkin, the preferred nominee, had declined, because of ill health and a loss of creative momentum, dying a year later. Hughes served in this position until his death in 1998. In 1992 Hughes published \"Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being\", a monumental work inspired by Graves's \"The White Goddess\". The book, considered Hughes's key work of prose, had a mixed reception \"divided between those who considered it an important and original appreciation of Shakespeare's complete works, whilst others dismissed it as a lengthy and idiosyncratic appreciation of Shakespeare refracted by Hughes's personal belief system\". Hughes himself later suggested that the time spent writing prose was directly responsible for a decline in his health. Also in 1992, Hughes published \"Rain Charm for the Duchy\", collecting together for the first time his Laureate works, including poems celebrating important royal occasions. The book also contained a section of notes throwing light on the context and genesis of each poem.\nIn 1998, his \"Tales from Ovid\" won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award. In \"Birthday Letters\", his last collection, Hughes broke his silence on Plath, detailing aspects of their life together and his own behaviour at the time. The book, the cover artwork for which was by their daughter Frieda, won the 1999 Whitbread Prize for poetry.\nHughes's definitive 1,333-page \"Collected Poems\" (Faber &amp; Faber) appeared (posthumously) in 2003. A poem discovered in October 2010, \"Last letter\", describes what happened during the three days leading up to Plath's suicide. It was published in \"New Statesman\" on National Poetry Day, October 2010. Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy told Channel 4 News that the poem was \"the darkest poem he has ever written\" and said that for her it was \"almost unbearable to read\".\nIn 2011, several previously unpublished letters from Hughes to Craig Raine were published in the literary review Aret\u00e9. They relate mainly to the process of editing \"Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being\", and also contain a sequence of drafts of letters in which Raine attempts to explain to Hughes his disinclination to publish Hughes's poem \"The Cast\" in an anthology he was editing, on the grounds that it might open Hughes to further attack on the subject of Sylvia Plath. \"Dear Ted, Thanks for the poem. It is very interesting and would cause a minor sensation\" (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in \"Birthday Letters\" and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: \"I have a whole pile of pieces that are all \u2013 one way or another \u2013 little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me\" (5 April 1997).\nThemes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThis house has been far out at sea all night,\nThe woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,\nWinds stampeding the fields under the window\nFloundering black astride and blinding wet\nTill day rose; then under an orange sky\nThe hills had new places, and wind wielded\nBlade-light, luminous black and emerald,\nFlexing like the lens of a mad eye.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nFrom \"Wind\" \"The Hawk in the Rain\", 1957\nHughes's earlier poetic work is rooted in nature and, in particular, the innocent savagery of animals, an interest from an early age. He wrote frequently of the mixture of beauty and violence in the natural world. Animals serve as a metaphor for his view on life: animals live out a struggle for the survival of the fittest in the same way that humans strive for ascendancy and success. Examples can be seen in the poems \"Hawk Roosting\" and \"Jaguar\".\nThe West Riding dialect of Hughes's childhood remained a staple of his poetry, his lexicon lending a texture that is concrete, terse, emphatic, economical yet powerful. The manner of speech renders the hard facts of things and wards off self-indulgence.\nHughes's later work is deeply reliant upon myth and the British bardic tradition, heavily inflected with a modernist, Jungian, and ecological viewpoint. He re-worked classical and archetypal myth working with a conception of the dark sub-conscious.\nTranslation.\nIn 1965, he founded with Daniel Weissbort the journal \"Modern Poetry in Translation\", which involved bringing to the attention of the West the work of Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Weissbort and Hughes were instrumental in bringing to the English-speaking world the work of many poets who were hardly known, from such countries as Poland and Hungary, then controlled by the Soviet Union. Hughes wrote an introduction to a translation of \"Vasko Popa: Collected Poems\", in the \"Persea Series of Poetry in Translation\", edited by Weissbort. which was reviewed with favour by premiere literary critic John Bayley of Oxford University in \"The New York Review of Books\".\nCommemoration and legacy.\nA memorial walk was inaugurated in 2005, leading from the Devon village of Belstone to Hughes's memorial stone above the River Taw, on Dartmoor, and in 2006 a Ted Hughes poetry trail was built at Stover Country Park, also in Devon. In 2008 \"The Times\" ranked Hughes fourth on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".\nOn 28 April 2011, a memorial plaque for Hughes was unveiled at North Tawton by his widow Carol Hughes. At Lumb Bridge near Pecket Well, Calderdale is a plaque, installed by The Elmet Trust, commemorating Hughes's poem \"Six Young Men\", which was inspired by an old photograph of six young men taken at that spot. The photograph, taken just before the First World War, was of six young men who were all soon to lose their lives in the war. A Ted Hughes Festival is held each year in Mytholmroyd, led by the Elmet Trust, an educational body founded to support the work and legacy of Hughes.\nIn 2010, it was announced that Hughes would be commemorated with a memorial in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. On 6 December 2011, a slab of Kirkstone green slate was ceremonially placed at the foot of the memorial commemorating T. S. Eliot. Poet Seamus Heaney and actress Juliet Stevenson gave readings at the ceremony, which was also attended by Hughes's widow Carol and daughter Frieda, and by the poets Simon Armitage, Blake Morrison, Andrew Motion and Michael Morpurgo. Motion paid tribute to Hughes as \"one of the two great poets of the last half of the last century\" (the other being Philip Larkin). Hughes's memorial stone bears lines from \"That Morning\", a poem recollecting the epiphany of a huge shoal of salmon flashing by as he and his son Nicholas waded a stream in Alaska: \"So we found the end of our journey / So we stood alive in the river of light / Among the creatures of light, creatures of light.\"\nIn October 2015, the BBC Two major documentary \"Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death\" examined Hughes's life and work. The programme included contributions from poets Simon Armitage and Ruth Fainlight, broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, biographers Elaine Feinstein and Jonathan Bate, activist Robin Morgan, critic Al Alvarez, publicist Jill Barber, friend Ehor Boyanowsky, patron Elizabeth Sigmund, friend Daniel Huws, Hughes's US editor Frances McCullough, and younger cousin Vicky Watling. His daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her father and mother.\nArchive.\nHughes archival material is held by institutions such as Emory University and Exeter University. In 2008, the British Library acquired a large collection comprising over 220 files containing manuscripts, letters, journals, personal diaries, and correspondence. The library archive is accessible through the British Library website.\nThere is also a Collection Guide available grouping together all of the Hughes material at the British Library with links to material held by other institutions. Inspired by Hughes's \"Crow\" the German painter Johannes Heisig created a large painting series in black and white which was presented to the public for the first time on the occasion of Berlin Museum Long Night in August 2011 at the SEZ Berlin.\nTed Hughes Award.\nIn 2009, the Ted Hughes Award for new work in poetry was established with the permission of Carol Hughes. The Poetry Society notes \"the award is named in honour of Ted Hughes, Poet Laureate, and one of the greatest twentieth century poets for both children and adults\". Members of the Poetry Society and Poetry Book Society recommend a living UK poet who has completed the newest and most innovative work that year, \"highlighting outstanding contributions made by poets to our cultural life\". The \u00a35,000 prize was previously funded from the annual honorarium that former Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy received as Laureate from The Queen.\nTed Hughes Society.\nThe Ted Hughes Society, founded in 2010, publishes a peer-reviewed on-line journal, which can be downloaded by members. Its website also publishes news, and has articles on all Hughes's major works for free access. The Society staged Hughes conferences in 2010 and 2012 at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and will continue to stage conferences elsewhere.\nTed Hughes Paper Trail.\nOn 16 November 2013, Hughes's former hometown of Mexborough held a special performance trail, as part of its \"Right Up Our Street\" project, celebrating the writer's connection with the town. The free event included a two-hour ramble through Mexborough following the route of young Hughes's paper round. Participants visited some of the important locations which influenced the poet, with the trail beginning at Hughes's former home, which is now a furniture shop.\nElmet Trust.\nThe Elmet Trust, founded in 2006, celebrates the life and work of Ted Hughes. The Trust looks after Hughes's birthplace in Mytholmroyd, which is available as a holiday let and writer's retreat. The Trust also runs Hughes-related events, including an annual Ted Hughes Festival.\nSelected works.\nPoetry collections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLimited editions.\nMany of Ted Hughes's poems have been published as limited-edition broadsides.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources and further reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPapers"}
{"id": "31035", "revid": "51033416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31035", "title": "Thomas Wolsey", "text": "English statesman and cardinal (1473\u20131530)\nThomas Wolsey ( ; c.\u2009March 1473 \u2013 29 November 1530) was an English statesman and Catholic cardinal. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the king's almoner. Wolsey's affairs prospered and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state. He also held important ecclesiastical appointments. These included the Archbishop of York\u2014the second most important role in the English church\u2014and that of papal legate. His appointment as a cardinal by Pope Leo X in 1515 gave him precedence over all other English clergy.\nThe highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor, the king's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as the \"alter rex\" (\"other king\"). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfil his ecclesiastical duties as archbishop, a position he nominally held but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason\u2014charges Henry commonly used against ministers who fell out of his favour\u2014but died from natural causes on the way.\nEarly life.\nThomas Wolsey was born in about 1473, the son of Robert Wolsey of Ipswich and his wife, Joan Daundy. Widespread traditions identify his father as a butcher; his modest origin became a topic of criticism later, when he amassed wealth and power that critics thought more befitting a member of the high nobility. In reality his father owned several businesses and his mother was related to the influential Wingfield and Daundy families. Wolsey attended Ipswich School and Magdalen College School before studying theology at Magdalen College, Oxford. His education and career were assisted by his uncle, Edmund Daundy.\nOn 10 March 1498, he was ordained as a priest in Marlborough, Wiltshire, and remained in Oxford, first as the Master of Magdalen College School, and soon the dean of divinity. From 1500 to 1509, Wolsey held a living as rector of St Mary's Church, Limington, in Somerset. He served as Dean of Hereford Cathedral in 1512.\nIn 1502, he became a chaplain to Henry Deane, archbishop of Canterbury, who died the following year. He was then taken into the household of Sir Richard Nanfan, who made Wolsey executor of his estate. After Nanfan's death in 1507, Wolsey entered the service of King Henry VII.\nWolsey benefited from Henry VII's policy of curbing the nobility and favouring those from more humble backgrounds. Henry VII appointed Wolsey royal chaplain. In this position Wolsey served as secretary to Richard Foxe, who recognised Wolsey's ability, dedication, industry and willingness to take on tedious tasks. Wolsey's remarkable rise to power from humble origins attests to his intelligence, administrative ability, industriousness, ambition, and rapport with the king. In April 1508, Wolsey was sent to Scotland to discuss with King James IV rumours of the renewal of the Auld Alliance.\nWolsey's rise coincided with the accession in April 1509 of Henry VIII, whose character, policies and attitude to diplomacy differed significantly from his father's. In 1509 Henry appointed Wolsey to the post of almoner, a position that gave him a seat on the Privy Council and an opportunity to attain greater prominence and establish personal rapport with the king. A factor in Wolsey's rise was the young Henry VIII's relative lack of interest in the details of government during his early years.\nPolitical career.\nRise to prominence.\nThe primary counsellors Henry VIII inherited from his father were Richard Foxe (c. 1448\u00a0\u2013 1528, Bishop of Winchester 1501\u20131528) and William Warham (c. 1450\u00a0\u2013 1532, Archbishop of Canterbury 1503\u20131532). They were cautious and conservative, advising the king to act as a careful administrator like his father. Henry soon appointed to his Privy Council men more sympathetic to his own views and inclinations. Until 1511, Wolsey was adamantly antiwar, but when the king expressed his enthusiasm for an invasion of France, Wolsey adapted his views to the king's and gave persuasive speeches to the Privy Council in favour of war. Warham and Foxe, who did not share the king's enthusiasm for the French war, fell from power (1515/1516), and Wolsey took over as the king's most trusted advisor and administrator. When Warham resigned as Lord Chancellor in 1515, probably under pressure from Wolsey, Henry appointed Wolsey in his place.\nWolsey made careful moves to destroy or neutralise other courtiers' influence. He helped cause the fall of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham in 1521, and in 1527 he prosecuted, unsuccessfully, Henry's close friend William Compton and Henry's ex-mistress Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon, for adultery. In the case of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Wolsey adopted a different strategy, attempting to win Suffolk's favour by his actions after the duke secretly married Henry's sister Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France, much to the king's displeasure. Wolsey advised the king not to execute the newlyweds but to embrace them; Brandon was already friends with Wolsey as well as a kinsman. However the bride, both as sister to Henry and as Dowager Queen of France, had high royal status that could have threatened Wolsey had she so chosen.\nWolsey's rise to a position of great secular power paralleled his increasing status in the church. He became a canon of Windsor in 1511. In 1514 he was made Bishop of Lincoln and then Archbishop of York in the same year. Pope Leo X made him a cardinal in 1515, with the titular church of St Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1518 he was appointed as abbot of St. Albans and bishop of Bath. Following the success of the English campaign in France and the peace negotiations that followed, Wolsey's ecclesiastical career advanced further: in 1523 he became Bishop of Durham, a post with wide political powers, and thus became known as Prince-Bishop of Durham. In 1529 he moved on from the bishop position in Durham to become the Bishop of Winchester. With his roles in the church came great wealth and estates, and with the accumulation of his different roles in the church he made upwards of \u00a335,000 a year.\nForeign policy.\nWar with France.\nThe Anglo-French War (1512\u201314) gave Wolsey a significant opportunity to demonstrate his talents in foreign policy. A convenient justification for going to war came in 1511 in the form of a plea for help from Pope Julius II, who was beginning to feel threatened by France. England formed an alliance with Julius, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor against King Louis XII of France.\nThe first English campaign against France proved unsuccessful, partly due to the unreliability of the alliance with Ferdinand. Henry learned from the mistakes of the campaign and in 1513, still with papal support, launched a joint attack on France with Maximilian, successfully capturing two French cities and causing the French to retreat. Wolsey's ability to keep a large number of troops supplied and equipped for the duration of the war proved a major factor in the English success. He also had a key role in negotiating the Anglo-French treaty of 7 August 1514, which secured a temporary peace between the two nations. Under this treaty, Louis XII would marry Henry's young sister, Mary. In addition England was able to keep the captured city of Tournai and secure an increase in the annual pension France paid.\nMeanwhile, a turnover of rulers in Europe threatened to diminish England's influence. With Henry's sister, Mary, married to Louis XII on 9 October 1514, an alliance was formed, but Louis was not in good health. Less than three months later, he died and was succeeded by the young and ambitious Francis I.\nQueen Mary had allegedly secured a promise from Henry that if Louis died, she could marry whomever she pleased. Following Louis's death, she secretly married Suffolk, with Francis I's assistance, which prevented another marriage alliance. As Mary was the only princess Henry could use to secure marriage alliances, this was a bitter blow. Wolsey then proposed an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire against France.\nPapal legate.\nThe death of Ferdinand II of Aragon, Henry VIII's father-in-law and England's closest ally, in 1516 was a further blow. Ferdinand was succeeded by Charles\u00a0V, who immediately proposed peace with France. After Maximilian I's death in 1519, Charles was elected in his stead; thus Charles ruled a substantial portion of Europe and English influence became limited on the continent.\nBut Wolsey managed to assert English influence by other means. In 1517, Pope Leo X sought peace in Europe to form a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. In 1518 Wolsey was made Papal Legate in England, enabling him to realise Leo's desire for peace by organising the Treaty of London. The treaty showed Wolsey as the arbiter of Europe, organising a massive peace summit involving 20 nations. This put England at the forefront of European diplomacy and drew her out of isolation, making her a desirable ally. This is well illustrated by the Anglo-French treaty signed two days afterwards. It was partly this peace treaty that caused conflict between France and Spain. In 1519, when Charles V ascended to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor, King Francis I of France was infuriated. He had invested enormous sums in bribing the electorate to elect him emperor, and thus used the Treaty of London as a justification for the Habsburg-Valois conflict. Wolsey appeared to act as mediator between the two powers, both of which were vying for England's support.\nField of the Cloth of Gold.\nAnother of Wolsey's diplomatic triumphs was the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Wolsey organised much of this grandiose meeting between Francis\u00a0I and Henry VIII, accompanied by 5,000 followers and involving court activities more than military discussion. Though it seemed to open the door to peaceful negotiations with France if the king wished, it was also a chance for a lavish display of English wealth and power before the rest of Europe, through flamboyant celebrations and events such as jousting, with the two kings competing, though not against each other. With France and Spain vying for England's allegiance, Wolsey could choose the ally that better suited his policies. Wolsey chose Charles mainly because England's economy would suffer from the loss of the lucrative cloth trade industry between England and the Netherlands had France been chosen instead.\nUnder Wolsey's guidance, Europe's chief nations sought to outlaw war among Christian nations. Garrett Mattingly, who has studied the causes of wars in that era, found that treaties of non-aggression such as this one could never be stronger than their sponsors' armies. When those forces were about equal, the treaties typically widened the conflict. That is, diplomacy could sometimes postpone war, but could not prevent wars based on irreconcilable interests and ambitions. What was lacking, Mattingly concludes, was a neutral power whose judgements were generally accepted either by impartial justice or by overwhelming force.\nAlliance with Spain.\nThe Treaty of London is often regarded as Wolsey's finest moment, but it was abandoned within a year. Wolsey developed links with Charles in 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. At the Calais Conference Wolsey signed the Secret Treaty of Bruges (1521) with Charles\u00a0V, stating that England would join Spain in a war against France if France refused to sign the peace treaty and ignored the Anglo-French treaty of 1518. Wolsey's relationship with Rome was also ambivalent. Despite his links to the papacy, Wolsey was strictly Henry's servant. Though the Treaty of London was an elaboration on Pope Leo's ambitions for European peace, it was seen in Rome as a vain attempt by England to assert her influence over Europe and steal some papal thunder. Furthermore, Wolsey's peace initiatives prevented a crusade to the Holy Land, which was the catalyst for the Pope's desire for European peace.\nCardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, who represented the Pope at the Treaty of London, was kept waiting for many months in Calais before being allowed to cross the Channel and join the festivities in London in what may have been a display by Wolsey of his independence of Rome. An alternative hypothesis is that Campeggio was kept waiting until Wolsey received his legacy, thus asserting Wolsey's attachment to Rome.\nThough the English gain from the wars of 1522\u201323 was minimal, their contribution certainly aided Charles V in his defeat of the French, particularly in 1525 at the Battle of Pavia, where Charles's army captured Francis I. Henry then felt there was a realistic opportunity for him to seize the French crown, to which the kings of England had long laid claim. Parliament, however, refused to raise taxes. This led Wolsey to devise the Amicable Grant, which was met with even more hostility, and contributed to his downfall. In 1525, after Charles V had abandoned England as an ally, Wolsey began to negotiate with France, and the Treaty of the More was signed, during Francis I's captivity, with the Regent of France\u2014his mother, Louise of Savoy.\nThe closeness between England and Rome can be seen in the formulation of the League of Cognac in 1526. Though England was not part of it, the League was organised in part by Wolsey with papal support. Wolsey's plan was that the League of Cognac, an alliance between France and some Italian states, would challenge Charles's League of Cambrai. This was both a gesture of allegiance to Rome and an answer to growing concerns about Charles's dominance over Europe.\nThe final blow to this policy came in 1529, when the French made peace with Charles. Meanwhile, the French also continued to honour the \"Auld Alliance\" with Scotland, stirring up hostility on England's border. With peace between France and the Emperor, there was no-one to free the Pope from Charles, who had effectively held Pope Clement VII captive since the Sack of Rome (1527). There was thus little hope of securing Henry VIII an annulment from his marriage to Charles's aunt Catherine of Aragon. Since 1527, Wolsey's desire to secure an annulment for his master had dictated his foreign policy, and by 1529 none of his endeavours had succeeded.\nAnnulment.\nHenry's marriage to Queen Catherine of Aragon had produced no sons who survived infancy; the Wars of the Roses were still within living memory, leading to the fear of a power struggle after Henry's death. Henry felt the people would accept only a male sovereign, not his daughter Mary. He believed God had cursed him for the sin of marrying the widow of his elder brother, and that the papal dispensation for that marriage was invalid because it was based upon the claim that Catherine was still a virgin after her first husband's death. Henry argued that Catherine's claim was not credible, and thus the dispensation must be withdrawn and the marriage annulled. His motivation has been attributed to his determination to have a son and heir, and to his desire for Anne Boleyn, one of his wife's maids-of-honour. Queen Catherine had no further pregnancies after 1519; Henry began annulment proceedings in 1527.\nCatherine, however, maintained that she had been a virgin when she married Henry. Because she opposed annulment and a return to her previous status as Dowager Princess of Wales, the annulment request became a matter of international diplomacy, with Catherine's nephew Charles V pressuring Clement not to annul the marriage. Clement faced a dilemma: he would anger either Charles or Henry. He delayed his decision as long as possible, infuriating Henry and Anne Boleyn, who began to doubt Wolsey's loyalty to the Crown over the Church.\nWolsey appealed to Clement for an annulment on three fronts. First, he tried to convince the Pope that the dispensation was void as the marriage clearly disobeyed instructions in the book of Leviticus. Second, Wolsey objected to the dispensation on technical grounds, claiming it was incorrectly worded. (Shortly afterwards, a correctly worded version was found in Spain.) Third, Wolsey wanted Clement to let the final decision be made in England, which, as papal legate, he would supervise.\nIn 1528 Clement decided to allow two papal legates to decide the outcome in England: Wolsey and Campeggio. Wolsey was confident of the decision, but Campeggio took a long time to arrive, and when he finally did, he delayed proceedings so much that the case had to be suspended in July 1529, effectively sealing Wolsey's fate.\nDomestic achievements.\nDuring his 14 years as chancellor, Wolsey had more power than any other Crown servant in English history. This led to his being hated by much of the nobility, who believed that power should be theirs. The king protected him from being attacked. As long as he was in the king's favour, Wolsey had great freedom in domestic matters, and had his hand in nearly every aspect of them. For much of the time, Henry VIII had complete confidence in him, and as Henry's interests inclined more towards foreign policy, he was willing to give Wolsey free rein in reforming the management of domestic affairs, for which Wolsey had grand plans. Historian John Guy explains Wolsey's methods:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Only in the broadest respects was [the king] taking independent decisions. ... It was Wolsey who almost invariably calculated the available options and ranked them for royal consideration; who established the parameters of each successive debate; who controlled the flow of official information; who selected the king's secretaries, middle-ranked officials, and JPs; and who promulgated decisions himself had largely shaped, if not strictly taken.\nOperating with the king's firm support, and with special powers over the church given by the Pope as legate, Wolsey dominated civic affairs, administration, the law, the church, and foreign policy. He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. He built a great fortune for himself and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, with some success in areas such as finance, taxation, educational provision and justice. From the king's perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry wanted a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a man dogged by other men's failures and his own ambition. In the end, abandoned by the king, Wolsey was charged with treason, but died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.\nTaxation.\nWolsey made changes to the taxation system, devising, with treasurer of the Chamber John Heron, the \"Subsidy\". This form of tax was based upon accurate valuations of the taxpayer's wealth, where one shilling was taken per pound from the income. The old fixed tax of 15ths and 10ths meant that those who earned very little had to pay almost as much as the wealthy. With the new income tax the poorer members of society paid much less. This more progressive form of taxation enabled Wolsey to raise enough money for the king's foreign expeditions, bringing in over \u00a3300,000. He also raised considerable capital through other means, such as \"benevolences\", and enforced loans from the nobility, which yielded \u00a3200,000 in 1522. Ultimately, Wolsey's fiscal policy became increasingly disliked- his forced loans and benevolences culminated in the Amicable Grant (1525). This was met with hostility as the Amicable Grant provoked \"full-scale revolt in Suffolk... the most serious rebellion since 1497\" (Cornish rebellion).\nJustice.\nAs a legal administrator, Wolsey reinvented the equity court, where the verdict was decided by the judge on the principle of \"fairness\". As an alternative to the Common Law courts, Wolsey re-established the position of the prerogative courts of the Star Chamber and the Court of Chancery. The system in both courts concentrated on simple, inexpensive cases, and promised impartial justice. He also established the Court of Requests (although this court was only given this name later on) for the poor, where no fees were required. Wolsey's legal reforms were popular, and overflow courts were required to attend to all the cases. Many powerful men who had felt invincible under the law found themselves convicted; for example, in 1515, the Earl of Northumberland was sent to Fleet Prison and in 1516 Lord Abergavenny was accused of maintaining a larger armed retinue than legally permitted.\nWolsey also used his courts to tackle national controversies, such as the pressing issue of enclosures. The countryside had been thrown into discord by the entrepreneurial actions of landlords enclosing areas of land and converting from arable farming to pastoral farming, requiring fewer workers. The Tudors valued stability, and the resulting mass urban migration represented a serious crisis. Wolsey conducted national enquiries into enclosures in 1517, 1518 and 1527. In the course of his administration, he used the Court of Chancery to prosecute 264 landowners, including peers, bishops, knights, religious heads, and Oxford colleges. Enclosures were seen as directly linked to rural unemployment and depopulation, vagrancy, food shortages and, accordingly, inflation. This pattern repeated in many of Wolsey's other initiatives, particularly his quest to abolish enclosure. Despite spending significant time and effort investigating the state of the countryside and prosecuting numerous offenders, Wolsey freely surrendered his policy during the parliament of 1523 to ensure that Parliament passed his proposed taxes for Henry's war in France. Enclosures remained a problem for many years.\nWolsey used the Star Chamber to enforce his 1518 policy of \"Just Price\", which attempted to implement price controls on food in urban markets. Those found to be charging too much were prosecuted by the Chamber. After the bad harvest of 1527, Wolsey bought up surplus grain and sold it off cheaply to the needy. This greatly eased disorder and became common practice after a disappointing harvest.\nChurch reforms.\nIn 1524 and 1527 Wolsey used his powers as papal legate to dissolve 30 decayed monasteries where monastic life had virtually ceased in practice, some in Ipswich and Oxford. He used the income to found a grammar school in Ipswich (The King's School, Ipswich) and Cardinal College in Oxford (in 1532, after Wolsey's fall, the king renamed it King Henry VIII's College; it is now known as Christ Church). In 1528 he began to limit the benefit of clergy. He also attempted, as legate, to force reform on monastic orders like the Augustinian canons.\nWolsey died five years before Henry's dissolution of the monasteries began.\nRelationships.\nWolsey's power depended on maintaining good relations with Henry. He grew increasingly suspicious of the \"minions\"\u2014young, influential members of the Privy chamber\u2014particularly after infiltrating one of his own men into the group. He attempted many times to disperse them from court, giving them jobs that took them to the Continent and far from Henry. After the Amicable Grant failed, the minions began to undermine him again. Consequently, Wolsey devised a grand plan of administrative reforms, incorporating the notorious Eltham ordinances of 1526. This reduced the members of the Privy Council from 12 to 6, removing Henry's friends such as Sir William Compton and Nicholas Carew.\nOne of Wolsey's greatest impediments was his lack of popularity amongst the nobles at court and in Parliament. Their dislikes and mistrusts partly stemmed from what they saw as Wolsey's excessive demands for money in the form of the Subsidy or benevolences. They also resented the Act of Resumption of 1486, by which Henry VII had resumed possession of all lands granted by the crown since 1455. These lands had passed onto his heir, Henry VIII. Many nobles resented the rise to power of a low-born man, whilst others simply disliked that he monopolised the court and concealed information from the Privy Council.\nWhen mass riots broke out in East Anglia, which should have been under the control of the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, Henry was quick to denounce the Amicable Grant, and began to lose faith in Wolsey. During the relatively peaceful period in England after the War of the Roses, its population increased. With more demand for food and no additional supply, prices increased. Landowners were forced to enclose land and convert to pastoral farming, which brought in more profit. Wolsey's quest against enclosure was fruitless in terms of restoring economic stability.\nThe same can be said for Wolsey's legal reforms. After he made justice accessible to all and encouraged more people to bring cases to court, the system was abused. The courts became overloaded with incoherent, tenuous cases, which would have been far too expensive to have rambled on in the Common Law courts. Wolsey eventually ordered all minor cases out of the Star Chamber in 1528. The result of this venture was further resentment by the nobility and the gentry.\nArt patronage.\nFrom 1515, when he became cardinal, until his death, Wolsey used art and architecture to underpin his positions. He initiated a building campaign on a scale not only unprecedented for an English churchman and Lord Chancellor, but also exceeded by few English kings. In so doing, he brought Italian Renaissance ideas, classical embellishments, and architectural models into English architecture. Scholars generally cite Somerset House in London (1547\u20131552) as the first classical building in England, built for Edward Seymour, the first Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector to King Edward VI. But Wolsey embraced Italian-inspired classicism nearly half a century before Seymour, though more theoretically than visually. Wolsey's subsequent disgrace over his failure to garner papal approval of an annulment of Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon has clouded the fact that he was not only the first high-profile patron in England to seek out and promote Italian classicism in art, architecture, and magnificence, but also that his contributions endured.\nAmong Wolsey's projects were lavish, classically inspired additions to York Palace in London, the Archbishop of York's residence. He supervised the grandiose temporary buildings at the Field of Cloth of Gold and renovated Hampton Court, which he later relinquished to the king. Wolsey's use of architecture as a symbol of power, along with his introduction of Italian classical ornamentation, set a trend continued by Henry VIII and others. Wolsey oversaw tombs for Henry's VIII's parents at Westminster Abbey and negotiated contracts for Henry VIII's tomb as well as one for himself. If these works had been completed as planned, they would be among Europe's largest, most elaborate, and grandest tombs. The college originally founded and planned by Wolsey and refounded by Henry VIII (Christ Church) remains the largest and grandest of all Oxford colleges.\nFailures with the Church.\nAs well as his State duties, Wolsey simultaneously attempted to exert his influence over the Church in England. As cardinal and, from 1524, lifetime papal legate, Wolsey continually vied for control over others in the Church. His principal rival was William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who made it more difficult for Wolsey to follow through with his plans for reform. Despite making promises to reform the bishoprics of England and Ireland, and, in 1519, encouraging monasteries to embark on a programme of reform, he did nothing to bring about these changes.\nDownfall and death.\nIn spite of having many enemies, Wolsey retained Henry VIII's confidence until Henry decided to seek an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. Wolsey's failure to secure the annulment directly caused his downfall and arrest. It was rumoured that Anne Boleyn and her faction convinced Henry that Wolsey was deliberately slowing proceedings; as a result, he was arrested in 1529, and the Pope decided that the official decision should be made in Rome, not England.\nIn 1529, Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of Palace of Whitehall, which Henry took to replace the Palace of Westminster as his own main London residence. Wolsey was permitted to remain Archbishop of York. He travelled to Yorkshire for the first time in his career, but when he was staying at one of the Archbishop's residences, Cawood in north Yorkshire, he was accused of treason and ordered to London by Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland.\nIn great distress, Wolsey left Cawood Castle on the evening of 7 November 1530. He lodged at Pomfret Abbey in Pontefract that night and the following day made it to Sheffield Park, where he spent the next 14 days hosted by George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury.\nAt Sheffield, Wolsey fell seriously ill with dysentery. Taken into custody by Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower, Wolsey left for Hardwick Hall on 25 November. He was so ill that Kingston's guards believed Wolsey to be dying, and wept openly. Spending the night in the city of Nottingham, Wolsey proceeded to Leicester Abbey in the city of Leicester. He was so weak, he could barely sit on his mule. He reached the abbey on the evening of 27 November, and had to be carried upstairs.\nWolsey remained in bed the next day, his health rapidly failing. He began to lose his sight, and repeatedly lost consciousness the night of 28 to 29 November. He made confession at 7\u00a0a.m. on 29 November, and died an hour later.\nWolsey was buried in a simple pine coffin, dressed in his episcopal robes and with his cross, mitre, and ring. He lay in state at the abbey until 5\u00a0p.m. on 29 November, after which his body was moved to the abbey church. The funeral Mass was sung at 4\u00a0a.m. on 1 December, and he was buried two hours later.\nLeicester Abbey was turned over to William Cavendish after the dissolution of the monasteries. His son tore down the abbey, and the site of Wolsey's burial was lost. (The site of the former abbey is now Abbey Park.)\nIn keeping with his practice of erecting magnificent buildings at Hampton Court, Westminster and Oxford, Wolsey had planned a magnificent tomb at Windsor by Benedetto da Rovezzano and Giovanni da Maiano. Henry VIII contemplated using the impressive black sarcophagus for himself, but Lord Nelson now lies in it, in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral.\nHenry often receives credit for artistic patronage that properly belongs to Wolsey.\nMistress and issue.\nWolsey lived in a \"non-canonical\" marriage for around a decade with a woman called Joan Larke of Yarmouth, Norfolk. The edict that priests, regardless of their functions or the character of their work, should remain celibate had not been wholeheartedly accepted in England.\nWolsey had two children, both before he was made bishop: a son, Thomas Wynter (born circa 1510), and a daughter, Dorothy (born circa 1512), both of whom lived to adulthood. The son was sent to live with a family in Willesden and tutored in his early years by Maurice Birchinshaw. He later married and had children of his own. Dorothy was adopted by John Clansey, and was in due course placed in the convent at Shaftesbury Abbey. Following the dissolution of the monasteries under Thomas Cromwell she was awarded a pension.\nFollowing his rapid promotion, Larke became a source of embarrassment to Wolsey, who arranged for her marriage to George Legh of Adlington, Cheshire, circa 1519. He provided the dowry. Henry VIII had a mansion built for Legh at Cheshunt Great House.\nMemorials.\nBefore Wolsey was removed from power, he planned to make his home town of Ipswich a seat of learning. He built a substantial college, which for two years, 1528\u20131530, was parent of the Queen Elizabeth School or Ipswich School, which today flourishes on another site. All that remains of Wolsey's structure is the former waterside gate, figured by Francis Grose in his \"Antiquities\", which can still be seen on College Street.\nIn 1930 Wolsey was commemorated in Ipswich with a pageant play.\nAn appeal was launched in 2009 to erect a permanent memorial to Wolsey in Ipswich. This led to the commissioning of a more-than-life-sized bronze statue from sculptor David Annand. Wolsey is shown seated and facing south towards St Peter's Church (the former medieval Augustinian priory church, which he annexed as the chapel of his college), teaching from a book, and with a cat at his side. The statue was unveiled in June 2011, when it was dedicated by the Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, and launched in a civic capacity by the Mayor of Ipswich.\nAnother statue of Wolsey stands in Leicester's Abbey Park close to the site of his burial. It was donated by the Wolsey hosiery company, a major employer in the city and also named after the cardinal.\nOther.\nCardinal Wolsey's bust was used in the 1980s above the London Transport roundel on London's buses in west and south-west London as the symbol of the Cardinal bus district, which was named after him and his residence at Hampton Court.\nCarlos Logario, a Spanish doctor practising in England, was the doctor to Thomas Wolsey.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31036", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31036", "title": "Triode", "text": "Single-grid amplifying vacuum tube having three active electrodes\nA triode is an electronic amplifying vacuum tube (or \"thermionic valve\" in British English) consisting of three electrodes inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated filament or cathode, a grid, and a plate (anode). \nDeveloped from Lee De Forest's 1906 Audion, a partial vacuum tube that added a grid electrode to the thermionic diode (Fleming valve), the triode was the first practical electronic amplifier and the ancestor of other types of vacuum tubes such as the tetrode and pentode. Its invention helped make amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony possible. Triodes were widely used in consumer electronics devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when transistors replaced them. Today, their main remaining use is in high-power RF amplifiers in radio transmitters and industrial RF heating devices. In recent years there has been a resurgence in demand for low power triodes due to renewed interest in tube-type audio equipment by audiophiles who prefer the sound of tube-based electronics.\nName.\nThe name \"triode\" was coined by British physicist William Eccles some time around 1920, derived from the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, \"tr\u00edodos\", from \"tri-\" (three) and \"hod\u00f3s\" (road, way), originally meaning the place where three roads meet.\nHistory.\nPrecursor devices.\nBefore thermionic valves were invented, Philipp Lenard used the principle of grid control while conducting photoelectric experiments in 1902.\nThe first vacuum tube used in radio was the thermionic diode or Fleming valve, invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 as a detector for radio receivers. It was an evacuated glass bulb containing two electrodes, a heated filament (cathode) and a plate (anode).\nInvention.\nTriodes came about in 1906 when American engineer Lee de Forest and Austrian physicist Robert von Lieben independently patented tubes that added a third electrode, a control grid, between the filament and plate to control current. Von Lieben's partially-evacuated three-element tube, patented in March 1906, contained a trace of mercury vapor and was intended to amplify weak telephone signals. Starting in October 1906 De Forest patented a number of three-element tube designs by adding an electrode to the diode, which he called Audions, intended to be used as radio detectors. The one which became the design of the triode, in which the grid was located between the filament and plate, was patented January 29, 1907. Like the von Lieben vacuum tube, De Forest's Audions were incompletely evacuated and contained some gas at low pressure. von Lieben's vacuum tube did not see much development due to his death seven years after its invention, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War.\nDe Forest's Audion did not see much use until its ability to amplify was recognized around 1912 by several researchers, who used it to build the first successful amplifying radio receivers and electronic oscillators. The many uses for amplification motivated its rapid development. By 1913 improved versions with higher vacuum were developed by Harold Arnold at American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which had purchased the rights to the Audion from De Forest, and Irving Langmuir at General Electric, who named his tube the \"Pliotron\", These were the first vacuum tube triodes. The name \"triode\" appeared later, when it became necessary to distinguish it from other kinds of vacuum tubes with more or fewer elements (diodes, tetrodes, pentodes, etc.). There were lengthy lawsuits between De Forest and von Lieben, and De Forest and the Marconi Company, who represented John Ambrose Fleming, the inventor of the diode.\nWider adoption.\nThe discovery of the triode's amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of \"electronics\", the technology of active (amplifying) electrical devices. The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. During World War I, AM voice two way radio sets were made possible in 1917 (see TM (triode)) which were simple enough that the pilot in a single seat aircraft could use it while flying. Triode \"continuous wave\" radio transmitters replaced the cumbersome inefficient \"damped wave\" spark-gap transmitters, allowing the transmission of sound by amplitude modulation (AM). Amplifying triode radio receivers, which had the power to drive loudspeakers, replaced weak crystal radios, which had to be listened to with earphones, allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first mass communication medium, with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920. Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode repeaters, invented at Bell Telephone after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915. Other inventions made possible by the triode were television, public address systems, electric phonographs, and talking motion pictures.\nThe triode served as the technological base from which later vacuum tubes developed, such as the tetrode (Walter Schottky, 1916) and pentode (Gilles Holst and Bernardus Dominicus Hubertus Tellegen, 1926), which remedied some of the shortcomings of the triode detailed below.\nThe triode was very widely used in consumer electronics such as radios, televisions, and audio equipment until it was replaced in the 1960s by the transistor, invented in 1947, which brought the \"vacuum tube era\" introduced by the triode to a close. Today triodes are used mostly in high-power applications for which solid state semiconductor devices are unsuitable, such as radio transmitters and industrial heating equipment. However, more recently the triode and other vacuum tube devices have been experiencing a resurgence and comeback in high fidelity audio and musical equipment. They also remain in use as vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), which come in a variety of implementations but all are essentially triode devices.\nConstruction.\nAll triodes have a hot cathode electrode heated by a filament, which releases electrons, and a flat metal plate electrode (anode) to which the electrons are attracted, with a grid consisting of a screen of wires between them to control the current. These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum, about 10\u22129 atm. Since the filament eventually burns out, the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit; the electrodes are attached to terminal pins which plug into a socket. The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes.\nLow power triodes.\nLow power triodes have a concentric construction \"(see drawing right)\", with the grid and anode as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode. The cathode is a narrow metal tube down the center. Inside the cathode is a filament called the \"heater\" consisting of a narrow strip of high resistance tungsten wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000\u00a0\u00b0C). This type is called an \"indirectly heated cathode\". The cathode is coated with a mixture of alkaline earth oxides such as calcium and thorium oxide which reduces its work function so it produces more electrons. The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode. The anode is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid. It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat-radiating fins. The electrons travel in a radial direction, from cathode through the grid to the anode. The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic insulators and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins. A \"getter\", a small amount of shiny barium metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.\nHigh-power triodes.\nHigh-power triodes generally use a filament which serves as the cathode (a directly heated cathode) because the emission coating on indirectly heated cathodes is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes. A thoriated tungsten filament is most often used, in which thorium added to the tungsten diffuses to the surface and forms a monolayer which increases electron emission. As the monolayer is removed by ion bombardment it is continually renewed by more thorium diffusing to the surface. These generally run at higher temperatures than indirectly heated cathodes. The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass, and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced. Tubes with anode power dissipation over several hundred watts are usually actively cooled; the anode, made of heavy copper, projects through the wall of the tube and is attached to a large external finned metal heat sink which is cooled by forced air or water.\nLighthouse tubes.\nA type of low power triode for use at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF), the \"lighthouse\" tube, has a planar construction to reduce interelectrode capacitance and lead inductance, which gives it the appearance of a \"lighthouse\". The disk-shaped cathode, grid and plate form planes up the center of the tube - a little like a sandwich with spaces between the layers. The cathode at the bottom is attached to the tube's pins, but the grid and plate are brought out to low inductance terminals on the upper level of the tube: the grid to a metal ring halfway up, and the plate to a metal button at the top. These are one example of \"disk seal\" design. Smaller examples dispense with the octal pin base shown in the illustration and rely on contact rings for all connections, including heater and D.C. cathode.\nAs well, high-frequency performance is limited by transit time: the time required for electrons to travel from cathode to anode. Transit time effects are complicated, but one simple effect is input conductance, also known as grid loading. At extreme high frequencies, electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode. This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low-frequency \"open circuit\" characteristic.\nTransit time effects are reduced by reduced spacings in the tube. Tubes such as the 416B (a Lighthouse design) and the 7768 (an all-ceramic miniaturised design) are specified for operation to 4\u00a0GHz. They feature greatly reduced grid-cathode spacings of the order of 0.1\u00a0mm.\nThese greatly reduced grid spacings also give a much higher amplification factor than conventional axial designs. The 7768 has an amplification factor of 225, compared with 100 for the 6AV6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an axial design.\nAnode-grid capacitance is not especially low in these designs. The 6AV6 anode-grid capacitance is 2 picofarads (pF), the 7768 has a value of 1.7 pF. The close electrode spacing used in microwave tubes \"increases\" capacitances, but this increase is offset by their overall reduced dimensions compared to lower-frequency tubes.\nOperation.\nIn the triode, electrons are released into the tube from the metal cathode by heating it, a process called thermionic emission. The cathode is heated red hot by a separate current flowing through a thin metal filament. In some tubes the filament itself is the cathode, while in most tubes there is a separate filament which heats the cathode but is electrically isolated from it. The interior of the tube is well evacuated so that electrons can travel between the cathode and the anode without losing energy in collisions with gas molecules. A positive DC voltage, which can be as low as 20V or up to thousands of volts in some transmitting tubes, is present on the anode. The negative electrons are attracted to the positively charged anode (or \"plate\"), and flow through the spaces between the grid wires to it, creating a flow of electrons through the tube from cathode to anode.\nThe magnitude of this current can be controlled by a voltage applied on the grid (relative to the cathode). The grid acts like a gate for the electrons. A more negative voltage on the grid will repel more of the electrons, so fewer get through to the anode, reducing the anode current. A less negative voltage on the grid will allow more electrons from the cathode to reach the anode, increasing the anode current. Therefore, an input AC signal on the grid of a few volts (or less), even at a very high impedance (since essentially no current flows through the grid) can control a much more powerful anode current, resulting in amplification. When used in its linear region, variation in the grid voltage will cause an approximately proportional variation in the anode current; this ratio is called the transconductance. If a suitable load resistance is inserted in the anode circuit, although the transconductance is somewhat lowered, the varying anode current will cause a varying voltage across that resistance which can be much larger than the input voltage variations, resulting in voltage gain.\nThe triode is a normally \"on\" device; and current flows to the anode with zero voltage on the grid. The anode current is progressively reduced as the grid is made more negative relative to the cathode. Usually a constant DC voltage (\"bias\") is applied to the grid along with the varying signal voltage superimposed on it. That bias is required so that the positive peaks of the signal never drive the grid positive with respect to the cathode which would result in grid current and non-linear behaviour. A sufficiently negative voltage on the grid (usually around 3-5 volts in small tubes such as the 6AV6, but as much as \u2013130 volts in early audio power devices such as the '45), will prevent any electrons from getting through to the anode, turning off the anode current. This is called the \"cutoff voltage\". Since beyond cutoff the anode current ceases to respond to the grid voltage, the voltage on the grid must remain above the cutoff voltage for faithful (linear) amplification as well as not exceeding the cathode voltage.\nThe triode is somewhat similar in operation to the n-channel JFET; it is normally on, and exhibits progressively lower and lower plate/drain current as the grid/gate is pulled increasingly negative relative to the source/cathode. Cutoff voltage corresponds to the JFET's pinch-off voltage (Vp) or VGS(off); i.e., the voltage point at which output current essentially reaches zero. This similarity is limited, however. The triode's anode current is highly dependent on anode voltage as well as grid voltage, thus limiting the voltage gain. Because, in contrast, the JFET's drain current is virtually unaffected by drain voltage, it appears as a constant-current device, similar in action to a tetrode or pentode tube (high dynamic output impedance). Both the JFET and tetrode/pentode valves are thereby capable of much higher voltage gains than the triode which seldom exceeds 100. However the power gain, or the output power obtained from a certain AC input voltage is often of greater interest. When these devices are used as cathode followers (or source followers), they all have a voltage \"gain\" of just under 1, but with a large current gain.\nApplications.\nAlthough S.G. Brown's Type G Telephone Relay (using a magnetic \"earphone\" mechanism driving a carbon microphone element) was able to give power amplification and had been in use as early as 1914, it was a purely mechanical device with limited frequency range and fidelity. It was suited only to a limited range of audio frequencies - essentially voice frequencies.\nThe triode was the first non-mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies, and made radio practical. Triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators. Many types are used only at low to moderate frequency and power levels. Large water-cooled triodes may be used as the final amplifier in radio transmitters, with ratings of thousands of watts. Specialized types of triode (\"lighthouse\" tubes, with low capacitance between elements) provide useful gain at microwave frequencies.\nVacuum tubes are obsolete in mass-marketed consumer electronics, having been overtaken by less expensive transistor-based solid-state devices. However, more recently, vacuum tubes have been making somewhat of a comeback. Triodes continue to be used in certain high-power RF amplifiers and transmitters. While proponents of vacuum tubes claim their superiority in areas such as high-end and professional audio applications, the solid-state MOSFET has similar performance characteristics.\nCharacteristics.\nIn triode datasheets, characteristics linking the anode current (Ia) to anode voltage (Va) and grid voltage (Vg) are usually given. From here, a circuit designer can choose the operating point of the particular triode. Then the output voltage and amplification of the triode can be evaluated graphically by drawing a load line on the graph.\nIn the example characteristic shown on the image, suppose we wish to operate it at a quiescent anode voltage Va of and a grid voltage bias of . This implies a quiescent plate (anode) current of (using the yellow curve on the graph). In a class-A triode amplifier, one might place an anode resistor (connected between the anode and the positive power supply). If we choose \"Ra\" = 10000 \u03a9, the voltage drop on it would be \"V\"+ \u2212 \"Va\" = \"Ia\" \u00d7 \"Ra\" = 22 V for the chosen anode current of \"Ia\" = 2.2 mA. Thus we require a power supply voltage \"V+\" = 222 V in order to obtain \"Va\" = 200 V on the anode.\nNow suppose we impress on the bias voltage a signal of peak-peak, so that the grid voltage varies between . When\" Vg\" = \u22120.5 V, the anode current will increase to 3.1 mA, lowering the anode voltage to \"Va\" = \"V\"+ \u2212 10 k\u03a9 \u00d7 3.1 mA = 191 V (orange curve). When \"Vg\" = \u22121.5 V, the anode current will decrease to , raising the anode voltage to \"Va\" = \"V\"+ \u2212 10 k\u03a9 \u00d7 1.4 mA = 208 V (green curve). Therefore a 1 V peak-peak signal on the input (grid) causes an output voltage change of about . \nThus voltage amplification of the signal is obtained. The ratio of these two changes, the voltage amplification factor (or \"mu\") is 17 in this case. It is also possible to use triodes as cathode followers in which there is no voltage amplification but a huge reduction in dynamic impedance; in other words, the \"current\" is greatly amplified (as it also is in the common-cathode configuration described above). Amplifying either the voltage or current results in power amplification, the general purpose of an amplifying tube (after all, either the current or voltage alone could be increased by decreasing the other just using a transformer, a passive device).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first transmitted in 1952, and repeated regularly for more than twenty years. A remake of the programme called \"Bill and Ben\" was broadcast in 2001.\nThe original programme was part of a BBC children's television series titled \"Watch with Mother\", featuring a different programme each weekday, most of them involving string puppets.\nPremise.\n\"Flower Pot Men\" features the story of Bill and Ben, two men made of terracotta flower pots who live at the bottom of an English garden. A third character, Little Weed, of indeterminate species resembling either a sunflower or a dandelion with a smiling face, is shown growing between two large flowerpots. The three are also sometimes visited by a tortoise called Slowcoach and, in one particular episode, the trio meet a faintly mysterious character made out of potatoes, Dan the Potato Man.\nTypically, while the \"man who worked in the garden\" would be away having his dinner, the two flower pot men, Bill and Ben, would emerge from their pots. After a minor adventure, a slight mishap would occur, for which someone would then take the blame: \"Which of these two flowerpot men, was it Bill or was it Ben?\" the narrator would trill in a quavering soprano; the culprit would then confess, before the gardener's footsteps would be heard coming up the garden path; the flower pot men then would vanish into their pots and the \"Goodbye\" screen would appear. The final punch-line was, \"..and I think the little house knew something about it; don't you?\".\nProduction.\nAccording to her adopted daughter Alison Gassier, Freda Lingstrom got the idea for the show after spending time in her woodshed with a flowerpot. She assembled the production crew, which consisted mainly of those who had worked on her previous show \"Andy Pandy\": her associate Maria Bird, who wrote the songs and music and narrated, puppeteers Audrey Atterbury and Molly Gibson, and singers Gladys Whitred and Julia Whitaker (nee Williams). The only new member was Peter Hawkins, who voiced both Bill and Ben, inventing their gibberish language, named Oddle-Poddle. He based the language on select words such as \"Slogalog\" (Slowcoach the Tortoise) and \"Haddap\" (Hello).\nThe puppets were made to look as if they were made from flowerpots. Cupcake holders were used for their hats, which sometimes caught onto their strings. Peter particularly praised Audrey's puppetry for being very precise. The scripts were written in English, with Peter translating them into Oddle-Poddle.\nUK VHS Releases.\n \nConfusion with other characters.\nRetired headteacher Hilda Brabban created an unrelated set of characters also named Bill and Ben. These have been confused with the \"Flower Pot Men\", including in the initial versions of two obituaries of Brabban, published in \"The Independent\" and BBC's in-house magazine \"Ariel\" respectively. The confusion also affected the BBC panel show \"QI\", where host Stephen Fry in the 2004 episode \"Bills\" mistakenly claimed Brabban had named the \"Flower Pot Men\" characters after her younger brothers. All three sources later corrected their statements. Brabban sold three stories about a Bill and Ben to the BBC in the 1950s; but other than their names, they bore no resemblance to the \"Flower Pot Men\". Brabban's stories were broadcast on the radio programme \"Listen with Mother\" in 1951; the Bill and Ben of the \"Flower Pot Men\" were first seen on the television programme \"Watch with Mother\" in 1952. Both programmes were produced by Freda Lingstrom. During her later life Brabban suffered a stroke and later maintained she did invent the characters used in the BBC series; this prompted lawyers, acting on behalf of the estate of the show's creator, Freda Lingstrom, to threaten Brabban with litigation if she appeared on television to propagate this claim.\nComics.\nThe show was the basis for a comic strip of the same name in the children's magazine \"Robin\".\nLegacy.\nThe short lived one-hit wonder group, The Flower Pot Men, known for their 1967 song \"Let's Go to San Francisco\", named the group after the show, although it caused controversies with people suggesting it may have had something to do with marijuana. Bill and Ben themselves may have inspired the names of the twin characters Bill and Ben from \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31039", "revid": "50572720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31039", "title": "Turboprop", "text": "Turbine engine driving an aircraft propeller\nA turboprop is a gas-turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller.\nA turboprop consists of an intake, reduction gearbox, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a propelling nozzle. Air enters the intake and is compressed by the compressor. Jet fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts. The hot combustion gases expand through the turbine stages, generating power at the point of exhaust. Some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor and electric generator. The gases are then exhausted from the turbine. In contrast to a turbojet or turbofan, the engine's exhaust gases do not provide enough power to create significant thrust, since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller.\nTechnological aspects.\nExhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power, which is obtained by extracting additional power (beyond that necessary to drive the compressor) from turbine expansion. Owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system, the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low. Consequently, the exhaust jet produces about 10% of the total thrust. A higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds.\nTurboprops have bypass ratios of 50\u2013100, although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.\nThe propeller is coupled to the turbine through a reduction gear that converts the high RPM/low torque output to low RPM/high torque. This can be of two primary designs, free-turbine and fixed. A free-turbine turboshaft found on the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6, where the gas generator is not connected to the propeller. This allows for propeller strike or similar damage to occur without damaging the gas generator and allowing for only the power section (turbine and gearbox) to be removed and replaced in such an event, and also allows for less stress on the start during engine ground starts. Whereas a fixed shaft has the gearbox and gas generator connected, such as on the Honeywell TPE331.\nThe propeller itself is normally a constant-speed (variable pitch) propeller type similar to that used with larger aircraft reciprocating engines, except that the propeller-control requirements are very different. Due to the turbine engine's slow response to power inputs, particularly at low speeds, the propeller has a greater range of selected travel in order to make rapid thrust changes, notably for taxi, reverse, and other ground operations. The propeller has 2 modes, Alpha and Beta. Alpha is the mode for all flight operations including takeoff. Beta, a mode typically consisting of zero to negative thrust, is used for all ground operations aside from takeoff. The Beta mode is further broken down into 2 additional modes, Beta for taxi and Beta plus power. Beta for taxi as the name implies is used for taxi operations and consists of all pitch ranges from the lowest alpha range pitch, all the way down to zero pitch, producing very little to zero-thrust and is typically accessed by moving the power lever to a beta for taxi range. Beta plus power is a reverse range and produces negative thrust, often used for landing on short runways where the aircraft would need to rapidly slow down, as well as backing operations and is accessed by moving the power lever below the beta for taxi range. Due to the pilot not being able to see out of the rear of the aircraft for backing and the amount of debris reverse stirs up, manufacturers will often limit the speeds beta plus power may be used and restrict its use on unimproved runways. Feathering of these propellers is performed by the propeller control lever.\nThe constant-speed propeller is distinguished from the reciprocating engine constant-speed propeller by the control system. The turboprop system consists of 3 propeller governors, a governor, and overspeed governor, and a fuel-topping governor. The governor works in much the same way a reciprocating engine propeller governor works, though a turboprop governor may incorporate beta control valve or beta lift rod for beta operation and is typically located in the 12 o'clock position. There are also other governors that are included in addition depending on the model, such as an overspeed and fuel topping governor on a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6, and an under-speed governor on a Honeywell TPE331. The turboprop is also distinguished from other kinds of turbine engine in that the fuel control unit is connected to the governor to help dictate power.\nTo make the engine more compact, reverse airflow can be used. On a reverse-flow turboprop engine, the compressor intake is at the aft of the engine, and the exhaust is situated forward, reducing the distance between the turbine and the propeller.\nUnlike the small-diameter fans used in turbofan engines, the propeller has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust. Since it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree, a low disc loading (thrust per unit disc area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.\nPropellers work well until the flight speed of the aircraft is high enough that the airflow past the blade tips reaches the speed of sound. Beyond that speed, the proportion of the power that drives the propeller that is converted to propeller thrust falls dramatically. For this reason turboprop engines are not commonly used on aircraft that fly faster than 0.6\u20130.7 Mach, with some exceptions such as the Tupolev Tu-95. However, propfan engines, which are very similar to turboprop engines, can cruise at flight speeds approaching 0.75 Mach. To maintain propeller efficiency across a wide range of airspeeds, turboprops use constant-speed (variable-pitch) propellers. The blades of a constant-speed propeller increase their pitch as aircraft speed increases. Another benefit of this type of propeller is that it can also be used to generate reverse thrust to reduce stopping distance on the runway. Additionally, in the event of an engine failure, the propeller can be feathered, thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning propeller.\nWhile the power turbine may be integral with the gas generator section, many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft. This enables the propeller to rotate freely, independent of compressor speed.\nHistory.\nAlan Arnold Griffith had published a paper on compressor design in 1926. Subsequent work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment investigated axial compressor-based designs that would drive a propeller. From 1929, Frank Whittle began work on centrifugal compressor-based designs that would use all the gas power produced by the engine for jet thrust.\nThe world's first turboprop was designed by the Hungarian mechanical engineer Gy\u00f6rgy Jendrassik. Jendrassik published a turboprop idea in 1928, and on 12 March 1929 he patented his invention. In 1938, he built a small-scale (100 Hp; 74.6\u00a0kW) experimental gas turbine. The larger Jendrassik Cs-1, with a predicted output of 1,000 bhp, was produced and tested at the Ganz Works in Budapest between 1937 and 1941. It was of axial-flow design with 15 compressor and 7 turbine stages, annular combustion chamber. First run in 1940, combustion problems limited its output to 400\u00a0bhp. Two Jendrassik Cs-1s were the engines for the world's first turboprop aircraft \u2013 the Varga RMI-1 X/H. This was a Hungarian fighter-bomber of WWII which had one model completed, but before its first flight it was destroyed in a bombing raid. In 1941, the engine was abandoned due to war, and the factory converted to conventional engine production.\nThe first mention of turboprop engines in the general public press was in the February 1944 issue of the British aviation publication \"Flight\", which included a detailed cutaway drawing of what a possible future turboprop engine could look like. The drawing was very close to what the future Rolls-Royce Trent would look like. The first British turboprop engine was the Rolls-Royce RB.50 Trent, a converted Derwent II fitted with reduction gear and a Rotol five-bladed propeller. Two Trents were fitted to Gloster Meteor \"EE227\" \u2014 the sole \"Trent-Meteor\" \u2014 which thus became the world's first turboprop-powered aircraft to fly, albeit as a test-bed not intended for production. It first flew on 20 September 1945. From their experience with the Trent, Rolls-Royce developed the Rolls-Royce Clyde, the first turboprop engine to receive a type certificate for military and civil use, and the Dart, which became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built. Dart production continued for more than fifty years. The Dart-powered Vickers Viscount was the first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large numbers. It was also the first four-engined turboprop. Its first flight was on 16 July 1948. The world's first single engined turboprop aircraft was the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba-powered Boulton Paul Balliol, which first flew on 24 March 1948.\nThe Soviet Union built on German World War II turboprop preliminary design work by Junkers Motorenwerke, while BMW, Heinkel-Hirth and Daimler-Benz also worked on projected designs. While the Soviet Union had the technology to create the airframe for a jet-powered strategic bomber comparable to Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, they instead produced the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear, powered with four Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops, mated to eight contra-rotating propellers (two per nacelle) with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum cruise speeds in excess of 575\u00a0mph, faster than many of the first jet aircraft and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions. The Bear would serve as their most successful long-range combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol of Soviet power projection through to the end of the 20th century. The USA used turboprop engines with contra-rotating propellers, such as the Allison T40, on some experimental aircraft during the 1950s. The T40-powered Convair R3Y Tradewind flying-boat was operated by the U.S. Navy for a short time.\nThe first American turboprop engine was the General Electric XT31, first used in the experimental Consolidated Vultee XP-81. The XP-81 first flew in December 1945, the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power. The technology of Allison's earlier T38 design evolved into the Allison T56, used to power the Lockheed Electra airliner, its military maritime patrol derivative the P-3 Orion, and the C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft.\nThe first turbine-powered, shaft-driven helicopter was the Kaman K-225, a development of Charles Kaman's K-125 synchropter, which used a Boeing T50 turboshaft engine to power it on 11 December 1951.\nDecember 1963 saw the first delivery of Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada's PT6 turboprop engine for the then Beechcraft 87, soon to become Beechcraft King Air.\n1964 saw the first deliveries of the Garrett AiResearch TPE331, (now owned by Honeywell Aerospace) on the Mitsubishi MU-2, making it the fastest turboprop aircraft for that year.\nUsage.\nIn contrast to turbofans, turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 725\u00a0km/h (450\u00a0mph; 390 knots) because the jet velocity of the propeller (and exhaust) is relatively low. Modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the same speed as small regional jet airliners but burn two-thirds of the fuel per passenger.\nCompared to piston engines, their greater power-to-weight ratio (which allows for shorter takeoffs) and reliability can offset their higher initial cost, maintenance and fuel consumption. As jet fuel can be easier to obtain than avgas in remote areas, turboprop-powered aircraft like the Cessna Caravan and Quest Kodiak are used as bush airplanes.\nTurboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft, but the Tupolev Tu-114 can reach . Large military aircraft, like the Tupolev Tu-95, and civil aircraft, such as the Lockheed L-188 Electra, were also turboprop powered. The Airbus A400M is powered by four Europrop TP400 engines, which are the second most powerful turboprop engines ever produced, after the Kuznetsov NK-12.\nIn 2017, the most widespread turboprop airliners in service were the ATR 42/72 (950 aircraft), Bombardier Q400 (506), De Havilland Canada Dash 8-100/200/300 (374), Beechcraft 1900 (328), de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (270), Saab 340 (225). Less widespread and older airliners include the BAe Jetstream 31, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner, Dornier 328, Saab 2000, Xian MA60, MA600 and MA700, Fokker 27 and 50.\nTurboprop business aircraft include the Piper Meridian, Socata TBM, Pilatus PC-12, Piaggio P.180 Avanti, Beechcraft King Air and Super King Air. In April 2017, there were 14,311 business turboprops in the worldwide fleet.\nReliability.\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the ATSB observed 417 events with turboprop aircraft, 83 per year, over 1.4 million flight hours: 2.2 per 10,000 hours.\nThree were \"high risk\" involving engine malfunction and unplanned landing in single\u2011engine Cessna 208 Caravans, four \"medium risk\" and 96% \"low risk\".\nTwo occurrences resulted in minor injuries due to engine malfunction and terrain collision in agricultural aircraft and five accidents involved aerial work: four in agriculture and one in an air ambulance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His output includes operas, concertos, sonatas for one to six instruments, sinfonias, and solo cantatas. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is known today for his instrumental music, especially his concertos. He is best remembered today for a work called \"Adagio in G minor\", attributed to him but largely written by Remo Giazotto, a 20th-century musicologist and composer, who was a cataloguer of the works of Albinoni.\nBiography.\nAlbinoni was born in Venice, at the time part of the Republic of Venice, but now in Italy. His father was Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant. Tomaso studied violin and singing; in 1694, he dedicated his Opus 1 to the fellow-Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII). His first opera, \"Zenobia, regina de Palmireni\", was produced in Venice in 1694. Albinoni was possibly employed in 1700 as a violinist to Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, to whom he dedicated his Opus 2 collection of instrumental pieces. In 1701 he wrote his hugely popular suites Opus 3, and dedicated that collection to Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany.\nIn 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi. At the ceremony, Antonino Biffi, the \"maestro di cappella\" of San Marco was a witness, and evidently was a friend of Albinoni. The Albinonis had six children but their names are not recorded.\nAlbinoni achieved his early fame as an opera composer in many cities in Italy, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. During this time, he was also composing instrumental music in abundance: prior to 1705, he mostly wrote trio sonatas and violin concertos, but between then and 1719 he wrote solo sonatas and concertos for oboe.\nUnlike most contemporary composers, he appears never to have sought a post at either a church or noble court, but rather had independent means through which he could afford to compose music without a salaried position. In 1722, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, to whom Albinoni had dedicated a set of twelve concertos, invited him to direct two of his operas in Munich.\nPart of Albinoni's work was lost in World War II with the destruction of the Dresden State Library. As a result, little is known of his life and music after the mid-1720s.\nAround 1740, a collection of Albinoni's violin sonatas was published in France as a posthumous work, and scholars long presumed that meant that Albinoni had died by that time. However, it appears he lived on in Venice in obscurity; a record from the parish of San Barnaba indicates Tomaso Albinoni died in Venice in 1751, of diabetes mellitus. He was 79 years old.\nMusic and influence.\nMost of his operatic works have been lost - either because they were never published or because they were destroyed. However, nine collections of instrumental works were published. These met with considerable success and consequent reprints. He is therefore today better known as a composer of instrumental music (99 sonatas, 59 concerti and 9 sinfonie). In his lifetime these works were compared favourably with those of Arcangelo Corelli and Antonio Vivaldi. His nine collections published in Italy, Amsterdam, and London were either dedicated to or sponsored by an impressive list of southern European nobility. Albinoni wrote at least fifty operas, of which twenty-eight were produced in Venice between 1723 and 1740. Albinoni himself claimed 81 operas (naming his second-to-last opera, in the libretto, as his 80th). In spite of his enormous operatic output, today he is most noted for his instrumental music, especially his oboe concerti (from \"12 Concerti a cinque\" op. 7 and, most famously, \"12 Concerti a cinque\" op. 9). He is the first Italian known to employ the oboe as a solo instrument in concerti (c. 1715, in his op. 7) and publish such works, although earlier concerti featuring solo oboe were probably written by German composers such as Telemann or H\u00e4ndel. In Italy, Alessandro Marcello published his well-known oboe concerto in D minor a little later, in 1717. Albinoni also employed the instrument often in his chamber works and operas.\nHis instrumental music attracted great attention from Johann Sebastian Bach, who never visited Italy but had access to Italian music, particularly when working in Weimar for the ducal court. Bach wrote at least two fugues on Albinoni's themes (\"Fugue in A major on a theme by Tomaso Albinoni,\" BWV 950, and \"Fugue in B minor on a theme by Tomaso Albinoni\", BWV 951) and frequently used his basses for harmonic exercises for his pupils. \nThe famous \"Adagio in G minor\", the subject of many modern recordings, is thought by some to be a musical hoax composed by Remo Giazotto. However, a discovery by musicologist Muska Mangano, Giazotto's last assistant before his death, has cast some doubt on that belief. Among Giazotto's papers, Mangano discovered a modern but independent manuscript transcription of the figured bass portion, and six fragmentary bars of the first violin, \"bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken\". This provides support for Giazotto's account that he did base his composition on an earlier source.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the English common law, the party who entrusts the property is known as the \"settlor,\" the party to whom it is entrusted is known as the \"trustee,\" the party for whose benefit the property is entrusted is known as the \"beneficiary,\" and the entrusted property is known as the \"corpus\" or \"trust property.\" A \"testamentary trust\" is an irrevocable trust established and funded pursuant to the terms of a deceased person's will. An inter vivos trust is a trust created during the settlor's life.\nThe trustee is the legal owner of the assets held in trust on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are equitable owners of the trust property. Trustees have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust for the benefit of the equitable owners. Trustees must provide regular accountings of trust income and expenditures. A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches their duty. Some breaches can be charged and tried as criminal offenses. A trustee can be a natural person, business entity or public body. A trust in the US may be subject to federal and state taxation. The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role. For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.\nHow trust works.\nTrusts have existed since Roman times and become one of the most important innovations in property law. Specific aspects of trust law vary in different jurisdictions. Some U.S. states are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain.\nAn owner placing property into trust turns over part of their bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or deceased. Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries. While the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. The primary duties owed are those of loyalty, prudence and impartiality. Trustees may be held to a high standard of care in their dealings to enforce their behavior. To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including openness, transparency, recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure. A trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise turn over all profits from the trust and neither endebt nor riskily speculate on the assets without the written, clear permission of all adult beneficiaries.\nThere are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with a conflict of interest. Courts can reverse a trustee's actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they find a trustee has failed in their duties. Such a failure is a civil breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities. It is advisable for settlors and trustees to seek legal advice before entering into, or creating, a trust agreement and trustees must take care in acting or omitting to act to avoid unlawful mistakes.\nHistory.\nEnglish common law.\nRoman law had a well-developed concept of the trust (\"fideicommissum\") in terms of \"testamentary trusts\" created by wills but never developed the concept of the \"inter vivos\" (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives. This was created by later common law jurisdictions. Personal trust law developed in England during the 12th and 13th centuries. In medieval English trust law, the settlor was known as the \"feoffor\" to uses, while the trustee was known as the \"feoffee\" to uses, and the beneficiary was known as the \"cestui que\" use, or \"cestui que\" trust.\nLegal historians believe that \"inter vivos\" trusts were first developed for the benefit of Franciscan friars, who were forbidden to own any sort of property. Benefactors would convey land for the use of the friars to a suitable local person (the feoffee) to hold legal fee simple title, while promising to allow the friars to live on and receive the profits of the land. However the feoffee had no legal obligations to the beneficiary in English common law, so after the death of the feoffor, there was no one to enforce the promises made by the feoffee or his ancestor. However, disgruntled beneficiaries could petition the King's Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case as \"keeper of the king's conscience\" (also known as the principle of equity in English law). After the chancellor began to consistently enforce the promises of feoffees, uses developed into a popular means for circumventing primogeniture and feudal death taxes.\nAs the proliferation of uses impacted tax revenue and complicated land sales, King Henry VIII pressured parliament to pass the Statute of Uses in 1535, which purported to abolish uses by \"executing\" them. This transferred title from the feoffee to the beneficiary. However, lawyers and judges soon found holes in the statute and courts held that the statute did not apply if the feoffee had active duties to perform. The courts began to refer to these title holders with active duties to manage the property as \"trustees\" of a \"trust\" in place of the medieval terminology.\nSignificance.\nThe trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the English legal system. Today, trusts play a significant role in most common law systems, and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes. In Cura\u00e7ao, for example, the trust was enacted into law on 1 January 2012; however, the Cura\u00e7ao Civil Code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument. France has recently added a similar, Roman-law-based device to its own law with the \"fiducie\", amended in 2009; the \"fiducie\", unlike a trust, is a contractual relationship. Trusts are widely used internationally, especially in countries within the English law sphere of influence, and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems, they do recognise the concept under the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition (partly only the extent that they are parties thereto). The Hague Convention also regulates conflict of trusts.\nAlthough trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers, they have become very important in American capital markets, particularly through pension funds (in certain countries essentially always trusts) and mutual funds (often trusts).\nBasic principles.\nProperty of any sort may be held in a trust. The uses of trusts are many and varied, for both personal and commercial reasons, and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning, asset protection, and taxes. Living trusts may be created during a person's life (through the drafting of a trust instrument) or after death in a will.\nIn a relevant sense, a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors (investors) are also the beneficiaries. This is particularly evident in the Delaware business trust, which could theoretically, with the language in the \"governing instrument\", be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation, although traditionally the Massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the US. One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee, multiple beneficiaries, and their respective creditors (particularly the trustee's creditors), making it \"bankruptcy remote\", and leading to its use in pensions, mutual funds, and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust.\nThe trustee's right to do this, where it exists, is called a power of appointment. Sometimes, a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee, such as the settlor, the protector, or a beneficiary.\nCreation.\nTrusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor also known as the founder (express trusts) or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.\nCommon ways in which a trust is created include:\nIn some jurisdictions, certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document.\nFormalities.\nThe formalities required of a trust depend on the type of trust in question.\nGenerally, a private express trust requires three elements to be certain, which together are known as the \"three certainties\". These elements were determined in \"Knight v Knight\" to be intention, subject matter and objects. The certainty of intention allows the court to ascertain a settlor's true reason for creating the trust. The certainties of subject matter and objects allow the court to administer trust when the trustees fail to do so. The court determines whether there is sufficient certainty by construing the words used in the trust instrument. These words are construed objectively in their \"reasonable meaning\", within the context of the entire instrument. Despite intention being integral to express trusts, the court will try not to let trusts fail for the lack of certainty.\nTrustees.\nA trust may have multiple trustees, and these trustees are the legal owners of the trust's property, but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties, such as a duty of care and a duty to inform. If trustees do not adhere to these duties, they may be removed through a legal action. The trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company, but typically the trust itself is not a legal entity and any litigation involving the trust must include the trustee as a party. A trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument. If a trust lacks a trustee, a court may appoint one.\nThe trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust. The trust's affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust, accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries, filing required tax returns and other duties. In some cases dependent upon the trust instrument, the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit. A trustee may be held personally liable for problems, although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased. For example, a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested. In addition, a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given. However, in the United States, similar to directors and officers, an exculpatory clause may minimize liability; although this was previously held to be against public policy, this position has changed.\nIn the United States, the Uniform Trust Code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts, although trustees may be unpaid. Commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about 1% of assets under management.\nBeneficiaries.\nThe beneficiaries are beneficial (or 'equitable') owners of the trust property. Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property, or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary's interest depends on the wording of the trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when they attain a specified age. The settlor has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.\nThe use of trusts as a means to inherit substantial wealth may be associated with some negative connotations; some beneficiaries who are able to live comfortably from trust proceeds without having to work a job may be jokingly referred to as \"trust fund babies\" (regardless of age) or \"trustafarians\".\nPurposes.\nCommon purposes for trusts include:\nTypes.\nTrusts go by many different names, depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, a single trust might accurately be described in several ways. For example, a living trust is often an express trust, which is also a revocable trust, and might include an incentive trust, and so forth.\nCountry specific variations.\nWhile trusts originated in England, and therefore English trusts law has had a significant influence, particularly among common law legal systems such as those of the Commonwealth or the United States, the impact of trust law has been wide and varied. Even under common law systems, the basic notion of a trust has been implemented in strikingly different ways.\nTrust law in civil law jurisdictions, generally including Continental Europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Cura\u00e7ao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases, for example within the Brussels regime (Europe) and the parties to the Hague Trust Convention. Tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that European countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts.\nCyprus.\nCyprus legislators enacted the Cyprus International Trusts Law of 2012 with an aim to facilitate the establishment of trusts by non-Cypriot residents. The Cyprus International Trust is based on common law principles however the law introduces certain conditions and requirements to for the trust to qualify under the same law.\nEngland and Wales.\nHistory.\nAs noted above, the English trust arose from the court of the Lord Chancellor, known as the Court of Chancery.\nThere are several features which distinguish the modern English trust both from other common law trusts and from civil law approaches.\nPurpose trusts and the requirement for a beneficiary.\nIn some ways, the modern English trust is, when compared to other jurisdictions, more conservative in its requirements. For example, it retains the requirement that there be a beneficiary. There are two main exceptions to this rule: charitable purpose trusts and \"Re Denley\" trusts. This contrasts with other jurisdictions like Cyprus, the BVI, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Gibraltar which allow for non-charitable purpose trusts to be valid. This will normally be done by appointing a somebody to act as the trust's Protector. These purpose trusts allow for a trust to be created with a purpose (e.g. 'to provide for \"N\"'s education', where \"N\" is a family member) instead of a named beneficiary. The role of the Protector (also sometimes called an enforcer) is to hold the trustees to account, which the beneficiaries would usually have the right to do.\nUnincorporated Associations.\nA major use of trusts is to allow for the existence of unincorporated associations. These often are associations or groups of people that come together for a particular (usually non-commercial purpose). Common examples might be local social and sports clubs, some gentlemen's clubs, and some professional associations.\nThe main way that English law supports the existence of these is by understanding them as a form of trust. The association has no legal personality (i.e. the capacity to enter into legal relations in their own name). This contrasts with the approach taken in many civil law jurisdictions, like Spain or France, where civil or social associations are often accorded legal personhood. Thus, in England, the officers of an association (e.g. its chairman, secretary and treasurer) will be recognised as trustees and will hold the assets of the association on trust for the members of the association with the constitution of the association forming the basis of the rules governing the trust.\nSouth Africa.\nIn many ways trusts in South Africa operate similarly to other common law countries, although the law of South Africa is actually a hybrid of the British common law system and Roman-Dutch law.\nIn South Africa, in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a \"bewind trust\" (inherited from the Roman-Dutch \"bewind\" administered by a \"bewindhebber\") in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust, although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust. \"Bewind\" trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages.\nIn South Africa, minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution, the Guardian's Fund, and released to the children in adulthood. Therefore, testamentary (will) trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children.\nThere are two types of living trusts in South Africa, namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts. In vested trusts, the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed, whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit.\nAsset protection.\nUntil recently, there were tax advantages to living trusts in South Africa, although most of these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).\nTax considerations.\nUnder South African law living trusts are considered tax payers. Two types of tax apply to living trusts, namely income tax and capital gains tax (CGT). A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40% (individuals pay according to income scales, usually less than 20%). The trust's income can, however, be taxed in the hands of either the trust or the beneficiary. A trust pays CGT at the rate of 20% (individuals pay 10%). Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax (although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate, in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax).\nThe taxpayer whose residence has been 'locked' into a trust has now been given another opportunity to take advantage of these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that it will ever become available thereafter.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in Pennsylvania, California, Oklahoma and Texas (and any other state that has adopted section 602 of the Uniform Trust Code), in which trusts are presumed to be revocable unless the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable.\nIn the United States, state law, variable from state to state, governs trusts. Many states have adopted the Uniform Trust Code, and there are also broad similarities among states' common law of trust. These similarities are summarized in the Restatements of the Law, such as the Restatement of Trusts, Third (2003\u221208). Additionally, as a practical matter, federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the Internal Revenue Service may affect the structure and creation of trusts.\nIn the United States the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations, partnerships, or not at all depending on the circumstances, although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations. For example, the trust-preferred security is a hybrid (debt and equity) security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks' balance sheets. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of (large) banks' regulatory capital.\nEstate planning.\nLiving trusts, as opposed to testamentary (will) trusts, may help a trustor avoid probate. Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular. Probate is potentially costly, and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private. Both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability, by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will.\nNegative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the one-time probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies whether or not there is a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.\nEstate tax effect.\nLiving trusts generally do not shelter assets from the U.S. federal estate tax. Married couples may, however, effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause.\nFor a living trust, the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust, such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had high tax consequences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tone rows were widely used in 20th-century contemporary music, like Dmitri Shostakovich's use of twelve-tone rows, \"without dodecaphonic transformations.\"\nA tone row has been identified in the A-minor prelude, BWV 889, from Book II of J.S. Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" (1742). It is also found in works such as Mozart's String Quartet in C, K. 157 (1772), String Quartet in E\u266d, K. 428, String Quintet in G minor, K. 516 (1790), and the Symphony No. 40, K. 550 (1788). A passage from Symphony No. 40 is shown below in which every tone in the chromatic scale is played except for G (the tonic): &lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;d4) f-. a-. bes-.\nBeethoven also used the technique but, on the whole, \"Mozart seems to have employed serial technique far more often than Beethoven\". Franz Liszt used a twelve-tone row in the opening of his \"Faust Symphony\". Hans Keller claims that Schoenberg was aware of this serial practice in the classical period and that \"Schoenberg repressed his knowledge of classical serialism because it would have injured his narcissism.\"\nTheory and compositional techniques.\nTone rows are designated by letters and subscript numbers (e.g.: RI11, which may also appear as RI11 or RI\u201311). The numbers indicate the initial (P or I) or final (R or RI) pitch-class number of the given row form, most often with \"c\" = 0.\nA twelve-tone composition will take one or more tone rows, called the \"prime form\", as its basis plus their transformations (inversion, retrograde, retrograde inversion, as well as transposition). These forms may be used to construct a melody in a straightforward manner as in the fifth movement from Schoenberg's Piano Suite, Op. 25, where P-0 is used to construct the opening melody and later varied through transposition, as P-6, and also in articulation and dynamics. It is then varied again through inversion, untransposed, taking form I-0. However, rows may be combined to produce melodies or harmonies in more complicated ways, such as taking successive or multiple pitches of a melody from two different row forms.\nInitially, Schoenberg required the avoidance of suggestions of tonality\u2014such as the use of consecutive imperfect consonances (thirds or sixths)\u2014when constructing tone rows, reserving such use for the time when the dissonance is completely emancipated. Alban Berg, however, sometimes incorporated tonal elements into his twelve-tone works. The main tone row of his Violin Concerto hints at this tonality:\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\override Score.TimeSignature\n\\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t\n \\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)\n \\relative c' {\n \\time 12/1\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 1 = 60\n g1 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThis tone row consists of alternating minor and major triads starting on the open strings of the violin, followed by a portion of an ascending whole-tone scale. This whole-tone scale reappears in the second movement when the chorale \"Es ist genug\" (\"It is enough\") from J.S. Bach's cantata \"O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort\", BWV 60 is quoted literally in the woodwinds (mostly clarinet).\nSome tone rows have a high degree of internal organization. An example is the tone row from Anton Webern's Concerto for Nine Instruments Op. 24, shown below.\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\override Score.TimeSignature\n\\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t\n \\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 3/1\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 1 = 60\n b1 bes d\n es, g fis\n aes e f\n c' cis a\n&lt;/score&gt;\nIn this tone row, if the first three notes are regarded as the \"original\" cell, then the next three are its retrograde inversion, the next three are retrograde, and the last three are its inversion. A row created in this manner, through variants of a trichord or tetrachord called the generator, is called a \"derived row\".\nThe tone rows of many of Webern's other late works are similarly intricate. The tone row for Webern's String Quartet, Op. 28 is based on the BACH motif (B\u266d, A, C, B\u266e) and is composed of three tetrachords:\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\override Score.TimeSignature\n\\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t\n \\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 4/1\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 1 = 60\n bes1 a c b!\n dis e cis d\n ges, f aes g\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThe \"set-complex\" is the forty-eight forms of the set generated by stating each \"aspect\" or transformation on each pitch class.\nThe all-interval twelve-tone row is a tone row arranged so that it contains one instance of each interval within the octave, 0 through 11.\nThe \"total chromatic\" (or \"aggregate\") is the set of all twelve pitch classes. An \"array\" is a succession of aggregates. The term is also used to refer to lattices.\nAn aggregate may be achieved through complementation or combinatoriality, such as with hexachords.\nA \"secondary set\" is a tone row which is derived from or, \"results from the reversed coupling of hexachords\", when a given row form is immediately repeated. For example, the row form consisting of two hexachords:\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 / 6 7 8 9 t e\nwhen repeated immediately results in the following succession of two aggregates, in the middle of which is a new and complete aggregate beginning with the second hexachord:\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 / 6 7 8 9 t e / 0 1 2 3 4 5 / 6 7 8 9 t e\n secondary set: [6 7 8 9 t e / 0 1 2 3 4 5]\nA \"weighted aggregate\" is an aggregate in which the twelfth pitch does not appear until at least one pitch has appeared at least twice, supplied by segments of different set forms. It seems to have been first used in Milton Babbitt's String Quartet No. 4. An aggregate may be vertically or horizontally weighted. An \"all-partition array\" is created by combining a collection of hexachordally combinatorial arrays.\nExamples.\nThe principal forms of the tone row of Anton Webern's Variations for piano, Op. 27 are shown below. In this tone row, each hexachord fills in a chromatic fourth, with B as the pivot (end of P1 and beginning of IR8), and thus linked by the prominent tritone in the center of the row.The first array of four aggregates (numbered 1\u20134 at bottom) from Milton Babbitt's \"Composition for Four Instruments\" are shown. In this row, each vertical line (four trichords labeled a\u2013d) is an aggregate while each horizontal line (four trichords labeled a\u2013d) is also an aggregateShown below is the tone row for Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Gruppen f\u00fcr drei Orchester\". Here, the registrally-fixed pitches correspond to duration units and metronome marks.\nNonstandard tone rows.\nSchoenberg specified many strict rules and desirable guidelines for the construction of tone rows such as number of notes and intervals to avoid. Tone rows that depart from these guidelines include the above tone row from Berg's Violin Concerto which contains triads and tonal emphasis, and the tone row below from Luciano Berio's \"Nones\" which contains a repeated note making it a 'thirteen-tone row':\nIgor Stravinsky used a five-tone row, chromatically filling out the space of a major third centered tonally on C (C\u2013E), in one of his early serial compositions, \"In memoriam Dylan Thomas\".\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\override Score.TimeSignature\n\\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t\n \\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 5/1\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 1 = 60\n e1 es c cis d\n&lt;/score&gt;\nIn his twelve-tone practice, Stravinsky preferred the inverse-retrograde (IR) to the retrograde-inverse (RI), as for example in his \"Requiem Canticles\":\nBen Johnston uses a \"just tone row\" (see just intonation) in works including String Quartets Nos. 6 and 7. Each permutation contains a just chromatic scale, however, transformations (transposition and inversion) produce pitches outside of the primary row form, as already occurs in the inversion of P0. The pitches of each hexachord are drawn from different otonality or utonality on A+ utonality, C otonality and utonality, and E\u266d- otonality, outlining a diminished triad.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

The state stud was established in 1731 and operated until 1944, when the fighting of World War II led to the annexing of East Prussia by Russia, and the town containing the stud renamed as Yasnaya Polyana.\nThe Trakehner typically stands between 15.2 and 17\u00a0hands ( and \u00a0inches, and \u00a0cm). They can be any color, with bay, gray, chestnut and black being the most common, though the breed also includes few roan and tobiano pinto horses. It is considered to be the lightest and most refined of the warmbloods, due to its closed stud book which allows entry of only Trakehner, as well as few selected Thoroughbred, Anglo-Arabian, Shagya and Arabian bloodlines.\nCharacteristics.\nOwing to its Thoroughbred ancestry, the Trakehner is of rectangular build, with a long sloping shoulder, good hindquarters, short cannons, and a medium-long, crested and well-set neck. The head is often finely chiseled, narrow at the muzzle, with a broad forehead. It is known for its \"floating trot\" \u2013 full of impulsion and suspension. The Trakehner possesses a strong, medium-length back and powerful hindquarters.\nTrakehners are athletic and trainable, with good endurance, while some are more spirited than horses of other warmblood breeds. Trakehners breed true to type, due to the purity of the bloodlines, making it valuable for upgrading other warmbloods.\nBreed history.\nOld Prussians and other Baltic people such as the Lithuanians were noted for their hardy horses and cavalry during the early Middle Ages. During their conquest of Old Prussians in the 13th century Prussian crusade, the conquering Teutonic Knights named the Old Prussian horse a \"Schwaikenpferd\", a small primitive horse. Beginning in the 14th century, knights used it to breed their military horses, and descendants of the Schwaikenpferd were later used by Masovian and Ostsiedlung farmers for light utility work. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the people of Ducal Prussia, Brandenburg, and Royal Prussia used a wide variety of horses from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Crimean Tatars, Ottoman Turkey, Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, Holy Roman Empire for their cavalry and stud horses, crossed on local animals.\nIn 1732 King Frederick William I of Prussia used these horses and other imports to establish the Trakehnen Stud at the East Prussian town Trakehnen (now Yasnaya Polyana, Russia). Soldiers cleared the forest at the River Pissa between Stallup\u00f6nen and Gumbinnen. In 1739 the king gave it to crown prince Frederick II of Prussia, who often sold stallions to make money. After his death in 1786 it became state property, named \"K\u00f6niglich Preu\u00dfisches Hauptgest\u00fct Trakehnen\".\nBetween 1817 and 1837 the stud added Arabian, Thoroughbred, and Hanoverian horse blood to their stock. One especially influential Thoroughbred was Perfectionist, by Persimmon, who won The Derby and the St Leger in 1896. He was to be the sire of the great Trakehner stallion Tempelh\u00fcter, and most modern Trakehners can be traced to these two stallions. The Arabian blood was added to offset possible flaws of the Thoroughbred.\nEast Prussian farmers were encouraged to bring their mares, by then known for their hardiness and quality, to Trakehnen's stallions. This enabled the rapid transformation of the breed into much sought-after army remounts: sure-footed, intelligent and athletic. By 1918 60,000 mares per year were bred to East Prussian stallions.\nIn 1919 the Treaty of Versailles limited Germany's army to 100,000 troops and so the breed's focus was again turned to producing horses suitable to farm duties. For this purpose, sires of heavier conformation (build) were used, the most successful being Ararad, Dampfross, Hyperion, Pythagoras and Tempelh\u00fcter. These stallions, while refined, possessed much substance and bone. Their influence is still seen on the modern Trakehner.\nIt was during the 1920s and 1930s that the breed was recognized for its performance abilities in competitive disciplines. Trakehners won gold and silver medals in two Olympics, including six gold medals in Berlin in 1936, and won Czechoslovakia's notoriously challenging Velk\u00e1 pardubick\u00e1 steeplechase nine times. In the 1930s there were more than 10,000 breeders and 18,000 registered mares.\nIn the 1930s and early 1940s Hauptvorwerk Trakehnen and its 15 Vorwerke covered , of which were fields, meadows, forest, garden and other. Horses such as the Trakehner were used in World War II which, at the end, nearly destroyed the breed as Soviet troops advanced from the East, causing flight and expulsion of Germans during and after WWII. The main Stud and local residents were forced to evacuate between 20 January 1945 and March 1945. Their journey West, known as \"Der Treck\" (\"The Flight\"), sent the horses on a dangerous journey in frigid conditions across the frozen Vistula lagoon without proper rations or shelter. It is considered one of the toughest tests to which an entire breed of horses has been submitted.\nRefugee convoys were bombed while on the ice by the Soviet airforce, so only a small number of horses made it to safety. 700 surviving horses were accounted for. The horses left behind in East Prussia became important in the breeding of Russian breeds such as the Kirov as well as the Polish Mazury (also known as the Masuren) and Pozan (or Poznan), which developed into the Wielkopolski. After the war, the breed, which once numbered tens of thousands was reduced to approximately 600 broodmares and 50 stallions in West Germany. The last original Trakehner was Keith, born there in 1941, who died in November 1976 in Gilten shortly before his 35th birthday. On 23 October 1947 the East Prussian Studbook Society was dissolved and the Association of Breeders and Friends of the Warmblood Horse of Trakehner Origin, known today as the \"Trakehner Verband\", was created. Among the greatest obstacles the organization faced was that unlike other German breeds, the Trakehner had no mother state and could not depend on government funding. The re-establishment of the breed originally depended on the determination of its members and the largesse of others.\nTrue pure-bred Trakehner show the \"Ostpreu\u00dfische Elchschaufel\" (East Prussian moose horn) branding.\nThe modern Trakehner.\nToday in Germany the breed is considered a federal responsibility, with its governance falling under both the Trakehner Verband and the Trakehner Gesellschaft mbH; the latter handling all business operations.\nStallion inspections are held in Neum\u00fcnster, Germany, each October and approved stallions are required to complete extended performance tests, which rate the horses' gaits, temperament, jumping ability, and suitability over a cross country course, before being given full breeding licenses.\nThe Trakehner is used as a \"refiner\" of other breeds, allowing an infusion of Thoroughbred and Arabian blood without the risks often involved in first generation outcrosses. Influential stallions include Abglanz for the Hanoverian, Herbststurm who influenced the Oldenburg, Marco Polo for the Dutch Warmblood, the stallions Ibikus and Donauwind for the Danish Warmblood, and Polarstern for the Swedish Warmblood.\nWhile Trakehners compete in nearly all equestrian disciplines, they are particularly prized as dressage mounts, due to their sensitivity, intelligence and way of going. Peron anchored the United States team to an Olympic Bronze in 1996 at Atlanta. Abdullah, by Donauwind, is particularly famous for his show jumping team gold and individual silver medals at the 1984 Olympics and 1985 World Cup win. Heuriger was the 1994 show jumping team silver medalist at the 1994 World Equestrian Games. Trakehner mare TSF Dalera BB, ridden by Jessica von Bredow Werndl, is the no.1 ranked dressage horse in the world as of September 2023, and has won gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics for both team and individual. Dalera has also won individual gold medals at the 2022 and 2023 Dressage World Cup.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are several types of tempera paint, but the one containing egg yolk is called egg tempera. Tempera paint made from the milk protein is Casein paint. If the binder is synthetic PVA, the result is polyvinyl acetate tempera. A distemper paint consisting of pigment and binders such as cornstarch, gum arabic and other gums is called poster paint in certain parts of the world, and it is also often confusingly referred to as \"tempera paint\", although the binders in this paint are different from traditional egg tempera paints and the visual effect is more like gouache.\nThe term \"Tempera\" also refers to the paintings done in any kind of these tempera mediums.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"tempera\" is derived from the Italian \"dipingere a tempera\" (\"paint in distemper\"), from the Late Latin \"distemperare\" (\"mix thoroughly\").\nHistory.\nThe earliest known examples of egg tempera are the prehistoric murals on the Domus de Janas chamber tombs in Sardinia, dating back to 3400-2700 BCE. Analysed samples of 1200 BCE also detected egg tempera in the murals of the Palace of Nestor in Pylos.\nIt is frequently claimed that egg tempera painting has been found on early Egyptian sarcophagus decorations. Some Fayum mummy portraits also seem to have been done in tempera, sometimes in combination with encaustic painting made with melted wax, the alternative painting technique in the ancient world. But recent scientific analysis cast some doubts in those affirmations. It was probably also used for the murals of the 3rd century Dura-Europos synagogue.\nA related technique has been used also in ancient and early medieval paintings found in several caves and rock-cut temples of India. High-quality art with the help of tempera was created in Bagh Caves between the late 4th and 10th centuries and in the 7th century in Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Odisha.\nThis art technique was known from the classical world, where it appears to have taken over from encaustic painting and was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the Byzantine world and Medieval and Early Renaissance Europe. Tempera painting was the primary panel painting medium for nearly every painter in the European Medieval and Early renaissance period up to 1500. For example, most surviving panel paintings attributed to Michelangelo are executed in egg tempera, an exception being his \"Doni Tondo\" which uses both tempera and oil paint.\nOil paint, which may have originated in Afghanistan between the 5th and 9th centuries and migrated westward in the Middle Ages eventually superseded tempera in popularity. Oil replaced tempera as the principal medium used for creating artwork during the 15th century in Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe. Around 1500, oil paint replaced tempera in Italy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were intermittent revivals of tempera technique in Western art, among the Pre-Raphaelites, Social Realists, and others. Tempera painting continues to be used in Greece and Russia where it is the traditional medium for Orthodox icons.\nTechnique.\nTempera is broad term describing many types of paint, traditionally created by hand-grinding dry powdered pigments into a binding agent or \"medium\", such as egg yolk, milk (in the form of casein) or a variety of plant gums.\nEgg tempera.\nThe most common form of classical tempera painting is \"egg tempera\". For this form most often only the contents of the egg yolk is used. The white of the egg and the membrane of the yolk are discarded (the membrane of the yolk is dangled over a receptacle and punctured to drain off the liquid inside). The egg yolk is diluted with water and used with pigment. Some kind of remedy is always added in different proportions. One recipe uses vinegar as a preservative, but only in small quantities, as vinegar will discolour pigments such as ultramarine. A few drops of vinegar will keep the solution for a week, but it is better to prepare fresh paint on a daily basis. Some egg tempera schools use different mixtures of egg yolk and water, usually the ratio of yolk to water is 1:3; other recipes offer white wine (1 part yolk, 2 parts wine).\nPowdered pigment, or pigment that has been ground in distilled water, is placed onto a palette or bowl and mixed with a roughly equal volume of the binder. Some pigments require slightly more binder, some require less.\nWhen used to paint icons on church walls, liquid myrrh is sometimes added to the mixture to give the paint a pleasing odor, particularly as worshippers may find the egg tempera somewhat pungent for quite some time after completion. The paint mixture has to be constantly adjusted to maintain a balance between a \"greasy\" and \"watery\" consistency by adjusting the amount of water and yolk. As tempera gradually dries on the palette, the artist will add some water to preserve the consistency and to balance the thickening of the yolk on contact with air. Once prepared, the paint cannot be stored. As such, tubed egg tempera tends to be Tempera Grassa, as it must contain several preservatives such as oil. Egg tempera is water-resistant, but not waterproof. Different preparations use the egg white instead of the yolk or even the whole egg for a different effect. Other additives such as oil and wax emulsions can modify the medium. Egg tempera is not a flexible paint and requires stiff boards; painting on canvas will cause cracks to form and chips of paint to fall off.\nEgg tempera paint should be cured for at least 3 months, up to 6 months. The surface is susceptible to scratches during the curing process, but will become much more durable after curing. Egg tempera paintings are not normally framed behind glass, as the glass can trap moisture and lead to the growth of mold.\nTempera grassa.\nAdding oil in no more than a 1:1 ratio with the egg yolk by volume produces a water-soluble medium with many of the color effects of oil paint, although it cannot be painted thickly as it would crack. \"Tempera grassa\" was detected in several Renaissance paintings by artists such as Botticelli.\nPigments.\nSome of the pigments used by medieval painters, such as cinnabar (contains mercury), orpiment (contains arsenic), or lead white (contains lead) are highly toxic if accidentally ingested or inhaled. Most artists today use modern synthetic pigments, which are less toxic but have similar color properties to the older pigments. Even so, many (if not most) modern pigments are still dangerous unless certain precautions are taken; these include keeping pigments wet in storage to avoid breathing their dust.\nApplication.\nTempera paint dries rapidly. It is normally applied in thin, semi-opaque or transparent layers. Tempera painting allows for great precision when used with traditional techniques that often require the application of numerous small brush strokes applied in a cross-hatching technique. When dry, it produces a smooth satin or slightly matte finish. Because it cannot be applied in thick layers as oil paints can, tempera paintings rarely have the deep color saturation that oil paintings can achieve because it can hold less pigment (lower pigment load). In this respect, the colors of an unvarnished tempera painting resemble a fresco, although the color deepens if a varnish is applied. On the other hand, tempera colors do not change over time, whereas oil paints darken, yellow, and become transparent with age.\nGround.\nTempera adheres best to an absorbent ground. The ground traditionally used is inflexible Italian gesso, and the substrate is usually rigid as well. Historically wood panels were used as the substrate, and more recently un-tempered masonite or medium density fiberboard (MDF) have been employed; heavy paper is also used.\nPre-made paints.\nApart from the traditional process of mixing pigment with egg yolk, new methods include egg tempera sold in tubes by manufacturers such as Sennelier and Daler-Rowney. These paints do contain a slight amount of oil in order to extend longevity within the container. Notable egg tempera artist and author Koo Schadler points out that because of this addition of oil \"tubed 'egg tempera' paints are actually 'tempera grassa', an emulsion of egg yolk and a drying oil (generally with other additives, such as preservatives and stabilizers). Tempera grassa has some of the working properties of both egg tempera and oil painting and is a perfectly viable medium \u2013 however it is not the same as pure, homemade egg tempera and behaves differently.\"Marc Chagall used Sennelier egg tempera tube paints extensively.\nArtists.\nAlthough tempera has been out of favor since the Late Renaissance and Baroque eras, it has been periodically rediscovered by later artists such as William Blake, the Nazarenes, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Joseph Southall. The 19th and 20th century saw a significant revival of tempera, partially due to the publication of Cennino Cennini's \"https://\" in 1821, and the Society of Painters in Tempera being created in 1901. European painters who worked with tempera include Giorgio de Chirico, Otto Dix, Eliot Hodgkin, Pyke Koch, and Pietro Annigoni, who used an emulsion of egg yolks, stand oil and varnish.\nSpanish surrealist painter Remedios Varo worked extensively in egg tempera.\nRevival in 20th-century American art.\nThe tempera medium was used by American artists such as the Regionalists Andrew Wyeth, Thomas Hart Benton and his students James Duard Marshall and Roger Medearis; expressionists Ben Shahn, Mitchell Siporin and John Langley Howard, magic realists George Tooker, Paul Cadmus, Jared French, Julia Thecla and Louise E. Marianetti, realist painter David Hanna; Art Students League of New York instructors Kenneth Hayes Miller and William C. Palmer, Social Realists Kyra Markham, Isabel Bishop, Reginald Marsh, and Noel Rockmore, Edward Laning, Anton Refregier, Jacob Lawrence, Rudolph F. Zallinger, Robert Vickrey, Peter Hurd, and science fiction artist John Schoenherr, notable as the cover artist of \"Dune\".\n20th-century Indian art.\nIn the early part of the 20th century, a large number of Indian artists, notably of the Bengal school took up tempera as one of their primary media of expression. Artists such as Gaganendranath Tagore, Asit Kumar Haldar, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Kalipada Ghoshal and Sughra Rababi were foremost. After the 1950s, artists such as Jamini Roy and Ganesh Pyne established tempera as a medium for the new age artists of India.\nIn contemporary art.\nOther practicing tempera artists include Philip Aziz, Ernst Fuchs, Antonio Roybal, George Huszar, Donald Jackson, Tim Lowly, Altoon Sultan, Shaul Shats, Sandro Chia, Alex Colville, Robert Vickrey, Andrew Wyeth, Andrew Grassie, Soheila Sokhanvari, and Ganesh Pyne.\nKen Danby (1940\u20132007) a Canadian realist artist, whose most well known works (such as: At the Crease, Lacing up, and Pancho) were completed using egg tempera.\nRobert Clinch (b. 1957) is an Australian realist painter who, thanks to the 1993 Marten Bequest Travelling Scholarship, was able to conduct extensive research into egg tempera and has since completed multiple works in the medium.\nIn 2013, American fine artists Elena Vladimir Baranoff and Anastasia Elena Baranoff founded Egg Tempera Movement in London, United Kingdom. Elena Vladimir Baranoff and Anastasia Elena Baranoff established Egg Tempera Movement to promote and preserve the egg tempera painting technique.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31054", "revid": "29738728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31054", "title": "Theological virtues", "text": "Christian ethics\nTheological virtues are virtues associated in Christian theology and philosophy with salvation resulting from the grace of God. Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally the theological virtues have been named faith, hope, and charity (love). They are coupled with the four natural or cardinal virtues, and opposed to the seven deadly sins.\nThe medieval Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas explained that these virtues are called theological virtues \"first, because their object is God, inasmuch as they direct us aright to God: secondly, because they are infused in us by God alone: thirdly, because these virtues are not made known to us, save by Divine revelation, contained in Holy Writ\".\nBackground.\n1 Corinthians 13.\nThe first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in St. Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, \"...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope...\" In 1 Thessalonians 5:8, he refers to this triad of virtues again, \"But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation.\"\nIn 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). \"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\" First, because it informs the other two: \"It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\" According to Augustine of Hippo, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while \"Hope isn't hope if its object is seen,\" and faith gives way to possession. This view is shared by Gregory of Nyssa.\nAquinas.\nAquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom () and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed \"the Unity of the Virtues.\"\nAquinas stated that theological virtues are so called \"because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures\".\nIn his treatment of the virtues, Aquinas viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.\nAquinas says \"Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found\".\nAquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.\nTeaching by denomination.\nCatholic Church.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that faith, hope, and love (charity) \"dispose Christians to live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity. They have God for their origin, their motive, and their object \u2013 God known by faith, hoped in, and loved for His own sake.\"\nMoravian Church.\nAmong essential beliefs, the Moravian Church teaches that \"God creates; God redeems; God blesses. And we respond in faith, in love, and in hope.\" As such, Moravian Christians teach to judge themselves \"by how deep our faith is, how expansive our love is, and how life affirming our hope is.\"\nAnglican Communion.\nChurches of the Anglican Communion also follow Augustine and Aquinas. \"Faith is a matter of knowledge of God which perfects the intellect... Hope is a matter of the perfection of the will... Love is a matter of perfection itself as love is the perfection of all powers.\" Richard Hooker said regarding faith, that its \"principal object is that eternal verity which hath discovered the treasures of hidden wisdom in Christ\"; of hope that its \"highest object is that everlasting goodness which in Christ doth quicken the dead\"; of charity, that its \"final object is that incomprehensible beauty which shineth in the countenance of Christ the Son of the Living God\".\nMoral theology.\nA person receives the theological virtues by their being \"infused\"\u2014through Divine grace\u2014into the person. The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being ().\nComparison of cardinal and theological virtues.\nThe moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the cardinal virtues in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. The Episcopal Church shares this view. \"As distinct from the cardinal virtues which we can develop, the theological virtues are the perfection of human powers given by the grace of God.\" Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.\nFollowing Augustine, Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of gluttony. The \"infused\" virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.\nPope Benedict XVI wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: \"Deus caritas est\" (about love), \"Spe salvi\" (about hope), and \"Lumen fidei\" (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by Pope Francis).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31056", "revid": "5718152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31056", "title": "The Rolling Stones", "text": "English rock band\nThe Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for over six decades, they are one of the most popular, influential, and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the band pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, guitarist Keith Richards, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts, after pianist Ian Stewart was side-lined by their manager Andrew Loog Oldham. During their early years, Jones was the primary leader. Oldham encouraged them to write their own songs. The Jagger\u2013Richards partnership soon became the band's primary songwriting and creative force.\nRooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing cover versions and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own compositions: \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", \"Get Off of My Cloud\" (both 1965) and \"Paint It Black\" (1966) became international number-one hits. \"Aftermath\" (1966), their first album to be entirely of original material, is often considered to be the most important of their early albums. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit \"Ruby Tuesday\"/\"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and experimented with psychedelic rock on \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\". By the end of the 1960s, they had returned to their rhythm and blues-based rock sound, with hit singles \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1968) and \"Honky Tonk Women\" (1969), and albums \"Beggars Banquet\" (1968), featuring \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and \"Street Fighting Man\", and \"Let It Bleed\" (1969), featuring \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and \"Gimme Shelter\".\nJones left the band a few weeks before his death in 1969, and was replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year saw the first time they were introduced on stage as \"the greatest rock and roll band in the world\". \"Sticky Fingers\" (1971), which yielded \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. It was followed by \"Exile on Main St.\" (1972), featuring \"Tumbling Dice\" and \"Happy\", and \"Goats Head Soup\" (1973), featuring \"Angie\". Taylor left the band at the end of 1974 and was replaced by Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood. The band released \"Some Girls\" in 1978, featuring \"Miss You\" and \"Beast of Burden\", and \"Tattoo You\" in 1981, featuring \"Start Me Up\". \"Steel Wheels\" (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by \"Voodoo Lounge\" (1994). Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction. By 2007, they had broken the record for the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and they were the highest-earning live act of 2021. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones becoming their regular bassist, and then as a three-piece core following Watts' death in 2021, with Steve Jordan becoming their regular drummer. \"Hackney Diamonds\", the band's first new album of original material in 18 years, was released in October 2023, becoming their fourteenth UK number-one album.\nThe Rolling Stones have estimated album sales of more than 250\u00a0million. They have won four Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. \"Billboard\" and \"Rolling Stone\" have ranked them as one of the greatest artists of all time.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nKeith Richards and Mick Jagger became classmates and childhood friends in 1950 in Dartford, Kent. The Jagger family moved to Wilmington, Kent, away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor. The group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf, and Bo Diddley. Jagger again met Richards on 17 October 1961 on platform two at Dartford railway station. Jagger was carrying records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters; these revealed to Richards a shared interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards and Taylor often met Jagger at his house. The meetings moved to Taylor's house in late 1961, where Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith joined the trio; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.\nIn March 1962, the Blues Boys read about the Ealing Jazz Club in the newspaper \"Jazz News\", which mentioned Alexis Korner's rhythm and blues band, Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated. The Blues Boys sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was impressed. On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club, where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included slide guitarist Brian Jones, keyboardist Ian Stewart, and drummer Charlie Watts. After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.\nHaving left Blues Incorporated, Jones advertised for bandmates in \"Jazz News\" in the week of 2 May 1962. Ian Stewart was among the first to respond to the ad. In June, Jagger, Taylor, and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart. The first rehearsal included guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band. They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards. That same month, the addition of the drummer Tony Chapman completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, and Taylor. According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to \"Jazz News\". When asked by a journalist for the band's name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was \"Rollin' Stone\". Jones was the band's \"uncontested leader\" during its early years and a key to the band's early success.\n1962\u20131964: Building a following.\nThe band played their first show billed as \"the Rollin' Stones\" on 12 July 1962, at the Marquee Club in London. At the time, the band consisted of Jones, Jagger, Richards, Stewart, and Taylor. Bill Wyman auditioned for the role of bass guitarist at a pub in Chelsea on 7 December 1962 and was hired as a successor to Dick Taylor. The band were impressed by his instrument and amplifiers (including the Vox AC30). The classic line-up of the Rolling Stones, with Charlie Watts on drums, played for the first time in public on Saturday, 12 January 1963 at the Ealing Jazz Club. However, it was not until a gig there on 2 February 1963 that Watts became the Stones' permanent drummer.\nShortly afterwards, the band began their first tour of the UK, performing Chicago blues, including songs by Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. By 1963, they were finding their musical stride as well as popularity. In 1964, they beat the Beatles as the number one United Kingdom band in two surveys. The band's name was changed shortly after their first gig to the Rolling Stones. Their acting manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, secured a Sunday afternoon residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London, in February 1963.\nIn May 1963, the Rolling Stones signed Andrew Loog Oldham as their manager. He had been directed to them by his previous clients, the Beatles. Oldham, then 19, had not reached the age of majority\u2014he was also younger than anyone in the band\u2014 and so could not obtain an agent's licence or sign any contracts without his mother co-signing. By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton to secure record financing and assistance booking venues. Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted.\nOldham initially tried applying the strategy used by Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles, and have the Rolling Stones wear suits. He later changed his mind and imagined a band that contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance. He wanted to make the Stones \"a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables\" and to \"establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic\". One of Oldham's first acts as manager was to remove Stewart from the official line-up, though he would be retained as the band's road manager and would continue to provide keyboards in the studio and live (initially off-stage, he would eventually play with the band on stage by the mid-1970s). Oldham later said of this decision, \"Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for [fans] to remember the faces in the picture.\" Oldham also reduced the band members' ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers.\nDecca Records, which had declined to sign a deal with the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with favourable terms. The band were to receive a royalty rate three times as high as that typically given to a new act, full artistic control of recordings, and ownership of the recording master tapes. The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios. Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became their preferred location. Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band's producer, said Regent had a sound that \"leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way\" creating a \"wall of noise\" that worked well for the band. Because of Regent's low booking rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks common at other studios. All tracks on the first Rolling Stones album, \"The Rolling Stones\", were recorded there.\nOldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' independence with the Beatles' obligation to record in EMI's studios, saying it made the Beatles appear as \"mere mortals\u00a0... sweating in the studio for the man\". He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoint to the Beatles, by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of their first album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as: \"Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?\" In contrast, Wyman says: \"Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally.\u00a0... [Oldham] never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively.\" In a 1971 interview, Wyman stated, \"We were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter.\"\nA cover version of Chuck Berry's \"Come On\" was the Rolling Stones' first single, released on 7 June 1963. The band refused to play it at live gigs, and Decca bought only one ad to promote the record. At Oldham's direction, fan-club members bought copies at record shops polled by the charts, helping \"Come On\" rise to number\u00a021 on the UK Singles Chart. Having a charting single gave the band entr\u00e9e to play outside London, starting with a booking at the Outlook Club in Middlesbrough on 13 July, sharing the billing with the Hollies. Later in 1963, Oldham and Easton arranged the band's first big UK concert tour as a supporting act for American stars, including Bo Diddley, Little Richard, and the Everly Brothers. The tour gave the band the opportunity to hone their stagecraft.\nDuring the tour, the band recorded their second single, a Lennon\u2013McCartney song, \"I Wanna Be Your Man\". It reached number\u00a013 on the UK charts. The Beatles' own recording of the song is included on the 1963 album \"With the Beatles\". On 1 January 1964, the Stones' were the first band to play on BBC's \"Top of the Pops\", performing \"I Wanna Be Your Man\". In January 1964 the band released a self-titled EP, which became their first number 1 record in the UK. The third single by the Stones, Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\", reflecting Bo Diddley's style, was released in February 1964 and reached number\u00a03.\nOldham saw little future for an act that gave up the chance to get significant songwriting royalties by only playing the songs of what he described as \"middle-aged blacks\", thus limiting their appeal to teenage audiences. Jagger and Richards decided to write songs together. Oldham described the first batch as \"soppy and imitative\". Because the band's songwriting developed slowly, songs on their first album, \"The Rolling Stones\" (1964; issued in the US as \"England's Newest Hit Makers\"), were primarily covers, with only one Jagger/Richards original\u2014\"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)\"\u2014and two numbers credited to Nanker Phelge, the pen name used for songs written by the entire group.\nThe Rolling Stones' first US tour in June 1964 was \"a disaster\", according to Wyman. \"When we arrived, we didn't have a hit record [there] or anything going for us.\" When the band appeared on the variety show \"The Hollywood Palace\", that week's guest host, Dean Martin, mocked both their hair and their performance. During the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, meeting many of their most important influences, including Muddy Waters. These sessions included what would become the Rolling Stones' first number\u00a01 hit in the UK, their cover version of Bobby and Shirley Womack's \"It's All Over Now\".\nThe Stones followed the Famous Flames, featuring James Brown, in the theatrical release of the 1964 film \"T.A.M.I. Show\", which showcased American acts with British Invasion artists. According to Jagger, \"We weren't actually following James Brown because there was considerable time between the filming of each section. Nevertheless, he was still very annoyed about it\u00a0...\" On 25 October the band appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Because of the pandemonium surrounding the Stones, Sullivan initially declined to rebook them. However, he booked them for appearances in 1966 and 1967.\nA second EP, \"Five by Five\", was issued in the UK in August 1964. In the US the EP was expanded into their second LP, \"12 X 5\", which was released in October during the tour. The Rolling Stones' fifth UK single, a cover of Willie Dixon's \"Little Red Rooster\"\u2014with \"Off the Hook\", credited to Nanker Phelge, as the B-side\u2014was released in November 1964 and became their second number\u00a01 hit in the UK. The band's US distributors, London Records, declined to release \"Little Red Rooster\" as a single. In December 1964, the distributor released the band's first single with Jagger/Richards originals on both sides: \"Heart of Stone\", with \"What a Shame\" as the B-side; the single went to number\u00a019 in the US.\n1965\u20131967: Height of fame.\nThe band's second UK LP, \"The Rolling Stones No. 2\", was released in January 1965 and reached number\u00a01 on the charts. The US version, released in February as \"The Rolling Stones, Now!\", reached number\u00a05. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles. In January and February of that year, the band played 34 shows for around 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand. The single \"The Last Time\", released in February, was the first Jagger/Richards composition to reach number\u00a01 on the UK charts; it reached number\u00a09 in the US. It was later identified by Richards as \"the bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\"\nTheir first international number\u00a01 hit was \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", recorded in May 1965 during the band's third North American tour. Richards recorded the guitar riff that drives the song with a fuzzbox as a scratch track to guide a horn section. Nevertheless, the final cut did not include the planned horn overdubs. Issued in the summer of 1965, it was their fourth UK number\u00a01 and their first in the US, where it spent four weeks at the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was a worldwide commercial success for the band. The US version of the LP \"Out of Our Heads\", released in July 1965, also went to number\u00a01; it included seven original songs, three Jagger/Richards numbers and four credited to Nanker Phelge. The UK version of \"Out of Our Heads\" was released in September 1965. Their second international number\u00a01 single \"Get Off of My Cloud\" was released in the autumn of 1965, followed by another US-only LP, \"December's Children (And Everybody's)\".\nThe album \"Aftermath\", released in the late spring of 1966, was the first LP to be composed entirely of Jagger/Richards songs; it reached number\u00a01 in the UK and number\u00a02 in the US. According to \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"Aftermath\" is often regarded as the most important of the band's formative records. On this album, Jones' contributions expanded beyond guitar and harmonica. To the Middle Eastern-influenced \"Paint It Black\" he added sitar; to the ballad \"Lady Jane\" he added dulcimer, and to \"Under My Thumb\" he added marimbas. \"Aftermath\" also contained \"Goin' Home\", a nearly 12-minute song that included elements of jamming and improvisation.\nThe Stones' success on the British and American singles charts peaked during the 1960s. \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" was released in February 1966, and reached number\u00a02 in the UK and US charts; \"Paint It Black\" reached number\u00a01 in the UK and US in May 1966. \"Mother's Little Helper\", released in June 1966, reached number\u00a08 in the US; it was one of the first pop songs to discuss the issue of prescription drug abuse. \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" was released in September 1966 and reached number\u00a05 in the UK and number\u00a09 in the US. It had a number of firsts for the group: it was the first Stones recording to feature brass horns, and the back-cover photo on the original US picture sleeve depicted the group satirically dressed in drag. The song was accompanied by one of the first official music videos, directed by Peter Whitehead.\nDuring their North American tour in June and July 1966, the Stones' high-energy concerts proved highly successful with young people, while alienating local police who had the physically exhausting task of controlling the often rebellious crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and the establishment seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\". In an effort to capitalise on this, London released the live album \"Got Live If You Want It!\" in December. The band's first greatest hits album, \"Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)\", was released in the UK in November 1966, a different version of which had been released in the US in March that year.\nIn January 1967, \"Between the Buttons\" was released, and reached number\u00a03 in the UK and number\u00a02 in the US. It was Andrew Oldham's last venture as the Rolling Stones' producer. Allen Klein took over his role as the band's manager in 1965. Richards recalled, \"There was a new deal with Decca to be made ... and he said he could do it.\" The US version included the double A-side single \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" and \"Ruby Tuesday\", which went to number\u00a01 in the US and number\u00a03 in the UK. When the band went to New York to perform the numbers on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in January, they were ordered to change the lyrics of the refrain of \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" to \"let's spend some time together\".\nIn early 1967, Jagger, Richards, and Jones began to be hounded by authorities over their recreational drug use, after the \"News of the World\" ran a three-part feature entitled \"Pop Stars and Drugs: Facts That Will Shock You\". The series described alleged LSD parties hosted by the Moody Blues and attended by top stars including the Who's Pete Townshend and Cream's Ginger Baker, and described alleged admissions of drug use by leading pop musicians. The first article targeted Donovan (who was raided and charged soon after); the second instalment (published on 5 February) targeted the Rolling Stones. A reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise's, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several Benzedrine tablets, displayed a piece of hashish, and invited his companions back to his flat for a \"smoke\". The article claimed this was Mick Jagger, but it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity; the reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on Brian Jones. Two days after the article was published, Jagger filed a writ for libel against the \"News of the World\".\nA week later, on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped off by the paper, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time, but Jagger, Richards, and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were subsequently charged with drug offences. Andrew Oldham was afraid of being arrested and fled to America. Richards said in 2003, \"When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize that this was a whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space where you could do anything you wanted.\"\nIn March 1967, while awaiting the consequences of the police raid, Jagger, Richards, and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that she left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: \"That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive me for that and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens.\" Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy. June 1967 saw the release of the US-only compilation album \"Flowers\".\nOn 10 May 1967, the day Jagger, Richards and Fraser were arraigned in connection with the Redlands charges, Jones' house was raided by police. He was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. Three of the five Stones now faced drug charges. Jagger and Richards were tried at the end of June. Jagger received a three-month prison sentence for the possession of four amphetamine tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to a year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point but were released on bail the next day, pending appeal.\n\"The Times\" ran an editorial, \"Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?\", in which conservative editor William Rees-Mogg surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on the sentencing, pointing out that Jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than \"any purely anonymous young man\". While awaiting the appeal hearings, the band recorded a new single, \"We Love You\", as a thank you for their fans' loyalty. It began with the sound of prison doors closing, and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of Oscar Wilde. On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction, and reduced Jagger's sentence to a conditional discharge. Jones' trial took place in November 1967. In December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones received a \u00a31,000 fine and was put on three years' probation, with an order to seek professional help.\nIn December 1967, the band released \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\", which reached number\u00a03 in the UK and number\u00a02 in the US. It drew unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". \"Satanic Majesties\" was recorded while Jagger, Richards, and Jones were awaiting their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was publicly amicable, but in 2003 Jagger said: \"The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that we were being childish. It was not a great moment really\u2014and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job.\" \"Satanic Majesties\" became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own. Its psychedelic sound was complemented by the cover art, which featured a 3D photo by Michael Cooper, who had also photographed the cover of \"Sgt. Pepper\". Bill Wyman wrote and sang a track on the album: \"In Another Land\", also released as a single, the first on which Jagger did not sing lead.\n1968\u20131972: Jones' departure and death, Mick Taylor joins, \"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\".\nThe band spent the first few months of 1968 working on material for their next album. Those sessions resulted in the song \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\", released as a single in May. The subsequent album, \"Beggars Banquet\", an eclectic mix of country and blues-inspired tunes, marked the band's return to their rhythm and blues roots. It was also the beginning of their collaboration with producer Jimmy Miller. It featured the lead single \"Street Fighting Man\" (which addressed the political upheavals of May 1968) and \"Sympathy for the Devil\". Controversy over the design of the album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the wall behind it, delayed the album's release for six months. While the band had \"absolute artistic control over their albums\", Decca was not enthused about the cover's depiction of graffiti reading \"John Loves Yoko\" being included; the album was released that December, with a different cover design.\n\"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\", which originally began as an idea about \"the new shape of the rock-and-roll concert tour\", was filmed at the end of 1968. It featured John Lennon, Yoko Ono, the Dirty Mac, the Who, Jethro Tull, Marianne Faithfull, and Taj Mahal. The footage was shelved for 28 years but was finally released officially in 1996, with a DVD version released in October 2004.\nBy the time \"Beggars Banquet\" was released, Brian Jones was only sporadically contributing to the band. Jagger said that Jones was \"not psychologically suited to this way of life\". His drug use had become a hindrance, and he was unable to obtain a US visa. Richards reported that in a June meeting with Jagger, Watts, and himself at Jones' house, Jones admitted that he was unable to \"go on the road again\", and left the band saying, \"I've left, and if I want to I can come back.\" On 3 July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool at his home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex. The band auditioned several guitarists, including Paul Kossoff, as a replacement for Jones, before settling on Mick Taylor, who was recommended to Jagger by John Mayall.\nThe Rolling Stones were scheduled to play at a free concert for Blackhill Enterprises in London's Hyde Park, two days after Jones' death; they decided to go ahead with the show as a tribute to him. Jagger began by reading an excerpt from Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem \"Adonais\", an elegy written on the death of his friend John Keats. They released thousands of butterflies in memory of Jones before opening their set with \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\", a Johnny Winter number. The concert, their first with new guitarist Mick Taylor, was performed in front of an estimated 250,000 fans. A Granada Television production team filmed the performance, which was broadcast on British television as \"The Stones in the Park\". Blackhill Enterprises stage manager Sam Cutler introduced the Rolling Stones onto the stage by announcing: \"Let's welcome the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.\"\nCutler repeated the introduction throughout their 1969 US tour. The show also included the concert debut of their fifth US number\u00a01 single, \"Honky Tonk Women\", which had been released the previous day. In September 1969 the band's second greatest hits album, \"Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)\", was released, featuring a poem in dedication to Jones on the inside cover.\nThe Stones' last album of the 1960s was \"Let It Bleed\", which reached number\u00a01 in the UK and number\u00a03 in the US. It featured \"Gimme Shelter\" with guest lead female vocals by Merry Clayton (sister of Sam Clayton, of the American rock band Little Feat). Other tracks include \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" (with accompaniment by the London Bach Choir, who initially asked that their name be removed from the album's credits after apparently being \"horrified\" by the content of some of its other material, but later withdrew this request), \"Midnight Rambler\", as well as a cover of Robert Johnson's \"Love in Vain\". Jones and Taylor are both featured on the album.\nJust after the US tour ended, the band performed at the Altamont Free Concert at the Altamont Speedway, about east of San Francisco. A Hells Angels biker gang provided security, and a fan, Meredith Hunter, was stabbed and beaten to death by the Angels after they realised he was armed. Part of the tour, and the Altamont concert, was documented in Albert and David Maysles' film \"Gimme Shelter\". In response to the growing popularity of bootleg recordings (in particular \"Live'r Than You'll Ever Be\", recorded during the 1969 tour), the album \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!\" was released in 1970. Critic Lester Bangs declared it the best-ever live album. It reached number\u00a01 in the UK and number\u00a06 in the US.\nAt the end of the decade, the band appeared on BBC's review of the 1960s music scene, \"Pop Go the Sixties\", performing \"Gimme Shelter\", which was broadcast live on 31 December 1969. The following year, the band wanted out of contracts with both Klein and Decca, but still owed them one more Jagger/Richards\u2013credited single. To get back at the label and fulfil their final contractual obligation, the band came up with the track \"Cocksucker Blues\"\u2014deliberately making it as crude as they could in hopes of making it un-releasable. Decca instead released \"Street Fighting Man\" from \"Beggar's Banquet\" as a UK single in July 1971, the track's 1968 single release having been only in the US.\nAmid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records. \"Sticky Fingers\", released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover designed by Andy Warhol. It was an Andy Warhol photograph of a man from the waist down in tight jeans featuring a functioning zipper. When unzipped, it revealed the subject's underwear. In some markets an alternate cover was released because of the perceived offensive nature of the original at the time.\n\"Sticky Fingers\"' cover was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band's logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Designer John Pasche created the logo, following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the stuck-out tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ... It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music. The tongue and lips design was part of a package that in 2003 VH1 named the best album cover ever. The logo has remained on all the Stones' post-1970 albums and singles, in addition to their merchandise and stage sets. The album contains one of their best-known hits, \"Brown Sugar\", and the country-influenced \"Dead Flowers\". \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" were recorded at Alabama's Muscle Shoals Sound Studio after the 1969 American tour. The album continued the band's immersion into heavily blues-influenced compositions; is noted for its \"loose, ramshackle ambience\"; and marked Mick Taylor's first full album with the band. \"Sticky Fingers\" reached number\u00a01 in both the UK and the US.\nIn 1968, the Stones, acting on a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control room in a van and created the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio so they would not be limited to the standard 9\u20135 operating hours of most recording studios. The band lent the mobile studio to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, who used it to record \"Led Zeppelin III\" (1970) and \"Led Zeppelin IV\" (1971). Deep Purple immortalised the mobile studio itself in the song \"Smoke on the Water\" with the line \"the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, making our music there\".\nFollowing the release of \"Sticky Fingers\", the Rolling Stones left England after receiving advice from their financial manager Prince Rupert Loewenstein. He recommended they go into tax exile before the start of the next financial year. The band had learned that they had not paid taxes for seven years, despite being assured that their taxes were taken care of; and the UK government was owed a relative fortune. The Stones moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the Villa Nellc\u00f4te and sublet rooms to band members and their entourage.\nUsing the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement. They completed the new tracks, along with material dating as far back as 1969, at Sunset Studios in Los Angeles. The resulting double album, \"Exile on Main St.\", was released in May 1972, and reached number one in both the UK and the US. Given an A+ grade by critic Robert Christgau and disparaged by Lester Bangs\u2014who reversed his opinion within months\u2014\"Exile\" is now accepted as one of the Stones' best albums. The films \"Cocksucker Blues\" (never officially released) and \"\" (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 North American Tour.\nThe band's double compilation album, \"Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971\", was released in 1971; it reached number\u00a03 in the UK and number\u00a04 in the US. It is certified Diamond in the US, having sold over 6\u00a0million copies, being certified 12\u00d7 Platinum for being a double album, and spent over 347 weeks on the \"Billboard\" album chart. A follow-up double compilation album \"More Hot Rocks (Big Hits &amp; Fazed Cookies)\" was released in 1972. In 1974, Bill Wyman was the first band member to release solo material, his album \"Monkey Grip\".\n1972\u20131977: Critical fluctuations and Ronnie Wood replaces Taylor.\nIn 1972, members of the band set up a complex financial structure to reduce the amount of their taxes. Their holding company, Promogroup, has offices in both the Netherlands and the Caribbean. The Netherlands was chosen because it does not directly tax royalty payments. The band have been tax exiles ever since, meaning they can no longer use Britain as their main residence. Due to the arrangements with the holding company, the band reportedly paid a tax of just 1.6% on their total earnings of \u00a3242\u00a0million over the 20 years preceding 2006.\nIn November 1972, the band began recording sessions in Kingston, Jamaica, for the album \"Goats Head Soup\"; it was released in 1973 and reached number\u00a01 in both the UK and US. The album, which contained the worldwide hit \"Angie\", was the first in a string of commercially successful, but critically tepidly received, studio albums. The sessions for \"Goats Head Soup\" also produced unused material, most notably an early version of the popular ballad \"Waiting on a Friend\", which was not released until the \"Tattoo You\" LP nine years later.\nAnother legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France, interrupted the making of \"Goats Head Soup\". Authorities had issued a warrant for Richards' arrest, and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning. This, along with Jagger's 1967 and 1970 convictions on drug charges, complicated the band's plans for their Pacific tour in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia. A European tour followed in September and October 1973, which bypassed France, coming, as it did, after Richards' recent arrest in England on drug charges.\nThe 1974 album \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" was recorded in the Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany; it reached number\u00a02 in the UK and number\u00a01 in the US. Miller was not invited to return as the album's producer because his \"contribution level had dropped\". Jagger and Richards, credited as \"the Glimmer Twins\", produced the album. Both the album and the single of the same name were hits.\nNear the end of 1974, Taylor began to lose patience after years of feeling like a \"junior citizen in the band of jaded veterans\". The band's situation made normal functioning complicated, with members living in different countries, and legal barriers restricting where they could tour. In addition, drug use was starting to affect Taylor's and Richards' productivity, and Taylor felt some of his own creative contributions were going unrecognised. At the end of 1974, Taylor quit the band. Taylor said in 1980, \"I wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do something else\u00a0... I wasn't really composing songs or writing at that time. I was just beginning to write, and that influenced my decision\u00a0... There are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest; they can ride along somebody else's success. And there are some people for whom that's not enough. It really wasn't enough for me.\"\nThe Stones needed a new guitarist, and the recording sessions in Munich for the next album, \"Black and Blue\" (1976) (number\u00a02 in the UK, number\u00a01 in the US), were effectively used as auditions. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned, as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed they had played without realising they were being auditioned. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out, but Richards and Jagger preferred for the band to remain purely British. When Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed he was the right choice. He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\". He had declined Jagger's earlier offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to Faces, saying \"that's what's really important to me\". Faces' lead singer Rod Stewart went so far as to say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.\nIn 1975, Wood joined the band as second guitarist for their upcoming Tour of the Americas, which was a contributing factor in the disbandment of Faces. His installment as an official Rolling Stone was announced in 1976; unlike the other band members, however, Wood was a salaried employee, which remained the case until the early 1990s, when he finally joined the Stones' business partnership.\nThe 1975 Tour of the Americas kicked off in New York City with the band performing on a flatbed trailer being pulled down Broadway. The tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which Jagger swung out over the audience. In June of that year, the Stones' Decca catalogue was purchased by Klein's ABKCO label. In August 1976, the Stones played Knebworth in England in front of 200,000\u2014their largest audience to date\u2014and finished their set at 7\u00a0a.m. Jagger had booked live recording sessions at the El Mocambo, a club in Toronto, to produce a long-overdue live album, 1977's \"Love You Live\", the first Stones live album since \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!\" It reached No.\u00a03 in the UK and No.\u00a05 in the US.\nRichards' addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in Toronto; the other members had already arrived. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canadian customs after Richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Anita Pallenberg, discovered of heroin in Richards' room. He was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence. The Crown prosecutor later conceded that Richards had procured the drugs after his arrival.\nDespite the incident, the band played two shows in Toronto, but caused more controversy when Margaret Trudeau, then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was seen partying with the band after one show. The band's shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the entire week by April Wine for a recording session. 1050 CHUM, a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.\nOn 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg pleaded guilty to drug possession and incurred a fine in connection with the original airport incident. The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, he received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two charity concerts to benefit the Canadian institute for the blind in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin. It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction as Richards struggled to get clean. While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was a regular at New York's Studio 54 disco club, often in the company of model Jerry Hall. His marriage to Bianca Jagger ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged.\nAlthough the Rolling Stones remained popular through the early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band.\n1978\u20131982: Commercial peak.\nThe group's fortunes changed in 1978, after the band released \"Some Girls\", which included the hit single \"Miss You\", the country ballad \"Far Away Eyes\", \"Beast of Burden\", and \"Shattered\". In part as a response to punk, many songs, particularly \"Respectable\", were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll, and the album's success re-established the Rolling Stones' immense popularity among young people. It reached number\u00a02 in the UK and number\u00a01 in the US. Following the 1978 US Tour, the band appeared on the first show of the fourth season of the TV series \"Saturday Night Live\". Following the success of \"Some Girls\", the band released their next album, \"Emotional Rescue\", in mid-1980. During recording sessions for the album, a rift between Jagger and Richards slowly developed. Richards wanted to tour in the summer or autumn of 1980 to promote the new album. Much to his disappointment, Jagger declined. \"Emotional Rescue\" hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached number\u00a03 in the US.\nIn early 1981, the group reconvened and decided to tour the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album, as well as to rehearse for the tour. That year's resulting album, \"Tattoo You\", featured a number of outtakes from other recording sessions, including lead single \"Start Me Up\", which reached number\u00a02 in the US and ranked number\u00a022 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot 100 year-end chart. Two songs (\"Waiting on a Friend\" (US number\u00a013) and \"Tops\") featured Mick Taylor's unused rhythm guitar tracks, while jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins played on \"Slave\", \"Neighbours\", and \"Waiting on a Friend\". The album reached number\u00a02 in the UK and number\u00a01 in the US.\nThe Rolling Stones reached number\u00a020 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1982 with \"Hang Fire\". Their 1981 American Tour was their biggest, longest, and most colourful production to date. It was the highest-grossing tour of that year. It included a concert at Chicago's Checkerboard Lounge with Muddy Waters, in one of his last performances before his death in 1983. Some of the shows were recorded. This resulted in the 1982 live album \"Still Life (American Concert 1981)\" which reached number\u00a04 in the UK and number\u00a05 in the US, and the 1983 Hal Ashby concert film \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", filmed at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona and the Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands, New Jersey.\nIn mid-1982, to commemorate their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The European tour was their first in six years and used a similar format to the American tour. The band was joined by former Allman Brothers Band keyboardist Chuck Leavell, who continues to perform and record with them. By the end of the year, the Stones had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, CBS Records, for a reported $50\u00a0million, then the biggest record deal in history.\n1983\u20131988: Band turmoil and solo projects.\nBefore leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released \"Undercover\" in late 1983. It reached number\u00a03 in the UK and number\u00a04 in the US. Despite good reviews and the peak Top Ten position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing their Atlantic catalogue. By this time, the Jagger/Richards rift had grown significantly. To Richards' annoyance, Jagger signed a solo deal with CBS Records and spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first album. He also declared his growing lack of interest in the Rolling Stones. By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings. Much of the material on 1986's \"Dirty Work\" was generated by Richards, with more contributions from Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. It was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward.\nIn June 1985, Jagger teamed up with David Bowie for \"Dancing in the Street\", which was recorded for the Live Aid charity movement. This was one of Jagger's first solo performances, and the song reached number\u00a01 in the UK, and number\u00a07 in the US. In December 1985, Ian Stewart died of a heart attack. The Rolling Stones played a private tribute concert for him at London's 100 Club in February 1986. Two days later they were presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\"Dirty Work\" was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews, reaching number\u00a04 in both the US and UK. It was the Stones' first album for CBS with an outside producer, Steve Lillywhite. With relations between Richards and Jagger at an all-time low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album and instead undertook a solo tour, where he performed some Rolling Stones songs. As a result of their animosity, the Stones almost broke up. Jagger's solo records, \"She's the Boss\" (1985), which reached number\u00a06 in the UK and number\u00a013 in the US, and \"Primitive Cool\" (1987), which reached number\u00a026 in the UK and number\u00a041 in the US, met with moderate commercial success. In 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, \"Talk Is Cheap\", which reached number\u00a037 in the UK and No.\u00a024 in the US. It was well received by fans and critics, and was certified Gold in the US. Richards has subsequently referred to this late-80s period, when the two were recording solo albums with no obvious reunion of the Stones in sight, as \"World War III\".\n1989\u20131999: Comeback, record-breaking tours and Wyman's departure.\nIn early 1989, the Stones \u2013 Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Ronnie Wood, Brian Jones, Mick Taylor, and Ian Stewart \u2013 were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Jagger, Richards, Wood and Taylor in attendance. Jagger and Richards set aside their animosity and went to work on a new Rolling Stones album, \"Steel Wheels\". Heralded as a return to form, it included the singles \"Mixed Emotions\" (US number\u00a05), \"Rock and a Hard Place\" (US number\u00a023) and \"Almost Hear You Sigh\". The album also included \"Continental Drift\", which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco, in 1989, with the Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar, coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting. Nigel Finch produced the BBC documentary film \"The Rolling Stones in Morocco\". Finch also directed \"\", a documentary spanning the band's 25-year history, featuring new interviews with the five current members and archival interview material of Brian Jones and Mick Taylor. \"25x5\" aired on the BBC in late 1989 and was released on home video early the following year. \"Steel Wheels\" reached number\u00a02 in the UK and number\u00a03 in the US.\nThe Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour was the band's first world tour in seven years and their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included Living Colour and Guns N' Roses. Recordings from the tour include the 1991 concert album \"Flashpoint\", which reached number\u00a06 in the UK and number\u00a016 in the US, and the concert film \"Live at the Max\" released in 1991. The tour was Bill Wyman's last. After years of deliberation he decided to leave the band, although his departure was not made official until January 1993. He then published \"Stone Alone\", an autobiography based on scrapbooks and diaries he had kept since the band's early days. A few years later he formed Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings and began recording and touring again.\nAfter the successes of the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, the band took a break. Watts released two jazz albums; Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called \"Slide On This\"; Wyman released his fourth solo album; Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, \"Main Offender\", and did a small tour, including big concerts in Spain and Argentina. Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, \"Wandering Spirit\", which reached number\u00a012 in the UK and number\u00a011 in the US. The album sold more than two million copies worldwide, being certified Gold in the US.\nAfter Wyman's departure, the Rolling Stones' new distributor/record label, Virgin Records, remastered and repackaged the band's back catalogue from \"Sticky Fingers\" to \"Steel Wheels\", except for the three live albums. They issued another hits compilation in 1993 entitled \"Jump Back\", which reached number\u00a016 in the UK and number\u00a030 in the US. By 1993, the Stones were ready to start recording another studio album. Charlie Watts recruited bassist Darryl Jones, a former sideman of Miles Davis and Sting, as Wyman's replacement for 1994's \"Voodoo Lounge\". Jones continues to perform with the band as their touring and session bassist. The album met with positive reviews and strong sales, going double platinum in the US. Reviewers took note and credited the album's \"traditionalist\" sounds to the Rolling Stones' new producer Don Was. \"Voodoo Lounge\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 1995 Grammy Awards. It reached number\u00a01 in the UK and number\u00a02 in the US.\nThe accompanying Voodoo Lounge Tour lasted into the following year and grossed $320\u00a0million, becoming the world's highest-grossing tour at the time. Mostly acoustic numbers from various concerts and rehearsals made up \"Stripped\" which reached number\u00a09 in the UK and the US. It featured a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\", as well as infrequently played songs such as \"Shine a Light\", \"Sweet Virginia\", and \"The Spider and the Fly\". On 8 September 1994, the Stones performed their new song \"Love Is Strong\" and \"Start Me Up\" at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The band received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the ceremony.\nThe Rolling Stones were the first major recording artists to broadcast a concert over the Internet; a 20-minute video was broadcast on 18 November 1994 using the Mbone at 10 frames per second. The broadcast, engineered by Thinking Pictures and financed by Sun Microsystems, was one of the first demonstrations of streaming video; while it was not a true webcast, it introduced many to the technology.\nThe Rolling Stones ended the 1990s with the album \"Bridges to Babylon\", released in 1997 to mixed reviews. It reached number\u00a06 in the UK and number\u00a03 in the US. The video of the single \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" featured Angelina Jolie as guest and was given steady rotation on both MTV and VH1. Sales were roughly equal to those of previous records (about 1.2\u00a0million copies sold in the US). The subsequent Bridges to Babylon Tour, which crossed Europe, North America, and other destinations, proved that the band remained a strong live attraction. Once again, a live album was recorded during the tour, \"No Security\"; only this time all but two songs (\"Live With Me\" and \"The Last Time\") were previously unreleased on live albums. The album reached number\u00a067 in the UK and number\u00a034 in the US. In 1999, the Rolling Stones staged the No Security Tour in the US and continued the Bridges to Babylon tour in Europe.\n2000\u20132011: 40th anniversary, \"A Bigger Bang\" and continued success.\nIn late 2001, Mick Jagger released his fourth solo album, \"Goddess in the Doorway\". It met with mixed reviews; it reached number\u00a044 in the UK and number\u00a039 in the US. A month after the September 11 attacks, Jagger, Richards, and a backing band took part in The Concert for New York City, performing \"Salt of the Earth\" and \"Miss You\". In 2002, the Stones released \"Forty Licks\", a greatest hits double album, to mark forty years as a band. The collection contained four new songs recorded with the core band of Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood, Leavell, and Jones. The album has sold more than 7\u00a0million copies worldwide. It reached number\u00a02 in both the US and UK. The same year, \"Q\" magazine named the Rolling Stones one of the 50 Bands To See Before You Die. The Stones headlined the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto concert in Toronto, Canada, to help the city\u2014which they had used for rehearsals since the Voodoo Lounge tour\u2014recover from the 2003 SARS epidemic; an estimated 490,000 people attended the concert.\nOn 9 November 2003, the band played their first concert in Hong Kong, as part of the Harbour Fest celebration, in support of its SARS-affected economy. The same month, the band licensed the exclusive rights to sell the new four-DVD boxed set \"Four Flicks\", recorded on their recent world tour, to the US Best Buy chain of stores. In response, some Canadian and US music retail chains (including HMV Canada and Circuit City) pulled Rolling Stones CDs and related merchandise from their shelves and replaced it with signs explaining why. In 2004, a double live album of the Licks Tour, \"Live Licks\", was released and certified gold in the US. It reached number\u00a02 in both the UK and US. In November 2004, the Rolling Stones were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame.\nThe band's first new album in almost eight years, \"A Bigger Bang\", was released on 6 September 2005 to positive reviews, including a glowing write-up in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. The album reached number\u00a02 in the UK and number\u00a03 in the US. The single \"Streets of Love\" reached the top 15 in the UK. The album included the political \"Sweet Neo Con\", Jagger's criticism of American neoconservatism. Richards was initially worried about a political backlash in the US, but did not object to the lyrics, saying \"I just didn't want it to become some peripheral distractions/political storm in a tea-cup sort of thing.\" The subsequent A Bigger Bang Tour began in August 2005, and included North America, South America, and East Asia. In February 2006, the group played the half-time show of Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. By the end of 2005, the Bigger Bang tour had set a record of $162\u00a0million in gross receipts, breaking the North American mark set by the band in 1994. On 18 February 2006, the band played a free concert to over one million people at the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro\u2014one of the largest rock concerts of all time.\nAfter performances in Japan, China, Australia, and New Zealand in March and April 2006, the Stones' tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe. During the break, Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall from a tree on Fiji, where he had been on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006, it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his alcohol abuse rehabilitation programme, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Mick Jagger's throat problems forced the cancellation of three shows and the rescheduling of several others that fall. The Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest-grossing tour of all time.\nMartin Scorsese filmed the Stones performances at New York City's Beacon Theatre on 29 October and 1 November 2006 for the documentary film, \"Shine a Light\", released in 2008. The film features guest appearances by Buddy Guy, Jack White, and Christina Aguilera. An accompanying soundtrack, also titled \"Shine a Light\", was released in April 2008 and reached number\u00a02 in the UK and number\u00a011 in the US. The album's debut at number\u00a02 on the UK charts was the highest position for a Rolling Stones concert album since \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert\" in 1970. At the Beacon Theatre show, music executive Ahmet Ertegun fell and later died from his injuries.\nThe band toured Europe throughout June and August 2007. 12 June 2007 saw the release of the band's second four-disc DVD set: \"The Biggest Bang\", a seven-hour film featuring their shows in Austin, Rio de Janeiro, Saitama, Shanghai, and Buenos Aires, along with extras. On 10 June 2007, the band performed their first gig at a festival in 30 years, at the Isle of Wight Festival, to a crowd of 65,000, and were joined onstage by Amy Winehouse. On 26 August 2007, they played their last concert of the Bigger Bang tour at the O2 Arena in London. At the conclusion of the tour, the band had grossed a record-setting $558\u00a0million and were listed in the 2007 edition of \"Guinness World Records\". On 12 November 2007, ABKCO released \"\", a double-CD remake of the 1975 compilation \"Rolled Gold\". In July 2008, the Rolling Stones left EMI to sign with Vivendi's Universal Music, taking with them their catalogue stretching back to \"Sticky Fingers\". New music released by the band while under this contract was to be issued through Universal's Polydor label.\nDuring the autumn, Jagger and Richards worked with producer Don Was to add new vocals and guitar parts to ten unfinished songs from the \"Exile on Main St.\" sessions. Jagger and Mick Taylor also recorded a session together in London, where Taylor added a new guitar track to what would be the expanded album's single, \"Plundered My Soul\". On 17 April 2010, the band released a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single of the previously unreleased track \"Plundered My Soul\", as part of Record Store Day. The track, part of the group's 2010 re-issue of \"Exile on Main St.\", was combined with \"All Down the Line\" as its B-side. The band appeared at the Cannes Festival for the premiere of the documentary \"Stones in Exile\" (directed by Stephen Kijak) about the recording of the album \"Exile on Main St.\" On 23 May, the re-issue of \"Exile on Main St.\" reached number\u00a01 on the UK charts, almost 38 years to the week after it first occupied that position. The band became the first act to see a classic work return to number\u00a01 decades after it was first released. In the US, the album re-entered the charts at number\u00a02.\nLoewenstein proposed to the band that they wind down their recording and touring activity and sell off their assets. The band disagreed, and that year Loewenstein parted from the band after four decades as their manager, later writing the memoir \"A Prince Among Stones\". Joyce Smyth, a lawyer who had long been working for the Stones, took over as their full-time manager in 2010. Smyth would go on to win Top Manager in the 2019 \"Billboard\" Live Music Awards.\nIn October 2010, the Stones released \"Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones\" to cinemas and later to DVD. A digitally remastered version of the film was shown in select cinemas across the United States. Although originally released to cinemas in 1974, it had never been available for home release, apart from bootleg recordings. In October 2011, the Stones released \"\" to cinemas. A digitally remastered version of the film was shown in select cinemas across the US. This live performance was recorded during one show in Ft. Worth, Texas, in support of their 1978 US Tour and their album \"Some Girls\". The film was released (on DVD/Blu-ray Disc) on 15 November 2011. On 21 November, the band reissued \"Some Girls\" as a 2-CD deluxe edition. The second CD included twelve previously unreleased tracks (except \"So Young\", which was a B-side to \"Out of Tears\") from the sessions, with mostly newly recorded vocals by Jagger.\n2012\u20132016: 50th anniversary, documentary and \"Blue &amp; Lonesome\".\nThe Rolling Stones celebrated their 50th anniversary in the summer of 2012 by releasing the book \"The Rolling Stones: 50\". A new take on the band's lip-and-tongue logo, designed by Shepard Fairey, was also revealed and used during the celebrations. Jagger's brother Chris performed a gig at The Rolling Stones Museum in Slovenia, in conjunction with the celebrations. The documentary \"Crossfire Hurricane\", directed by Brett Morgen, was released in October 2012. He conducted approximately fifty hours of interviews for the film, including extensive interviews with Wyman and Taylor. This was the first official career-spanning documentary since \"25x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones\", filmed for their 25th anniversary in 1989. A new compilation album, \"GRRR!\", was released on 12 November. Available in four different formats, it included two new tracks, \"Doom and Gloom\" and \"One More Shot\", recorded at Studio Guillaume Tell in Paris, France, in the last few weeks of August 2012. The album went on to sell over two million copies worldwide. The music video for \"Doom and Gloom\", featuring Noomi Rapace, was released on 20 November.\nIn November 2012, the Stones began their 50 &amp; Counting... tour at London's O2 Arena, where they were joined by Jeff Beck. At their second show, in London, Eric Clapton and Florence Welch joined the group onstage. The third anniversary concert took place on 8 December at the Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York. The last two dates were at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on 13 and 15 December. Bruce Springsteen and blues-rock band the Black Keys joined the band on the final night. The stage on this tour was designed so that the lips could \"inflate and deflate during different parts of the show.\" The band also played two songs at \"\".\nThe Stones played nineteen shows in the US in spring 2013 with various guest stars, including Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, before returning to the UK. In June, the band performed at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival. They returned to Hyde Park in July and performed the same set list as their 1969 concert at the venue. \"Hyde Park Live\", a live album recorded at the two Hyde Park gigs on 6 and 13 July, was released exclusively as a digital download through iTunes later that month. An award-winning live DVD, \"\", was released on 11 November.\nIn February 2014, the band embarked on their 14 On Fire tour, scheduled for the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Europe and to go until the summer. On 17 March, Jagger's long-time partner L'Wren Scott died suddenly, resulting in the cancellation and rescheduling of the opening tour dates to October. On 4 June, the Rolling Stones performed for the first time in Israel. \"Haaretz\" described the concert as being \"Historic with a capital H\". In a 2015 interview with Jagger, when asked if retirement crosses his mind he stated, \"Nah, not in the moment. I'm thinking about what the next tour is. I'm not thinking about retirement. I'm planning the next set of tours, so the answer is really, 'No, not really.'\"\nThe Stones embarked on their Latin American tour in February 2016. On 25 March, the band played a bonus show, a free open-air concert in Havana, Cuba, which was attended by an estimated 500,000 concert-goers. In June of that year, the Rolling Stones released \"Totally Stripped\", an expanded and reconceived edition of \"Stripped\", in multiple formats. Their concert on 25 March 2016 in Cuba was commemorated in the film '. It premiered on 23 September for one night only in more than a thousand theatres worldwide. The film ', a documentary of their 2016 Latin America tour, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 16 September 2016; it came out on DVD and Blu-ray on 26 May 2017. The Stones performed at the Desert Trip festival held in Indio, California, playing two nights, 7 and 14 October, the same nights as Bob Dylan.\nThe band released \"Blue &amp; Lonesome\" on 2 December 2016. The album consisted of 12 blues covers of artists such as Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed, and Little Walter. Recording took place in British Grove Studios, London, in December 2015, and featured Eric Clapton on two tracks. The album reached number\u00a01 in the UK, the second-highest opening sales week for an album that year. It also debuted at number\u00a04 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n2017\u2013present: No Filter Tour, Watts' death, and \"Hackney Diamonds\".\nIn July 2017, the \"Toronto Sun\" reported that the Stones were getting ready to record their first album of original material in more than a decade, but recording was later ultimately delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"On Air\", a collection of 18 recordings the band performed on the BBC between 1963 and 1965, was released in December 2017. The album featured eight songs the band had never recorded or released commercially.\nIn May 2017, the No Filter Tour was announced, with fourteen shows in twelve different venues across Europe in September and October of the same year. It was later extended to go from May to July 2018, adding fourteen new dates across the UK and Europe, making it the band's first UK tour since 2006. In November 2018, the Stones announced plans to bring the No Filter Tour to US stadiums in 2019, with 13 shows set to run from April to June. In March 2019, it was announced that Jagger would be undergoing heart valve replacement surgery, forcing the band to postpone the 17-date North American leg of their No Filter Tour. On 4 April 2019, it was announced that Jagger had completed his heart valve procedure in New York, was recovering (in hospital) after a successful operation, and could be released in the following few days. On 16 May, the Rolling Stones announced that the No Filter Tour would resume on 21 June with the 17 postponed dates rescheduled up to the end of August. In March 2020, the No Filter Tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Rolling Stones\u2014featuring Jagger, Richards, Watts, and Wood at their homes\u2014were one of the headline acts on Global Citizen's \"\" on-line and on-screen concert on 18 April 2020, a global event featuring dozens of artists and comedians to support frontline healthcare workers and the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 23 April, Jagger announced through his Facebook page the release (the same day at 5pm BST) of the single \"Living in a Ghost Town\", a new Rolling Stones song recorded in London and Los Angeles in 2019 and finished in isolation (part of the new material that the band were recording in the studio before the COVID-19 lockdown), a song that the band \"thought would resonate through the times we're living in\" and their first original one since 2012. The song reached number\u00a01 on the German Singles Chart, the first time the Stones had reached the top spot in 52 years, and making them the oldest artists ever to do so.\nThe band's 1973 album \"Goats Head Soup\" was reissued on 4 September 2020 and featured previously unreleased outtakes: such as \"Criss Cross\", which was released as a single and music video on 9 July 2020; \"Scarlet\", featuring Jimmy Page; and \"All the Rage\". On 11 September 2020, the album topped the UK Albums Chart as the Rolling Stones became the first artist to top the chart across six different decades.\nIn August 2021, it was announced that Watts would undergo an unspecified medical procedure and would not perform on the remainder of the No Filter tour; the longtime Stones associate Steve Jordan filled in as drummer. Watts died on 24 August 2021, at the age of 80, in a London hospital with his family around him. For 10 days, the contents of the Rolling Stones' official website were replaced with a picture of Watts, in his memory. On 27 August, the band's social media accounts shared a montage of pictures and videos of Watts. The band subsequently showed pictures and videos of Watts at the beginning of each concert on the No Filter tour. The short segment is roughly a minute long and plays a simple drum track by Watts. They became the highest-earning live act of 2021, surpassing Taylor Swift; since 2018 the two have traded the top two spots. The band began a new tour in 2022, with Jordan on drums.\nFollowing reports in February 2023 that former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr would appear on their new album, representatives for the band confirmed that McCartney will appear but stated that Starr would not. This will mark the first time that McCartney and the Stones have collaborated on a studio album. Four months later, it was reported that Wyman would return for a song, more than 30 years after his departure from the band.\nIn August 2023, media outlets reported, based on an advertisement in a local UK newspaper, that a new Stones album might be released in September 2023. The \"Hackney Gazette\" advertisement made reference to several previous Stones hits, and linked to a fictitious diamond jeweller called \"Hackney Diamonds\", whose website privacy policy is that of Universal Music Group; the band's logo was used to dot the letter \"i\" in \"diamonds\". On 29 August, the band confirmed association with the website through posts on its social media profiles. Because of the advertisement, it was suspected that the album might be called \"Hackney Diamonds\". Elton John, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney, among others, were expected to guest on the new album (and they all did).\nOn 6 September 2023, Jagger, Richards and Wood appeared in a live Q&amp;A with Jimmy Fallon to announce that \"Hackney Diamonds\" would be released on 20 October 2023. The album features the final two songs Charlie Watts recorded with the band prior to his death, and it also features former longtime bassist Bill Wyman on one of the album's tracks, marking only his second studio recording with the band since 1991's \"Flashpoint\" album. \"Angry\", the album's first single and music video (starring actress Sydney Sweeney), was also released during the Q&amp;A, with the song also landing on the \"EA Sports FC 24\" soundtrack. Jagger speculated that the band's follow-up to \"Hackney Diamonds\" was 75% done by the time that album was released. Ten months later, Jagger stated that it is likely the band would release new music \"soon\".\nThe subsequent Hackney Diamonds Tour took place from 28 April 2024 to 21 July 2024 and was generally well received, with the \"Los Angeles Times\" calling the band \"still as dangerous and vital as ever\" with other papers sharing the sentiment, including the \"Vancouver Sun\" and \"The New York Times\". The band expressed interest that June in continuing the tour in 2025, telling Reuters \"We'll consider those offers, where we're going to go and where it will be fun, you know?...It could be Europe, could be South America, could be anywhere.\" Wood confirmed in a May 2025 interview with the \"Times\" that the band is still planning a new album.\nMusical development.\nThe Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&amp;B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music\u2014exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka\u2014as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Stones \"pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock &amp; roll that came to define hard rock\" with a \"strong yet subtly swinging rhythm\" provided by Wyman and Watts.\nJagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, \"He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair, stating in 2003, \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.\" Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&amp;B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard\u00a0... the most expressive\". He also recalled, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters\u2014and there were a lot of us\u2014in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very\u00a0... heartwarming\".\nDespite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&amp;B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, \"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)\", as a \"pop rock ballad\u00a0... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers\". \"As Tears Go By\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.\nRichards said of their early writing experiences, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try\u00a0...'\" Jagger opined, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order\u00a0... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\"\nThe writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.\nBeginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" responsible for part of their sound\u2014the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's. Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on \"Beggars Banquet\" are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On \"Exile on Main St.\", Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.\nRichards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Brown Sugar\" (\"Sticky Fingers\", 1971), \"Tumbling Dice\" (capo IV), \"Happy\" (capo IV), (\"Exile on Main St.\", 1972), and \"Start Me Up\" (\"Tattoo You\", 1981).\nThe feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as \"World War III\". Of making albums with the Stones, Richards referred to it in 2023 as \"controlled madness. Mick is the controller and I'm the madness.\"\nMusical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded \"by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions\". Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the \"Telegraph\", \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.\nStephen Hyden writes:The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the '60s and '70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When arena-rock reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with Led Zeppelin; when David Bowie and glam became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978's \"Some Girls\", the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City's punk and disco scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band's career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., \"Miss You.\"\nLegacy.\nSince their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones have survived multiple feuds. They have released 31 studio albums, 13 live albums, 28 official compilation albums and many recognised bootleg recordings, all of which comprise more than 340 songs. According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time. Their top single is \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", regarded by many at the time as \"the classic example of rock and roll\". The Stones contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own \"codewords\" and slang, such as \"losing streak\" for menstrual period, which they have used throughout their catalogue of songs.\nThey pioneered the \"raw, blues-based sound\" that came to define hard rock and has been viewed as the musical \"vanguard of a major transfusion\" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in Britain and the rest of the world. Muddy Waters was quoted as saying that the Rolling Stones and other English bands piqued the interest of American youth in blues musicians. After they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums\u2014and those of other blues musicians\u2014increased public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music.\nThe Stones were supporters of the civil rights movement, having a clause in period contracts stating that they would not perform in segregated venues. Breach of this clause would fine the promoter \u00a330,100 and allow the band to walk away. Their support of civil rights causes has continued to the current era.\nIn 1981, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that the Stones \"are the great rock &amp; roll rhythm section of our time\" and are \"special primarily because they understand that a great rock &amp; roll band never takes too much for granted.\" In 2010, they ranked fourth on the magazine's list of the Greatest Artists of All Time. Steven Van Zandt wrote: The Rolling Stones are my life. If it wasn't for them, I would have been a Soprano for real. I first saw the Stones on TV, on The Hollywood Palace in 1964. In '64, the Beatles were perfect: the hair, the harmonies, the suits. They bowed together. Their music was extraordinarily sophisticated. The whole thing was exciting and alien but very distant in its perfection. The Stones were alien and exciting, too. But with the Stones, the message was, \"Maybe you can do this.\" The hair was sloppier. The harmonies were a bit off. And I don't remember them smiling at all. They had the R&amp;B traditionalist's attitude: \"We are not in show business. We are not pop music.\" And the sex in Mick Jagger's voice was adult. This wasn't pop sex \u2013 holding hands, playing spin the bottle. This was the real thing. Jagger had that conversational quality that came from R&amp;B singers and bluesmen, that sort of half-singing, not quite holding notes. The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock &amp; roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird \u2013 even Bob Dylan.\n\"The Telegraph\" has called Mick Jagger \"the Rolling Stone who changed music\". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the \"whole business model of popular music\". The only artists to top the UK Album Charts in six different decades, they are tied with Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams for the second most number\u00a01 albums on the Official UK Chart, surpassed only by the Beatles.\nIn 2002, CNN called the Stones \"far and away the most successful act in rock today\", adding, \"since 1989 alone, the band has generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenues. That total includes sales of records, song rights, merchandising, sponsorship money, and touring. The Stones have made more money than U2, or Springsteen, or Michael Jackson, or Britney Spears, or the Who\u2014or whoever. Sure, Mick attended the London School of Economics, but his greatest talent, besides strutting and singing, is his ability to surround himself and the rest of the band with a group of very able executives.\" \nIn a review of the band's 2020 acoustic rendition of \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" for Global Citizen's \"One World: Together At Home\" on-line and on-screen concert, \"Billboard\" stated that they are \"still the masters of delivering unforgettable live performances.\" On their enduring appeal and reinvention, Rich Cohen of \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote in 2016:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Stones have gone through at least five stylistic iterations: cover band, '60s pop, '60s acid, '70s groove, '80s New Wave. At some point, they lost that elasticity and ability to reinvent\u2014they got old\u2014but the fact that they did it so well for so long explains their inexhaustible relevance. The Stones have lived and died and been reborn again and again. It means that, for many different generations of adults, the sound of high school was the Rolling Stones. The Stones have reinvented themselves so many times that they might as well be immortal.\nThe band have received and been nominated for multiple awards including three Grammy Awards (and 12 nominations) and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986, the Juno Award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, the Jazz FM Awards' Album of the Year (2017) for their album \"Blue &amp; Lonesome\", and \"NME\" (\"New Musical Express\") awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary \"Crossfire Hurricane\".\nOn Jagger's 75th birthday in 2018, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band. Two species, \"Petroperla mickjaggeri\" and \"Lapisperla keithrichardsi\", were placed within a new family Petroperlidae. The new family was named in honour of the Rolling Stones, derived from the Greek \"petra\" that stands for \"stone\". The scientists referred to the fossils as \"Rolling Stoneflies\". This theme was continued when NASA named a rock disturbed by the thrusters of the Mars InSight Lander \"Rolling Stones Rock\", as announced by Robert Downey Jr. during the band's 22 August 2019 performance in Pasadena, California. In 2020, a third species of Petroperlidae, \"Branchioperla ianstewarti\", was named after Ian Stewart, pianist and founding member of the band.\nIn 2019, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked the Rolling Stones second on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\", based on the band's US chart success. In 2022, the band featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail and their 60th anniversary was commemorated with a collectible coin by the Royal Mint. The band has 38 top-10 albums in the US, the most of any artist. They have sold more than 250\u00a0million albums worldwide.\nLive performances.\nSince their first concert on 12 July 1962 at the Marquee Club in London, the Rolling Stones have performed more than two thousand concerts around the world and have gone on over 48 tours of varying length, including three of the highest-grossing tours of all time: Bridges to Babylon, Voodoo Lounge, and A Bigger Bang.\nFrom small clubs and hotels in London with little room for Jagger to move around to selling out stadiums worldwide, Rolling Stones tours have changed significantly over the decades. The Stones' early setups were simple compared to what they became later in the band's career, when elaborate stage designs, pyrotechnics, and giant screens were used. By the time the Stones toured America in 1969, they began to fill large halls and arenas, such as The Forum in Inglewood, California. They were also using more equipment, including lighting rigs and better sound equipment, than they had used in clubs.\nThe 1969 tour is considered a \"great watershed tour\" by Mick Jagger because they \"started hanging the sound and therefore hanging the lights\". Attributing the birth of arena rock to the Stones 1969 US tour, \"The Guardian\" ranked it 19 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history. Before this tour the loudest sound at large-capacity shows was often the crowd, so the Stones used lighting and sound systems that ensured they could be seen and heard in the biggest arenas. \"The Guardian\" commented that their \"combination of front-of-house excellence and behind-the-scenes savvy took the business of touring to an entirely new level.\" During the 1972 tour, the Stones developed a complex light show that included giant mirrors that bounced the light off them.\nDuring the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows became an industry for the band, and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher. The props the band used on stage increased in both size and sophistication, similar to those on Broadway. They started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show. On this tour they had two versions of what Jagger referred to as the \"lotus stage\". One version had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain, and the other had leaves that began in a folded up position and opened during the beginning of the concert. This period also included a variety of props, including inflatable penises and other gimmicks, and incorporated a number of circus tricks.\nDuring the 1981\u20131982 American tour, the Stones worked with Japanese designer Kazuhide Yamazari in constructing their stages for stadium-sized locations and audiences. During this period, stages increased in size to include runways and movable sections of the stage going out into the audience. This tour used coloured panels and was one of the last Stones tours to do so before switching to devices such as video screens. Stadium shows provided a new challenge for the band.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When you're out there in this vast stadium, you have to physically tiny up on stage, so that's why on the 1981-2 tour we had those coloured panels and later we started using devices like video screens. We became very aware of not being seen, of just being there like ants. Mick is the one who \"really\" has to project himself over the footlights. And when the show gets that big, you need a little extra help, you need a couple of gimmicks, as we call it, in the show. You need fireworks, you need lights, you need a bit of theatre.\u2014\u200a\nOver time, their props and stage equipment have become increasingly sophisticated. When the Stones began to fill stadium-sized venues, or larger, they ran into the problem of the audience no longer being able to see them. This was particularly the case when they performed a free concert for an estimated 1.5\u00a0million people in Rio de Janeiro on the \"A Bigger Bang\" tour in 2006. The show required over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost in length. Due to the length of the beach on which the Stones performed, sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern down the length of the beach, to keep the sound in sync with the music from the stage; for every of beach, the sound would be delayed by an additional second.\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nFormer members\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31058", "revid": "41183179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31058", "title": "Tipu Sultan", "text": "Sultan of Mysore from 1782 to 1799\nTipu Sultan (, , \"Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu\"; 1 December 1751\u00a0\u2013 4 May 1799), commonly referred to as Sher-e-Mysore (Tiger of Mysore), was the Sultan of Mysore from 1782 until his death in 1799. He was a pioneer of rocket artillery. He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual \"Fathul Mujahidin\". The economy of Mysore reached a zenith during his reign. He deployed rockets against advances of British forces and their allies during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, including the Battle of Pollilur and Siege of Srirangapatna.\nTipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali used their French-trained army in alliance with the French in their struggle with the British, and in Mysore's struggles with other surrounding powers: against the Marathas, Sira, and rulers of Malabar, Kodagu, Bednore, Carnatic, and Travancore. Tipu became the ruler of Mysore upon his father's death from cancer in 1782 during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. He negotiated with the British in 1784 with the Treaty of Mangalore which ended the war in status quo ante bellum.\nTipu's conflicts with his neighbours included the Maratha\u2013Mysore War, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Gajendragad.\nTipu remained an enemy of the British East India Company. He initiated an attack on British-allied Travancore in 1789. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War, he was forced into the Treaty of Seringapatam, losing a number of previously conquered territories, including Malabar and Mangalore. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, a combined force of British East India Company troops supported by the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated Tipu. He was killed on 4 May 1799 while defending his stronghold of Seringapatam.\nTipu also introduced administrative innovations during his rule, including a new coinage system and calendar, and a new land revenue system, which initiated the growth of the Mysore silk industry. He is known for his patronage to Channapatna toys.\nEarly years.\nChildhood.\nTipu Sultan was born in Devanahalli, in present-day Bangalore Rural district, about north of Bangalore on 1 December 1751. He was named \"Tipu Sultan\" after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia of Arcot. Being illiterate, Hyder was very particular in giving his eldest son a religious education and a very early exposure to military and political affairs. At age of 17 onwards Tipu was given charge of diplomatic and military missions and supported his father Hyder in his wars.\nTipu's father, Hyder Ali, was a military officer in service to the Kingdom of Mysore who had become the \"de facto\" ruler of Mysore in 1761 while his mother Fatima Fakhr-un-Nisa was the daughter of Mir Muin-ud-Din, the governor of the fort of Kadapa. Hyder Ali appointed able teachers to give Tipu an early education in subjects like Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kannada, Beary, Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, riding, shooting and fencing.\nLanguage.\nTipu Sultan's mother tongue was Urdu. The French noted that \"Their language is Moorish[Urdu] but they also speak Persian.\" \"Moors\" at the time was a European designation for Urdu: \"I have a deep knowledge [\"je poss\u00e8de \u00e0 fond\"] of the common tongue of India, called \"Moors\" by the English, and \"Ourdouzebain\" by the natives of the land.\"\nReligion \nTipu hailed from a religious family and used to perform his 5 daily prayers, he was also peer o murshid of popular saint Bande Nawaz also known as gesu daraz, prayers and celebration of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha were performed in kingdom along with celebration of Mawlid, Ashura and Urs of sufi saints \nTipu was also secular to allow and celebrate other religion festivals as well.\nEarly military service.\nEarly Conflicts.\nTipu Sultan was instructed in military tactics by French officers in the employment of his father. At age 15, he accompanied his father against the British in the First Mysore War in 1766. He commanded a corps of cavalry in the invasion of Carnatic in 1767 at age 16. He also took part in the First Anglo-Maratha War of 1775\u20131779.\nAlexander Beatson, who published a volume on the Fourth Mysore War entitled \"View of the Origin and Conduct of the War with Tippoo Sultaun\", described Tipu Sultan as follows: \"His stature was about five feet eight inches; he had a short neck, square shoulders, and was rather corpulent: his limbs were small, particularly his feet and hands; he had large full eyes, small arched eyebrows, and an aquiline nose; his complexion was fair, and the general expression of his countenance, not void of dignity\".\nSecond Anglo-Mysore War.\n In 1779, the British captured the French-controlled port of Mah\u00e9 which Tipu had placed under his protection, providing some troops for its defence. In response, Hyder launched an invasion of the Carnatic, with the aim of driving the British out of Madras. During this campaign in September 1780, Tipu Sultan was dispatched by Hyder Ali with 10,000 men and 18 guns to intercept Colonel William Baillie who was on his way to join Sir Hector Munro. In the Battle of Pollilur, Tipu defeated Baillie. Out of 360 Europeans, about 200 were captured alive, and the sepoys, who were about 3800 men, suffered very high casualties. Munro was moving south with a separate force to join Baillie, but on hearing the news of the defeat he retreated to Madras, abandoning his artillery in a water tank at Kanchipuram.\nTipu Sultan defeated Colonel Braithwaite at Annagudi near Tanjore on 18 February 1782. Braithwaite's forces, consisting of 100 Europeans, 300 cavalry, 1400 sepoys and 10 field pieces, was the standard size of the colonial armies. Tipu Sultan seized all guns and took the detachment prisoner. In December 1781 Tipu Sultan seized Chittur from the British. Tipu Sultan had gained sufficient military experience by the time Hyder Ali died on Friday, 6 December 1782. Some historians put Hyder Ali's death at 2 or 3 days later or before due to the Hijri date being 1 Muharram, 1197 as per some records in Persian (which can result in a difference of 1 to 3 days due to the Lunar Calendar). He became the ruler of Mysore on Sunday, 22 December 1782 (the inscriptions in some of Tipu's regalia show it as 20 Muharram, 1197 Hijri Sunday) in a simple coronation ceremony.\nHe subsequently worked on to check the advances of the British by making alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The Second Mysore War came to an end with the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore.\nRuler of Mysore.\nOn 29 December 1782, Tipu Sultan crowned himself \"Badshah\" or Emperor of Mysore with the title Nawab Tipu Sultan Bahadur at age 32, and struck coinage.\nConflicts with Maratha Confederacy.\nThe Maratha Empire under its new Peshwa Madhavrao I regained most of Indian subcontinent, twice defeating Tipu's father in 1764 and then in 1767. In 1767 Maratha Peshwa Madhavrao defeated both Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan and entered Srirangapatna, the capital of Mysore. Hyder Ali accepted the authority of Madhavrao who gave him the title of Nawab of Mysore.\nSubsequently, to escape the treaty, Tipu tried to take some Maratha forts in Southern India captured by in the previous war and also stopped the tribute to Marathas which was promised by Hyder Ali. This brought Tipu in direct conflict with the Marathas, leading to Maratha\u2013Mysore War\nConflicts between Mysore (under Tipu) and Marathas:\nConflict ended with Treaty of Gajendragad in March 1787, as per which Tipu returned all the territory captured by Hyder Ali to Maratha Empire. Tipu would release Kalopant and return Adoni, Kittur, and Nargund to their previous rulers. Badami would be ceded to the Marathas and Tipu would also pay an annual tribute totaling 12 lakhs for an agreed period of 4 years to the Marathas. In return, Tipu Sultan would get all the region that he had captured during the war. This included Gajendragarh and Dharwar. The Marathas in return agreed to recognize his authority and to address Tipu sultan as \"Nabob Tipu Sultan Futteh Ally Khan\". However the Marathas ultimately reneged on the treaty and in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War the Marathas presented their support to the British East India Company which helped the British to take over Mysore in 1799.\nThe Invasion of Malabar (1766\u20131790).\nIn 1766 when he was 15 years old Tipu accompanied his father on an invasion of Malabar. After the incident- Siege of Tellicherry in Thalassery in North Malabar, Hyder Ali started losing his territories in Malabar. Tipu came from Mysore to reinstate the authority over Malabar. After the Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789\u201390), due to the monsoon flood, the stiff resistance of the Travancore forces and news about the attack of British in Srirangapatnam he went back.\nThird Anglo-Mysore War.\nIn 1789, Tipu Sultan disputed the acquisition by Dharma Raja of Travancore of two Dutch-held fortresses in Cochin. In December 1789 he massed troops at Coimbatore, and on 28 December made an attack on the lines of Travancore, knowing that Travancore was (according to the Treaty of Mangalore) an ally of the British East India Company. On account of the staunch resistance by the Travancore army, Tipu was unable to break through the Tranvancore lines and the Maharajah of Travancore appealed to the East India Company for help. In response, Lord Cornwallis mobilised company and British military forces, and formed alliances with the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad to oppose Tipu. In 1790 the company forces advanced, taking control of much of the Coimbatore district. Tipu counter-attacked, regaining much of the territory, although the British continued to hold Coimbatore itself. He then descended into the Carnatic, eventually reaching Pondicherry, where he attempted without success to draw the French into the conflict.\nIn 1791 his opponents advanced on all fronts, with the main British force under Cornwallis taking Bangalore and threatening Srirangapatna. Tipu harassed the British supply and communication and embarked on a \"scorched earth\" policy of denying local resources to the British. In this last effort he was successful, as the lack of provisions forced Cornwallis to withdraw to Bangalore rather than attempt a siege of Srirangapatna. Following the withdrawal, Tipu sent forces to Coimbatore, which they retook after a lengthy siege.\nThe 1792 campaign was a failure for Tipu. The allied army was well-supplied, and Tipu was unable to prevent the junction of forces from Bangalore and Bombay before Srirangapatna. After about two weeks of siege, Tipu opened negotiations for terms of surrender. In the ensuing treaty, he was forced to cede half his territories to the allies, and deliver two of his sons as hostages until he paid in full three crores and thirty lakhs rupees fixed as war indemnity to the British for the campaign against him. He paid the amount in two instalments and got back his sons from Madras.\nNapoleon's attempt at a junction.\nIn 1794, with the support of French Republican officers, Tipu allegedly helped found the Jacobin Club of Mysore for 'framing laws comfortable with the laws of the Republic'. He planted a Liberty Tree and declared himself Citizen Tipoo. In a 2005 paper, historian Jean Boutier argued that the club's existence, and Tipu's involvement in it, was fabricated by the East India Company in order to justify British military intervention against Tipu.\nOne of the motivations of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was to establish a junction with India against the British. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tippoo Sahib. Napoleon assured the French Directory that \"as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions.\" According to a 13 February 1798 report by Talleyrand: \"Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send a force of 15,000 men from Suez to India, to join the forces of Tipu-Sahib and drive away the English.\" Napoleon was unsuccessful in this strategy, losing the Siege of Acre in 1799 and at the Battle of Abukir in 1801.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatcentre\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:centre; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nDeath.\nHoratio Nelson defeated Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers at the Battle of the Nile in Egypt in 1798. Three armies marched into Mysore in 1799\u2014one from Bombay and two British, one of which included Arthur Wellesley. They besieged the capital Srirangapatna in the Fourth Mysore War. There were more than 60,000 soldiers of the British East India Company, approximately 4,000 Europeans and the rest Indians; while Tipu Sultan's forces numbered only around 30,000. The betrayal by Tipu Sultan's ministers in working with the British and weakening the walls to make an easy path for the British. The death of Tipu Sultan led British General Harris to exclaim \"Now India is ours.\"\nWhen the British broke through the city walls, French military advisers told Tipu Sultan to escape via secret passages and to fight the rest of the wars from other forts, but he refused. Tipu famously said \"Better to live one day as a tiger than a thousand years as a sheep\".\nTipu Sultan was killed at the Hoally (Diddy) Gateway, which was located from the N.E. Angle of the Srirangapatna Fort. He was buried the next afternoon at the Gumaz, next to the grave of his father. Many members of the British East India Company believed that Nawab of Carnatic Umdat Ul-Umra secretly provided assistance to Tipu Sultan during the war and sought his deposition after 1799. These five men include Mir Sadiq, Purnaiya, two military commanders Saiyed Saheb and Qamaruddin, and Mir Nadim, commandant of the fort of Seringapatam. The episode of treachery as narrated by Hasan starts with the disobedience of Tipu's instructions. When he died there were jubilant celebrations in Britain, with authors, playwrights and painters creating works to celebrate it. The death of Tipu Sultan was celebrated with declaration of public holiday in Britain.\nAdministration.\nTipu introduced a new calendar, new coinage, and seven new government departments, during his reign, and made military innovations in the use of rocketry.\nMysorean rockets.\nDr APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, in his Tipu Sultan Shaheed Memorial Lecture in Bangalore (30 November 1991), called Tipu Sultan the innovator of the world's first war rocket. Two of these rockets, captured by the British at Srirangapatna, were displayed in the Royal Artillery Museum in London. According to historian Dr Dulari Qureshi Tipu Sultan was a fierce warrior king and was so quick in his movement that it seemed to the enemy that he was fighting on many fronts at the same time. Tipu managed to subdue all the petty kingdoms in the south. He was also one of the few Indian rulers to have defeated British armies.\nTipu Sultan's father had expanded on Mysore's use of rocketry, making critical innovations in the rockets themselves and the military logistics of their use. He deployed as many as 1,200 specialised troops in his army to operate rocket launchers. These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. The rockets had twin side sharpened blades mounted on them, and when fired \"en masse\", spun and wreaked significant damage against a large army. Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder's death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time. The rockets deployed by Tipu during the Battle of Pollilur were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2\u00a0km range).\nBritish accounts describe the use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars. During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. After Tipu's defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets. These became influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.\nNavy.\nIn 1786 Tipu Sultan, again following the lead of his father, decided to build a navy consisting of 20 battleships of 72 cannons and 20 frigates of 65 cannons. In the year 1790 he appointed Kamaluddin as his \"Mir Bahar\" and established massive dockyards at Jamalabad and Majidabad. Tipu Sultan's board of admiralty consisted of 11 commanders in service of a \"Mir Yam\". A \"Mir Yam\" led 30 admirals and each one of them had two ships. Tipu Sultan ordered that the ships have copper-bottoms, an idea that increased the longevity of the ships and was introduced to Tipu by Admiral Suffren.\nArmy.\nDue to their perpetual battle engagements, Haidar and Tipu required a disciplined standing army. Thus, Rajputs, Muslims and able tribal men were enrolled for full time service replacing the local militia called the \"Kandachar\" force of agricultural origin which existed in the Mysore army earlier. The removal of the Vokkaligas from the local militia which had taken part in wars for centuries and the imposition of higher taxes on them in place of their quit rent led indirectly to the implementation of Ryotwari system. Now the Ryots could not rely upon slaves for their agricultural activities since their slaves were enrolled in the army in some places. Besides paying higher taxes they had to endure the additional responsibility of feeding the slaves and financing their marriages. This led to the weakening of the system of slavery in Mysore.\nEconomy.\nThe peak of Mysore's economic power was under Tipu Sultan in the late 18th century. Along with his father Hyder Ali, he embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under his reign, Mysore overtook Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with highly productive agriculture and textile manufacturing. Mysore's average income was five times higher than subsistence level at the time.\nTipu Sultan laid the foundation for the construction of the Kannambadi dam (present-day Krishna Raja Sagara or KRS dam) on the Kaveri river, as attested by an extant stone plaque bearing his name, but was unable to begin the construction. The dam was later built and opened in 1938. It is a major source of drinking water for the people of Mysore and Bangalore.\nThe Mysore silk industry was first initiated during the reign of Tipu Sultan. He sent an expert to Bengal Subah to study silk cultivation and processing, after which Mysore began developing polyvoltine silk.\nThe greater prominence of the Channapatna toys can be traced to patronage from Tipu Sultan, the historic ruler of Mysore, though these toys existed before this period historically given as gifts as part of Dusshera celebrations. It is known that he was an ardent admirer of arts, and in particular of woodwork.\nRoad development.\nTipu Sultan was considered as pioneer of road construction, especially in Malabar, as part of his campaigns, he connected most of the cities by roads.\nForeign relations.\nBoth Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan owed nominal allegiance to the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; both were described as Nabobs by the British East India Company in all existing treaties. But unlike the Nawab of Carnatic, they did not acknowledge the overlordship of the Nizam of Hyderabad.\nImmediately after his coronation as \"Badshah\", Tipu Sultan sought the investiture of the Mughal emperor. He earned the title \"Nasib-ud-Daula\" with the heavy heart of those loyal to Shah Alam II. Tipu was a selfdeclared \"Sultan\" this fact drew towards him the hostility of Nizam Ali Khan, the Nizam of Hyderabad, who clearly expressed his hostility by dissuading the Mughal emperor and laying claims on Mysore. Disheartened, Tipu Sultan began to establish contacts with other Muslim rulers of that period.\nTipu Sultan was the master of his own diplomacy with foreign nations, in his quest to rid India of the East India Company and to ensure the international strength of France. Like his father before him he fought battles on behalf of foreign nations which were not in the best interests of Shah Alam II.\nAfter Ghulam Qadir had Shah Alam II blinded on 10 August 1788, Tipu Sultan is believed to have broken into tears.\nAfter the Fall of Seringapatam in 1799, the blind emperor did remorse for Tipu, but maintained his confidence in the Nizam of Hyderabad, who had now made peace with the British.\nAfter facing substantial threats from the Marathas, Tipu Sultan began to correspond with Zaman Shah Durrani, the ruler of the Afghan Durrani Empire, so they could defeat the British and Marathas. Initially, Zaman Shah agreed to help Tipu, but the Persian attack on Afghanistan's Western border diverted its forces, and hence no help could be provided to Tipu.\nIn 1787, Tipu Sultan sent an embassy to the Ottoman capital Constantinople, to the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid I requesting urgent assistance against the British East India Company. Tipu Sultan requested the Ottoman Sultan to send him troops and military experts. Furthermore, Tipu Sultan also requested permission from the Ottomans to contribute to the maintenance of the Islamic shrines in Mecca, Medina, Najaf and Karbala.\nHowever, the Ottomans were themselves in crisis and still recuperating from the devastating Austro-Ottoman War and a new conflict with the Russian Empire had begun, for which Ottoman Turkey needed British alliance to keep off the Russians, hence it could not risk being hostile to the British in the Indian theatre.\nDue to the Ottoman inability to organise a fleet in the Indian Ocean, Tipu Sultan's ambassadors returned home only with gifts from their Ottoman brothers.\nNevertheless, Tipu Sultan's correspondence with the Ottoman Empire and particularly its new Sultan Selim III continued till his final battle in the year 1799.\nLike his father before him, Tipu Sultan maintained friendly relations with Mohammad Ali Khan, ruler of the Zand dynasty in Persia. Tipu Sultan also maintained correspondence with Hamad bin Said, the ruler of the Sultanate of Oman.\nTipu's and Mysore's tryst with silk began in the early 1780s when he received an ambassador from the Qing dynasty-ruled China at his court. The ambassador presented him with a silk cloth. Tipu was said to be enchanted by the item to such an extent that he resolved to introduce its production in his kingdom. He sent a return journey to China, which returned after twelve years.\nBoth Hyder Ali and Tipu sought an alliance with the French, the only European power still strong enough to challenge the British East India Company in the subcontinent. In 1782, Louis XVI concluded an alliance with the Peshwa Madhu Rao Narayan. This treaty enabled Bussy to move his troops to the Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the same year, French Admiral De Suffren ceremonially presented a portrait of Louis XVI to Haidar Ali and sought his alliance.\nNapoleon conquered Egypt in an attempt to link with Tipu Sultan. In February 1798, Napoleon wrote a letter to Tipu Sultan appreciating his efforts of resisting the British annexation and plans, but this letter never reached Tipu and was seized by a British spy in Muscat. The idea of a possible Tipu-Napoleon alliance alarmed the British Governor, General Sir Richard Wellesley (also known as Lord Wellesley), so much that he immediately started large scale preparations for a final battle against Tipu Sultan.\nSocial system.\nJudicial system.\nTipu Sultan appointed judges from both communities for Hindu and Muslim subjects. Qadi for Muslims and Pandit for Hindus in each province. Upper courts also had similar systems.\nMoral Administration.\nUsage of liquor and prostitution were strictly prohibited in his administration. Usage and agriculture of psychedelics, such as Cannabis, was also prohibited.\nPolyandry in Kerala was prohibited by Tipu Sultan. He passed a decree for all women to cover their breasts, which was not practised in Kerala in the previous era.\nReligious policy.\nOn a personal level, Tipu was a devout Muslim, saying his prayers daily and paying special attention to mosques in the area. Regular endowments were made during this period to about 156 Hindu temples, including the famed Ranganathaswami Temple at Srirangapatna. Many sources mention the appointment of Hindu officers in Tipu's administration and his land grants and endowments to Hindu temples, which are cited as evidence for his religious tolerance.\nHis religious legacy has become a source of considerable controversy in India, with some groups (including Christians and even Muslims) proclaiming him a great warrior for the faith or \"Ghazi\" for both religious and political reasons. Various sources describe the massacres, imprisonment and forced conversion of Hindus (Kodavas of Coorg, Nairs of Malabar) and Christians (Catholics of Mangalore), the destruction of churches and temples, and the clamping down on Muslims (Mappila of Kerala, the Mahdavia Muslims, the rulers of Savanur and the people of Hyderabad State), which are sometimes cited as evidence for his intolerance.\nBritish accounts.\nHistorians such as Brittlebank, Hasan, Chetty, Habib, and Saletare, amongst others, argue that controversial stories of Tipu Sultan's religious persecution of Hindus and Christians are largely derived from the work of early British authors (who were very much against Tipu Sultan's independence and harboured prejudice against the Sultan) such as James Kirkpatrick and Mark Wilks, whom they do not consider to be entirely reliable and likely fabricated. A. S. Chetty argues that Wilks' account in particular cannot be trusted.\nIrfan Habib and Mohibbul Hasan argue that these early British authors had a strong vested interest in presenting Tipu Sultan as a tyrant from whom the British had liberated Mysore. This assessment is echoed by Brittlebank in her recent work where she writes that Wilks and Kirkpatrick must be used with particular care as both authors had taken part in the wars against Tipu Sultan and were closely connected to the administrations of Lord Cornwallis and Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley.\nRelations with Hindus.\nTipu Sultan's treasurer was Krishna Rao, Shamaiya Iyengar was his Minister of Post and Police, his brother Ranga Iyengar was also an officer, and Purnaiya held the very important post of \"Mir Asaf\". Moolchand and Sujan Rai were his chief agents at the Mughal court, and his chief \"Peshkar\", Suba Rao, was also a Hindu.\nThe Editor of Mysore Gazette reports of correspondence between his court and temples, and his having donated jewellery and deeded land grants to several temples, which he was compelled to for forming alliances with Hindu rulers. Between 1782 and 1799 Tipu Sultan issued 34 \"Sanads\" (deeds) of endowment to temples in his domain, while also presenting many of them with gifts of silver and gold plate.\nThe Srikanteswara Temple in Nanjangud still possesses a jeweled cup presented by the Sultan. He also gave a greenish linga; to Ranganatha temple at Srirangapatna, he donated seven silver cups and a silver camphor burner. This temple was hardly a stone's throw from his palace from where he would listen with equal respect to the ringing of temple bells and the muezzin's call from the mosque; to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale he gifted four cups, a plate and Spitoon in silver.\nDuring the Maratha\u2013Mysore War in 1791, a group of Maratha horsemen under Raghunath Rao Patwardhan raided the temple and \"matha\" of Sringeri \"Shankaracharya\". They wounded and killed many people, including Brahmins, plundered the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrated the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sarada.\nThe incumbent \"Shankaracharya\" petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. About 30 letters written in Kannada, which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the Sringeri Shankaracharya, were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in Mysore. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:\n\"People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: \"Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate\" (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).\" \nHe immediately ordered the Asaf of Bednur to supply the Swami with 200 \"rahati\"s (\"fanam\"s) in cash and other gifts and articles. Tipu Sultan's interest in the Sringeri temple continued for many years, and he was still writing to the Swami in the 1790s.\nIn light of this and other events, historian Irfan Habib has described Tipu Sultan as a defender of the Hindu dharma, who also patronised other temples including one at Melkote, for which he issued a Kannada decree that the Shrivaishnava invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form. The temple at Melkote still has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale. Tipu Sultan does seem to have repossessed unauthorised grants of land made to Brahmins and temples, but those which had proper \"sanads\" (certificates) were not. It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\nPersecution of Hindus in Melkote.\nTipu killed 1200+ Iyengar Brahmins in Melkote, as part of his military campaign against the Wodeyars of Mysore and the Marathas. The Hindu Iyengar Brahmins, who were closely associated with the Sri Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple in Melkote, were targeted during this attack.\nThe town of Melkote in Karnataka has stopped celebrating Deepavali as a mark of mourning for the massacre of Hindu Iyengar Brahmins carried out by Tipu Sultan's forces.\nPersecution of Kodavas outside Mysore.\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the \"Nawab of Kurnool\", to launch a surprise attack upon the Kodavas who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains. Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.\nMohibbul Hasan, Prof. Sheikh Ali, and other historians cast great doubt on the scale of the deportations and forced conversions in Coorg in particular. Hassan says that it is difficult to estimate the real number of Kodava captured by Tipu.\nIn a letter to Runmust Khan, Tipu himself stated: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We proceeded with the utmost speed, and, at once, made prisoners of 40,000 occasion-seeking and sedition-exciting Kodavas, who alarmed at the approach of our victorious army, had slunk into woods, and concealed themselves in lofty mountains, inaccessible even to birds. Then carrying them away from their native country (the native place of sedition) we raised them to the honour of Islam, and incorporated them into our Ahmedy corps.\"\nThe coinage system.\nThe coinage of Tipu Sultan is one of the most complex and fascinating series struck in India during the 18th century. Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became Mysore since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant pagoda), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These pagoda were always in the South Indian style until the reign of Haidar Ali (1761\u20131782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue pagodas, mohurs and rupees, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large paisa was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new Persian names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\nCopper: Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa (Persian for the pole star) \u2013 Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) \u2013 Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet Mars) \u2013 Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet Venus) \u2013 either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa (the third caliph of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet Jupiter).\nSilver: Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee (Khizr the prophet) \u2013 Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for Musa, the seventh Shi'ite Imam) \u2013 Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee (Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shi'ite Imam) \u2013 B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee (Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam) \u2013 Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee (Ali Zain al-'Abidin, the fourth Imam) \u2013 Imami for the rupee (reference to the 12 Shi'ite Imams) \u2013 Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for Ali b. Abi Talib, who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\nGold: Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda (Umar al-Faruq, the second caliph) \u2013 Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda (Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, the first caliph) \u2013 Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the mohur, with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\nCoinage dating system.\nThe denomination does not appear on the Hijri dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the Hijri dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the solar year and the birth year of Muhammad (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") \u2013 Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"eternity \", year 2) \u2013 Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) \u2013 Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of Aquarius, year 4) \u2013 Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) \u2013 S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) \u2013 Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"mirage \", for year 7) \u2013 Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) \u2013 Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) \u2013 sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"dawn \", year 10) \u2013 S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).\nAssessment and legacy.\nIndia\nThe original copy of the Constitution of India bears a painting of Tipu Sultan. School and college textbooks in India officially recognize him as a \"freedom-fighter\" along with many other rulers of the 18th century who fought European powers. \nAssessments of Tipu Sultan have often been passionate and divided. Successive Indian National Congress governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the Bharatiya Janata Party has been largely critical. \nIn 2017 the 14th Indian president Ram Nath Kovind hailed Tipu Sultan in his address to the Karnataka Assembly on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the state secretariat Vidhana Soudha saying \"Tipu Sultan died a heroic death fighting the British. He was also a pioneer in the development and use of Mysore rockets in warfare. This technology was later adopted by the Europeans.\"\nTipu Sultan has been admired by another Indian freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, the former President Ram Nath Kovind, former President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and former President K. R. Narayanan. \nOn 21 October 1943, Subhas Chandra Bose proclaimed the Provisional Government of Azad Hind (Free India), and the proclamation highlighted the \"Warriors\" Tipu and his father Hyder Ali for their names are \"forever engraved in letters of gold.\"\nPakistan\nIn Pakistan, Tipu Sultan is a household name and symbolises courage and bravery. There is a ship (guided missile destroyer) of Pakistan Navy that is named after him and is called PNS Tippu Sultan (D-185).\nTipu Sultan is also admired as a hero in Pakistan. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that he admires Tipu Sultan as a freedom fighter. He has admired Tipu on multiple occasions. \nFormer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said, \"It is distressing to learn that some people believe that Tipu Sultan was anti-Hindu.\" Her father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was also an admirer of Tipu and in his library, he had kept Tipu Sultan's letters.\nIn 2025, in the Parliament of Pakistan, Minister Shahid Ahmed Khattak, quoted Tipu Sultan in his criticism of the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\nAbroad\nIn his sermon on 4 July 1800, John Russell, a Baptist minister in Providence, told his congregation of Tipu\u2019s death at the hands of British soldiers: \u2018here the full heart must have vent\u2026 [Tipu Sultan] defended his power with a spirit which showed he deserved it. His death was worthy of a king.\u2019\nArt, media and culture\nTipu also patronised art forms such as Ganjifa cards, effectively saving this art form. Ganjifa card of Mysore have the GI Tag today.\nSeveral TV series on Tipu Sultan have been released in India and Pakistan, such as:\nSword and tiger.\nTipu Sultan had lost his sword in a war with the Nairs of Travancore during the Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789), in which he was forced to withdraw due to the severe joint attack from the Travancore army and British army. The Nair army under the leadership of Raja Kesavadas again defeated the army of Tipu near Aluva. The Maharaja, Dharma Raja, gave the famous sword to the Nawab of Arcot, from whom the sword was taken as a war trophy by the British after annexing Arcot and sent to London. The sword was on display at the Wallace Collection, No. 1 Manchester Square, London.\nTipu was commonly known as the Tiger of Mysore and adopted this animal as the symbol (\"bubri/babri\") of his rule. It is said that Tipu Sultan was hunting in the forest with a French friend. They came face to face with a tiger there. The tiger first pounced on the French soldier and killed him. Tipu's gun did not work, and his dagger fell on the ground as the tiger jumped on him. He reached for the dagger, picked it up, and killed the tiger with it. That earned him the name \"the Tiger of Mysore\". He even had French engineers build a mechanical tiger for his palace. The device, known as Tipu's Tiger, is on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Not only did Tipu place relics of tigers around his palace and domain, but also had the emblem of a tiger on his banners and some arms and weapons. Sometimes this tiger was very ornate and had inscriptions within the drawing, alluding to Tipu's faith \u2013 Islam. Historian Alexander Beatson reported that \"in his palace was found a great variety of curious swords, daggers, fusils, pistols, and blunderbusses; some were of exquisite workmanship, mounted with gold, or silver, and beautifully inlaid and ornamented with tigers' heads and stripes, or with Persian and Arabic verses\".\nThe last sword used by Tipu in his last battle, at Sri Rangapatnam, and the ring worn by him were taken by the British forces as war trophies. They are kept on display at the British Museum London as gifts to the museum from Maj-Gen Augustus W.H. Meyrick and Nancy Dowager. At an auction in London in April 2004, Vijay Mallya purchased a sword of Tipu Sultan and some other historical artefacts, and brought them back to India.\nIn October 2013, another sword owned by Tipu Sultan and decorated with his \"babri\" (tiger stripe motif) surfaced and was auctioned by Sotheby's. It was purchased for \u00a398,500 by a telephone bidder.\nTipu Sultan Jayanti.\nIn 2015, the Government of Karnataka, under the leadership of then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah from the Congress party, began to celebrate Tipu's birth anniversary as the \"Tipu Sultan Jayanti\". The Congress regime declared it as an annual event to be celebrated on 20 November. It was officially celebrated in Karnataka initially by the Minority Welfare department, and later by the Kannada &amp; Culture department. However, on 29 July 2019, the next Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa, who belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ordered the celebrations cancelled, saying: \"Legislators from Kodagu had highlighted incidents of violence during Tipu Jayanti.\"\nObjecting against the cancellation of the celebrations, the previous Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said: \"BJP has cancelled it because of their hatred towards minorities. It's a big crime. He [Tipu] was a king of Mysore and fought against the British [as] a freedom fighter. It was during his time when the foundation was laid for the Krishna Raja Sagara dam. He also tried to improve industry, agriculture and trade\". The previous year, not a single JD(S) leader, including the then chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, attended the event, turning it into a fiasco.\nThe Lok Sabha Congress leader, Mallikarjun Kharge, also earlier criticized BJP and RSS for their opposition against holding the celebrations, and asked: \"When RSS can celebrate Nathuram Godse, can't we celebrate Tipu Sultan?\"\nFamily.\nTipu had several wives. His first wife was Sultan Begum Sahib also known as Padishah Begum. She was the daughter of Imam Sahib Bakhshi Naita from Arcot, and sister of Ghulam Husain Khan, known as the Pondicherry Nawab, a descendant of Chanda Sahib. They married in 1774. Another wife married at the same time was Ruqaya Banu Begum. She was the daughter of Lala Miyan Shaheed Charkoli, and the sister of Sheikh Burhanuddin. She died in February 1792 at the time of the siege of Seringapatam. Another wife was Khadija Zaman Begum. She was the daughter of Mir Sayyid Moinuddin Khan also known as Sayyid Sahib. They married in 1796. She died in childbirth in 1797. Another wife was Buranti Begum. She was the daughter of Mir Muhammad Pasand Beg, a nobleman from Delhi and her mother's father was Sayyid Muhammad Khan, once a \"subedar\" of Kashmir. Another wife was Roshani Begum. She was the mother of his eldest son Fath Haider.\nHis sons were Hyder Ali Khan Sultan,\nMuin-ud-din Sultan, Abdul Khaliq Sultan, Muiz-ud-din Sultan, Muhammad Subhan Sultan, Shukrullah Sultan, Ghulam Ahmad Sultan, Ghulam Muhammad Sultan, Sarwar-ud-din Sultan, Muhammad Yasin Sultan, Jamal-ud-din Sultan and Munir-ud-din Sultan. One of his daughters was married to Husain Ali Khan.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31062", "revid": "892079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31062", "title": "Telnet", "text": "Network protocol for virtual terminals\nTelnet (sometimes stylized TELNET) is a client-server application protocol that provides access to virtual terminals of remote systems on local area networks or the Internet. It is a protocol for bidirectional 8-bit communications. Its main goal was to connect terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes.\nThe name \"Telnet\" refers to two things: a protocol itself specifying how two parties are to communicate and a software application that implements the protocol as a service. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet transmits all information including usernames and passwords in plaintext so it is not recommended for security-sensitive applications such as remote management of routers. Telnet's use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of SSH. Some extensions to Telnet which would provide encryption have been proposed.\nDescription.\nThe telnet protocol is a client-server protocol that runs on a reliable connection-oriented transport. Most often, a telnet client connects over TCP to port 23 or 2323, where a Telnet server application is listening. The Telnet protocol abstracts any terminal as a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT). The client must simulate a NVT using the NVT codes when messaging the server.\nTelnet predated UDP/IP and originally ran over Network Control Protocol (NCP). The telnet service is best understood in the context of a user with a simple terminal using the local Telnet program (known as the client program) to run a logon session on a remote computer where the user's communications needs are handled by a Telnet server program.\nTelnet service.\nA Telnet service is an application providing services over the Telnet protocol. Most operating systems provide a service that can be installed or enabled to provide Telnet services to clients.\nName.\nWhile the official specification stylizes the name as TELNET, it is not defined therein as an acronym or abbreviation.\nIn a 1972 paper, when discussing one of the early forms of the protocol, Stephen Crocker et al. used \"TELNET\" explicitly as an abbreviation of \"telecommunications network.\"\nIn his 2015 book \"WHOIS Running the Internet: Protocol, Policy, and Privacy\", Internet researcher Garth O. Bruen claims that Telnet was originally short for \"Teletype Over Network Protocol.\"\nHistory.\nTelnet was originally developed for ARPANET in 1969. Initially, it was an ad hoc protocol with no formal specification, but after extensive work in the 1970s, including numerous RFCs, it was officially formalized in and , which together form internet standard 8.\nSince then, many additional RFCs have updated or extended the Telnet specification, both to address issues in the original standard and to add new capabilities. Some of these extensions have also been adopted as Internet standards, particularly standards 27 through 32 (see below).\nSecurity vulnerabilities.\nTelnet is vulnerable to network-based cyberattacks, such as packet sniffing sensitive information including passwords and fingerprinting.\nTelnet services can also be exploited to leak information about the server (such as hostnames, IP addresses and brand) by packet sniffing the banner. This information can then be searched to determine if a Telnet service accepts a connection without authentication. Telnet is also frequently exploited by malware due to being improperly configured. In fact, Telnet is targeted by attackers more frequently than other common protocols, especially when compared to UPnP, CoAP, MQTT, AMQP and XMPP . Common devices targeted are Internet of things devices, routers and modems.\nThe SANS Institute recommends that the use of Telnet for remote logins should be discontinued under normal circumstances for the following reasons:\nExtensions to Telnet provide Transport Layer Security (TLS) security and Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) authentication that address the above concerns. However, most Telnet implementations do not support these extensions; and they do not address other vulnerabilities such as parsing the banner information. Telnet over VPN is a viable option if SSHv2 is not supported, or a VPN is already used to securely tunnel other application data to the remote network the Telnet server is present in. However, precautions must be taken: ideally the VPN should terminate on the Telnet server itself, unless the LAN has additional security measures against eavesdropping and modification by other devices such as additional encryption and/or VLANs. This is because Telnet traffic leaves the VPN server in its insecure plaintext form after it is decrypted. The VPN software should be a trusted one that is heavily audited (e.g. OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec), using preferably certificate-based/public key mutual authentication.\nIBM 5250 or 3270 workstation emulation is supported via custom telnet clients, TN5250/TN3270, and IBM i systems. Clients and servers designed to pass IBM 5250 data streams over Telnet generally do support SSL encryption, as SSH does not include 5250 emulation. Under IBM i (also known as OS/400), port 992 is the default port for TelnetS (Telnet over SSL/TLS).\nUses.\nHistorical uses.\nHistorically, Telnet provided access to a command-line interface on a remote host. However, because of serious security concerns when using Telnet over an open network such as the Internet, its use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of SSH. The usage of Telnet for remote management has declined rapidly, especially on the public Internet, in favor of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SSH provides much of the functionality of telnet, with the addition of strong encryption to prevent sensitive data such as passwords from being intercepted, and public key authentication, to ensure that the remote computer is actually who it claims to be.\nModern day uses.\nThe Telnet protocol is mainly used for legacy equipment that does not support more modern communication mechanisms. For example, a large number of industrial and scientific devices only have Telnet available as a communication option. Some are built with only a standard RS-232 port and use a serial server hardware appliance to provide the translation between the TCP/Telnet data and the RS-232 serial data. In such cases, SSH is not an option unless the interface appliance can be configured for SSH (or is replaced with one supporting SSH).\nTelnet is commonly used by amateur radio operators for providing public information.\nDespite recommendations against it, security researchers estimated that 7,096,465 exposed systems on the Internet continue to use Telnet as of 2021. However, estimates of this number have varied significantly, depending on the number of ports scanned beyond the default TCP port 23.\nThe Telnet client may be used in debugging network services such as SMTP, IRC, or HTTP servers, to issue commands to the server and examine the responses. In this case, when the Telnet client establishes a TCP connection to a port other than the standard Telnet server port, it does not use the Telnet protocol, and can be used instead to send and receive data over the TCP connection directly.\nTechnical details.\nThe technical details of Telnet are defined by a variety of specifications including .\nTelnet commands.\nTelnet commands consist of at least two bytes. The first byte is the IAC escape character (byte 255) followed by the byte code for a given command:\nInterpret As Command.\nAll data octets except 0xff are transmitted over Telnet as is.\nTelnet options.\nTelnet also has a variety of options that terminals implementing Telnet should support.\nIn popular culture.\n\"\" from 1977 has been recreated as a text art movie served through Telnet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
