{"id": "36119", "revid": "15130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36119", "title": "1346", "text": "Calendar year\nYear 1346 (MCCCXLVI) was a common year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. It was a year in the 14th century, in the midst of a period known in European history as the Late Middle Ages. In Asia that year, the Black Death came to the troops of the Golden Horde Khanate; the disease also affected the Genoese Europeans they were attacking, before spreading to the rest of Europe. In Central and East Asia, there was a series of revolts after Kazan Khan was killed in an uprising, and the Chagatai Khanate began to splinter and fall; several revolts in China began what would eventually lead to the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty. The Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara won several victories over Muslim conquerors in the north in this year as well.\nIn Eastern Europe, Stefan Du\u0161an was proclaimed Tsar of Serbia on April 16 (Easter Sunday) at Skopje. In the nearby Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman emir Orhan married Byzantine princess Theodora as part of an alliance between her father John VI Kantakouzenos and the Ottomans. Ongoing civil wars in both Bulgaria and Byzantium continued. Denmark sold its portion of Northern Estonia to the Livonian Order of the Teutonic Knights after finally quelling the St. George's Night Uprising. In Central Europe, Charles IV of Luxembourg was elected Roman King on July 11. A number of banking families in Italy, including the Bardi family, faced bankruptcy in this year, and much of Italy suffered a famine. The Hundred Years' War between the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of England continued in Western Europe, as Edward III of England led an invasion onto the continent and won a number of victories.\nEvents.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nAsia.\nWestern Asia.\nThe Golden Horde's siege of Kaffa continued through 1346, despite a number of obstacles. They were struck with the Black Plague and forced to retreat, although not until the following year. As one Russian historian records:\nIn the same year [1346], God's punishment struck the people in the eastern lands, in the town Ornach, and in Khastorokan, and in Sarai, and in Bezdezh, and in other towns in those lands; the mortality was great among the Bessermens, and among the Tartars, and among the Armenians and the Abkhazians, and among the Jews, and among the European foreigners, and among the Circassians, and among all who lived there, so that they could not bury them.\nThe many areas and peoples listed here represent much of Western Asia and the Caucasus. The \"European foreigners\" are those fighting with the Tartars in the Mongol-led siege of Kaffa. These Europeans would return to Europe the following year, carrying the plague with them. Travellers returning from the Crimea also carried the plague to Byzantium and Arabia, according to Greek and Arab scholars of the time.\nAnother account of the events in the Crimea reads: \nIt seemed to the besieged Christians as if arrows were shot out of the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, followed by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.\nModern scholars consider this one of the earliest, and most deadly, biological attacks in world history, though in the end the Mongols were forced to retreat. Early sources state that the plague began its spread in the spring of 1346 at the River Don near the Black Sea, then spread throughout Russia, the Caucasus, and the Genovese provinces within the year.\nFurther south in Georgia, King George the Brilliant died and was succeeded by King David IX. King George V had managed to increase the Georgian realm to all of Transcaucasia. However, after 1346 the Kingdom began to decline, caused by George's death and the devastating spread of the plague throughout the area soon afterwards.\nCentral and East Asia.\nCentral Asia was marked in 1346 by the continued disintegration of the Mongol's domains, as well as by Muslim expansion. Kazan Khan, emperor of the Chagatai Khanate, was killed by the forces of Qazaghan in this year, putting an end to the Chagtai Khanate's status as a unified empire. Qazghan was the leader of the group of Turkish nobles opposed to Mongol rule. Qazghan had been wounded by Kazan's forces earlier in the year, but rather than taking advantage of his opponent's weakness, Kazan retreated and many of his troops abandoned him. \nTo the east, Kashmir was conquered by Shah Mir, the first Muslim to rule the area. Kathmandu was also conquered in this year. However, Muslim expansion did suffer some defeats in southern India. The Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagara in India conquered the Hoysalas and celebrated its \"festival of victory\", strengthening their status as a legitimate Hindu empire in opposition to Muslim rule in the north. The Delhi Sultanate in Northern India, Muhammad bin Tughluq, had a particular disdain for Hinduism, and the Deccan culture of the south. Telugu chieftains gathered in opposition to the Sultan in this year and celebrated victory.\nFurther east, Ibn Battuta traveled from Southeast Asia to Khanbaliq (Beijing) in China. Although the Muslim leaders there extended him a warm welcome, they advised him to leave the city soon. A civil war had caused the Khan to flee the city, and riots were becoming more and more widespread. Meanwhile, T'aigo Wangsa, a Korean Buddhist monk, traveled to China to receive training under the guidance of Buddhist leader Shih-wu. T'aigo later founded the T'aigo sect of Korean Buddhism.\nEurope.\nScandinavia.\nIn 1346 Denmark sold Northern Estonia (Danish Estonia) to the Teutonic Knights following the end of an uprising and conflict between the pro-Danish party (bishop Olaf of Lindanise) and the pro-German party (captain Marquard Breide), called the St. George's Night Uprising. The Danish dominions in were sold for 10,000 marks to the Livonian Order, ignoring the promise by Christopher II in 1329 never to abandon or sell its Estonian territories. The King of Denmark even made a public statement \"repenting\" for that broken promise, and asked forgiveness from the pope.\nBalkans and Asia Minor.\nIn the Balkans, on April 16 (Easter Sunday), Stefan Du\u0161an was crowned in Skopje as Tsar of the new Serbian Empire, which now occupied much of southeastern Europe. Also in 1346, both Bulgaria and Byzantium (which at this time covered most of Greece) were in the middle of a series of civil wars. At the same time, the Christian-held islands and possessions around the Aegean Sea were subject to Turkish raids.\nOrhan, the Ottoman Turkish prince of Bithynia was married to Theodora, daughter of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. The Greek clergy believed that the marriage of a Christian princess and a prominent Muslim would increase the region's power. Orhan already had several other wives, and although Theodora was permitted to keep her religion, she was required to spend the rest of her life in an Islamic harem. Kantakouzenos hoped that Orhan would become his ally in any future wars, but Orhan, like his fellow Turks, became his enemy in the Genoese war. As part of the alliance, the Ottoman prince was permitted to sell the Christians he had captured at Constantinople as slaves in the public market.\nCentral.\nOn July 11, Charles IV of Luxembourg was elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In consequence of an alliance between his father and Pope Clement VI, the relentless enemy of the emperor Louis IV, Charles was chosen Roman king in opposition to Louis by some of the princes at Rhens. He had previously promised to be subservient to Clement, he confirmed the papacy in the possession of wide territories, promised to annul the acts of Louis against Clement, to take no part in Italian affairs, and to defend and protect the church.\nCharles IV was at this time in a very weak position in Germany. Owing to the terms of his election, he was derisively referred to by some as a \"priest's king\" (Pfaffenk\u00f6nig). Many bishops and nearly all of the Imperial cities remained loyal to Louis the Bavarian. Charles further endangered his high position when he backed the losing side in the Hundred Years' War. He lost his father and many of his best knights at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in August 1346. He himself was wounded on the same field.\nMeanwhile, in Italy a number of banks in Florence collapsed due to internal problems in Florence, contributed by King Edward III of England defaulting on some of his loans. Most notably, the Bardi family went bankrupt in this year. Italy also suffered a famine, making it difficult for the Papacy to recruit troops for the attack on Smyrna. The Venetians, however, organized an alliance uniting several European parties (\"Sancta Unio\"), composed notably of the Knights Hospitaller, which carried out five consecutive attacks on \u0130zmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. In the realm of technology, papermaking reached Holland, and firearms made their way to Northern Germany in this year. The earliest records in the area place them in the city of Aachen.\nWestern Europe.\nOn July 11, King Edward III crossed the English Channel and arrived in Normandy the following day with 1,600 ships. He took the ports of La Hogue and Barfleur with overwhelming force and continued inland towards Caen, taking towns along the way. The French mounted a defence at Caen, but were ultimately defeated. The French had been planning to cross the channel and invade England with a force of about 14,000 led by Jean le Franc, but Edward's attack forced them onto the defensive.\nThe French king, Philippe VI, destroyed several bridges to prevent Edward's advance, but the English took the town of Poissy in August and repaired its bridge in order to advance. The French king mounted a defence near the forest at Cr\u00e9cy, which ended in another English victory. Edward then proceeded to Calais, laying siege to the city from September 4. Meanwhile, Jean de France, King Philippe's son, besieged the city of Aigullon, but with no success. Philippe also urged the Scots to continue the fight against England to the north. The Scots, believing that the English were preoccupied with Calais, marched into England toward Durham in October, but were met and defeated by an English force of knights and clergymen at the Battle of Neville's Cross, and King David of Scotland was captured. The Irish also mounted a brief resistance, but were similarly defeated. Before the end of the year, Edward also captured Poitiers and the towns surrounding Tonnay-Charente.\nFor his role in the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, Edward, the Black Prince, Philippe VI honoured the bravery of John I, Count of Luxemburg and King of Bohemia (also known as John the Blind) by adopting his arms and motto: \"Ich Dien\" or \"I Serve\". John's decades of fighting had already made his name widely known throughout Europe, and his heroic death at Cr\u00e9cy became the subject of legend, recorded by writers such as Froissart.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Kashmir conflict also saw a period of escalation, and the Second Intifada continued in Israel and Palestine. The global economy recovered from the early 2000s recession, especially in China, Japan, and the United States, and Argentina recovered from its years-long economic crisis. A conference of World Trade Organization members caused diplomatic conflict between developing and developed nations, with the former creating their own trade bloc, the G20 developing nations. The Catholic Church celebrated the 25th anniversary of the election of Pope John Paul II, while disputes about gay rights emerged within several Christian denominations in 2003. The Islamic world faced crisis as the war on terror and Islamic terrorism prompted religious leaders to define Islam's identity. Elsewhere in the world, ten nations were approved for membership to the European Union, North Korea restarted its nuclear weapons program, and several political leaders were convicted in the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and for the former Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Court also began operation in 2003.\nThe 110th element of the periodic table was officially named darmstadtium (Ds) in 2003. The Human Genome Project announced that it had finished mapping the human genome, while controversies regarding human cloning and genetically modified crops caused political turmoil around the scientific community. A new dinosaur, \"Rajasaurus narmadensis\", was described. Space travel was affected by the explosion of the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" that killed seven astronauts, while a close approach from Mars allowed several landers and rovers to be launched toward the planet. Consumers saw the launch of the iTunes Store and the publication of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", while products like camera phones, 64-bit computers, LCD television, and broadband internet achieved widespread popularity. Email spam became a growing problem in 2003, leading to legislation in several countries.\nThe year 2003 tied with 2002 as the second-hottest year on record. SARS became an epidemic for several months in 2003, centered in Guangdong and Hong Kong, while concerns about polio and measles outbreaks in West Africa and Uganda, respectively, led to massive child vaccination drives that saw entire populations inoculated. The city of Bam, Iran, was almost entirely destroyed in 2003 following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPopulation.\nThe world population on January 1, 2003, was estimated to be 6.272\u00a0billion people and increased to 6.353\u00a0billion people by January 1, 2004. An estimated 134.0\u00a0million births and 52.5\u00a0million deaths took place in 2003. The average global life expectancy was 67.1 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2002. There were approximately 10.6\u00a0million global refugees at the beginning of 2003, and the number was reduced to 9.7\u00a0million refugees by the end of the year. Afghanistan was the largest source of refugees, with a total of 2.1\u00a0million at the end of the year.\nConflicts.\nThere were 29 armed conflicts with at least 25 fatalities in 2003.625 The deadliest conflicts were the invasion of Iraq, the Kashmir insurgency, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the War in Darfur.627\nThe European Union engaged in its first military operation when it sent peacekeepers to Macedonia and its first operation outside of Europe when it sent 1,500 soldiers to enforce a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo until operations were taken over by the UN mission MONUSCO. NATO launched its first operation outside of Europe or North America when it took command of the International Security Assistance Force in the fight against the Taliban insurgency. ECOWAS peacekeepers and American marines were deployed to Liberia when civil war resumed in August, until the United Nations Mission in Liberia took over operations in September.251\nInternal conflicts.\nMultiple civil wars were ongoing in Africa. The First Ivorian Civil War was halted in 2003 amid a ceasefire while France and the states of ECOWAS intervened. Peace talks fell apart on March 7 until the ceasefire was restored on May 3, only to be broken again on September 23. The war was left in a frozen state at the end of 2003 with rebels controlling parts of the country. The Second Liberian Civil War against Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy escalated when the Movement for Democracy in Liberia split off as its own faction.116 President Charles Taylor resigned on August 2, allowing a peace agreement to take place on August 18.118 The Second Sudanese Civil War escalated as new militant groups joined the conflict,628 though a security agreement was reached between the National Islamic Front and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement on September 25.119\nThe Indonesian insurgency in Aceh escalated when a demilitarization agreement failed and the government renewed its offensive in May.126 Indonesia declared martial law and launched an attack against the Free Aceh Movement, killing at least 1,100 and capturing another 2,000 out of the movement's total 5,000 members.250 The Moro conflict in the Philippines deescalated when the Philippine government agreed to peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in July, though conflicts with other groups continued.129 A truce between Nepal and Maoist rebels held until conflict resumed in August. Australia deployed 2,000 soldiers to the Solomon Islands in July as a response to internal unrest.250 The Sri Lankan civil war continued in 2003 as peace talks failed, and long-running civil wars in Burundi and in Uganda both escalated. Agreements was reached in the second Second Congo War for rebels and foreign soldiers to end hostilities.101629\nThe Colombian conflict against two Marxist militant groups\u2014the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army\u2014escalated in 2003.101 The government negotiated an agreement for the right-wing militant group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia to disband as a means to deescalate the conflict.102 The Second Chechen War continued in Russia: the Russian government held a referendum for a new Chechen constitution and offered amnesty for Chechen rebels, but terror attacks continued.125\nInternational conflicts.\nA coalition of countries led by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia led an invasion of Iraq beginning on March 20, warning that Iraq had been operating a program to develop weapons of mass destruction. The subsequent Iraq War became the most publicized conflict in 2003. The coalition quickly defeated the Iraqi Armed Forces, and American president George W. Bush gave a speech on May 1 declaring victory in the war.2 The subsequent Iraqi insurgency proved more deadly than the invasion by the end of the year.3 The most significant insurgency action was a bombing on August 19 that targeted United Nations personnel in Baghdad, killing UN Special Representative S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello among many others.209 Doubts were raised throughout the year whether Iraq had been developing the weapons of which it was accused.3 The Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan slowed until a bombing in Mumbai killed 52 people.250 A ceasefire took effect on November 23.95\nThe Second Intifada continued into 2003 as conflict between Israel and Palestine killed 400 people in suicide bombings by Palestinians and military strikes by the Israel Defense Forces.104 Israel constructed the West Bank barrier, which it described as a measure to prevent suicide bombings and Palestine described as a measure to impose segregation.76 Israel also launched bombings against Lebanon and Syria following attacks in Israel.250 Al-Qaeda remained active in the Middle East, launching suicide bombings in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, as well as Morocco in North Africa. On September 10, its leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri released their first video statement since 2001, celebrating the September 11 attacks. Al-Qaeda figures Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Riduan Isamuddin were captured in March and August, respectively.74\nCulture.\nArt and architecture.\nThe most widely publicized art exhibition in 2003 was the 50th Venice Biennale,157 while the most heavily attended exhibitions were for Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Struth, both held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where they attracted thousands of visitors each day.525 The \"Rembrandt's Journey\" collected various Rembrandt works, including etchings and drawings, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.159 The \"7000 Years of Persian Art\" tour took place as a rare international collaboration from the National Museum of Iran.525 Street photography made a return in the art community, and the International Center of Photography held an exhibition on the subject.160 Elsewhere in the art world, \"Descent into Limbo\" by Andrea Mantegna was the most prominent Old Master artwork to be sold in 2003, going for US$28.6 million526 and the government of the Netherlands began returning items from its collection of works it acquired from Nazi Germany, the Nederlands Kunstbezit-collectie.526 Economic hardship and geopolitical events prompted a global shift toward affordable popular fashion, including a surge of face masks with fake brand logos that became popular in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic.200\nPlans to replace the World Trade Center remained a focus of the architecture world in 2003, with architects David Childs and Daniel Libeskind placed in charge of the project. Other developments in architecture included an inquiry into the ongoing construction of the Scottish Parliament Building when its expected cost increased tenfold,527 and concern that Athens would not be ready to host the 2004 Summer Olympics when construction of the Olympic Stadium of Athens slowed.528 New buildings that opened in 2003 included the Silodam housing complex in Amsterdam,154 the Albertina art museum in Vienna after a previous closure, the Asian Civilisations Museum in Singapore,525 and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles after sixteen years of development.153 The Gherkin finished construction in London,154 and the Amber Room of Catherine Palace, which existed from 1717 to 1945, finished reconstruction.525\nMuseums and libraries were looted and burned during riots in Baghdad following the invasion of Iraq.2212 About 10,000 items were taken from the Iraq Museum, though many were returned by the end of the year, and several items were taken from the Mosul Museum. The Iraq National Library and Archive was burned down, destroying 500,000 books and 12 million Ottoman documents. The lost treasure of Tillya Tepe was found to be in Saddam Hussein's possession.524\nMedia.\nThe highest-grossing films globally in 2003 were \", \"Finding Nemo\", and \"The Matrix Reloaded\", while the highest-grossing non-English film was \"Bayside Shakedown 2\" (Japanese), the 39th highest-grossing film of the year. Critically acclaimed films included \"Finding Nemo\", \"Lost in Translation\", and .\nMusic sales in 2003 amounted to about 2.7 billion units, a decline of 6.5% from 2002. DVD music video thrived in 2003 at the expense of singles and cassettes. CD sales overall saw a large decline in favor of internet downloads.162 Globally, the best-selling albums of the year were \"Come Away with Me\" by Norah Jones, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin\"' by 50 Cent, and \"Meteora\" by Linkin Park. No non-English albums were among the global top fifty albums sold in 2003. The opera industry was negatively affected by a decline in tourism and other economic factors in Europe and North America, and many productions were canceled.505\nThe popularity of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise meant that the publication of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" was the largest literary event in 2003, bringing significant growth to the publishing and bookseller industries.529 The \"Daily Sun\" launched and became an immediate success in South Africa as a newspaper targeted toward black audiences as recovery from Apartheid continued.243 Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori began a radio show, \"The Chino's Hour\", from exile in Japan.242 The television programs \"Queer Eye\" and \"Saudi Women Speak Out\" provided unprecedented media outlets for American gay men and Saudi women, respectively. Also successful in 2003 was the Taiwanese soap opera \"Liow sing hua yen\". The GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox remained the most popular video game consoles, although the GameCube faced poor sales. Nokia introduced the N-Gage, which functioned as both a phone and a handheld game console.168 Through the internet, flash mobs developed as a social trend in 2003.168\nWhen decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing replaced the centralized platform Napster as a means to pirate music, the Recording Industry Association of America began directing legal action against individual users who uploaded pirated songs rather than the platforms themselves, filing a total of 382 lawsuits.483 The iTunes Store launched on April 28 and was immediately successful, selling over 10 million songs over the next four months.87 This was touted as a possible solution to music piracy.483\nSports.\nThe England national rugby union team won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, making them the first Northern Hemisphere team to do so.534 Australia won the 2003 Cricket World Cup, coming out victorious in every match they played, while Kenya had upset victories that took them to the semi-finals.535 In tennis, players Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, and Juan Carlos Ferrero won their first Grand Slams in 2003,538 while Martina Navratilova tied with the record of twenty Wimbledon titles set by Billie Jean King.539 Lennox Lewis successfully defended his status as the heavyweight boxing champion against Vitali Klitschko.540\nIn football, the transfer of footballer David Beckham from Manchester United F.C. to Real Madrid CF for \u00a317.25 million was widely publicized. The UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying took place in 2003, where Turkey's defeat in a game against Latvia came as an upset after Turkey had been semi-finalists in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.533 The 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in the United States after being moved from China due to a SARS outbreak; Germany won their first title after they defeated Sweden.307 Other major sporting upsets took place in golf when Ben Curtis defeated some of the sport's top players in his first major competition at the 2003 Open Championship,539 and in Major League Baseball when the Florida Marlins defeated the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series.541\nThe 2003 World Championships in Athletics saw Hicham El Guerrouj become the fourth man to win four successive world track titles and Carolina Kl\u00fcft become the first woman in seven years to score more than 7,000 points in the heptathlon. Athletics was plagued with the discovery of THG steroids, which the United States accused the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative of providing to athletes.537 Michael Schumacher remained the dominant driver in the 2003 Formula One World Championship, winning 11 of 17 races and claiming his sixth championship.539 Lance Armstrong won the 2003 Tour de France, giving him his fifth victory.540\nEconomy.\nThe global economy was weak in the first half of 2003 as uncertainty arose from Middle Eastern conflict, the spread of SARS, and major corporate scandals of the previous year.9 It improved in the second half of 2003 with recovery from the early 2000s recession, remedied by low interest rates and expansionary fiscal policy. The gross world product increased in total by 2.5% in 2003, and international trade increased by 4.75%. The United States led the recovery, while China and Japan also made significant contributions. The economic situation improved in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe saw slower recovery. The Eurozone had a low GDP growth of 0.5%.12 Questions arose around the Eurozone as the British economy fared better than those which had adopted the euro, and a referendum in Sweden showed strong opposition to the euro's adoption.351 Developing countries did especially well with a growth rate of 5%, compared to the 1.8% growth in developed countries.173 Argentina emerged from its economic crisis after four years, reaching the year's highest GDP in the Western Hemisphere with 7% growth.11\nThe invasion of Iraq caused markets to fluctuate, first through a significant increase and then a decline as the war's financial cost became apparent and the 2003 Istanbul bombings shocked the economy.177 Petroleum prices fell after the invasion of Iraq concluded and rose again following an announcement that OPEC would reduce its output.182 The prices of non-fuel commodities, such as metal, minerals, and agricultural materials, increased during the year. Gold, copper, nickel, and aluminum all saw increases in value.182 The airline industry began a slow recovery from the serious decline it faced after the September 11 attacks.182 Foreign direct investment became a global economic priority when it began to falter, with 70 countries implementing at least one new law in attempts to improve the situation.173 In the corporate world, the Italian food company Parmalat and the Dutch supermarket company Ahold were the subjects of major corporate scandals.12 These were the latest among a series of corporate corruption scandals over the previous years that led the United States and a coalition of European countries to reform their policies on the matter.15\nPotential mergers and acquisitions in the media industry were a topic of discussion in 2003. Protestors in the United States objected to loosening of Federal Communications Commission regulations around television station ownership, causing the US Congress and the courts to overrule the changes. American company Liberty Media acquired UnitedGlobalCom and purchased shares in QVC to reach 98% ownership.239 HKATV CEO Chan Wing-kee purchased shares in HKATV in Hong Kong so that he had half ownership, while Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing purchased 64% of China Entertainment Television.240 A merger between TCL Electronics and Thomson created the world's largest television set manufacturer.241 The largest purchase of the newspaper industry in 2003 occurred when John Fairfax Holdings of Australia acquired Independent Newspapers of New Zealand, while a merger also took place between Denmark's two largest newspapers, Jyllands-Posten and Politiken.243\nEnvironment and weather.\nThe year 2003 tied with 2002 as the second hottest year on record, behind only 1998. The year began during an El Ni\u00f1o period that continued until April. A major heatwave occurred in Europe during the summer, causing approximately 70,000 deaths, 14,000 of which were in France. Severe cold weather affected Asia, North America, and Peru. Low precipitation caused droughts in Australia, the United States, and Zimbabwe, but the previous year's droughts in Asia were alleviated by heavy precipitation in the region. Several reports were published in 2003 forecasting severe negative effects of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change determined that approximately one million species risked extinction if no preventative measures were implemented, and the World Wide Fund for Nature determined that the fresh water access of 7 billion people would be at risk by 2050 because of global warming and other causes.485 Reports also warned about the potential destruction of the Amazon rainforest and provided evidence that widespread destruction of coral was taking place.487 Several studies in 2003 indicated that climate change was causing a global increase in droughts as well as changes to the ranges and life cycles of flora and fauna.172\nMajor earthquakes in 2003 included a magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Algeria on May 21 that killed over 2,200 people and a magnitude 6.6 earthquake in Iran on December 26 that destroyed approximately 85% of Bam, Iran.170 The largest earthquake of the year was a magnitude 8.3 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido, but it did not cause significant damage.170 Major volcano eruptions included Stromboli, Italy; Reventador, Ecuador; Soufri\u00e8re Hills, Montserrat; Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, Guatemala; and Anatahan, Mariana Islands.171\nThe 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was above average in activity, including sixteen named storms of which seven were hurricanes. The most severe hurricanes were Hurricane Fabian, Hurricane Isabel, and Hurricane Kate. Tropical Storm Ana was the first recorded North Atlantic tropical storm to occur in April, and 2003 was the first year since 1887 to have two tropical storms occur in December. The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was slightly more intense than average, though the overall number of tropical storms was below average with 23 total storms. The most destructive typhoons were Typhoon Dujuan, which made landfall in Guangdong, China, on September 2, and Typhoon Maemi, which made landfall in South Korea on September 12.\nInternational agreements about the environment that came into force included the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on September 11, the Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants on October 23, and the Protocol on Heavy Metals on December 29.493 The capture or killing of whales and dolphins was a major topic in 2003, as was African poaching where the collection of bushmeat threatened chimpanzee and gorilla populations.196\nThe Tasman Spirit oil spill occurred in Pakistan on July 28, and cleanup of the previous year's Prestige oil spill continued throughout 2003.195 Other environmental disasters included the bursting of a pulp factory's caustic soda reservoir on March 29 in Cataguases, Brazil196 and the explosion of a wellhead in Alaska.487 The sinking of Soviet submarine K-159 caused worries about leakage of its spent nuclear fuel, but none was found.83 A study in August caused alarm when it was determined that people across 17 countries were at risk of arsenic poisoning from groundwater.196\nFive new World Heritage Sites were recognized in 2003: Purnululu National Park in Australia, Three Parallel Rivers in China, Uvs Lake Basin in Mongolia and Russia, Monte San Giorgio in Switzerland, and Phong Nha \u2013 K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng National Park in Vietnam.197 Construction began on MOSE, a set of sea gates in Venice designed to prevent the city's perpetual flooding,78 and China began use of the Three Gorges Dam along the Yangtze.488 The overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq ended his project to construct a dam that would have flooded the ruins of Assur.524\nHealth.\nThe World Health Organization adopted its first international agreement in 2003, the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.493 Member states also granted the WHO increased authority to take action in states without their approval to combat global health crises.347 Global food production increased from 2002 but fell short of the amount produced in 2001, and much of southern Africa was dependent on food aid early in the year following drought-related crop failures in 2002.146\nSARS, caused by the SARS-CoV-1 virus, became a major health concern in early 2003. China informed the WHO in February that an unknown infectious disease was spreading in the country, and the WHO issued its first global alert the following month.201 Fearing a pandemic, it issued a recommendation to avoid non-essential travel to Guangdong and Hong Kong where the largest outbreaks occurred.137 There were 8,098 cases, including 774 that ended in death, and the final case was diagnosed in June.201\nMultiple treatments for cancer were tested or approved in 2003 with varying results, including Avastin, Erbitux, Genasense, Velcade, and Letrozole.206 Several studies were published in 2003 warning of health effects for hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, causing fear around the procedure. Analysis of retroviral gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency found that its life-threatening side effects were caused by the retrovirus affecting the LMO2 gene. Study of bone marrow cells cast doubt on cellular differentiation in stem-cell therapy, moving focus toward cell fusion.\nA large spike in polio cases led the WHO to redirect its global polio immunization program to the thirteen most-affected countries.201 A breakout in West Africa led to a massive vaccination drive where hundreds of thousands of participants helped vaccinate the children of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, and Togo over three days in October.202 Following a summit on measles the same month, UNICEF and the WHO organized a measles vaccination drive in Uganda that brought the nation's child measles vaccination rate to 100% in two weeks.201 The RTS,S malaria vaccine began trials for children in Mozambique after it was shown to be safe for adults in several nations, while human trials for an Ebola vaccine began in the United States.480\nRecord numbers of HIV/AIDS cases and deaths occurred in 2003 with an estimated five million new cases and three million deaths. Although the disease grew, UNAIDS and the WHO reformed how they estimated the total cases and reduced the estimate from 42 million to 40 million.202 The AIDSVAX vaccine by VaxGen underwent two trials but was unsuccessful.203 The first fusion inhibitor treatment for AIDS, enfuvirtide, was approved in the United States in March. Evidence was presented at an International AIDS Society meeting in July that about 10% of HIV infections in Europe had acquired resistance to antiretroviral treatments.202 In response to concerns about the feasibility of treating HIV in Africa, several pharmaceutical companies reduced prices of antiretroviral drugs by up to 50% for countries in Africa and the Caribbean.203\nOther major disease outbreaks include an outbreak of mpox (then known as monkeypox) in May and June in the United States\u2014the first mpox outbreak in the Western Hemisphere\u2014with 72 reported cases,202 the spread of avian influenza to poultry in Europe with one human case in Hong Kong that proved fatal, and two instances of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows in Canada and the United States.147\nPolitics and law.\nInternational politics.\nA conference held by the World Trade Organization in September resulted in a dispute between nations that cast doubts on whether the agreements of the Doha Development Round were sustainable.14 Developing nations alleged that their input was being excluded by Western powers.147 The use of farming subsidies, particularly by Europe, Japan, and the United States, was challenged here because of their effect on developing nations. These disputes led developing nations to form their own alliance, the G21 (later the G20 developing nations).485 Several free trade areas were proposed or negotiated in 2003, including separate zones for the Andean Community, ASEAN, Central America, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Southern Cone Common Market, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation,14 and the Western Hemisphere's Free Trade Area of the Americas.147 Some of these were conditional on political reform and democratization.14 Cambodia and Nepal became the first developing countries to be approved for World Trade Organization membership through a working-party negotiation.347\nRenewed concern about nuclear weapons began when North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in January,250 and on February 6 it announced the restoration of its nuclear weapons program. Several nations engaged in tenuous negotiations with North Korea throughout the year, but no agreements were made.81 Iran announced its own program to produce enriched uranium in violation of its agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, disclosing this as an attempt to avoid sanctions.83 Libya agreed to end any plans for a nuclear weapons program as scrutiny of such programs around the world increased.6 The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty between Russia and the United States came into effect in June.248\nTen European countries signed accession agreements in April that would make them members of the European Union in May 2004.12 This included the first eight post-Soviet states to be approved for membership.350 The European Commission objected to some of the admissions, arguing that the countries had weak legal institutions and were plagued with corruption.352 The first draft of a potential Constitution of the European Union was written by former French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing and presented to the EU in June.351\nPolitical discourse around migration expanded in 2003 from a focus on irregular migration and right of asylum to a more general focus on how inflows of migrants affected trade and the workforce. Many countries expressed interest in regional agreements to manage migration and several summits were held in different parts of the world. Other developments in international politics included the seizure of the North Korean \"Pong Su\" by Australia in April after the ship smuggled heroin into the country,210 the construction of a Russian military base in Kant, Kyrgyzstan, as the Russian Federation's first foreign military base,251 and Libya's acceptance of fault in the 1988 downing of Pan Am Flight 103. In the latter case, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi offered reparations to the victims' family members, prompting the United States to petition for the removal of international sanctions against Libya 82\nDomestic politics.\nLiberian president Charles Taylor fled the country on August 1 and was replaced by Gyude Bryant, a compromise between the different factions of the Liberian Civil War, on October 14.80 Nigeria declined to extradite Taylor to Sierra Leone where he was under indictment.208 President Fradique de Menezes of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and President Kumba Ial\u00e1 of Guinea-Bissau were overthrown by military coups in July and in September, respectively, but de Menezes resumed control following negotiations.250\nPolitical controversies in 2003 included a series of protests in Hong Kong following the implementation of laws by China that limited the rights of the Hongkongers,82 the arrest of Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky on October 27 in what was seen internationally as political persecution by the government to exercise control over Russian oligarchs,82 and the arrest of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other pro-democracy activists in Myanmar on May 30.288 Serbian prime minister Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 was assassinated on March 12, prompting a crackdown on a criminal organization that supported former dictator Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, whom \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 had ousted.82 Swedish foreign minister Anna Lindh was murdered on September 10.210\nArgentina revoked amnesty for those who had people killed during the Dirty War, and a trial began for General Antonio Domingo Bussi.287 The country also attempted to extradite 40 people accused of crimes against Spanish nationals during the war, but Spain did not accept them.208 The secular Shinui party gained influence in Israel following a public debate on the role of Judaism in Israeli politics.473 Armenia abolished its death penalty so it would be in compliance with Council of Europe obligations.211\nCrime and international law.\nThe American-led invasion of Iraq dominated discourse around international law and sparked debate about when such actions are justified. Military intervention was supported by countries such as Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and much of Eastern Europe, while its strongest opponents included China, France, Germany, and Russia.491 Proponents justified the actions by invoking a right to self defense through preemptive war, the allowance of use of force in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter,207 and the past United Nations Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991) and 1441 (2002).491 The United Nations played a critical role in international discourse around the invasion as its relations with the United States were strained.346 International relations were similar troubled in Europe where British support for the war brought the UK into diplomatic conflict with much of Western Europe.351 The US was criticized for holding suspected terrorists without due process and subjecting them to torture.287 The Iraqi president Saddam Hussein went into hiding as the invasion took place, but he was discovered and arrested six months later.4 The Iraqi government was replaced by the Coalition Provisional Authority, led by the United States military.248\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) accepted two new cases in 2003: a border dispute case between Malaysia and Singapore and a dispute over the United States' application of the death penalty against Mexican nationals. The United Nations General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ regarding the construction of the West Bank barrier by Israel. A case filed by Libya against the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the 1988 downing of Pan Am Flight 103 was settled outside of court.491 The ICJ ruled in the \"Oil Platforms\" case that American force was not justified in the 1987 attacks on Iranian oil platforms but that it had not broken the 1955 treaty as Iran alleged. It rejected appeals of a 1992 border dispute between El Salvador and Honduras and a 1996 decision that the ICJ had jurisdiction in Yugoslavia at the time.492\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted major political leaders, including President of Republika Srpska Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107 and military commander Stanislav Gali\u0107.495 The Tribunal for Rwanda convicted clerics and issued the first international convictions for journalists since the Nuremberg trials.494 Terms for the creation of a Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia were agreed on in June.495 The International Criminal Court (ICC) was inaugurated in March with Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno Ocampo as its first chief prosecutor. The United States pressured dozens of nations to sign bilateral immunity agreements affirming that they would not extradite American nationals to the ICC.208 Belgium repealed its war crimes law that it had used to claim universal jurisdiction over all war crimes committed anywhere in the world.207\nThe Migrant Workers Convention came into effect on July 1. The United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, the first UN measure on the issue, came into force on September 29. The United Nations Convention Against Corruption opened for signing on December 9.493\nReligion.\nA week of celebrations were held in Vatican City for the 25th anniversary of the election of Pope John Paul II. The events included the beatification of Mother Teresa.98 John Paul II became the first pope to enter a mosque when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on May 6. The church's sexual abuse scandals continued into 2003.471 Cambodia banned Christian proselytizing in February, and Saudi Arabia banned the construction of Christian churches in March.279\nSeveral Christian denominations debated homosexuality and same-sex marriages in 2003. The Catholic Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Coptic Orthodox Church all took stances against it, while the United Church of Christ endorsed the inclusion of transgender people.278 The Anglican Communion was embroiled in debate about its stance on homosexuality when Rowan Williams was made Archbishop of Canterbury on February 27 and expressed concern that the issue was fragmenting the church. Jeffrey John was nominated as Bishop of Reading in May, but his relationship with a man caused controversy and prompted him to decline. A similar debate took place when the gay reverend Gene Robinson was made Bishop of New Hampshire on November 2.470277\nOpponents of the American-led invasion of Iraq saw it as an attack on Islam.471 Organized efforts were made by political and religious leaders in the Muslim world to differentiate typical Islam from extremism. Religious strife occurred in Saudi Arabia where Wahhabi Muslims supported stricter application of Islamic law\u2014some engaging in civil unrest and suicide bombings\u2014while other denominations spoke in favor of tolerance for minority religions and women.472 Terrorist attacks took place throughout the Middle East, including a car bombing at the Imam Ali Shrine that killed Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim, the most prominent pro-US cleric in Iraq, and at least 80 other people.278 French society and the French government, especially within the National Front, took a hostile approach toward Muslims in 2003. A proposal was made to ban religious attire in schools, while at the same time the country's first Muslim-run school was opened in Lille.473\nJudaism was marked with disputes between different sects, both in Israel and the United Kingdom. Israel debated whether Haredi Jews should be allowed to retain exemptions to certain laws.473 The British Masorti Rabbi Louis Jacobs was not permitted in an Orthodox ceremony for his granddaughter's marriage on the orders of the \"beth din\" in London, reigniting the Jacobs Affair of the 1960s.474\nHindus were allowed to enter an 11th-century memorial in Bhojshala, Madhya Pradesh, after a five-year ban against Hindus culminated in violence.279 Controversy erupted in the Hindu world after the reprint of \"Ganesa: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings\" by Paul Courtright and the publication of \"Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India\" by James Laine. Both of these books were seen as offensive by some Hindu groups, causing the writers and publishers to receive threats and harassment.474 The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall opened in London as the largest Sikh temple outside of India. In Haiti, practitioners of voodoo were given the right to register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion.279\nScience.\nThe Herto Man was dated to approximately 160,000 years ago and proposed as a human subspecies \"Homo sapiens idaltu\". The findings provided additional evidence for the theory that humans originated in Africa.149 Another set of human fossils, a set of skulls first discovered in Mexico in 1959, were dated to approximately 13,000 years ago.151 Among nonhuman fossils, the dinosaur \"Rajasaurus narmadensis\" was described, study of \"Microraptor gui\" fossils determined that it had asymmetrical feathers on its limbs that supported a theory of arboreal evolution for dinosaurs,219 \"Ginkgo biloba\" fossils from 121 million years ago closed a gap in the species' fossil record, Tetrapod fossils from the Late Devonian were discovered in China that indicated fast globalization of the clade, and fossilized spider silk was dated to at least 130 million years.220\nThe 110th element of the periodic table was officially named darmstadtium (Ds), replacing the provisional name ununnilium.270 The Human Genome Project announced in April that it had finished mapping the human genome.218 Studies in genetics produced artificial mouse eggs from stem cells, found that chimpanzees share 99.4 percent of their DNA with humans instead of the previous estimate of 95 percent,479 and determined that microRNAs are responsible for controlling shape-regulating genes in plants.217 Human cloning was a subject of international scrutiny in 2003, triggered in part by the disputed claims of the Ra\u00eblist company Clonaid that they had produced human clones. Several countries supported international bans on human cloning.478 The cloned horse Prometea was the first mammal in which its mother was also its genetic donor, while the cloned sheep Dolly died on February 21 after living for only six years, raising doubts about the viability of cloning.479 The use of genetically modified crops was also a controversial issue, particularly in the European Union where a moratorium on genetically modified food remained in effect. Many other countries expanded their production of genetically modified crops.147\nThe 2002 discovery of the James Ossuary, the suspected resting place of James, brother of Jesus, was challenged by the Israel Antiquities Authority when it accused Oded Golan of fabricating the discovery.150 A Liao dynasty coffin was opened during a live televised broadcast in Mongolia, revealing the remains of a nobleman.151 Other discoveries announced in 2003 include a religious burial site from c.\u20099000 BC in Kfar HaHoresh, a sanctuary to Zeus in the Greek city Dion, the first Pleistocene cave art to be found in Great Britain at Creswell Crags, Bronze Age weapons and jewelry in Tyrol,150 Viking treasure from c. 1020 on the Isle of Man, six 4th-century Roman shoes near Amsterdam, a Spring and Autumn period tomb in Henan, a wall of Mandan defensive fortifications at Double Ditch in North Dakota, a Mississippian building in Illinois, Olmec seals that are among the oldest New World writing, burial sites in Teotihuacan,151 a 4000-year-old gourd fragment with religious decorations,280 and the 1898 wreckage of the Portland off the coast of Massachusetts.152\nSpace exploration and astronomy.\nThe American Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" was destroyed in the atmosphere as it returned to Earth on February 1, killing all seven on board.130 The Brazilian VLS-1 launcher exploded on the launchpad on August 22, killing 21 people.276 NASA lost contact with the \"Pioneer 10\" probe (launched in 1972) and ended the mission of the \"Galileo\" probe (launched in 1989) by sending it into Jupiter's atmosphere. The \"Voyager 1\" probe became the first man-made object to reach the termination shock zone at the edge of the Solar System.477 China became the third country to launch a human into space with the \"Shenzhou 5\" mission on October 15, in which taikonaut Yang Liwei was in space for 21 hours.476\nNASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) scheduled several launches toward Mars for 2003 as the planet's orbit brought it its closest to Earth in approximately 60,000 years. NASA launched two Mars rovers, the \"Spirit\" on June 10 and the \"Opportunity\" on July 7.477 The ESA launched the \"Mars Express\" orbiter with the \"Beagle 2\" lander on June 2, but contact was lost with the \"Beagle 2\" when it was scheduled to land on December 25.476 The Mars Global Surveyor found over 500 new geographical features on Mars, including ones that provided evidence for landslides around former volcanoes, erosion that may have been caused by flowing water, and liquid iron in the planet's core.273\nThe ESA's \"Rosetta\" mission to the comet 46P/Wirtanen was scheduled for January 12 but set back a year for a safety evaluation of the Ariane 5 rocket following an incident the previous month.476 NASA launched the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (later renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope) on August 2, and the ESA launched the SMART-1 satellite on September 27 to study the Moon.477 The first results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe were published in 2003. Its measurements of cosmic background radiation indicated that the universe is 13.7 billion years old and the first stars formed 200 million years after the Big Bang.142 This provided evidence of the existence of dark matter and dark energy.477\nThe number of known moons in the solar system increased from 40 to 61 for Jupiter, from 30 to 31 for Saturn, and from 8 to 11 for Neptune. Other astronomical developments occurred when OGLE-TR-56b became the first exoplanet to be discovered through transit photometry, the exoplanet PSR B1620\u221226 b was estimated to be over 12.5 billion years old,273 and the existence of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy was proposed. The star Achernar was determined to be oblate in shape with the radius of its equator being approximately 50% larger than that of its poles.274\nTechnology.\nComputing was the subject of multiple legal and philosophical disputes in 2003. The European Commission considered legalizing software patents, triggering strong backlash.481 A dispute began between SCO Group and IBM over the open source status of UNIX, triggering a lawsuit in March. The State Council of China required that government ministries move away from software developed by Microsoft in favor of locally produced software.482 Approximately 55 percent of emails sent in 2003 were spam emails, which led to the implementation of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive in the European Union and the CAN-SPAM Act in the United States.483 The United Nations World Summit on the Information Society took place in December to organize the expansion of internet access throughout the world.484 Significant malware programs in 2003 included the SQL Slammer,484 the Blaster worm, the Welchia worm that was meant to combat the Blaster worm, and the Sobig worm, which was transmitted through email and became the world's fastest spreading virus.163\nAmong consumer products, camera phones became widespread in 2003 as millions were sold.88 Several companies invested in flatscreen and LCD television production in 2003.241 The original Volkswagen Beetle, the most widely produced car ever designed, ended production with a final run of 3,000 cars for collectors.92 Intel and AMD released 64-bit processors in 2003, popularizing what was previously a niche hardware amid the more common 32-bit systems.483 Broadband internet and cable modems gained popularity at the expense of dial-up and DSL modems. Wi-Fi hotspots became more common, and they were increasingly found in businesses for customers' use.165 Other technological milestones included the end of Concorde supersonic airliner services on October 24 after operating for 27 years,93 the installation of the first rotating underwater turbine in June to generate tidal power in the United Kingdom,488 and the testing of the Massive Ordinance Air Burst bomb by the United States Air Force as its strongest non-nuclear munition.251\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An estimated 138.5\u00a0million births and 53.3\u00a0million deaths took place in 2006. The average global life expectancy was 68.6 years, an increase of 0.5 years from 2005.\nThe estimated number of global refugees increased from 8.65\u00a0million to 9.88\u00a0million by the end of the year, marking an end to several years of declining rates. The number of refugees from Iraq increased by about 1.2\u00a0million, and the global number also increased by 464,000 after a change to how the United Nations counted refugees that resided in the United States. Afghanistan remained the largest source of refugees with 2.1\u00a0million people.\nConflicts.\nThere were 32 conflicts in 2006 that resulted in at least 25 fatalities, all of which were intrastate conflicts fought by violent non-state actors. Five resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Iraqi insurgency, Eelam War IV in Sri Lanka, the Chadian Civil War, and the Sudanese War in Darfur. Peace agreements were made with at least one faction in conflicts in Angola, Burundi, Chad, Nepal, and Sudan.\nThe 2006 Lebanon War began when Hezbollah launched an attack against Israel on July 12 and continued until August 14 when the United Nations send additional peacekeepers to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Israel also remained in conflict with Palestine as Hamas rose to power in the latter nation. The Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan intensified to its highest point since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and the National Liberation Front of Tripura escalated conflict in India after a brief period of relative peace the previous year. Two major rebel groups entered into conflicts in 2006: the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity in the Central African Bush War and the Islamic Courts Union in the Somali Civil War. The latter prompted the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia as Ethiopia sought to prevent the creation of an Islamic state in Somalia.\nCulture.\nThe highest-grossing film globally in 2006 was ', followed by \"The Da Vinci Code\" and '. Critically acclaimed films from 2006 include \"Children of Men\", \"The Departed\", \"The Lives of Others\", \"Pan's Labyrinth\", and \"United 93\".\nTotal unit sales in music increased by 19.4 percent from the previous year. The best-selling album globally in 2006 was the \"High School Musical\" soundtrack, followed by \"Me and My Gang\" by Rascal Flatts and \"Some Hearts\" by Carrie Underwood.\nCritically acclaimed video games from 2006 include \"\", \"Guitar Hero II\", and \"Wii Sports\".\nEconomy.\nThe gross world product increased by 3.8% in 2006. The largest growth took place in transition economies (7.2%) and developing countries (6.5%). International trade grew by over 10%, improving on the 7.3% growth in 2005. Unemployment rates lowered in developed countries, while transition economies and developing countries saw only minimal reduction in unemployment. Inflation occurred in many parts of the world but was mostly limited to oil prices, which rose to an all-time high before sharply declining.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The largest sources of refugees were Afghanistan with 3.1\u00a0million people and Iraq with 2.3\u00a0million people.\nConflicts.\nThere were 34 conflicts in 2007 that resulted in at least 25 fatalities. Four of these resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Iraqi insurgency, the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, Eelam War IV in Sri Lanka, and the War in Somalia. This was the first year since 1957 to have fewer than five such conflicts. Conflicts in 2007 trended toward fragmentation as insurgencies, criminal organizations, and terrorist groups engaged with each other.\nThe Iraqi insurgency against the Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq grew in 2007. Conflict rose between Sunni and Shia populations, and sectarian militias emerged. Despite making up a small portion of the insurgency, al-Qaeda in Iraq became a major perpetrator of mass-casualty attacks. The United States escalated its presence in Iraq with a surge of soldiers and the commencement of Operation Phantom Thunder to combat Al-Qaeda and other Islamist groups.\nThe Central African Bush War ended when rebels with the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity were granted amnesty, and the First Ivorian Civil War ended with the Ouagadougou Agreement that authorized the merger of the government and the Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast rebel group. Progress was made in the Juba talks that moved Uganda closer to peace with the Lord's Resistance Army, but a permanent ceasefire was not obtained. Israel and Palestine made progress toward peace during the Annapolis Conference. A peace agreement was reached with the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development rebellion in Chad, but the rebels broke the agreement a month later. The War in Darfur slowed slightly early in the year but then revived with a stronger inclination toward fragmentation and insurgent-style fighting over traditional warfare, including rebel groups that launched attacks out of neighboring Chad.\nSeveral conflicts emerged or resumed in 2007 as rebel groups and insurgencies became active. The ADC rebel group started an insurgency in northern Mali, reviving a 1990s insurgency for Tuareg separatism. Another Tuareg insurgency formed in Niger, the Niger Movement for Justice, but it did not promote the separatist beliefs of the ADC. Rebellion by Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi resumed in Pakistan, escalating after a siege on a mosque in July. Other conflicts that resumed in 2007 included the Cabinda War in Angola and the conflict with the Shining Path in Peru. Bundu dia Kongo, a Kongo separatist movement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, abandoned its mostly-peaceful approach and formally militarized.\nCulture.\nThe highest-grossing film globally in 2007 was \"\", followed by \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" and \"Spider-Man 3\".

Unemployment rates lowered throughout the world, albeit less so in Africa.\nNegotiations surrounding the Doha Development Round resumed in February, but no progress was made throughout the year. Oil prices rose as demand from developing countries exceeded the resource slack, and development of biofuel contributing to rising prices for wheat and maize.\nThe subprime mortgage crisis occurred in the United States in late 2007 as housing prices plummeted, leading to global economic downturn.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36168", "revid": "50591480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36168", "title": "3DO", "text": "Video gaming format\n3DO is a video gaming hardware format developed by The 3DO Company and conceived by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. The specifications were originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technology Group, and were licensed by third parties; most hardware were packaged as home video game consoles under the name Interactive Multiplayer, and Panasonic produced the first models in 1993 with further renditions released afterwards by manufacturers GoldStar, Sanyo, Creative Labs, and Samsung Electronics.\nCentered around a 32-bit ARM60 RISC-type processor and a custom graphics chip, the format was initially marketed as a multimedia one but this had shifted into purely video games within a year of launching. Despite having a highly promoted launch (including being named \"Time\" magazine's \"1993 Product of the Year\"), the oversaturated console market and the system's mixed reviews prevented it from achieving success comparable to competing consoles from Sega and Sony, leading to its discontinuation by 1996. In 1997, The 3DO Company sold its \"Opera\" hardware to Samsung, a year after offloading its M2 successor hardware to Panasonic.\nHistory.\nConception.\nThe 3DO format was the brainchild of Electronic Arts (EA) founder Trip Hawkins; while at EA, he found himself frustrated with the limitations of developing software for different platforms that were incompatible with each other. Hawkins was inspired to create his own platform from his repeated recollection of a cartoon he saw on a wall at his previous employer, Apple Computer: it consisted of two vultures on a branch, with one suggesting to the other that they kill something instead of waiting to scavenge. Hawkins formed a unit within EA to work on the platform, but when it was spun off as The 3DO Company on September 12, 1991, he found no one willing to oversee it; he ultimately relinquished his role as chief executive of EA to oversee it himself while remaining at EA as its chairman. The 3DO name itself was an abbreviation of \"three-dimensional optics\", though it was also a play on the words \"audio\" and \"video\". The 3DO Company's objective was to create a next-generation, CD-based video game/entertainment standard which would be manufactured by various partners and licensees; 3DO would collect a royalty on each console sold and on each game manufactured. To game publishers, the low US$ royalty rate per game was a better deal than the higher royalties paid to Nintendo and Sega when making games for their consoles. The 3DO hardware itself was designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical (designers of the Atari Lynx), starting from an outline on a restaurant napkin in 1989. Trip Hawkins was a long-time acquaintance of Needle and Mical and found that their design very closely fit his philosophy for architecture and approach, so he decided: \"Rather than me start a brand-new team and starting from scratch, it just made a lot of sense to ... join forces with them and shape what they were doing into what I wanted it to be.\" The company demonstrated a prototype unit at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1993, where attendees marveled at the console's graphical capabilities; industry analysts considered them unprecedented compared to those of contemporary consoles and personal computers.\nLicensing model.\nThe 3DO Company lacked the resources to manufacture consoles, and instead licensed the hardware to other companies for manufacturing. Trip Hawkins recounted that they approached every electronics manufacturer, but that their chief targets were Sony and Matsushita (now named Panasonic), the two largest consumer electronics companies in the world. However, Sony had already begun development on their own console, the PlayStation, and ultimately decided to continue work on it rather than sign with 3DO. According to former Sega CEO Tom Kalinske, The 3DO Company was engaged in very serious talks for Sega to become involved with the 3DO, though Sega ultimately passed on it due to concerns over cost. In contrast, Matsushita agreed to partner with the company as it was seeking reassurance for its investment in MCA Inc., which owned Universal Pictures and had yet to see substantial success since its acquisition by Matsushita in 1990. Matsushita launched the 3DO with its Panasonic FZ-1 model in 1993, though Goldstar (now LG) and Sanyo would later manufacture the 3DO as well. Companies who obtained the hardware license but never actually sold 3DO units include Samsung, Toshiba, and AT&amp;T, who went so far as to build prototype AT&amp;T 3DO units and display them at the January 1994 Consumer Electronics Show.\nLicensing to independent manufacturers made the system extremely expensive. The manufacturers had to make a profit on the hardware itself, whereas most major game console manufacturers, such as Sega and Sony, sold their systems at a loss, with expectations of making up for the loss with software sales. The 3DO was priced at US$, far above competing game systems and aimed at high-end users and early adopters. Hawkins has argued that 3DO was launched at $, and not \"higher myths that are often reported\". In a later interview, Hawkins clarified that while the suggested retail price was $, not all retailers sold the system at that price. Goldstar, Sanyo, and Panasonic's later models were less expensive to manufacture than the FZ-1 and were sold for considerably lower prices. For example, the Goldstar model launched at $. In addition, after six months on the market, the price of the FZ-1 had dropped to $.\nCompetition.\nHawkins' belief was that the 3DO system could become a dominant standard in a similar way to that achieved by the VHS video cassette format, with several companies being able to promote the standard effectively against individual competitors with their own technologies. It was also believed that companies would be able to more effectively compete by being able to leverage a common standard, as opposed to having to attract developers to individual formats, with Hawkins noting that this would be \"tough for Atari and Sony\". Indeed, Hawkins believed that the failure of NEC to establish its TurboGrafx system, and yet being \"much bigger than Sony\", illustrated the difficulties faced by new entrants to the console market and thought that Sony, in following the business model of Sega and Nintendo, \"would have had a better chance if it had partnered with some of the others\". Meanwhile, other products were not regarded as competitive threats: the Atari Jaguar was perceived as \"primitive\" and \"slightly better than a 16-bit system\", and the Philips CD-i was regarded as \"really obsolete by today's standards\". Both 3DO and Philips, seeking to pioneer the broader concept of interactive entertainment, aimed to sell in the order of one million units during 1994 and into 1995.\nHawkins claimed that the console was HDTV-capable, and that the company could use its technology for a set-top box. It was believed the platform would appeal to cable companies seeking to provide digital interactive services, with broadcasts being accompanied by digital information, eventually leading to the development of video-on-demand services on what was described as a \"client-server interactive network\", with an interactive networking trial having been announced in collaboration with US West in Omaha, Nebraska for the autumn of 1994.\nLaunch and performance.\nThe launch of the platform in October 1993 received a great deal of attention in the press as part of the \"multimedia wave\" in the computer world at the time. \"Return Fire\", \"Road Rash\", \"FIFA International Soccer\", and \"Jurassic Park Interactive\" had been slated for launch releases but were pushed to mid-1994 due to the developers' struggles with the then-cutting-edge hardware. Moreover, the 3DO Company made continuous updates to the console hardware almost up to the system's release, which resulted in a number of third-party titles missing the launch date, in some cases by less than a month, because the developers were not left enough time to fully test them on the finalized hardware. The only 3DO software available at launch was the third-party game \"Crash 'N Burn\". Panasonic also failed to manufacture an ample supply of the console in time for launch day, and as a result most retail stores only received one or two units. By mid-November, the 3DO had sold 30,000 units.\nThe system was released in Japan in March 1994 with an initial lineup of six games. The Japanese launch was moderately successful, with 70,000 units shipping to 10,000 stores. However, sales soon dropped and by 1995 the system was known in Japan as a host for pornographic releases.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" reported in January 1994 that 3DO \"is poised for an avalanche of software support to appear in the next 12 months\", unlike the Atari Jaguar and Pioneer LaserActive. The magazine predicted that \"If 3DO's licensees can get enough machines and software out in the market, this could very well become the interactive gamer's entry level machine\" and possibly \"the ideal plug-and-play solution for those of us who are tired of playing circuit board roulette with our personal computers\". Electronic Arts promoted the console in two-page advertisements, describing it as a \"technological leap\" and promising \"twenty new titles ... over the next twelve months\".\nThe 3DO's claim to the title of most advanced console on the market was lost with the 1994 Japanese launches of the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The 3DO Company responded by emphasizing their console's large existing software library, lower price (both the Panasonic and Goldstar models were $ by this time), and promised successor: the M2. To assure consumers that the 3DO would still be supported, the M2 was initially announced as an add-on for the 3DO. It was later revealed that the M2 would be an entirely separate console, albeit one with 3DO backward compatibility. Eventually the M2 project was cancelled.\nEnd of 3DO.\nUnlike Panasonic, Goldstar initially produced only 3DO hardware, not software. This made it difficult to manage competitive price drops, and when the price of the Goldstar 3DO dropped to $ in December 1995, the company took a loss of more than $ on each sale. Goldstar tried switching to the usual industry model of selling hardware at a loss and profiting on software, but though a handful of Goldstar games were published for the 3DO, Goldstar's software development operation arrived too late to allow them to turn a profit on the 3DO. This lack of a profitable business model, combined with Panasonic acquiring exclusive rights to the M2 technology, were cited as the two chief reasons for Goldstar dropping support for the 3DO in early 1996. During the second quarter of 1996 several of the 3DO's most loyal software supporters, including the software division of The 3DO Company themselves, announced they were no longer making games for the system, leaving Panasonic as the only company supporting active software development for the 3DO.\nThe 3DO system was eventually discontinued towards the end of 1996, with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the M2 technology to Panasonic. The 3DO Company restructured themselves around this same time, selling off their hardware division to become a multi-platform company focused on software development and online gaming. After The 3DO Company sold its \"Opera\" hardware to Samsung in 1997, the 3DO platform had achieved more attention in South Korea, where LG had opened a '3DO Plaza' in Seoul on its 1994 launch and many games had been localized. It competed there against Samsung's local version of the Sega Genesis and Hyundai's \"Comboy\" Super Nintendo.\nThe initial high price is considered to be one of the many issues that led to the 3DO's failure, along with lack of significant funding that larger companies such as Sony took advantage of. In an interview shortly after The 3DO Company dropped support for the system, Trip Hawkins attributed its failure to the model of licensing all hardware manufacturing and software to third parties. He reasoned that for a console to be a success, it needed a single strong company to take the lead in marketing, hardware, and software, and pointed out that it was essentially a lack of coordination between The 3DO Company, Panasonic, and the 3DO's software developers which had led to the console launching with only one game ready.\nLicensed systems.\nA number of different manufacturers produced the 3DO system. The Panasonic versions are the best known and most common.\nHardware.\nThe original edition of the console, the FZ-1, was referred to in full as the \"3DO REAL Interactive Multiplayer\". The console had advanced hardware features at the time: an ARM60 32-bit RISC CPU, a custom graphics processor with a math co-processor, and a custom 16-bit DSP with a 20-bit ALU. It also featured 2 megabytes (MB) of DRAM, 1 MB of VRAM, and a double speed CD-ROM drive for main CD+Gs or Photo CDs (and Video CDs with an add-on MPEG video module). The 3DO included the first light synthesizer in a game console, converting CD music to a mesmerizing color pattern.\nThe optical disc format for 3DO software uses a proprietary file system named Opera. The 3DO is one of few CD-based units that feature neither regional lockout nor copy protection, making it easy to use illegal copies or homebrew software. Although there is no regional lockout for 3DO systems, a few Japanese games cannot be played on non-Japanese 3DO consoles due to a special kanji font which was not present in the English language console firmware. Games that have compatibility issues include \"Sword and Sorcery\" (which was released in English under the title \"Lucienne's Quest\"), \"Twinkle Knights\" and a demo version of \"Alone in the Dark\".\nConnectivity.\nPower.\nAll 3DO consoles have integrated power supplies. Some models (Panasonic 3DO FZ-1, Sanyo TRY 3DO, and Goldstar 3DO) have hardwired power cords, others (Panasonic 3DO FZ-10) use an IEC 60320 C7 \"figure 8\" power cord. All North American model specifications are AC 120 V 60 Hz 30 W.\nBasic accessories.\nMost 3DO systems shipped with a standard controller, as well as A/V and power cables. The 3DO controllers were unusual in that the system base unit contained only one controller port and the controllers could be physically daisy chained together via a port on the top of each controller. Up to eight controllers could be linked together in this fashion. All controllers for each 3DO console are compatible with one another.\nIn addition, standard 3DO controllers released with the Panasonic FZ-1 also contained a headphone jack and volume control for silent play. The GoldStar (LG) model also included a controller with this feature.\nThird party controllers were produced by a number of companies including Logitech. World International Trading Corporation also released an adapter that allows Super NES controllers to be used with the 3DO.\nLight gun.\nThe only light gun released for the 3DO was the Gamegun, a product of third-party developer American Laser Games. Despite this, no fewer than 10 games with light gun support were produced for the system. Most of these were arcade ports from American Laser Games (including \"Mad Dog McCree\"), but Virgin Interactive and Digital Pictures also released 3DO light gun games.\nThe 3DO Gamegun uses the same design as the Gamegun released for the Sega CD: an orange \"Old West\" revolver. Select Gameguns house a controller port so that another Gamegun may be daisy-chained for two-player gameplay, which is supported in most of American Laser Games's 3DO titles.\nThough no light gun was released for the 3DO in Japan, the Japanese localizations of \"Demolition Man\" and \"Corpse Killer\" retain light gun support, and could be played by Japanese gamers using imported Gameguns.\nMouse.\nPanasonic and Logitech both released the 3DO mouse. The Panasonic FZ-JM1 and Logitech 3DO mouse are identical aside from their markings. Fewer than 20 games supported its use, some of which were optimized for the standard controller or light gun rather than the mouse. Of the 3DO games which were optimized for use with the mouse, the best known are \"Myst\" and \"Lemmings\". The Panasonic mouse was also bundled with Konami's \"Policenauts\" Limited Edition in Japan which came with a Policenauts mouse pad.\nOther.\nHome Arcade Systems released a steering wheel for the 3DO which is supported by several racing titles, including \"The Need for Speed\".\nThe Panasonic FZ-EM256 is a 256 KB Expandable Memory Unit that plugs into the 3DO expansion port on the back of the console. It was released in 1994 and sold in Japan only.\nThe Panasonic 3DO Karaoke Mixer allows 3DO owners to play a standard music CD, turn the vocals down, plug in one or two microphones and sing over the music. This unit was released in limited markets.\nGames.\nSome of the best-received titles were ports of arcade or PC games that other systems of the time were not capable of playing, such as \"Alone in the Dark\", \"Myst\" and \"Star Control II\". Other popular titles included \"Total Eclipse\", \"Jurassic Park Interactive\", \"Gex\", \"Crash 'N Burn\", \"\", \"Killing Time\", \"The Need for Speed\", \"Road Rash\", and \"Immercenary\". The 3DO version of arcade title \"Samurai Shodown\" was the only port with faithful graphics for some time, and the 3DO \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\" was the first port with its CD-quality audio.\nSince its release coincided with the arrival of the modern first-person shooter, the 3DO also had some of the earliest members of the genre as exclusives, such as \"Escape from Monster Manor\", the previously mentioned \"Killing Time\", and \"PO'ed\", as well as ports of \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\".\nHowever, the 3DO library also exhibited less successful traits of home consoles at the time. The 3DO was one of the first CD-ROM consoles, and some early titles on the 3DO frequently attempted to use interactive movie-style gameplay. Such titles rendered all or nearly all of their graphics in full motion video, which necessitated that any interactive influence from the player be limited to a greater extent than other games of the time. Some games followed a single unfolding of events simply by correctly timed prompts executed by the player. \"Night Trap\", \"D\", \"Mad Dog McCree\", and \"The Daedalus Encounter\" are among the more famous examples of full motion video driven games.\nReception.\nReviewing the 3DO, \"GamePro\" gave it a \"thumbs sideways\". They commented that \"The 3DO is the first CD-ROM system to make a real jump forward in graphics, sound, and game design.\" However, they questioned whether it would soon be rendered obsolete by the upcoming Jaguar CD and \"Project Reality\" (later released as the Nintendo 64) and felt there were not yet enough games to justify a purchase, recommending that gamers wait several months to see if the system would get a worthwhile library of games. The 3DO was awarded Worst Console Launch of 1993 by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\". In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Ts\u016bshin\" would score the 3DO Real console a 26 out of 40. \"Next Generation\" reviewed the 3DO in late 1995. They noted that due chiefly to its early launch, it had a larger installed base and more high quality games than the newly launched Saturn and PlayStation, making it a viable alternative to those systems. However, they debated whether it could remain a serious contender in the long run, in light of the successor M2's imminent release and the Saturn and PlayStation's superior hardware. They deemed the 3DO hardware overhyped but still very good for its time, especially praising the DMA engine. They gave it 2 out of 5 stars, concluding that it \"has settled out as a solid system with some good titles in its library and more on the way. The question that must be answered though is this: Is having a 'good system' enough?\"\nCiting a lack of decent exclusives and an \"astronomical asking price\", in 2009 video game website IGN chose the 3DO as its 22nd greatest video game console of all time, slightly higher than the Jaguar but lower than its four other major competitors: Super NES (4th best), Genesis (5th), PlayStation (7th), and Sega Saturn (18th). On Yahoo! Games the 3DO was placed among the top five worst console launches due to its one-game launch lineup and high launch price.\nGaming retrospectives have also accused the 3DO of having an abundance of poor quality interactive movies. Trip Hawkins' business model for selling the 3DO was widely derided by industry figures.\nLegacy.\nThe 3DO Company designed a next-generation console that was never released due to various business and technological issues. The M2 project, which began as an accelerator add-on for the 3DO, was to use dual PowerPC 602 processors in addition to newer 3D and video rendering technologies. Late during development, the company abandoned the console hardware business and sold the M2 technology to Matsushita.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Of apparent magnitude 5.20 and 6.05, respectively, they can be seen with binoculars in city skies or with the naked eye in rural areas without light pollution.\n61 Cygni first attracted the attention of astronomers when its large proper motion was first demonstrated by Giuseppe Piazzi in 1804. In 1838, Friedrich Bessel measured its distance from Earth at about 10.4\u00a0light-years, very close to the actual value of about 11.4\u00a0light-years; this was the first distance estimate for any star other than the Sun, and the first star to have its stellar parallax measured. Among all stars or stellar systems listed in the latest Gaia catalogues, 61 Cygni has the sixth-highest proper motion, and the highest among all naked-eye visible stars.\nOver the course of the twentieth century, several different astronomers reported evidence of a massive planet orbiting one of the two stars, but recent high-precision radial velocity observations have shown that all such claims were unfounded. No planets have been confirmed in this stellar system to date.\nName.\n61 Cygni is relatively dim, so it does not appear on ancient star maps, nor is it given a name in western or Chinese systems.\nThe name \"61 Cygni\" is part of the Flamsteed designation assigned to stars. According to this designation scheme, devised by John Flamsteed to catalog his observations, stars of a particular constellation are numbered in the order of their right ascension, not in Greek letters as the Bayer designation does. The star does not appear under that name in Flamsteed's \"Historia Coelestis Britannica\", although it has been stated by him that 61 Cygni actually corresponds to what he referred to as 85 Cygni in the 1712 edition. It has also been called \"Bessel's Star\" or \"Piazzi's Flying Star\".\nObservation history.\nEarly observations.\nThe first well recorded observation of the star system using optical instruments was made by James Bradley on 25 September 1753, when he noticed that it was a double star. William Herschel began systematic observations of 61 Cygni as part of a wider study of binary stars. His observations led to the conclusion that binary stars were separated enough that they would show different movements in parallax over the year, and hoped to use this as a way to measure the distance to the stars.\nIn 1792, Giuseppe Piazzi noticed the high proper motion when he compared his own observations of 61 Cygni with those of Bradley, made 40 years earlier. This led to considerable interest in 61 Cygni by contemporary astronomers, and its continual observation since that date. Piazzi's repeated measurements led to a definitive value of its motion, which he published in 1804.\nIt was in this record he christened the system as the \"Flying Star\".\nPiazzi noted that this motion meant that it was probably one of the closest stars, and suggested it would be a prime candidate for an attempt to determine its distance through parallax measurements, along with two other possibilities, Delta Eridani and Mu Cassiopeiae.\nParallax measurement.\nA number of astronomers soon took up the task, including attempts by Fran\u00e7ois Arago and Claude-Louis Mathieu in 1812, who recorded the parallax at 500\u00a0milliarcseconds (mas), and Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters used Arago's data to calculate a value of 550\u00a0mas. Peters calculated a better value based on observations made by Bernhard von Lindenau at Seeburg between 1812 and 1814; he calculated it to be 470 \u00b1510\u00a0mas. Von Lindenau had already noted that he had seen no parallax, and as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve pointed out after his own test series between 1818 and 1821, all of these numbers are more accurate than the accuracy of the instrument used.\nFriedrich Wilhelm Bessel made a notable contribution in 1812 when he used a different method to measure distance. Assuming the orbital period of the two stars in the binary to be 400 years, he estimated the distance between the two this would require, and then measured the angular distance between the stars. This led to a value of 460\u00a0mas. He then followed this up with direct parallax measurements in a series of observations between 1815 and 1816, comparing it with six other stars. The two sets of measurements produced values of 760 and 1320\u00a0mas. All of these estimates, like earlier attempts by others, retained inaccuracies greater than the measurements.\nWhen Joseph von Fraunhofer invented a new type of heliometer, Bessel carried out another set of measurements using this device in 1837 and 1838 at K\u00f6nigsberg. He published his findings in 1838 with a value of 369.0 \u00b119.1\u00a0mas to \"A\" and 260.5 \u00b118.8 to \"B\", and estimated the center point to be at 313.6 \u00b113.6. This corresponds to a distance of about 600,000 astronomical units, or about 10.4 light-years. This was the first direct and reliable measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun. His measurement was published only shortly before similar parallax measurements of Vega by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and Alpha Centauri by Thomas Henderson that same year. Bessel continued to make additional measurements at K\u00f6nigsberg, publishing a total of four complete observational runs, the last in 1868. The best of these placed the center point at 360.2 \u00b112.1\u00a0mas, made during observations in 1849. This is close to the currently accepted value of 287.18\u00a0mas (yielding 11.36\u00a0light-years).\nOnly a few years after Bessel's measurement, in 1842 Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander noted that Groombridge 1830 had an even larger proper motion, and 61 Cygni became the second highest known. It was later moved further down the list by Kapteyn's Star and Barnard's Star. 61 Cygni has the sixth highest proper motion of all stellar systems listed in the latest Gaia catalogues, but retains the title of highest proper motion among stars visible to the naked eye.\nBinary observations.\nDue to the wide angular separation between 61 Cygni A and B, and the correspondingly slow orbital motion, it was initially unclear whether the two stars in the 61 Cygni system were a gravitationally bound system or simply a juxtaposition of stars. von Struve first argued for its status as a binary in 1830, but the matter remained open.\nHowever, by 1917 refined measured parallax differences demonstrated that the separation was significantly less. The binary nature of this system was clear by 1934, and orbital elements were published.\nIn 1911, Benjamin Boss published data indicating that the 61 Cygni system was a member of a comoving group of stars. This group containing 61 Cygni was later expanded to include 26 potential members. Possible members include Beta Columbae, Pi Mensae, 14 Tauri and 68 Virginis. The space velocities of this group of stars range from 105 to 114\u00a0km/s relative to the Sun.\nObservations taken by planet search programs show that both components have strong linear trends in the radial velocity measurements.\nAmateur observation.\nAn observer using 7\u00d750 binoculars can find 61 Cygni two binocular fields southeast of the bright star Deneb. The angular separation of the two stars is slightly greater than the angular size of Saturn (16\u201320\u2033). So, under ideal viewing conditions, the binary system can be resolved by a telescope with a 7\u00a0mm aperture. This is\nwell within the capability for aperture of typical binoculars, though to resolve the binary these need a steady mount and some 10x magnification. With a separation of 28 arc-seconds between the component stars, 10\u00d7 magnification would give an apparent separation of 280 arc-seconds, above the generally regarded eye resolution limit of 4 arc-minutes or 240 arc-seconds.\nProperties.\nAlthough it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, 61 Cygni is a widely-separated binary star system, composed of two K class (orange) main sequence stars, the brighter 61 Cygni A and fainter 61 Cygni B, which have apparent magnitudes of 5.2 and 6.1, respectively. Both appear to be old-disk stars, with an estimated age that is older than the Sun. At a distance of just over 11 light-years, it is the 15th-nearest-known star system to the Earth (not including the Sun). 61 Cygni A is the fourth-nearest star that is visible to the naked eye for mid-latitude northern observers, after Sirius, Epsilon Eridani, and Procyon A. This system will make its closest approach at about 20,000 CE, when the separation from the Sun will be about 9 light-years. Smaller and dimmer than the Sun, 61 Cygni A has about 70 percent of a solar mass, 72 percent of its diameter and about 8.5 percent of its luminosity and 61 Cygni B has about 63 percent of a solar mass, 67 percent of its diameter, and 3.9 percent of its luminosity.\n61 Cygni A's long-term stability led to it being selected as an \"anchor star\" in the Morgan\u2013Keenan (MK) classification system in 1943, serving as the K5 V \"anchor point\" since that time. Starting in 1953, 61 Cygni B has been considered a K7 V standard star (Johnson &amp; Morgan 1953, Keenan &amp; McNeil 1989).\n61 Cygni A is a typical BY Draconis variable star designated as V1803 Cyg while 61 Cygni B is a flare type variable star named HD 201092 with their magnitudes varying 5.21 V and 6.03, respectively. The two stars orbit their common barycenter in a period of 659 years, with a mean separation of about 84\u00a0AU\u201484 times the separation between the Earth and the Sun. The relatively large orbital eccentricity of 0.48 means that the two stars are separated by about 44\u00a0AU at periapsis and 124 AU at apoapsis. The leisurely orbit of the pair has made it difficult to pin down their respective masses, and the accuracy of these values remain somewhat controversial. In the future this issue may be resolved through the use of asteroseismology. 61 Cygni A has about 11% more mass than 61 Cygni B.\nThe system has an activity cycle that is much more pronounced than the solar sunspot cycle. This is a complex activity cycle that varies with a period of about 7.5\u00b11.7\u00a0years. The starspot activity combined with rotation and chromospheric activity is a characteristic of a BY Draconis variable. Because of differential rotation, this star's surface rotation period varies by latitude from 27 to 45 days, with an average period of 35 days.\nThe outflow of the stellar wind from component A produces a bubble within the local interstellar cloud. Along the direction of the star's motion within the Milky Way, this extends out to a distance of 30\u00a0AU, or roughly the orbital distance of Neptune from the Sun. This is lower than the separation between the two components of 61 Cygni, and so the two most likely do not share a common atmosphere. The compactness of the astrosphere is likely due to the low mass outflow and the relatively high velocity through the local interstellar medium.\n61 Cygni B displays a more chaotic pattern of variability than A, with significant short-term flares. There is an 11.7-year periodicity to the overall activity cycle of B. Both stars exhibit stellar flare activity, but the chromosphere of B is 25% more active than for 61 Cygni A. As a result of differential rotation, the period of rotation varies by latitude from 32 to 47 days, with an average period of 38 days.\nThere is some disagreement over the evolutionary age of this system. Kinematic data gives an age estimate of about 10\u00a0Gyr. Gyrochronology, or the age determination of a star based on its rotation and color, results in an average age of 2.0 \u00b10.2 Gyr. The ages based on chromospheric activity for A and B are 2.36\u00a0Gyr and 3.75\u00a0Gyr, respectively. Finally the age estimates using the isochrone method, which involve fitting the stars to evolutionary models, yield upper limits of 0.44\u00a0Gyr and 0.68\u00a0Gyr. However, a 2008 evolutionary model using the CESAM2k code from the C\u00f4te d'Azur Observatory gives an age estimate of 6.0 \u00b11.0 Gyr for the pair.\nClaims of a planetary system.\nOn different occasions, it has been claimed that 61 Cygni might have unseen low-mass companions, planets or a brown dwarf. Kaj Strand of the Sproul Observatory, under the direction of Peter van de Kamp, made the first such claim in 1942 using observations to detect tiny but systematic variations in the orbital motions of 61 Cygni A and B. These perturbations suggested that a third body of about 16 Jupiter masses must be orbiting 61 Cygni A. Reports of this third body served as inspiration for Hal Clement's 1953 science fiction novel \"Mission of Gravity\". In 1957, van de Kamp narrowed his uncertainties, claiming that the object had a mass of eight times that of Jupiter, a calculated orbital period of 4.8\u00a0years, and a semi-major axis of 2.4\u00a0AU, where 1\u00a0AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. In 1977, Soviet astronomers at the Pulkovo Observatory near Saint Petersburg suggested that the system included three planets: two giant planets with six and twelve Jupiter masses around 61 Cyg A, and one giant planet with seven Jupiter masses around 61 Cygni B.\nIn 1978, Wulff-Dieter Heintz of the Sproul Observatory proved that these claims were spurious, as they were unable to detect any evidence of such motion down to six percent of the Sun's mass\u2014equivalent to about 60 times the mass of Jupiter.\nIn 2018, analysis of the DR2 data gathered by the Gaia space telescope revealed significant proper motion anomalies in the orbits of the binary stars around each other; the stars were not quite orbiting around their centre of mass with 61 Cygni B also orbiting too slowly for its assumed mass. These anomalies taken together are indicative of the possible presence of a perturbing third object in orbit around 61 Cygni B. However, subsequent works found the astrometric data of the two stars to be consistent with a binary system with no third body.\nThe habitable zone for 61 Cygni A, defined as the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-like planet, is 0.26\u20130.58\u00a0AU. For 61 Cygni B, the habitable zone is 0.24\u20130.50 AU.\nRefining planetary boundaries.\nSince no certain planetary object has been detected around either star so far, McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets around 61 Cygni A and 61 Cygni B with masses between 0.07 and 2.1\u00a0Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2\u00a0AU.\nBecause of the proximity of this system to the Sun, it is a frequent target of interest for astronomers. Both stars were selected by NASA as \"Tier 1\" targets for the proposed optical Space Interferometry Mission. This mission is potentially capable of detecting planets with as little as 3\u00a0times the mass of the Earth at an orbital distance of 2\u00a0AU from the star.\nMeasurements of this system appeared to have detected an excess of far infrared radiation, beyond what is emitted by the stars. Such an excess is sometimes associated with a disk of dust, but in this case it lies sufficiently close to one or both of the stars that it has not been resolved with a telescope. A 2011 study using the Keck Interferometer Nuller failed to detect any exozodiacal dust around 61 Cygni A.\nObject for biosignature research.\nThe two stars are among five (all nearby star) paradigms listed among those K-type stars of a type in a 'sweet spot' between Sun-analog stars and M stars for the likelihood of evolved life, per analysis of Giada Arney from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The civil war became a war of separate states with the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948, the end of the British Mandate for Palestine at midnight, and the entry of a military coalition of Arab states into the territory of Mandatory Palestine the following morning. The war formally ended with the 1949 Armistice Agreements which established the Green Line.\nSince the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 creation of the British Mandate of Palestine, and in the context of Zionism and the mass migration of European Jews to Palestine, there had been tension and conflict between Arabs, Jews, and the British in Palestine. The conflict escalated into a civil war 30 November 1947, the day after the United Nations adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine proposing to divide the territory into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and an internationally administered corpus separatum for the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. \nAt the end of a campaign beginning April 1948 called Plan Dalet, in which Zionist forces attacked, conquered, and depopulated cities, villages, and territories in Mandatory Palestine in preparation for the establishment of a Jewish state, and just before the expiration of the British Mandate for Palestine, Zionist leaders announced the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. The following morning, Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, and expeditionary forces from Iraq entered Palestine, taking control of the Arab areas and attacking Israeli forces and settlements. The 10 months of fighting took place mostly on the territory of the British Mandate and in the Sinai Peninsula and southern Lebanon, interrupted by several truce periods.\nBy the end of the war, the State of Israel controlled all of the area that the UN had proposed for a Jewish state, as well as almost 60% of the area proposed for an Arab state, including Jaffa, Lydda and Ramle area, Upper Galilee, some parts of the Negev, the west coast as far as Gaza City, and a wide strip along the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem road. Israel also took control of West Jerusalem, which was meant to be part of an international zone for Jerusalem and its environs. Transjordan took control of East Jerusalem and what became known as the West Bank, annexing it the following year. The territory known today as the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt.\nExpulsions of Palestinians, which had begun during the civil war, continued during the Arab-Israeli war. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed in multiple massacres, such as occurred in the expulsions from Lydda and Ramle. These events are known today as the Nakba (Arabic for \"the catastrophe\") and were the beginning of the Palestinian refugee problem. A similar number of Jews moved to Israel during the three years following the war, including 260,000 who migrated, fled, or were expelled from the surrounding Arab states.\nBackground.\nSince the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 creation of the British Mandate of Palestine, and in the context of Zionism and the mass migration of European Jews to Palestine, there had been tension and conflict between Arabs, Jews, and the British. British policies dissatisfied both Arabs and Jews. In 1920, the Arab leaders were very disappointed with Britain. In 1916, the British commander-in-chief in Cairo had made an agreement with the Emir of Mecca: if the Arabs rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, the British would provide them with arms and money and support the formation of an independent Arab state. Around 30,000 older rifles and a smaller amount of modern weapons were supplied by the British, and a very large area from the Red Sea to Damascus was conquered.\nBritain backtracked from its promise that an independent Arab state would be formed. In 1920, Britain let French troops attack the Arab Kingdom of Syria, crushing its army and overthrowing its government. Arab opposition developed into the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine, while the Jewish opposition developed into the 1944\u20131947 Jewish insurgency in Palestine. On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and the City of Jerusalem.\nThe General Assembly resolution on Partition was greeted with overwhelming joy in Jewish communities and widespread outrage in the Arab world. In Palestine, violence erupted almost immediately, feeding into a spiral of reprisals and counter-reprisals. The British refrained from intervening as tensions boiled over into a low-level conflict that quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war.\nFrom January onwards, operations became increasingly militarised, with the intervention of a number of Arab Liberation Army regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria. Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni came from Egypt with several hundred men of the Army of the Holy War. Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, al-Husayni organised the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem.\nTo counter this, the Yishuv authorities tried to supply the city with convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but the operation became more and more impractical as the number of casualties in the relief convoys surged. By March, Al-Hussayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed. The situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated Negev and north of Galilee was even more critical.\nWhile the Jewish population had received strict orders requiring them to hold their ground everywhere at all costs, the Arab population was more affected by the general conditions of insecurity to which the country was exposed. Up to 100,000 Arabs, from the urban upper and middle classes in Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, or Jewish-dominated areas, evacuated abroad or to Arab centres eastwards.\nThis situation caused the United States to withdraw its support for the Partition Plan, encouraging the Arab League to believe that the Palestinian Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to the plan. However, the British decided on 7 February 1948 to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.\nAlthough doubt took hold among Yishuv supporters, their apparent defeats were due more to their wait-and-see policy than to weakness. David Ben-Gurion reorganised Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Thanks to funds raised by Golda Meir from sympathisers in the United States, and Stalin's decision to support the Zionist cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to sign very important armament contracts in the East. Other Haganah agents recovered stockpiles from the Second World War, which helped improve the army's equipment and logistics. Operation Balak allowed arms and other equipment to be transported for the first time by the end of March.\nBen-Gurion invested Yigael Yadin with the responsibility to come up with a plan of offence whose timing was related to the foreseeable evacuation of British forces. This strategy, called Plan Dalet, was readied by March and implemented towards the end of April. A separate plan, Operation Nachshon, was devised to lift the siege of Jerusalem. 1500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and Palmach's Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 and 20 April. Both sides acted offensively in defiance of the Partition Plan, which foresaw Jerusalem as a \"corpus separatum\", under neither Jewish nor Arab jurisdiction. The Arabs did not accept the Plan, while the Jews were determined to oppose the internationalisation of the city, and secure it as part of the Jewish state. The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last two months were trucked into Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population. The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Husayni in combat.\nDuring this time, fighters from Irgun and Lehi massacred a substantial number of Palestinians at Deir Yassin. The attack was widely publicized and had a deep impact on the morale of the Palestinian population and contributed to generate the exodus of the Arab population.\nAt the same time, the Arab Liberation Army was roundly defeated at Mishmar HaEmek in its first large-scale operation, coinciding with the loss of their Druze allies through defection.\nWith the implementation of Plan Dalet, the Haganah, Palmach and Irgun forces began conquering mixed zones. The Palestinian Arab society was shaken as Tiberias, Haifa, Safed, Beisan, Jaffa and Acre were all captured and more than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled.\nThe British had essentially withdrawn their troops. This pushed the leaders of the neighbouring Arab states to intervene, but they were not fully prepared, and could not assemble sufficient forces to turn the tide. The majority of Palestinian Arab hopes lay with the Arab Legion of Transjordan's monarch, King Abdullah I, but he had no intention of creating a Palestinian Arab-run state, since he hoped to annex as much of the territory of the British Mandate for Palestine as he could. He was playing a double game, being just as much in contact with the Jewish authorities as with the Arab League.\nIn preparation for the offensive, Haganah successfully launched Operations Yiftah and Ben-'Ami to secure the Jewish settlements of Galilee, and Operation Kilshon, which created a united front around Jerusalem. The inconclusive meeting between Golda Meir and Abdullah I, followed by the Kfar Etzion massacre on 13 May by the Arab Legion led to predictions that the battle for Jerusalem would be merciless.\nOn 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel and the 1948 Palestine war entered its second phase with the intervention of the Arab state armies and the beginning of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War.\nArmed forces.\nBy September 1947, the Haganah had \"10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76\u00a0mm) mortars\".\nImporting arms.\nIn 1946, Ben-Gurion decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a \"massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West\", and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities.\nThe Yishuv managed clandestinely to amass arms and military equipment abroad for transfer to Palestine once the British blockade was lifted. In the United States, Yishuv agents purchased three Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, one of which bombed Cairo in July 1948, some Curtiss C-46 Commando transport planes, and dozens of half-tracks, which were repainted and defined as \"agricultural equipment\". In Western Europe, Haganah agents amassed fifty 65mm French mountain guns, twelve 120mm mortars, ten H-35 light tanks, and a large number of half-tracks. By mid-May or thereabouts the Yishuv had purchased from Czechoslovakia 25 Avia S-199 fighters (an inferior version of the Messerschmitt Bf 109), 200 heavy machine guns, 5,021 light machine guns, 24,500 rifles, and 52\u00a0million rounds of ammunition, enough to equip all units, but short of heavy arms. The airborne arms smuggling missions from Czechoslovakia were codenamed Operation Balak.\nThe airborne smuggling missions were carried out by mostly American aviators \u2013 Jews and non-Jews \u2013 led by ex-U.S. Air Transport Command flight engineer Al Schwimmer. Schwimmer's operation also included recruiting and training fighter pilots such as Lou Lenart, commander of the first Israeli air assault against the Arabs. Several Americans, including Schwimmer, were later prosecuted by the U.S. government for violating the Neutrality Act of 1939.\nArms production.\nThe Yishuv also had \"a relatively advanced \"arms producing\" capacity\", that between October 1947 and July 1948 \"produced 3\u00a0million 9\u00a0mm bullets, 150,000 Mills grenades, 16,000 submachine guns (Sten Guns) and 210 three-inch (76\u00a0mm) mortars\", along with a few \"Davidka\" mortars, which had been indigenously designed and produced. They were inaccurate but had a loud explosion that demoralised the enemy. Much of the munitions used by the Israelis came from the Ayalon Institute, a clandestine bullet factory beneath kibbutz Ayalon, which produced about 2.5\u00a0million bullets for Sten guns. The munitions produced by the Ayalon Institute were said to have been the only supply that was not in shortage during the war. Locally produced explosives were also plentiful. After Israel's independence, these clandestine arms manufacturing operations were moved above ground. All of the Haganah's weapons-manufacturing was centralised and later became Israel Military Industries.\nManpower.\nIn November 1947, the Haganah was an underground paramilitary force that had existed as a highly organised, national force, since the Arab riots of 1920\u201321, and throughout the riots of 1929, Great Uprising of 1936\u201339, and World War II. It had a mobile force, the HISH, which had 2,000 full-time fighters (men and women) and 10,000 reservists (all aged between 18 and 25) and an elite unit, the Palmach composed of 2,100 fighters and 1,000 reservists. The reservists trained three or four days a month and went back to civilian life the rest of the time. These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (\"Heil Mishmar\", lit. Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25. The Yishuv's total strength was around 35,000 with 15,000 to 18,000 fighters and a garrison force of roughly 20,000.\nThere were also several thousand men and women who had served in the British Army in World War II who did not serve in any of the underground militias but would provide valuable military experience during the war. Walid Khalidi says the Yishuv had the additional forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, numbering some 12,000, the Gadna Youth Battalions, and the armed settlers. Few of the units had been trained by December 1947. On 5 December 1947, conscription was instituted for all men and women aged between 17 and 25 and by the end of March, 21,000 had been conscripted. On 30 March, the call-up was extended to men and single women aged between 26 and 35. Five days later, a General Mobilization order was issued for all men under 40.\nBy March 1948, the Yishuv had a numerical superiority, with 35,780 mobilised and deployed fighters for the Haganah, 3,000 men under Lehi and Irgun, and a few thousand armed settlers. Irgun was eventually absorbed into the Jewish Defence Army. The activities of Irgun was monitored by MI5, which found that Irgun was \"involved or implicated in numerous acts of terrorism\" during the end years of the British mandate in Palestine such as the attacks on trains and the kidnapping of British servicemen.\nArab forces.\nAccording to Benny Morris, by the end of 1947, the Palestinians already \"had a healthy and demoralising respect for the Yishuv's military power\" and if it came to battle, the Palestinians expected to lose. When the first violent incidents broke out in Jerusalem on the 29 November, the Arab Higher Committee, well aware of their lack of armaments, had called for a three-day strike: the most militant Palestinian group in the city, consisting of 44 fighters, was furnished with 12 rifles, some handguns and a few kilograms of explosives.\nThe effective number of Arab combatants was listed as growing to 12,000 by some historians while others calculate an eventual total Arab strength of approximately 23,500 troops, and with this being more of less or roughly equal to that of the Yishuv. However, as Israel mobilised most of its most able citizens during the war while the Arab troops were only a small percentage of its far greater population, the strength of the Yishuv grew steadily and dramatically during the war.\nPolitical objectives.\nYishuv.\nYishuv's aims evolved during the war. Mobilisation for a total war was organised. Initially, the aim was \"simple and modest\": to survive the assaults of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states. \"The Zionist leaders deeply, genuinely, feared a Middle Eastern reenactment of the Holocaust, which had just ended; the Arabs' public rhetoric reinforced these fears\". As the war progressed, the aim of expanding the Jewish state beyond the UN partition borders appeared: first to incorporate clusters of isolated Jewish settlements and later to add more territories to the state and give it defensible borders. A third and further aim that emerged among the political and military leaders after four or five months was to \"reduce the size of Israel's prospective large and hostile Arab minority, seen as a potential powerful fifth column, by belligerency and expulsion\".\nAccording to research by Shay Hazkani, Ben-Gurion and segments of the religious Zionist leadership drew parallels between the war and the biblical wars of extermination, and states this was not a fringe position. IDF indoctrination pamphlets were distributed to recruits instructing them that God \u201cdemands a revenge of extermination without mercy to whoever tries to hurt us for no reason.\u201d.\nPlan Dalet, or Plan D, (, \"Tokhnit dalet\") was a plan worked out by the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary group and the forerunner of the Israel Defense Forces, in autumn 1947 to spring 1948, which was sent to Haganah units in early March 1948. The intent of Plan Dalet is subject to much controversy, with historians on the one extreme asserting that it was entirely defensive, and historians on the other extreme asserting that the plan aimed at maximum conquest and expulsion of the Palestinians. According to Walid Khalidi and Ilan Papp\u00e9, its purpose was to conquer as much of Palestine and to expel as many Palestinians as possible, though according to Benny Morris there was no such intent. In his book \"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\", Papp\u00e9 asserts that Plan Dalet was a \"blueprint for ethnic cleansing\" with the aim of reducing both rural and urban areas of Palestine.\nAccording to Yoav Gelber, the plan specified that in case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule. According to Morris, Plan D called for occupying the areas within the UN sponsored Jewish state, several concentrations of Jewish population outside those areas (West Jerusalem and Western Galilee), and areas along the roads where the invading Arab armies were expected to attack.\nThe Yishuv perceived the peril of an Arab invasion as threatening its very existence. Having no real knowledge of the Arabs' true military capabilities, the Jews took Arab propaganda literally, preparing for the worst and reacting accordingly.\nArab League as a whole.\nThe Arab League had unanimously rejected the UN partition plan and were officially opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state alongside an Arab one.\nThe Arab League before partition affirmed the right to the independence of Palestine, while blocking the creation of a Palestinian government. Towards the end of 1947, the League established a military committee commanded by the retired Iraqi general Isma'il Safwat whose mission was to analyse the chance of victory of the Palestinians against the Jews. His conclusions were that they had no chance of victory and that an invasion of the Arab regular armies was mandatory. The political committee nevertheless rejected these conclusions and decided to support an armed opposition to the Partition Plan excluding the participation of their regular armed forces.\nIn April with the Palestinian defeat, the refugees coming from Palestine and the pressure of their public opinion, the Arab leaders decided to invade Palestine.\nThe Arab League gave reasons for its invasion in Palestine in the :\nBritish diplomat Alec Kirkbride wrote in his 1976 memoirs about a conversation with the Arab League's secretary-general Azzam Pasha a week before the armies marched: \"...when I asked him for his estimate of the size of the Jewish forces, [he] waved his hands and said: 'It does not matter how many there are. We will sweep them into the sea.'\"\nAccording to Gelber, the Arab countries were \"drawn into the war by the collapse of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab Liberation Army [and] the Arab governments' primary goal was preventing the Palestinian Arabs' total ruin and the flooding of their own countries by more refugees. According to their own perception, had the invasion not taken place, there was no Arab force in Palestine capable of checking the Haganah's offensive\".\nKing Abdullah I of Transjordan.\nKing Abdullah was the commander of the Arab Legion, the strongest Arab army involved in the war according to Eugene Rogan and Avi Shlaim in 2007. (In contrast, Morris wrote in 2008 that the Egyptian army was the most powerful and threatening army.) The Arab Legion had about 10,000 soldiers, trained and commanded by British officers.\nIn 1946\u201347, Abdullah said that he had no intention to \"resist or impede the partition of Palestine and creation of a Jewish state.\" Ideally, Abdullah would have liked to annex all of Palestine, but he was prepared to compromise. He supported the partition, intending that the West Bank area of the British Mandate allocated for the Arab state be annexed to Jordan. Abdullah held secret meetings with the Jewish Agency (at which the future Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir was among the delegates) that reached an agreement of Jewish non-interference with Jordanian annexation of the West Bank (although Abdullah failed in his goal of acquiring an outlet to the Mediterranean Sea through the Negev desert) and of Jordanian agreement not to attack the area of the Jewish state contained in the United Nations partition resolution (in which Jerusalem was given neither to the Arab nor the Jewish state, but was to be an internationally administered area). In order to keep their support to his plan of annexation of the Arab State, Abdullah promised to the British he would not attack the Jewish State.\nThe neighbouring Arab states pressured Abdullah into joining them in an \"all-Arab military invasion\" against the newly created State of Israel, that he used to restore his prestige in the Arab world, which had grown suspicious of his relatively good relationship with Western and Jewish leaders. Jordan's undertakings not to cross partition lines were not taken at face value. While repeating assurances that Jordan would only take areas allocated to a future Arab state, on the eve of war Tawfik Abu al-Huda told the British that were other Arab armies to advance against Israel, Jordan would follow suit. On 23 May Abdullah told the French consul in Amman that he \"was determined to fight Zionism and prevent the establishment of an Israeli state on the border of his kingdom\".\nAbdullah's role in this war became substantial. He saw himself as the \"supreme commander of the Arab forces\" and \"persuaded the Arab League to appoint him\" to this position. Through his leadership, the Arabs fought the 1948 war to meet Abdullah's political goals.\nOther Arab states.\nKing Farouk of Egypt was anxious to prevent Abdullah from being seen as the main champion of the Arab world in Palestine, which he feared might damage his own leadership aspirations of the Arab world. In addition, Farouk wished to annex all of southern Palestine to Egypt. According to Gamal Abdel Nasser the Egyptian Ministry of Defence's first communique describe the Palestine operations as a merely punitive expedition against the Zionist \"gangs\", using a term frequent in Haganah reports of Palestinian fighters. According to a 2019 study, \"senior British intelligence, military officers and diplomats in Cairo were deeply involved in a covert scheme to drive the King to participate in the Arab states' war coalition against Israel.\" These intelligence officers acted without the approval or knowledge of the British government.\nNuri as-Said, the strongman of Iraq, had ambitions for bringing the entire Fertile Crescent under Iraqi leadership. Both Syria and Lebanon wished to take certain areas of northern Palestine.\nOne result of the ambitions of the various Arab leaders was a distrust of all the Palestinian leaders who wished to set up a Palestinian state, and a mutual distrust of each other. Co-operation was to be very poor during the war between the various Palestinian factions and the Arab armies.\nArab Higher Committee of Amin al-Husayni.\nFollowing rumours that King Abdullah was re-opening the bilateral negotiations with Israel that he had previously conducted in secret with the Jewish Agency, the Arab League, led by Egypt, decided to set up the All-Palestine Government in Gaza on 8 September under the nominal leadership of the Mufti. Abdullah regarded the attempt to revive al-Husayni's Holy War Army as a challenge to his authority and all armed bodies operating in the areas controlled by the Arab Legion were disbanded. Glubb Pasha carried out the order ruthlessly and efficiently.\nInitial line-up of forces.\nMilitary assessments.\nThough the State of Israel faced the formidable armies of neighbouring Arab countries, due to previous battles the Palestinians themselves hardly existed as a military force by the middle of May. The British Intelligence and Arab League military reached similar conclusions.\nThe British Foreign Ministry and the CIA believed that the Arab states would finally win in case of war. Martin Van Creveld says that in terms of manpower, the sides were fairly evenly matched.\nIn May, Egyptian generals told their government that the invasion would be \"a parade without any risks\" and Tel Aviv would be taken \"in two weeks.\" Egypt, Iraq, and Syria all possessed air forces, Egypt and Syria had tanks, and all had some modern artillery. Initially, the Haganah had no heavy machine guns, artillery, armoured vehicles, anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons, nor military aircraft or tanks. The four Arab armies that invaded on 15 May were far stronger than the Haganah formations they initially encountered.\nOn 12 May, three days before the invasion, David Ben-Gurion was told by his chief military advisers (who over-estimated the size of the Arab armies and the numbers and efficiency of the troops who would be committed\u00a0\u2013 much as the Arab generals tended to exaggerate Jewish fighters' strength) that Israel's chances of winning a war against the Arab states were only about even.\nYishuv/Israeli forces.\nSources disagree about the quantity of arms at the Yishuv's disposal at the end of the Mandate. According to Efraim Karsh before the arrival shipments from Czechoslovakia as part of Operation Balak, there was roughly one weapon for every three fighters, and even the Palmach could arm only two out of every three of its active members. According to Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, by April 1948, the Haganah had accumulated only about 20,000 rifles and Sten guns for the 35,000 soldiers who existed on paper. According to Walid Khalidi, \"the arms at the disposal of these forces were plentiful\". France authorised Air France to transport cargo to Tel Aviv on 13 May.\nYishuv forces were organised in nine brigades, and their numbers grew following Israeli independence, eventually expanding to twelve brigades. Although both sides increased their manpower over the first few months of the war, the Israeli forces grew steadily as a result of the progressive mobilisation of Israeli society and the influx of an average of 10,300 immigrants each month. By the end of 1948, the Israel Defense Forces had 88,033 soldiers, including 60,000 combat soldiers.\nAfter the invasion: France allowed aircraft carrying arms from Czechoslovakia to land on French territory in transit to Israel, and permitted two arms shipments to \u2018Nicaragua\u2019, which were actually intended for Israel.\nCzechoslovakia supplied vast quantities of arms to Israel during the war, including thousands of vz. 24 rifles and MG 34 and ZB 37 machine guns, and millions of rounds of ammunition. Czechoslovakia supplied fighter aircraft, including at first ten Avia S-199 fighter planes.\nHaganah agents in Western Europe had amassed fifty 65mm French mountain guns, twelve 120mm mortars, ten H-35 light tanks, and a large number of half-tracks. The Haganah readied twelve cargo ships throughout European ports to transfer the equipment, which would set sail as soon as the British blockade lifted at the end of the Mandate.\nFollowing Israeli independence, the Israelis managed to build three Sherman tanks from scrap-heap material found in abandoned British ordnance depots.\nThe Haganah also managed to obtain stocks of British weapons due to the logistical complexity of the British withdrawal, and the corruption of a number of officials.\nOn 29 June 1948, the day before the last British troops left Haifa, two British soldiers sympathetic to the Israelis stole two Cromwell tanks from an arms depot in the Haifa port area, smashing them through the unguarded gates, and joined the IDF. These two tanks would form the basis of the Israeli Armoured Corps.\nAfter the first truce, by July 1948, the Israelis had established an air force, a navy, and a tank battalion.\nAfter the second truce, Czechoslovakia supplied Supermarine Spitfire fighter planes, which were smuggled to Israel via an abandoned Luftwaffe runway in Yugoslavia, with the agreement of the Yugoslav government. The airborne arms smuggling missions from Czechoslovakia were codenamed Operation Balak.\nArab forces.\nAt the invasion, in addition to the irregular Palestinian militia groups, the five Arab states that joined the war were Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq sending expeditionary forces of their regular armies. Additional contingents came from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. On the eve of war, the available number of Arab troops likely to be committed was between 23,500 and 26,500 (10,000 Egyptians, 4,500 Jordanians, 3,000 Iraqis, 3,000\u20136,000 Syrians, 2,000 ALA volunteers, 1,000 Lebanese, and several hundred Saudis), in addition to the irregular Palestinians already present. These Arab forces had been trained by British and French instructors; this was particularly true of Jordan's Arab Legion under command of Lt Gen Sir John Glubb (known as Glubb Pasha).\nSyria bought a quantity of small arms for the Arab Liberation Army from Czechoslovakia, but the shipment never arrived due to Haganah force intervention.\nArab states.\nJordan's Arab Legion was considered the most effective Arab force. Armed, trained and commanded by British officers, this 8,000\u201312,000 strong force was organised in four infantry/mechanised regiments supported by some forty artillery pieces and seventy-five armoured cars. Until January 1948, it was reinforced by the 3,000-strong Transjordan Frontier Force. As many as 48 British officers served in the Arab Legion. Glubb Pasha, the commander of the Legion, organised his forces into four brigades as follows:\nThe Arab Legion joined the war in May 1948, but fought only in the area that King Abdullah wanted to secure for Jordan: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\nFrance prevented a large sale of arms by a Swiss company to Ethiopia, brokered by the UK foreign office, which was actually destined for Egypt and Jordan, and denied a British request at the end of April to land a squadron of British aircraft on its way to Transjordan, and applied diplomatic pressure on Belgium to suspend arms sales to the Arab states.\nThe Jordanian forces were probably the best trained of all combatants. Other combatant forces lacked the ability to make strategic decisions and tactical manoeuvres, as evidenced by positioning the fourth regiment at Latrun, which was abandoned by ALA combatants before the arrival of the Jordanian forces and the importance of which was not fully understood by the Haganah. In the later stages of the war, Latrun proved to be of high strategic importance for its access to roads and proximity to Jerusalem, with some of the most successful Arab and Jordanian fighting occurring there.\nIn 1948, Iraq's army had 21,000 men in twelve brigades and the Iraqi Air Force had 100 planes, mostly British. Initially the Iraqis committed around 3,000 men to the war effort, including four infantry brigades, one armoured battalion and support personnel. These were to operate under Jordanian guidance. The first Iraqi forces to be deployed reached Jordan in April 1948 under the command of Gen. Nur ad-Din Mahmud.\nIn 1948, Egypt's army was able to put a maximum of around 40,000 men into the field, 80% of its military-age male population were unfit for military service, and its embryonic logistics system was limited in its ability to support ground forces beyond its borders. Initially, an expeditionary force of 10,000 men was sent to Palestine under the command of Maj. Gen. Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. This consisted of five infantry battalions, one armoured battalion equipped with British Light Tank Mk VI and Matilda tanks, one battalion of sixteen 25-pounder guns, a battalion of eight 6-pounder guns and one medium-machine-gun battalion with supporting troops.\nThe Egyptian Air Force had over thirty Spitfires, four Hawker Hurricanes and twenty C47s modified into crude bombers.\nSyria had 12,000 soldiers at the beginning of the 1948 War, grouped into three infantry brigades and an armoured force of approximately battalion size. The Syrian Air Force had forty-three planes, thirty-seven operational, of which approximately the ten newest were World War II\u2013generation models.\nFrance suspended arms sales to Syria, notwithstanding already-signed contracts.\nLebanon's army was the smallest of the Arab states, consisting of 3,500 soldiers, of whom only 1,000 were deployed during the war. According to Gelber, in June 1947, Ben-Gurion \"arrived at an agreement with the Maronite religious leadership in Lebanon that cost a few thousand pounds and kept Lebanon's army out of the War of Independence and the military Arab coalition\". A token force of 436 soldiers crossed into northern Galilee, seized two villages after a small skirmish, and withdrew. Israel then invaded and occupied southern Lebanon until the end of the war.\nBy the time of the second truce, the Egyptians had 20,000 men in the field in thirteen battalions equipped with 135 tanks and 90 artillery pieces.\nDuring the first truce, the Iraqis increased their force to about 10,000. Ultimately, the Iraqi expeditionary force numbered around 18,000 men.\nSaudi Arabia sent hundreds of volunteers to join the Arab forces. In February 1948, around 800 tribesmen had gathered near Aqaba to invade the Negev, but crossed to Egypt after Saudi rival King Abdallah denied them permission to pass through Jordanian territory. The Saudi troops were attached to the Egyptian command throughout the war, and estimates of their total strength ranged up to 1,200. By July 1948, the Saudis comprised three brigades within the Egyptian expeditionary force, and were stationed as guards between Gaza city and Rafah. This area came under heavy aerial bombardment during Operation Yoav in October, and faced a land assault beginning in late December which culminated in the Battle of Rafah in early January of the new year. With the subsequent armistice of 24 February 1949 and evacuation of almost 4,000 Arab soldiers and civilians from Gaza, the Saudi contingent withdrew through Arish and returned to Saudi Arabia.\nDuring the first truce, Sudan sent six companies of regular troops to fight alongside the Egyptians. Yemen also committed a small expeditionary force to the war effort, and contingents from Morocco joined the Arab armies as well.\nCourse of the war.\nAt the last moment, several Arab leaders, to avert catastrophe \u2013 secretly appealed to the British to hold on in Palestine for at least another year.\nFirst phase: 15 May \u2013 11 June 1948.\nThe civil war in Mandatory Palestine became a war between separate states with the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, a few hours before the termination of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight. The following morning, the regular armies of neighbouring Arab states\u00a0\u2013 Egypt, Transjordan and Syria\u00a0\u2013 invaded territories of the former Palestinian mandate allocated for a future Arab state according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.\nThrough Plan Dalet, Zionist forces had already, from 1 April down to 14 May, conducted 8 of its 13 full-scale military operations outside of the area allotted to a Jewish state by partition, and the operational commander Yigal Allon later stated that had it not been for the Arab invasion, Haganah's forces would have reached 'the natural borders of western Israel.' Although the Arab invasion was denounced by the United States, the Soviet Union, and UN secretary-general Trygve Lie, it found support from the Republic of China and other UN member states.\nThe initial Arab plans called for Syrian and Lebanese forces to invade from north while Jordanian and Iraqi forces were to invade from east in order to meet at Nazareth and then to push forward together to Haifa. In the south, the Egyptians were to advance and take Tel Aviv. At the Arab League meeting in Damascus on 11\u201313 May, Abdullah rejected the plan, which served Syrian interests, using the fact his allies were afraid to go to war without his army. He proposed that the Iraqis attack the Jezreel valley and the Arab Legion enter Ramallah and Nablus and link with the Egyptian army at Hebron, which was more in compliance with his political objective to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab State by the partition plan and promises not to invade the territory allocated to the Jewish State by the partition plan. In addition, Lebanon decided not to take part in the war at the last minute, due to the still-influential Christians' opposition, encouraged by Jewish bribes.\nIntelligence provided by the French consulate in Jerusalem on 12 May 1948 on the Arab armies' invading forces and their revised plan to invade the new state contributed to Israel's success in withstanding the Arab invasion.\nThe first mission of the Jewish forces was to hold on against the Arab armies and stop them, although the Arabs had enjoyed major advantages (the initiative, vastly superior firepower). As the British stopped blocking the incoming Jewish immigrants and arms supply, the Israeli forces grew steadily with large numbers of immigrants and weapons, that allowed the Haganah to transform itself from a paramilitary force into a real army. Initially, the fighting was handled mainly by the Haganah, along with the smaller Jewish militant groups Irgun and Lehi. On 26 May 1948, Israel established the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), incorporating these forces into one military under a central command.\nSouthern front \u2013 Negev.\nThe Egyptian force, the largest among the Arab armies, invaded from the south.\nOn 15 May 1948, the Egyptians attacked two settlements: Nirim, using artillery, armoured cars carrying cannons, and Bren carriers; and Kfar Darom using artillery, tanks and aircraft. The Egyptians' attacks met fierce resistance from the few and lightly armed defenders of both settlements, and failed. On 19 May the Egyptians attacked Yad Mordechai, where an inferior force of 100 Israelis armed with nothing more than rifles, a medium machinegun and a PIAT anti-tank weapon, held up a column of 2,500 Egyptians, well-supported by armour, artillery and air units, for five days. The Egyptians took heavy losses, while the losses sustained by the defenders were comparatively light.\nOne of the Egyptian force's two main columns made its way northwards along the shoreline, through what is today the Gaza Strip and the other column advanced eastwards toward Beersheba. To secure their flanks, the Egyptians attacked and laid siege to a number of kibbutzim in the Negev, among those Kfar Darom, Nirim, Yad Mordechai, and Negba. The Israeli defenders held out fiercely for days against vastly superior forces, and managed to buy valuable time for the IDF's Givati Brigade to prepare to stop the Egyptian drive on Tel Aviv.\nOn 28 May the Egyptians renewed their northern advance, and stopped at a destroyed bridge north to Isdud. The Givati Brigade reported this advance but no fighters were sent to confront the Egyptians. Had the Egyptians wished to continue their advance northward, towards Tel Aviv, there would have been no Israeli force to block them.\nFrom 29 May to 3 June, Israeli forces stopped the Egyptian drive north in Operation Pleshet. In the first combat mission performed by Israel's fledgling air force, four Avia S-199s attacked an Egyptian armoured column of 500 vehicles on its way to Isdud. The Israeli planes dropped 70 kilogram bombs and strafed the column, although their machine guns jammed quickly. Two of the planes crashed, killing a pilot. The attack caused the Egyptians to scatter, and they had lost the initiative by the time they had regrouped. Following the air attack, Israeli forces constantly bombarded Egyptian forces in Isdud with \"Napoleonchik\" cannons, and IDF patrols engaged in small-scale harassment of Egyptian lines. Following another air attack, the Givati Brigade launched a counterattack. Although the counterattack was repulsed, the Egyptian offensive was halted as Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive, and the initiative shifted to Israel.\nOn 6 June, in the Battle of Nitzanim, Egyptian forces attacked the kibbutz of Nitzanim, located between Majdal and Isdud, and the Israeli defenders surrendered after resisting for five days.\nBattles of Latrun.\nThe heaviest fighting occurred in Jerusalem and on the Jerusalem \u2013 Tel Aviv road, between Jordan's Arab Legion and Israeli forces. As part of the redeployment to deal with the Egyptian advance, the Israelis abandoned the Latrun fortress overlooking the main highway to Jerusalem, which the Arab Legion immediately seized. The Arab Legion also occupied the Latrun Monastery. From these positions, the Jordanians were able to cut off supplies to Israeli fighters and civilians in Jerusalem.\nThe Israelis attempted to take the Latrun fortress in a series of battles lasting from 24 May to 18 July. The Arab Legion held Latrun and managed to repulse the attacks. During the attempts to take Latrun, Israeli forces suffered some 586 casualties, among them Mickey Marcus, Israel's first general, who was killed by friendly fire. The Arab Legion also took losses, losing 90 dead and some 200 wounded up to 29 May.\nThe besieged Israeli Jerusalem was only saved via the opening of the so-called \"Burma Road\", a makeshift bypass road built by Israeli forces that allowed Israeli supply convoys to pass into Jerusalem. Parts of the area where the road was built were cleared of Jordanian snipers in May and the road was completed on 14 June. Supplies had already begun passing through before the road was completed, with the first convoy passing through on the night of 1\u20132 June. The Jordanians spotted the activity and attempted to shell the road, but were ineffective, as it could not be seen. However, Jordanian sharpshooters killed several road workers, and an attack on 9 June left eight Israelis dead. On 18 July, elements of the Harel Brigade took about 10 villages to the south of Latrun to enlarge and secure the area of the Burma Road.\nThe Arab Legion was able to repel an Israeli attack on Latrun. The Jordanians launched two counterattacks, temporarily taking Beit Susin before being forced back, and capturing Gezer after a fierce battle, which was retaken by two Palmach squads the same evening.\nBattle for Jerusalem.\nThe Jordanians in Latrun cut off supplies to western Jerusalem. Though some supplies, mostly munitions, were airdropped into the city, the shortage of food, water, fuel and medicine was acute. The Israeli forces were seriously short of food, water and ammunition.\nKing Abdullah ordered Glubb Pasha, the commander of the Arab Legion, to enter Jerusalem on 17 May. The Arab Legion fired 10,000 artillery and mortar shells a day, and also attacked West Jerusalem with sniper fire.\nHeavy house-to-house fighting occurred between 19 and 28 May, with the Arab Legion eventually succeeding in pushing Israeli forces from the Arab neighbourhoods of Jerusalem as well as the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. The 1,500 Jewish inhabitants of the Old City's Jewish Quarter were expelled, and several hundred were detained. The Jews had to be escorted out by the Arab Legion to protect them against Palestinian Arab mobs that intended to massacre them.\nOn 22 May, Arab forces attacked kibbutz Ramat Rachel south of Jerusalem. After a fierce battle in which 31 Jordanians and 13 Israelis were killed, the defenders of Ramat Rachel withdrew, only to partially retake the kibbutz the following day. Fighting continued until 26 May, until the entire kibbutz was recaptured. Radar Hill was also taken from the Arab Legion, and held until 26 May, when the Jordanians retook it in a battle that left 19 Israelis and 2 Jordanians dead. A total of 23 attempts by the Harel Brigade to capture Radar Hill in the war failed.\nThe same day, Thomas C. Wasson, the US Consul-General in Jerusalem and a member of the UN Truce Commission was shot dead in West Jerusalem. It was disputed whether Wasson was killed by the Arabs or Israelis.\nIn mid to late October 1948, the Harel Brigade began its offensive in what was known as Operation Ha-Har, to secure the Jerusalem Corridor.\nNorthern Samaria.\nAn Iraqi force consisting of two infantry and one armoured brigade crossed the Jordan River from northern Jordan, attacking the Israeli settlement of Gesher with little success. Following this defeat, Iraqi forces moved into the strategic triangle bounded by the Arab towns Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm. On 25 May, they were making their way towards Netanya, when they were stopped. On 29 May, an Israeli attack against the Iraqis led to three days of heavy fighting over Jenin, but Iraqi forces managed to hold their positions. After these battles, the Iraqi forces became stationary and their involvement in the war effectively ended.\nIraqi forces failed in their attacks on Israeli settlements with the most notable battle taking place at Gesher, and instead took defensive positions around Jenin, Nablus, and Tulkarm, from where they could put pressure on the Israeli center. On 25 May, Iraqi forces advanced from Tulkarm, taking Geulim and reaching Kfar Yona and Ein Vered on the Tulkarm-Netanya road. The Alexandroni Brigade then stopped the Iraqi advance and retook Geulim. The IDF Carmeli and Golani Brigades attempted to capture Jenin during an offensive launched on 31 May, but were defeated in course of the subsequent battle by an Iraqi counterattack.\nNorthern front \u2013 Lake of Galilee.\nOn 14 May Syria entered Palestine with the 1st Infantry Brigade supported by a battalion of armoured cars, a company of French R 35 and R 37 tanks, an artillery battalion and other units. The Syrian president, Shukri al-Quwwatli instructed his troops in the front, \"to destroy the Zionists\". \"The situation was very grave. There aren't enough rifles. There are no heavy weapons,\" Ben-Gurion told the Israeli Cabinet. On 15 May, the Syrian forces turned to the eastern and southern Sea of Galilee shores, and attacked Samakh the neighbouring Tegart fort and the settlements of Sha'ar HaGolan, Ein Gev, but they were bogged down by resistance. Later, they attacked Samakh using tanks and aircraft, and on 18 May they succeeded in conquering Samakh and occupied the abandoned Sha'ar HaGolan.\nOn 21 May, the Syrian army was stopped at kibbutz Degania Alef in the north, where local militia reinforced by elements of the Carmeli Brigade halted Syrian armoured forces with Molotov cocktails, hand grenades and a single PIAT. One tank that was disabled by Molotov cocktails and hand grenades still remains at the kibbutz. The remaining Syrian forces were driven off the next day by four Napoleonchik mountain guns \u2013 Israel's first use of artillery during the war. Following the Syrian forces' defeat at the Deganias a few days later, they abandoned the Samakh village. The Syrians were forced to besiege the kibbutz rather than advance. One author claims that the main reason for the Syrian defeat was the Syrian soldiers' low regard for the Israelis who they believed would not stand and fight against the Arab army.\nOn 6 June, the 3rd battalion of the Lebanese Army took Al-Malkiyya and Qadas in what became the only intervention of the Lebanese army during the war, handing the towns over to the Arab Liberation Army and withdrawing on 8 July.\nOn 6 June, Syrian forces attacked Mishmar HaYarden, but they were repulsed. On 10 June, the Syrians overran Mishmar HaYarden and advanced to the main road, where they were stopped by units of the Oded Brigade. Subsequently, the Syrians reverted to a defensive posture, conducting only a few minor attacks on small, exposed Israeli settlements.\nPalestinian forces.\nIn the continuity of the civil war between Jewish and Arab forces that had begun in 1947, battles between Israeli forces and Palestinian Arab militias took place, particularly in the Lydda, al-Ramla, Jerusalem, and Haifa areas. On 23 May, the Alexandroni Brigade captured Tantura, south of Haifa, from Arab forces. On 2 June, Holy War Army commander Hasan Salama was killed in a battle with Haganah at Ras al-Ein.\nAir operations.\nAll Jewish aviation assets were placed under the control of the \"Sherut Avir\" (Air Service, known as the SA) in November 1947 and flying operations began in the following month from a small civil airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv called Sde Dov, with the first ground support operation (in an RWD-13) taking place on 17 December. The Galilee Squadron was formed at Yavne'el in March 1948, and the Negev Squadron was formed at Nir-Am in April. By 10 May, when the SA suffered its first combat loss, there were three flying units, an air staff, maintenance facilities and logistics support. At the outbreak of the war on 15 May, the SA became the Israeli Air Force. With its fleet of light planes it was no match for Arab forces during the first few weeks of the war with their T-6s, Spitfires, C-47s, and Avro Ansons.\nOn 15 May, with the beginning of the war, four Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF) Spitfires attacked Tel Aviv, bombing Sde Dov Airfield, where the bulk of Sherut Avir's aircraft were concentrated, as well as the Reading Power Station. Several aircraft were destroyed, some others were damaged, and five Israelis were killed. Throughout the following hours, additional waves of Egyptian aircraft bombed and strafed targets around Tel Aviv, although these raids had little effect. One Spitfire was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and its pilot was taken prisoner.\nThroughout the next six days, the REAF continued to attack Tel Aviv, causing civilian casualties. On 18 May, Egyptian warplanes attacked the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station, killing 42 people and wounding 100. In addition to their attacks on Tel Aviv, the Egyptians bombed rural settlements and airfields, though few casualties were caused in these raids.\nAt the outset of the war, the REAF was able to attack Israel with near impunity, due to the lack of Israeli fighter aircraft to intercept them, and met only ground fire.\nAs more effective air defences were transferred to Tel Aviv, the Egyptians began taking significant aircraft losses. As a result of these losses, as well as the loss of five Spitfires downed by the British when the Egyptians mistakenly attacked RAF Ramat David, the Egyptian air attacks became less frequent. By the end of May 1948, almost the entire REAF Spitfire squadron based in El Arish had been lost, including many of its best pilots.\nAlthough lacking fighter or bomber aircraft, in the first few days of the war, Israel's embryonic air force still attacked Arab targets, with light aircraft being utilised as makeshift bombers, striking Arab encampments and columns. The raids were mostly carried out at night to avoid interception by Arab fighter aircraft. These attacks usually had little effect, except on morale.\nThe balance of air power soon began to swing in favour of the Israeli Air Force following the arrival of 25 Avia S-199s from Czechoslovakia, the first of which arrived in Israel on 20 May. Ironically, Israel was using the Avia S-199, an inferior derivative of the Bf 109 designed in Nazi Germany to counter British-designed Spitfires flown by Egypt. Throughout the rest of the war, Israel would acquire more Avia fighters, as well as 62 Spitfires from Czechoslovakia. On 28 May 1948, Sherut Avir became the Israeli Air Force.\nMany of the pilots who fought for the Israeli Air Force were foreign volunteers or mercenaries, including many World War II veterans.\nOn 3 June, Israel scored its first victory in aerial combat when Israeli pilot Modi Alon shot down a pair of Egyptian DC-3s that had just bombed Tel Aviv. Although Tel Aviv would see additional raids by fighter aircraft, there would be no more raids by bombers for the rest of the war. From then on, the Israeli Air Force began engaging the Arab air forces in air-to-air combat. The first dogfight took place on 8 June, when an Israeli fighter plane flown by Gideon Lichtman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. By the fall of 1948, the IAF had achieved air superiority and had superior firepower and more knowledgeable personnel, many of whom had seen action in World War II. Israeli planes then began intercepting and engaging Arab aircraft on bombing missions.\nFollowing Israeli air attacks on Egyptian and Iraqi columns, the Egyptians repeatedly bombed Ekron Airfield, where IAF fighters were based. During a 30 May raid, bombs aimed for Ekron hit central Rehovot, killing 7 civilians and wounding 30. In response to this, and probably to the Jordanian victories at Latrun, Israel began bombing targets in Arab cities. On the night of 31 May/1 June, the first Israeli raid on an Arab capital took place when three IAF planes flew to Amman and dropped several dozen 55 and 110-pound bombs, hitting the King's Palace and an adjacent British airfield. Some 12 people were killed and 30 wounded. During the attack, an RAF hangar was damaged, as were some British aircraft. The British threatened that in the event of another such attack, they would shoot down the attacking aircraft and bomb Israeli airfields, and as a result, Israeli aircraft did not attack Amman again for the rest of the war. Israel also bombed Arish, Gaza, Damascus, and Cairo. Israeli Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers flying to Israel from Czechoslovakia bombed Egypt on their way.\nSea battles.\nAt the outset of the war, the Israeli Navy consisted of three former Aliyah Bet ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in Haifa harbour, where they were tied up at the breakwater. Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background \u2013 one, the INS \"Eilat\", was an ex-US Coast Guard icebreaker, and the other two, the INS \"Haganah\" and INS \"Wedgwood\", had been Royal Canadian Navy corvettes.\nThe ships were put into minimum running condition by contractors dressed as stevedores and port personnel, who were able to work in the engine rooms and below deck. The work had to be clandestine to avoid arousing British suspicion. On 21 May 1948, the three ships set sail for Tel Aviv, and were made to look like ships that had been purchased by foreign owners for commercial use. In Tel Aviv, the ships were fitted with small field guns dating to the late 19th century and anti-aircraft guns.\nAfter the British left Haifa port on 30 June, Haifa became the main base of the Israeli Navy. In October 1948, a submarine chaser was purchased from the United States. The warships were manned by former merchant seamen, former crewmembers of Aliyah Bet ships, Israelis who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II, and foreign volunteers. The newly refurbished and crewed warships served on coastal patrol duties and bombarded Egyptian coastal installations in and around the Gaza area all the way to Port Said.\nIsraeli use of biological warfare.\nResearch by Israeli historians Benny Morris and Benjamin Kedar show that during the 1948 war, Israel conducted a biological warfare operation codenamed Cast Thy Bread. According to Morris and Kedar, the Haganah initially used typhoid bacteria to contaminate water wells in newly cleared Arab villages to prevent the population including militiamen from returning. Later, the biological warfare campaign expanded to include Jewish settlements that were in imminent danger of being captured by Arab troops and inhabited Arab towns not slated for capture. There were also plans to expand the biological warfare campaign into other Arab states including Egypt, Lebanon and Syria, but they were not carried out.\nEnd of the first phase.\nThroughout the following days, the Arabs were only able to make limited gains due to fierce Israeli resistance, and were quickly driven off their new holdings by Israeli counterattacks.\nAs the war progressed, the IDF managed to field more troops than the Arab forces. In July 1948, the IDF had 63,000 troops; by early spring 1949, they had 115,000. The Arab armies had an estimated 40,000 troops in July 1948, rising to 55,000 in October 1948, and slightly more by the spring of 1949.\nUpon the implementation of the truce, the IDF had control over nine Arab cities and towns or mixed cities and towns: New Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Safed, Tiberias, Baysan (Beit She'an), Samakh and Yibna (Yavne). Another city, Jenin, was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, Mishmar HaYarden, was in the territory of the proposed Jewish State according to Resolution 181.\nWithin the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the Lod Airport and pumping station near Antipatris, which were within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, were under the control of the Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of the proposed Jewish State and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometres of the proposed Jewish State were under the control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometres of the proposed Arab State were under the control of the IDF. This figure ignores the Negev desert which was not under any absolute control of either side.\nIn the period between the invasion and the first truce the Syrian army had 315 of its men killed and 400\u2013500 injured; the Iraqi expeditionary force had 200 of its men killed and 500 injured; the Jordanian Arab Legion had 300 of its men killed and 400\u2013500 injured (including irregulars and Palestinian volunteers fighting under the Jordanians); the Egyptian army had 600 of its men killed and 1,400 injured (including irregulars from the Muslim Brotherhood); the ALA, which returned to fight in early June, had 100 of its men killed or injured. 800 Jews were taken hostage by the Arabs and 1,300 Arabs were taken hostage by the Jews, mostly Palestinians.\nFirst truce: 11 June \u2013 8 July 1948.\nThe UN declared a truce on 29 May, which came into effect on 11 June and lasted 28 days.\nThe truce was designed to last 28 days and an arms embargo was declared with the intention that neither side would make any gains from the truce. Neither side respected the truce; both found ways around the restrictions placed on them. Both the Israelis and the Arabs used this time to improve their positions, a direct violation of the terms of the ceasefire.\nReinforcements.\nAt the time of the truce, the British view was that \"the Jews are too weak in armament to achieve spectacular success\". As the truce commenced, a British officer stationed in Haifa stated that the four-week-long truce \"would certainly be exploited by the Jews to continue military training and reorganization while the Arabs would waste [them] feuding over the future divisions of the spoils\". During the truce, the Israelis sought to bolster their forces by massive import of arms. The IDF was able to acquire weapons from Czechoslovakia as well as improve training of forces and reorganisation of the army during this time. Yitzhak Rabin, an IDF commander at the time of the war and later Israel's fifth Prime Minister, stated \"[w]ithout the arms from Czechoslovakia... it is very doubtful whether we would have been able to conduct the war\".\nThe Israeli army increased its manpower from approximately 30,000\u201335,000 men to almost 65,000 during the truce due to mobilisation and the constant immigration into Israel. It was also able to increase its arms supply to more than 25,000 rifles, 5,000 machine guns, and fifty million bullets. As well as violating the arms and personnel embargo, they also sent fresh units to the front lines, much as their Arab enemies did.\nDuring the truce, Irgun attempted to bring in a private arms shipment aboard a ship called \"Altalena\". Fearing a coup by the Irgun (at the time the IDF was in the process of integrating various pre-independence political factions), Ben-Gurion ordered that the arms be confiscated by force. After some miscommunication, the army was ordered by Ben-Gurion to sink the ship. Sixteen Irgun members and three IDF soldiers were killed in the fighting.\nUN mediator Bernadotte.\nThe ceasefire was overseen by UN mediator Folke Bernadotte and a team of UN Observers made up of army officers from Belgium, United States, Sweden and France.\nBernadotte was voted in by the General Assembly to \"assure the safety of the holy places, to safeguard the well-being of the population, and to promote 'a peaceful adjustment of the future situation of Palestine'\". Folke Bernadotte reported:\n During the period of the truce, three violations occurred ... of such a serious nature:\nAfter the truce was in place, Bernadotte began to address the issue of achieving a political settlement. The main obstacles in his opinion were \"the Arab world's continued rejection of the existence of a Jewish state, whatever its borders; Israel's new 'philosophy', based on its increasing military strength, of ignoring the partition boundaries and conquering what additional territory it could; and the emerging Palestinian Arab refugee problem\".\nTaking all the issues into account, Bernadotte presented a new partition plan. He proposed there be a Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel and that a \"Union\" \"be established between the two sovereign states of Israel and Jordan (which now included the West Bank); that the Negev, or part of it, be included in the Arab state and that Western Galilee, or part of it, be included in Israel; that the whole of Jerusalem be part of the Arab state, with the Jewish areas enjoying municipal autonomy and that Lydda Airport and Haifa be 'free ports' \u2013 presumably free of Israeli or Arab sovereignty\". Israel rejected the proposal, in particular the aspect of losing control of Jerusalem, but they did agree to extend the truce for another month. The Arabs rejected both the extension of the truce and the proposal.\nSecond phase: 8\u201318 July 1948 (\"Ten Day Battles\").\nOn 8 July, the day before the expiration of the truce, Egyptian forces under General Muhammad Naguib renewed the war by attacking Negba. The following day, Israeli air forces launched a simultaneous offensive on all three fronts, ranging from Quneitra to Arish and the Egyptian air force bombed the city of Tel Aviv. During the fighting, the Israelis were able to open a lifeline to a number of besieged kibbutzim.\nThe fighting continued for ten days until the UN Security Council issued the Second Truce on 18 July. During those 10 days, the fighting was dominated by large-scale Israeli offensives and a defensive posture from the Arab side.\nSouthern front.\nIn the south, the IDF carried out several offensives, including Operation An-Far and Operation Death to the Invader. The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars. According to Amnon Neumann, a Palmach veteran of the Southern front, hardly any Arab villages in the south fought back, due to the miserable poverty of their means and lack of weapons, and suffered expulsion. What slight resistance was offered was quelled by an artillery barrage, followed by the storming of the village, whose residents were expelled and houses destroyed.\nOn 12 July, the Egyptians launched an offensive action, and again attacked Negba, which they had previously failed to capture, using three infantry battalions, an armoured battalion, and an artillery regiment. In the battle that followed, the Egyptians were repulsed, suffering 200\u2013300 casualties, while the Israelis lost 5 dead and 16 wounded.\nAfter failing to take Negba, the Egyptians turned their attention to more isolated settlements and positions. On 14 July, an Egyptian attack on Gal On was driven off by a minefield and by resistance from Gal On's residents.\nThe Egyptians then assaulted the lightly defended village of Be'erot Yitzhak. The Egyptians managed to penetrate the village perimeter, but the defenders concentrated in an inner position in the village and fought off the Egyptian advance until IDF reinforcements arrived and drove out the attackers. The Egyptians suffered an estimated 200 casualties, while the Israelis had 17 dead and 15 wounded. The battle was one of Egypt's last offensive actions during the war, and the Egyptians did not attack any Israeli villages following this battle.\nOperation Dani.\nIsraeli Operation Dani was the most important Israeli offensive, aimed at securing and enlarging the corridor between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv by capturing the roadside cities Lod (Lydda) and Ramle. In a second planned stage of the operation the fortified positions of Latrun \u2013 overlooking the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway \u2013 and the city of Ramallah were also to be captured. Hadita, near Latrun, was captured by the Israelis at a cost of nine dead.\nThe objectives of Operation Dani were to capture territory east of Tel Aviv and then to push inland and relieve the Jewish population and forces in Jerusalem. Lydda had become an important military center in the region, lending support to Arab military activities elsewhere, and Ramle was one of the main obstacles blocking Jewish transportation. Lydda was defended by a local militia of around 1,000 residents, with an Arab Legion contingent of 125\u2013300.\nOn 10 July, Glubb Pasha ordered the defending Arab Legion troops to \"make arrangements...for a phony war\".\nLydda and al-Ramla.\nThe IDF forces gathered to attack the city numbered around 8,000. It was the first operation where several brigades were involved. The city was attacked from the north via Majdal al-Sadiq and al-Muzayri'a, and from the east via Khulda, al-Qubab, Jimzu and Daniyal. Bombers were also used for the first time in the conflict to bombard the city. The IDF captured the city on 11 July.\nThe civilian populations of Lydda and Ramle (50,000-70,000 people) were violently expelled. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed in multiple mass killing events in Lydda, and many were expelled without the provision of transport vehicles, as had been done in Ramle; many of the evictees died on the long walk under the hot July sun.\nBattle of Latrun.\nOn 15\u201316 July, an attack on Latrun took place but did not manage to occupy the fort. A desperate second attempt occurred on 18 July by units from the Yiftach Brigade equipped with armoured vehicles, including two Cromwell tanks, but that attack also failed. Despite the second truce, which began on 18 July, the Israeli efforts to conquer Latrun continued until 20 July.\nJerusalem.\nOperation Kedem's aim was to secure the Old City of Jerusalem, but fewer resources were allocated. The operation failed. Originally the operation was to begin on 8 July, immediately after the first truce, by Irgun and Lehi forces. However, it was delayed by David Shaltiel, possibly because he did not trust their ability after their failure to capture Deir Yassin without Haganah assistance.\nIrgun forces commanded by Yehuda Lapidot were to break through at the New Gate, Lehi was to break through the wall stretching from the New Gate to the Jaffa Gate, and the Beit Horon Battalion was to strike from Mount Zion.\nThe battle was planned to begin on the Shabbat, at 20:00 on 16 July, two days before the second ceasefire of the war. The plan went wrong from the beginning and was postponed first to 23:00 and then to midnight. It was not until 02:30 that the battle actually began. The Irgun managed to break through at the New Gate, but the other forces failed in their missions. At 05:45 on 17 July, Shaltiel ordered a retreat and to cease hostilities.\nOn 14 July 1948, Irgun occupied the Arab village of Malha after a fierce battle. Several hours later, the Arabs launched a counterattack, but Israeli reinforcements arrived, and the village was retaken at a cost of 17 dead.\nSouthern Galilee.\nThe second plan was Operation Dekel, which was aimed at capturing the Lower Galilee including Nazareth. Nazareth was captured on 16 July, and by the time the second truce took effect at 19:00 18 July, the whole Lower Galilee from Haifa Bay to the Sea of Galilee was captured by Israel.\nEastern Galilee.\nOperation Brosh was launched in a failed attempt to dislodge Syrian forces from the Eastern Galilee and the Benot Yaakov Bridge. During the operation, 200 Syrians and 100 Israelis were killed.\nSecond truce: 18 July \u2013 15 October 1948.\nAt 19:00 on 18 July, the second truce of the conflict went into effect after intense diplomatic efforts by the UN.\nOn 16 September, Count Folke Bernadotte proposed a new partition for Palestine in which the Negev would be divided between Jordan and Egypt, and Jordan would annexe Lydda and Ramla. There would be a Jewish state in the whole of Galilee, with the frontier running from Faluja northeast towards Ramla and Lydda. Jerusalem would be internationalised, with municipal autonomy for the city's Jewish and Arab inhabitants, the Port of Haifa would be a free port, and Lydda Airport would be a free airport. All Palestinian refugees would be granted the right of return, and those who chose not to return would be compensated for lost property. The UN would control and regulate Jewish immigration.\nThe plan was once again rejected by both sides. On the next day, 17 September, Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem by the militant Zionist group Lehi. A four-man team ambushed Bernadotte's motorcade in Jerusalem, killing him and a French UN observer sitting next to him. Lehi saw Bernadotte as a British and Arab puppet, and thus a serious threat to the emerging State of Israel, and feared that the provisional Israeli government would accept the plan, which it considered disastrous. Unbeknownst to Lehi, the government had already decided to reject it and resume combat in a month. Bernadotte's deputy, American Ralph Bunche, replaced him.\nOn 22 September 1948, the Provisional State Council of Israel passed the Area of Jurisdiction and Powers Ordnance, 5708\u20131948. The law officially added to Israel's size by annexing all land it had captured since the war began. It also declared that from then on, any part of Palestine captured by the Israeli army would automatically become part of Israel.\nLittle triangle pocket.\nThe Arab villagers of the area known as the \"Little Triangle\" south of Haifa repeatedly fired at Israeli traffic along the main road from Tel Aviv to Haifa and were supplied by the Iraqis from northern Samaria. The sniping at traffic continued during the Second Truce. The poorly planned assaults on 18 June and 8 July had failed to dislodge Arab militia from their superior positions. The Israelis launched Operation Shoter on 24 July in order to gain control of the main road to Haifa and to destroy all the enemy in the area.\nIsraeli assaults on 24 and 25 July were beaten back with stiff resistance. The Israelis then broke the Arab defences with a combined infantry and armour assault backed by heavy shelling and bombing. Three Arab villages surrendered, and most of the inhabitants fled before and during the attack. The Israeli soldiers and aircraft struck one of the Arab retreat routes, killing 60 Arab soldiers.. Most of the inhabitants fled before and during the attack, reaching northern Samaria; hundreds were forcibly expelled during the following days. At least a hundred militiamen and civilians were killed.\nThe Arabs claimed that the Israelis had massacred Arab civilians, but the Israelis rejected the claims. A United Nations investigation found no evidence of a massacre. Following the operation, the Tel Aviv-Haifa road was opened to Israeli military and civilian traffic, and Arab roadblocks along the route were removed. Traffic along the Haifa-Hadera coastal railway was also restored.\nThird phase: 15 October 1948 \u2013 10 March 1949.\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the northern and southern borders of Israel.\nNorthern front \u2013 Galilee.\nOn 22 October, the third truce went into effect. Irregular Arab forces refused to recognise the truce, and continued to harass Israeli forces and settlements in the north. On the same day that the truce came into effect, the Arab Liberation Army violated the truce by attacking Manara, capturing the strongpoint of Sheikh Abed, repulsing counterattacks by local Israeli units, and ambushed Israeli forces attempting to relieve Manara. The IDF's Carmeli Brigade lost 33 dead and 40 wounded. Manara and Misgav Am were totally cut off, and Israel's protests at the UN failed to change the situation.\nOn 24 October, the IDF launched Operation Hiram and captured the entire upper Galilee area, driving the ALA back to Lebanon, and ambushing and destroying an entire Syrian battalion. The Israeli force of four infantry brigades was commanded by Moshe Carmel. The entire operation lasted just 60 hours, during which numerous villages were captured, often after locals or Arab forces put up resistance. Arab losses were estimated at 400 dead and 550 taken prisoner, with low Israeli casualties.\nSome prisoners were reportedly executed by the Israeli forces. An estimated 50,000 Palestinian refugees fled into Lebanon, some of them fleeing ahead of the advancing forces, and some expelled from villages which had resisted, while the Arab inhabitants of those villages which had remained at peace were allowed to remain and became Israeli citizens. The villagers of Iqrit and Birim were persuaded to leave their homes by Israeli authorities, who promised them that they would be allowed to return. Israel eventually decided not to allow them to return, and offered them financial compensation, which they refused to accept.\nAt the end of the month, the IDF had captured the whole of Galilee, driven all ALA forces out of Israel, and had advanced into Lebanon to the Litani River, occupying thirteen Lebanese villages. In the village of Hula, two Israeli officers killed between 35 and 58 prisoners as retaliation for the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. Both officers were later put on trial for their actions.\nNegev.\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the borders of Israel. However, invading the West Bank might have brought into the borders of the expanding State of Israel a massive Arab population it could not absorb. The Negev desert was an empty space for expansion, so the main war effort shifted to Negev from early October. Israel decided to destroy or at least drive out the Egyptian expeditionary force since the Egyptian front lines were too vulnerable as permanent borders.\nOn 15 October, the IDF launched Operation Yoav in the northern Negev. Its goal was to drive a wedge between the Egyptian forces along the coast and the Beersheba-Hebron-Jerusalem road and ultimately to conquer the whole Negev. This was a special concern on the Israeli part because of a British diplomatic campaign to have the entire Negev handed over to Egypt and Jordan, and which thus made Ben-Gurion anxious to have Israeli forces in control of the Negev as soon as possible.\nOperation Yoav was headed by the Southern Front commander Yigal Allon. Committed to Yoav were three infantry and one armoured brigades, who were given the task of breaking through the Egyptian lines. The Egyptian positions were badly weakened by the lack of a defence in depth, which meant that once the IDF had broken through the Egyptian lines, there was little to stop them. The operation was a huge success, shattering the Egyptian ranks and forcing the Egyptian Army from the northern Negev, Beersheba and Ashdod.\nIn the so-called \"Faluja Pocket\", an encircled Egyptian force was able to hold out for four months until the 1949 Armistice Agreements, when the village was peacefully transferred to Israel and the Egyptian troops left. Four warships of the Israeli Navy provided support by bombarding Egyptian shore installations in the Ashkelon area, and preventing the Egyptian Navy from evacuating retreating Egyptian troops by sea.\nOn 19 October, Operation Ha-Har began in the Jerusalem Corridor, while a naval battle also took place near Majdal, with three Israeli corvettes facing an Egyptian corvette with air support. An Israeli sailor was killed and four wounded, and two of the ships were damaged. One Egyptian plane was shot down, but the corvette escaped. Israeli naval vessels also shelled Majdal on 17 October, and Gaza on 21 October, with air support from the Israeli Air Force. The same day, the IDF captured Beersheba, and took 120 Egyptian soldiers prisoner. On 22 October, Israeli naval commandos using explosive boats sank the Egyptian flagship \"Emir Farouk\", and damaged an Egyptian minesweeper.\nOn 9 November 1948, the IDF launched Operation Shmone to capture the Tegart fort in the village of Iraq Suwaydan. The fort's Egyptian defenders had previously repulsed eight attempts to take it, including two during Operation Yoav. Israeli forces bombarded the fort before an assault with artillery and airstrikes by B-17 bombers. After breaching the outlying fences without resistance, the Israelis blew a hole in the fort's outer wall, prompting the 180 Egyptian soldiers manning the fort to surrender without a fight. The defeat prompted the Egyptians to evacuate several nearby positions, including hills the IDF had failed to take by force. Meanwhile, IDF forces took Iraq Suwaydan itself after a fierce battle, losing 6 dead and 14 wounded.\nFrom 5 to 7 December, the IDF conducted Operation Assaf to take control of the Western Negev. The main assaults were spearheaded by mechanised forces, while Golani Brigade infantry covered the rear. An Egyptian counterattack was repulsed. The Egyptians planned another counterattack, but it failed after Israeli aerial reconnaissance revealed Egyptian preparations, and the Israelis launched a preemptive strike. About 100 Egyptians were killed, and 5 tanks were destroyed, with the Israelis losing 5 killed and 30 wounded.\nOn 22 December, the IDF launched Operation Horev, also called Operation Ayin. The goal of the operation was to drive all remaining Egyptian forces from the Negev, destroying the Egyptian threat on Israel's southern communities and forcing the Egyptians into a ceasefire. During five days of fighting, the Israelis secured the Western Negev, expelling all Egyptian forces from the area.\nIsraeli forces subsequently launched raids into the Nitzana area, and entered the Sinai Peninsula on 28 December. The IDF captured Umm Katef and Abu Ageila, and advanced north towards Al Arish, with the goal of encircling the entire Egyptian expeditionary force. Israeli forces pulled out of the Sinai on 2 January 1949 following joint British-American pressure and a British threat of military action. IDF forces regrouped at the border with the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces attacked Rafah the following day, and after several days of fighting, Egyptian forces in the Gaza Strip were surrounded. The Egyptians agreed to negotiate a ceasefire on 7 January, and the IDF subsequently pulled out of Gaza. According to Morris, \"the inequitable and unfair rules of engagement: the Arabs could launch offensives with impunity, but international interventions always hampered and restrained Israel's counterattacks.\"\nOn 28 December, the Alexandroni Brigade failed to take the Falluja Pocket, but managed to seize Iraq el-Manshiyeh and temporarily hold it. The Egyptians counterattacked, but were mistaken for a friendly force and allowed to advance, trapping a large number of men. The Israelis lost 87 soldiers.\nOn 5 March, Operation Uvda was launched following nearly a month of reconnaissance, with the goal of securing the Southern Negev from Jordan. The IDF entered and secured the territory, but did not meet significant resistance along the way, as the area was already designated to be part of the Jewish state in the UN Partition Plan, and the operation meant to establish Israeli sovereignty over the territory rather than actually conquer it. The Golani, Negev, and Alexandroni brigades participated in the operation, together with some smaller units and with naval support.\nOn 10 March, Israeli forces secured the Southern Negev, reaching the southern tip of Palestine: Umm Rashrash on the Red Sea (where Eilat was built later) and taking it without a battle. Israeli soldiers raised a hand-made Israeli flag (\"The Ink Flag\") at 16:00 on 10 March, claiming Umm Rashrash for Israel. The raising of the Ink Flag is considered to be the end of the war.\nAnglo-Israeli air clashes.\nAs the fighting progressed and Israel mounted an incursion into the Sinai, the Royal Air Force began conducting almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai. RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside Royal Egyptian Air Force planes. High-flying British aircraft frequently flew over Haifa and Ramat David Airbase, and became known to the Israelis as the \"shuftykeit.\"\nOn 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance De Havilland Mosquito of No. 13 Squadron RAF was shot down by an Israeli Air Force P-51 Mustang flown by American volunteer Wayne Peake as it flew over the Galilee towards Hatzor Airbase. Peake opened fire with his cannons, causing a fire to break out in the port engine. The aircraft turned to sea and lowered its altitude, then exploded and crashed off Ashdod. The pilot and navigator were both killed.\nJust before noon on 7 January 1949, four Spitfire FR18s from No. 208 Squadron RAF on a reconnaissance mission in the Deir al-Balah area flew over an Israeli convoy that had been attacked by five Egyptian Spitfires fifteen minutes earlier. The pilots had spotted smoking vehicles and were drawn to the scene out of curiosity. Two planes dived to below 500\u00a0feet altitude to take pictures of the convoy, while the remaining two covered them from 1,500\u00a0feet.\nIsraeli soldiers on the ground, alerted by the sound of the approaching Spitfires and fearing another Egyptian air attack, opened fire with machine guns. One Spitfire was shot down by a tank-mounted machine gun, while the other was lightly damaged and rapidly pulled up. The remaining three Spitfires were then attacked by patrolling IAF Spitfires flown by Chalmers Goodlin and John McElroy, volunteers from the United States and Canada respectively. All three Spitfires were shot down, and one pilot was killed.\nTwo pilots were captured by Israeli soldiers and taken to Tel Aviv for interrogation, and were later released. Another was rescued by Bedouins and handed over to the Egyptian Army, which turned him over to the RAF. Later that day, four RAF Spitfires from the same squadron escorted by seven Hawker Tempests from No. 213 Squadron RAF and eight from No. 6 Squadron RAF went searching for the lost planes, and were attacked by four IAF Spitfires. The Israeli formation was led by Ezer Weizman. The remaining three were manned by Weizman's wingman Alex Jacobs and American volunteers Bill Schroeder and Caesar Dangott.\nThe Tempests found they could not jettison their external fuel tanks, and some had non-operational guns. Schroeder shot down a British Tempest, killing pilot David Tattersfield, and Weizman severely damaged a British plane flown by Douglas Liquorish. Weizman's plane and two other British aircraft suffered light damage during the engagement. During the battle, British Tempest pilots treated British Spitfires as potential Israeli aircraft until the British Spitfire pilots were told by radio to wiggle their wings to be more clearly identifiable. The engagement ended when the Israelis realised the danger of their situation and disengaged, returning to Hatzor Airbase.\nIsraeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion personally ordered the wrecks of the RAF fighters that had been shot down to be dragged into Israeli territory. Israeli troops subsequently visited the crash sites, removed various parts, and buried the other aircraft. However, the Israelis did not manage to conceal the wrecks in time to prevent British reconnaissance planes from photographing them. An RAF salvage team was deployed to recover the wrecks, entering Israeli territory during their search. Two were discovered inside Egypt, while Tattersfield's Tempest was found north of Nirim, inside Israel. Interviews with local Arabs confirmed that the Israelis had visited the crash sites to remove and bury the wrecks. Tattersfield was initially buried near the wreckage, but his body was later removed and reburied at the British War Cemetery in Ramla.\nIn response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires to attack any IAF aircraft they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The Royal Navy was placed on high alert. At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were strapped into the cockpits at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorise any retaliatory strikes.\nThe day following the incident, British pilots were issued a directive to regard any Israeli aircraft infiltrating Egyptian or Jordanian airspace as hostile and to shoot them down, but were also ordered to avoid activity close to Israel's borders. Later in January 1949, the British managed to prevent the delivery of aviation spirit and other essential fuels to Israel in retaliation for the incident. The British Foreign Office presented the Israeli government with a demand for compensation over the loss of personnel and equipment.\nUN Resolution 194.\nIn December 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194. It called to establish a UN Conciliation Commission to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states. However, many of the resolution's articles were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected by the Arab states, or were overshadowed by war as the 1948 conflict continued.\nWeapons.\nBoth sides utilized weapons that had been used in World War II by the British and French forces. Egypt's arsenal included leftover British equipment, while the Syrian arsenal included leftover French weaponry. The Israeli Defense Forces utilized an array of British, American, French and Czechoslovakian military equipment. In addition to the aforementioned, the IDF also used several Davidka mortars, which were a domestically produced weapon by Israel.\nAccording to Amitzur Ilan, \"Israel's ability to cope better with the embargo situation was, by far, her greatest strategic asset.\"\nAftermath.\n1949 Armistice Agreements.\nIn 1949, Israel signed separate armistices with Egypt on 24 February, Lebanon on 23 March, Transjordan on 3 April, and Syria on 20 July. The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered Mandate as it stood after Transjordan's independence in 1946. Israel controlled territories of about one-third more than was allocated to the Jewish State under the UN partition proposal. After the armistices, Israel had control over 78% of the territory comprising former Mandatory Palestine or some , including the entire Galilee and Jezreel Valley in the north, the whole Negev in south, West Jerusalem and the coastal plain in the center.\nThe armistice lines were known afterwards as the \"Green Line\". The Gaza Strip and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) were occupied by Egypt and Transjordan respectively. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization and Mixed Armistice Commissions were set up to monitor ceasefires, supervise the armistice agreements, to prevent isolated incidents from escalating, and assist other UN peacekeeping operations in the region.\nJust before the signing of the Israel-Transjordan armistice agreement, general Yigal Allon proposed a military offensive to conquer the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state. Ben-Gurion refused, although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British. Moreover, the results of the war were already satisfactory and Israeli leaders had to build a state.\nCasualties.\nIsrael lost 6,373 of its people, about 1% of its population at the time, in the war. About 4,000 were soldiers and the rest were civilians.\nThe exact number of Arab casualties is unknown. One estimate places the Arab death toll at 7,000, including 3,000 Palestinians, 2,000 Egyptians, 1,000 Jordanians, and 1,000 Syrians. In 1958, Palestinian historian Aref al-Aref calculated that the Arab armies' combined losses amounted to 3,700, with Egypt losing 961 regular and 200 irregular soldiers and Transjordan losing 362 regulars and 200 irregulars. According to Henry Laurens, the Palestinians suffered double the Jewish losses, with 13,000 dead, 1,953 of whom are known to have died in combat situations. Of the remainder, 4,004 remain nameless but the place, tally and date of their death is known, and a further 7,043, for whom only the place of death is known, not their identities nor the date of their death. According to Laurens, the largest part of Palestinian casualties consisted of non-combatants and corresponds to the successful operations of the Israelis.\nDemographic outcomes.\nArabs.\nDuring the 1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War that followed, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, out of approximately 1,200,000 Arabs living in former British Mandate of Palestine, a displacement known to Palestinians as the \"Nakba\". In 1951, the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees displaced from Israel was 711,000.\nThis number did not include displaced Palestinians inside Israeli-held territory. More than 400 Arab villages, and about ten Jewish villages and neighbourhoods, were depopulated during the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, most of them during 1948. According to estimate based on earlier census, the total Muslim population in Palestine was 1,143,336 in 1947. The causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus are a controversial topic among historians. After the war, around 156,000 Arabs remained in Israel and became Israeli citizens.\nDisplaced Palestinian Arabs, known as Palestinian refugees, were settled in Palestinian refugee camps throughout the Arab world. The United Nations established UNRWA as a relief and human development agency tasked with providing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees. Arab nations refused to absorb Palestinian refugees, instead keeping them in refugee camps while insisting that they be allowed to return.\nRefugee status was also passed on to their descendants, who were also largely denied citizenship in Arab states, except in Transjordan. The Arab League instructed its members to deny Palestinians citizenship \"to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right of return to their homeland.\" More than 1.4\u00a0million Palestinians still live in 58 recognised refugee camps, while more than 5\u00a0million Palestinians live outside Israel and the Palestinian territories.\nPalestinian refugees and displaced persons and the lack of a Palestinian right of return remain major issues in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.\nJews.\nIn the three years from May 1948 to the end of 1951, 700,000 Jews settled in Israel, mainly along the borders and in former Arab lands, doubling the Jewish population there. Of these, upwards of 300,000 arrived from Asian and North African states. Among them, the largest group, over 100,000, was from Iraq. The remaining came mostly from Europe, including 136,000 from the 250,000 displaced Jews of World War II living in refugee camps and urban centers in Germany, Austria, and Italy, and more than 270,000 coming from Eastern Europe, mainly Romania and , over 100,000 each.\nOn the establishment of the state, a top priority was given to a policy for the \"ingathering of exiles\", and the Mossad LeAliyah Bet gave key assistance to the Jewish Agency to organise immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, and arrange for their transport to Israel. For Ben-Gurion, a fundamental defect of the State was that \"it lacked Jews\".\nJewish immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries left for numerous reasons. The war's outcome had exacerbated Arab hostilities to local Jewish communities. News of the victory aroused messianic expectations in Libya and Yemen; Zionism had taken root in many countries; active incentives for making aliyah formed a key part of Israeli policy; and better economic prospects and security were to be expected from a Jewish state.\nSome Arab governments, Egypt, for example, held their Jewish communities hostage at times. Persecution, political instability, and news of a number of violent pogroms also played a role. Some 800,000\u20131,000,000 Jews eventually left the Arab world over the next three decades as a result of these various factors. An estimated 650,000 of the departees settled in Israel.\nHistoriography.\nSince the war, different historiographical traditions have interpreted the events of 1948 differently; in the words of the New Historian Avi Shlaim, \"each side subscribes to a different version of events.\" In the Israeli narrative, the war is Israel's War of Independence. In the Palestinian narrative, the War of 1948 is inextricable from the Nakba, the Zionist movement is one of settler colonialism, and the Israelis are seen as conquerors and the Palestinians as victims. The different narratives of 1948 reflect these different perceptions.\nAn issue affecting the historiography of 1948 is access to sources and archives, which may have been destroyed, appropriated, censored, or otherwise made unavailable to some or all researchers. Linguistic barriers represent another hurdle, as most research is published exclusively in the author's native language and is not translated.\nThe historiography of 1948 is tied to political legitimacy in the present and has implications for the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. According to Avraham Sela and Neil Caplan:A major reason for this grip of the past over the present is the unfulfilled quest of both Israelis and Palestinians for legitimacy, in one or more of the following three senses: (a) each party's sense of its own legitimacy as a national community entitled to its own sovereign state; (b) each party's willingness to grant legitimacy to at least part of the competing national narrative of the other; and (c) the international community's extension of legitimacy to the competing rights and claims of Israelis and Palestinians.The narratives of 1948 have also had implications for Palestinian refugees.211\nIsraeli narratives.\nThe Israelis, whether or not they were conquerors, were irrefutably the victors of the war, and for this reason among others, \"they were able to propagate more effectively than their opponents their version of this fateful war.\" Only in 1987 was that narrative effectively challenged outside the Arab world.\nZionist narrative.\nAvi Shlaim gives the conventional Zionist narrative or the \"old history\" of the 1948 war as follows:The conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine came to a head following the passage, on 29 November 1947, of the United Nations partition resolution that called for the establishment of two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The Jews accepted the U.N. plan despite the painful sacrifices it entailed, but the Palestinians, the neighboring Arab states, and the Arab League rejected it. Great Britain did everything in its power toward the end of the Palestine Mandate to frustrate the establishment of the Jewish state envisaged in the UN plan. With the expiry of the Mandate and the proclamation of the State of Israel, seven Arab states sent their armies into Palestine with the firm intention of strangling the Jewish state at birth. The subsequent struggle was an unequal one between a Jewish David and an Arab Goliath. The infant Jewish state fought a desperate, heroic, and ultimately successful battle for survival against overwhelming odds. During the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled to the neighboring Arab states, mainly in response to orders from their leaders and despite Jewish pleas to stay and demonstrate that peaceful coexistence was possible. After the war, the story continues, Israeli leaders sought peace with all their heart and all their might but there was no one to talk to on the other side. Arab intransigence was alone responsible for the political deadlock, which was not broken until President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem thirty years later.According to Shlaim, this narrative is \"not history in the proper sense of the word,\" as most of the literature on the war was produced\u00a0\u2013 not by professional academic historians\u00a0\u2013 but rather by participants in the war, politicians, soldiers, and state-sponsored historians, as well as by sympathetic journalists, chroniclers, and biographers. It also portrays Israelis as morally superior, lacks political analysis, and gives undue weight to \"the heroic feats of the Israeli fighters.\" This nationalist narrative was taught in Israeli schools and used for gaining legitimacy internationally.\nNew Historians.\nThe standard Zionist narrative of the war remained unchallenged outside the Arab world until the war's fortieth anniversary, when a number of critical books came out, including Simha Flapan's \"The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities\" (1987), Benny Morris's \"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem\" (1987), Ilan Papp\u00e9's \"Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1948\u201351\" (1988), and Shlaim's \"Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, the Zionist Movement and the Partition of Palestine\" (1988). These writers came to be known as New Historians or \"post-Zionists.\"\"\"\nAccording to Shlaim, the new historians disagreed with the Zionist narrative on six main points: British policy with regard to the Yishuv at the end of the Palestine Mandate, the military balance in 1948, the origins of the Palestinian refugee problem, the nature of relations between Israelis and Jordanians during the war, Arab aims in the war, and the reasons peace remained elusive after the war.\nAmong their most vitriolic critics was Shabtai Teveth, biographer of David Ben-Gurion, who published \"The New Historians,\" a series of four weekly full-page articles attacking the new historians, in Haaretz May 1989. Teveth claimed that the new historiography was flawed in its practice and that it was politically motived, that it was pro-Palestinian and aimed to delegitimize the State of Israel.\nNeo-Zionist narratives.\nIlan Papp\u00e9 identifies a turn in predominant Israeli narratives about 1948 in September 2000. In the climate of the Second Intifada and in the Post-9/11 period, \"not only were Israel's brutal military operations against the Palestinians during the new intifada seen as justified, but so was their systematic expulsion in 1948.\" Evidence of the expulsions, massacres, and war crimes of 1948 brought to light by the New Historians could no longer be ignored, but writers of what Papp\u00e9 calls a \"neo-Zionist\" narrative justified these as necessary or unavoidable.\nIn this period, the focus of Israeli historical writing on 1948 shifted largely from its human impact back to its military aspects. Neo-Zionist writers were given selective access to top-secret material, to which writers critical of Zionism would not have been given access, and much of their work was published by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.\nAmong those Papp\u00e9 associated with the neo-Zionist perspective were Benny Morris (who had become more outspokenly defensive of Zionism by this time), Daniel Gutwein, Mordechai Bar-On, Yoav Gelber, Tamir Goren, Arnon Golan, Alon Kadish, and Yoav Peleg, as well as the journal \"Techelet\" .\nPalestinian narratives.\nUnlike Israeli narratives that shifted over the decades, Palestinian narratives of 1948 have been more or less constant, focusing on Palestinians' indigenous rights to Palestine, Palestinian victimhood, dispossession, displacement, exile, statelessness, and more \"unrequited grievances against colonialism and Zionism.\" The term 'Nakba' to describe the Palestinian catastrophe in the war of 1948 was coined in Constantin Zureiq's 1948 book \"Ma'na an-Nakba\". Aref al-Aref wrote a six volume work titled \"an-Nakba\u200a\" that was published in Arabic in the 1950s.\nPalestinian narratives have focused on countering the dominant Zionist narrative; the preeminent Palestinian historian of 1948 Walid Khalidi has dedicated much of his career to disproving the official Israeli narrative that the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight was voluntary.211\nRashid Khalidi and other historians hold that \"there is no established, authoritative Palestinian master narrative.\"212 They attribute this to, among other reasons, the dispersed and fragmented state of the Palestinian community and the loss, destruction, or appropriation by Israel of relevant documents and libraries.212 Without access to much in the way of archival materials, Palestinian historians have made use of oral history.214\nArab narratives.\nIn the narratives of the wider Arab-Muslim world, 1948 is seen as an \"Arab debacle,\" representative of the region's social and political decline from its \"glorious distant past.\"210 The official narratives of Arab states on 1948 tended to be apologetic with the goal of defending their political legitimacy, while the Arab nationalists wrote with a focus on distilling and extracting historical lessons to galvanize Arab society, politics, and ideology in preparation for the next conflict with Israel\u00a0\u2013 neither approach bridled itself too much with historical accuracy.6\nWestern narratives.\nIn the United States.\nThe American journalist Joan Peters' 1984 book \"From Time Immemorial\" had a massive impact on how 1948 was understood in popular and political narratives in the United States.\nIlan Papp\u00e9 asserts the neo-Zionist narrative was pushed in the United States most passionately by Michael Walzer, and by Anita Shapira and Derek Penslar with their 2003 \"Israeli Historical Revisionism: From Left to Right\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nWorks by involved parties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncillary works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "36202", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36202", "title": "5\u03b1-Reductase 2 deficiency", "text": "5\u03b1-Reductase 2 deficiency (5\u03b1R2D) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations impairing the function of \"SRD5A2\", a gene located on chromosome 2 and encoding the enzyme 5\u03b1-reductase type 2 (5\u03b1R2). 5\u03b1R2 is expressed in specific tissues and catalyzes the transformation of testosterone (T) to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT plays a key role in the process of sexual differentiation.\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nThis rare deficiency causes atypical sex development in genetic males (people with a 46XY karyotype), with a broad spectrum of presentations most apparent in the genitalia. Many people with 5-alpha reductase deficiency are assigned female at birth based on their external genitalia. In other cases, affected infants are assigned male at birth based on their external genitalia, often an unusually small penis (micropenis) and the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). Still other affected infants may be assigned either female or male at birth as their external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female.\nDuring puberty, an increase in the levels of male sex hormones leads to the development of some secondary sex characteristics, such as increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, development of pubic hair, and a growth spurt. The penis and scrotum may grow larger. People with 5-alpha reductase deficiency do not develop much facial or body hair.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAffected individuals exhibit a broad spectrum of presentation including atypical genitalia (ranging from female-appearing to underutilized male), hypospadias, and isolated micropenis. The internal reproductive structures (vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles, epididymides and ejaculatory ducts) are normal but testes are usually undescended and prostate hypoplasia is common. Males with the same mutations in SRD5A2 can have different phenotypes suggesting additional factors that are involved in clinical presentation. Although people who are genetically female (with two X chromosomes in each cell) may inherit variants in both copies of the SRD5A2 gene, their sexual development is not affected. The development of female sex characteristics does not require DHT, so a lack of steroid 5-alpha reductase 2 activity does not cause physical changes in these individuals.\nVirilization of genitalia with voice deepening, development of muscle mass occurs at puberty in affected individuals, and height is not impaired. Gynecomastia is uncommon and bone density is normal in contrast to 46,XY DSD from other causes such as partial androgen insensitivity syndrome and 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency. Hair on the face and body is reduced and male pattern baldness does not occur.\nSpontaneous fertility in 5\u03b1R2D affected individuals is very unusual (though has been observed) due to semen abnormalities that include reduced sperm counts, high semen viscosity and, in some cases, lack of primary spermatocytes. This supports the notion that DHT has an important role in spermatocyte differentiation. The broad spectrum of presentation is consistent with highly varying sperm counts among affected individuals. Testicular function may also be impaired by incomplete descent as well as the genetic mutation itself.\nGenetics.\nTwo different genes, each with five exons and four introns, designated as SRD5A1 and SDR5A2, encode two different 5\u03b1-reductases. The human 5\u03b1-reductase-2 gene (SRD5A2) is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 at band 23 and encodes a 254 amino acid protein, called 5\u03b1-reductase type 2. The 5\u03b1-reductase-1 gene (SRD5A1) is located in band 15 on the short arm of chromosome 5 and encodes a 259 amino acid protein, called 5\u03b1-reductase type 1. The high amino acid sequence identity of their proteins (approximately 60%) indicates the possibility of a common precursor gene during evolution. But the role of 5\u03b1-reductase type 1 is not well defined.\nMutations in the SRD5A2 gene can result in a 46,XY disorder of sex development(46,XY DSD) called 5\u03b1-reductase-2 deficiency. These mutations are more often observed in areas with a specific ethnic background and high coefficients of inbreeding. They generate proteins with various degrees of enzymatic activity ranging from an unstable isoenzyme to complete loss of enzymatic activity. Of the 254 amino acids in the 5a-reductase type 2 protein, mutations in codons specifying 67 different residues have been identified, with multiple mutations in the codons of several amino acids. \nThe first known mutation SRD5A2 was almost a complete deletion that was discovered from an analysis of affected individuals in a Papua New Guinean tribe. The majority of SRD5A2 mutations are missense mutations, but small deletions, splice junction mutations, and gross deletions were also observed. Mutations result in a spectrum of activity effects ranging from destabilizing 5\u03b1R2 to complete loss of activity.\nSRD5A2 mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Homozygous defects are more common than compound heterozygous ones. A phenotype-genotype correlation is not known to exist for many of the most common mutations, and affected individuals with the same 5\u03b1R2 mutations have variable phenotypes suggesting other interacting genetic factors that determine phenotype.\nMechanism.\n5\u03b1-Reductase type 2 (5\u03b1R2) is an enzyme, encoded by the SRD5A2 gene, that is expressed in specific tissues in the male body from fetal development to adulthood. The enzyme catalyzes the transformation of testosterone (T) to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) intracellularly. DHT is the most potent ligand to the androgen receptor (AR). Upon binding, the DHT-AR complex translocates from cytoplasm to the nucleus and activates the androgen receptor-regulated genes involved in processes that include male sexual differentiation.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis is usually made between birth and puberty. Pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias presenting with female-appearing genitalia and pubertal virilization is the classical syndrome attributed to 5\u03b1R2D, but modern diagnostic methods can diagnose the deficiency shortly after birth and recognize the broad spectrum of presentation.\nThe initial diagnosis of 46,XY DSD is indicated by overt genital abnormality. The objective clinical evaluation of dysmorphic features to diagnose 46,XY DSD for apparent female genitalia includes enlarged clitoris, posterior labial fusion, and inguinal/labial mass. For apparent male genitalia: nonpalpable testes, micropenis, isolated perineal hypospadias, or mild hypospadias with undescended testis. Family history and prenatal history are also taken into account in the evaluation. Karyotyping and SRY gene analysis on samples from peripheral leukocytes will exclude sex chromosome abnormalities. With the determination of an XY karyotype and normal SRY, the differential diagnosis of 46,XY DSD is made with endocrinological measurements of T/DHT ratios (which indicate 5\u03b1R2 activity) and precise anatomical imaging since 5\u03b1R2D can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of 46,XY DSD (e.g., partial androgen insensitivity syndrome and 17\u03b2- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 enzyme deficiencies).\nThe measurement of the serum DHT concentration is challenging since the concentrations are low and DHT has a high level of cross-reactivity. A high level of assay specificity is required to measure concentrations of DHT since serum T levels are generally 10-fold higher than DHT in young males. Endocrinological tests for T/DHT ratios can be difficult to interpret since the normal ratio level varies according to age and severity of 5\u03b1R2 activity impairment. Affected young males of at least pubertal age with normal serum T levels demonstrate elevated T/DHT levels (normal T, lower than normal DHT). Stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (alternatively, testosterone enanthate) is required in prepubertal children (with stimulation and samples taken over several days) to increase serum testosterone levels for measurement. Interpreting T/DHT ratios in male newborns is especially challenging due to neonatal testosterone surge and higher than normal 5a-reductase type 1 activity. SRD5A2 gene analysis is recommended for diagnosis in newborns. Broadly, 5\u03b1R2D is diagnosed with T/DHT ratios greater than 18 while ratios greater than 30 have been observed in severely affected individuals. 5\u03b1R2D can also be indicated by low ratios of 5\u03b1- to 5\u00df- reduced steroids, as measured in urine measured via gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry.\nUltrasonography is the primary means for assessing internal reproductive organs for diagnosis while genitography and voiding cystourethrography are used to resolve structures such as urethral and vaginal tracts. The use of pelvic MRI for diagnostic imaging for 5\u03b1R2D remains controversial.\nManagement.\nOne of the most clinically challenging and controversial topics with 46,XY DSD is the practice of \"sex assignment\" or \"sex of rearing\". This is especially so in 5\u03b1R2D, since most affected individuals have undervirilized genitalia at birth but virilize to varying degrees at puberty. Historically most 5\u03b1R2D individuals have been \"raised as females\", but later reports show that over half of patients who underwent virilizing puberty adopted a male gender identity thus challenging historical practices.\nThe goal of sex assignment/rearing is to facilitate the greatest likelihood of concordant gender identity in the patient's adulthood. The factors that contribute to gender identity are complex and not easy to report but some factors that contribute include sex chromosomes, androgen exposure, psychosocial development, cultural expectations, family dynamics, and social situation.\nFemale sex rearing in 5\u03b1R2D individuals involves surgical procedures such as childhood gonadectomy (to prevent virilization at puberty) and vaginoplasty. Life-long hormonal treatments as also required for the development and maintenance of female secondary sex characteristics. Male sex of rearing avoids lifelong hormonal treatments and allows for the potential of fertility. Cryptorchidism and hypospadias must be addressed to prevent damage to the seminiferous tubules that are essential for spermatogenesis and fertility. Some approaches encourage a diagnosis during infancy prior to any gender assignment or surgical interventions.\nThe intersection of the child's well-being, parental wishes, recommendations of the associated medical team, and local laws makes decision-making challenging in these cases. The necessity and ethics around consent and deception involved in administering such interventions have been seriously questioned.\nAssisted reproduction methods involving sperm extraction and concentration for intrauterine insemination, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and in vitro fertilization have all demonstrated successful outcomes for fertility in those with 5\u03b1R2D.\nEpidemiology.\n5\u03b1R2D is a rare condition with a worldwide distribution. A 2020 study identified 434 cases of 5\u03b1R2D across 44 countries including Turkey (23%), China (17%), Italy (9%), and Brazil (7%). The same study also found that genitalia virilization influenced sex assignment while gender change was influenced by cultural aspects across the countries. Molecular diagnosis resulted in favoring male sex assignment in affected newborns.\nMany SRD5A2 mutations come from areas with high coefficients of inbreeding, including the Dominican Republic (where people with the condition are called g\u00fcevedoces\u00a0\u2013 \"testes at twelve\"), Papua New Guinea (where it is known as \"kwolu-aatmwol\"\u00a0\u2013 suggesting a person's transformation \"into a male thing\"), and Turkey.\nHistory.\nAn autosomal recessive disorder of sex development, described as pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias (PPSH), was discovered in males in 1961. The main feature of this syndrome was a vulva with the presence of bilateral testes and male urogenital tracts in which the ejaculatory ducts terminate in a blind-ending vagina. This disorder was consistent with 5\u03b1R2D as the underlying cause as observed in animal models. 5\u03b1R2D was confirmed as the cause in humans in 1974, when studies were done of 24 participants in the Dominican Republic and 2 in Dallas Texas, USA. One of the cases in Dallas began to virilize at puberty and underwent surgery to remove testes and \"repair\" the apparent clitoromegaly. During surgery, a normal male urogenital tract was observed as well as other features consistent with PPSH. DHT was almost undetectable in cultured fibroblasts from foreskin, epididymis and the presumed \"labia majora\" whereas in normal males DHT is detected, suggesting impaired DHT formation. Similar conclusions were obtained for participants in a family in the Dominican Republic study, in whom high serum concentration ratios of T to DHT and low concentrations of urinary 5a-reduced androgens were observed. This disorder is now known to be due to homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the SRD5A2 gene. The frequency of the deficiency was found to be unusually high in Las Salinas, with occurrence ratio of 1 \"g\u00fcevedoce\" to every 90 unaffected males.\nSociety and culture.\nDominican Republic.\nIn the Dominican Republic, \"g\u00fcevedoces\" are regarded as a third gender and experience ambivalent gender socialisation. In adulthood, they most commonly self-identify as men, but are not necessarily completely treated as such by society.\nPapua New Guinea.\nIn Papua New Guinea, it has been said that the \"girl\" is shunned when he begins his natural transformation into a male body and socially assumes a male gender role.\nSport.\nIn April 2014, the \"BMJ\" reported that four elite athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and \"partial clitoridectomies\" in order to compete in women's sport. The authors noted that \"partial clitoridectomy\" was \"not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic 'advantage,'\" relating to elevated androgen levels. The athletes were all from developing countries where lifetime access to hormone replacement may prove elusive. Intersex advocates regard this intervention as \"a clearly coercive process\".\nPopular culture.\nIn the \"Nip/Tuck\" season three episode \"Quentin Costa\", it is revealed that Quentin Costa had 5-ARD.\nJeffrey Eugenides' Pulitzer Prize-winning 2002 novel \"Middlesex\" is about a young man with 5-ARD. The character was originally born Calliope and raised as a girl, but upon realizing his genetic sex, he transitions into Cal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The star is visible to the naked eye as a faint, yellow-hued point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.97. It is drifting further away with a heliocentric radial velocity of +4.4\u00a0km/s and has a high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at the rate of 0.621\u00a0arc seconds per annum.\nThis object has a stellar classification of G4\u00a0V-IV, being rather unusually bright for a main sequence star of its type and thus may be just starting to evolve into the subgiant phase. It is an estimated 7.9\u00a0billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 4.8\u00a0km/s. The star has 1.09 times the mass of the Sun and 1.94 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 3.05 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,473\u00a0K. The metallicity \u2013 a term astronomers use to describe the abundance of elements heavier than helium \u2013 is near solar.\nIn 2011, a star was discovered 2.86 arcseconds away from the primary, and is likely associated with 70 Virginis. Based on its properties, it has a spectral type later than M5V, and has a mass of about 8% that of the Sun. There is also an L-type brown dwarf 42.7 arcseconds away from the primary, but it is unclear whether this is bound to the system.\nIn 1996, 70 Virginis was discovered to have an extrasolar planet in orbit around it. There is also an orbiting dusty disc with an average temperature of 153\u00a0K located at a mean distance of 3.4 AU from the star.\nPlanetary system.\nThe discovery of the planet around 70 Virginis was announced on January 17, 1996 at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Antonio, Texas. The planet was detected using radial velocity measurements taken with the C. Donald Shane telescope at Lick Observatory. It has an orbital period of 117\u00a0days, an eccentricity of 0.4, and a mass at least 7.4 times that of Jupiter.\n! align=center| Companion\n! align=center| Mass\n! align=center| Semimajor axis\n! align=center| Orbital period\n! align=center| Eccentricity\n! align=center| Inclination\n! align=center| Radius\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Inflation and interest rates stayed low and steady throughout the decade, gross world product grew from 2010 to 2019. Global economic recovery accelerated during the latter half of the decade, fueled by strong economic growth in many countries, robust consumer spending, increased investment in infrastructure, and the emergence of new technologies. However, the recovery developed unevenly. Socioeconomic crises in some countries\u2014particularly in the Arab world\u2014triggered political revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Bahrain as well as civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen in a regional phenomenon that was commonly referred to as the Arab Spring. Meanwhile, Europe had to grapple with a debt crisis that was pronounced early in the decade. Shifting social attitudes saw LGBT rights make substantial progress throughout the decade, particularly in developed countries.\nThe decade saw the musical and cultural dominance of dance-pop, electronic dance music, hipster culture and electropop. Globalization and an increased demand for variety and personalisation in the face of music streaming services such as Spotify, SoundCloud and Apple Music created many musical subgenres. As the decade progressed, diversity was also seen with the mainstream success of K-pop, Latin music and trap. Superhero films became box office leaders, with \"\" becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. Cable providers saw a decline in subscribers as cord cutters switched to lower cost online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney+. The video game industry continued to be dominated by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft; while indie games became more popular, with \"Minecraft\" becoming the best-selling game of all time. Handheld console gaming revenue was overtaken by mobile gaming revenue in 2011. The best-selling book of this decade was \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Drake was named the top music artist of the decade in the U.S. by \"Billboard.\"\nThe United States continued to retain its superpower status while China sought to expand its influence in the South China Sea and in Africa through its economic initiatives and military reforms. It solidified its position as an emerging superpower, despite causing a series of conflicts around its frontiers. Within its border, China enhanced its suppression and control of Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. These developments led the United States to implement a containment policy and initiate a trade war against China. Elsewhere in Asia, the Koreas improved their relations after a prolonged crisis between the two countries, and the war on terror continued as a part of the U.S.'s continued military involvement in many parts of the world. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant extremist organization in 2014 erased the Syria-Iraq border, resulting in a multinational intervention against it. In Africa, South Sudan broke away from Sudan, and mass protests and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. In the U.S., celebrity businessman Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 amid an international wave of populism and neo-nationalism. The European Union experienced a migrant crisis in the middle of the decade and withdrawal of the United Kingdom as a member state following the historic United Kingdom EU membership referendum. Russia attempted to assert itself in international affairs, annexing Crimea in 2014. In the last months of the decade, the first cases of the Coronavirus pandemic of Sars-Cov2 emerged in Wuhan, China, before affecting the rest of the world.\nInformation technology progressed, with smartphones becoming widespread and increasingly displacing desktop computers for many users. Internet coverage grew from 29% to 54% of the world population, and also saw advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and cloud computing. Advancements in data processing and the rollout of 4G broadband allowed data, metadata, and information to be collected and dispersed among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as social media facilitated phenomena such as the Me Too movement, the rise of slacktivism, and online cancel culture. WikiLeaks gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics related to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Syria, the Afghan and Iraq wars, and United States diplomacy. Edward Snowden blew the whistle on global surveillance, raising awareness on the role governments and private entities play in global surveillance and information privacy. Baidu (4th), Twitter (6th) and Instagram (8th) emerged to become among the top 10 most visited websites, while Wikipedia went from the 9th to the 5th most popular website, almost sextupling its monthly visits. Yahoo significantly declined in popularity, descending from being the 1st to the 9th most popular site, with monthly visits declining by two-thirds. Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yandex maintained relatively consistent popularity and remained within the top 10 throughout the decade.\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through new record temperatures in different occurrences and extreme weather events on all continents. The CO2 concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be areas of major concern, as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. The Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, and the global climate youth movement was formed. Major natural disasters included the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Nepal earthquake of 2015, the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami, the devastating tropical cyclones Bopha (Pablo), Haiyan (Yolanda), and Maria, as well as the 2019 European heat waves.\nDuring the decade, the world population grew from 6.9 to 7.7 billion people. There were approximately 1.4 billion births during the decade (140 million per year), and about 560 million deaths (56 million per year).\nPolitics and wars.\nMajor conflicts.\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\nRevolutions and major protests.\nSuccessful revolutions and otherwise major protests of the decade include, but are not limited to:\nArab Spring.\nThe Arab Spring was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Islamic world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low standard of living, starting with protests in Tunisia. Social media was heralded as the driving force behind the swift spread of revolution throughout the world, as new protests appeared in response to success stories shared from those taking place in other countries. Many governments began recognising the importance of social media for citizens to organise and began shutting down certain websites or blocking Internet service entirely, especially prior to major rallies. Governments also scrutinised or suppressed discussion in online forums through accusing content creators of unrelated crimes or shutting down communication on specific sites or groups, such as through Facebook.\nTerrorist attacks.\nThe most prominent terrorist attacks committed against civilian populations during the decade include, but are not limited to:\nPolitical trends.\nInternational relations.\nChina was increasingly called a superpower in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President Hu Jintao and United States President Barack Obama. By the end of the decade, China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation and the country filing the most patents, dramatically expanded its military and landed its lunar rover \"Yutu\" on the moon, ending a four-decade hiatus of lunar exploration. In 2018, global military spending reached its highest level since 1988, late Cold War levels, largely fuelled by increased defence spending by the United States (4.6% increase to $649 billion) and China (5% increase to $250 billion). Together, their budgets accounted for half of the world's total military spending. In 2019, the Lowy Institute Asia Power Index, which measures the projections of power across eight indexes in the Indo-Pacific, ranked the United States at #1 with a score of 84.5 and China #2 with a score of 75.9.\nAlong with the United States and China, Russia under President Vladimir Putin steadily increased its defence spending and continued to modernise its military throughout the decade. This included the development of the T-14 Armata main battle tank and the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 jet fighter. Russia also exercised its power projection capabilities in its 2014 annexation of Crimea and interventions in eastern Ukraine and the Syrian Civil War. Russia also waged information warfare campaigns against its geopolitical foes, interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections via hacking and leaking emails of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the Internet Research Agency. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the 2016 Montenegrin coup plot and the 2018 Skripal poisonings, both of which were attributed by some to the GRU's Unit 29155. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat them\u2014have been referred to as marking the beginning of the Second Cold War.\nThe European Union went through several crises. The European debt crisis caused severe economic problems to several eurozone member states, most notably Greece. The 2015 migration crisis led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several eurosceptic parties, including the League in Italy, Alternative for Germany, and the Finns Party in Finland. As a result of a referendum, the United Kingdom became the first member state in the EU's history to leave the Union.\nWestern polarisation.\nSocio-political polarisation increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the West. In the United States, polls showed a divided electorate regarding healthcare reform, immigration, gun rights, taxation, job creation, and debt reduction. In Europe, movements protesting increasing numbers of refugees and migrants from Islamic countries developed, such as the English Defence League and Pegida.\nThe trend of polarisation in the West was partially influenced by the prevalence of identity politics, both left-wing and right-wing, among activist movements. Beginning around 2011, far-left and progressive concepts such as combating social inequality and economic inequality, often via progressive stack tactics, proliferated in the Western world and elsewhere. Around the middle of the decade, phenomenon such as white nationalism, identitarianism and emboldened feelings of nativism saw a marked reemergence in the West due to drastically increased migration and corresponding crime and amongst both the right and left general dissatisfaction with Western government and Media responses to certain issues. There were also increased calls for egalitarianism, including between the sexes, and some scholars assert that a fourth wave of feminism began around 2012, with a primary focus on intersectionality.\nAnti-establishment politics.\nPopulism in politics saw a widespread surge throughout the decade, with many politicians and various political movements expressing populist sentiments and utilising populist rhetoric. This included conservative wave phenomenon in Latin America and neo-nationalist fervor in Europe and North America. The 2019 European Parliament election saw the highest voter turnout in two decades and saw relatively moderate centre-right and centre-left parties suffer significant losses to less moderate far-right, environmentalist, and both pro-EU and eurosceptic parties, who made gains. Examples of 2010s populist movements included the Tea Party movement, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit, Black Lives Matter, and the alt-right. Examples of populist country leaders were just as extensive, with Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Rodrigo Duterte, Boris Johnson, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Robert Fico, Antonis Samaras and Alexis Tsipras left and right-wing, described as such.\nRelated to the rise of populism and protests movements was the decline of traditional political parties. In Europe, pasokification described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional centre-left or social democratic parties. In France, specifically, Emmanuel Macron's \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" party won a majority in its first election in 2017.\nCentre-left, neoliberal and traditional social democratic parties often lost their vote share to more socialist or democratic socialist alternatives, especially in Europe. This happened most completely in Greece, where PASOK was replaced by Syriza as the main left-wing party. Other far-left parties which rose in prominence included Podemos in Spain and La France Insoumise in France. In the two-party systems of the English-speaking world, these challenges mainly came from within the established parties of the left, with Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party and Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour Party pushing for more left-wing policies.\nThe political establishment was also challenged in many countries by protest movements, often organised through new social media platforms. These included the various Arab Spring protests, the Occupy movement, and the yellow vests movement.\nDemocratisation and authoritarianism.\nCountries which democratised fully or partially during the decade included Angola, which reformed under Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o; Armenia, which went through a revolution; Ecuador, which reformed under Len\u00edn Moreno; Ethiopia; and Malaysia, where the ruling party lost the first election since independence.\nLong-term dictators ousted from power included Muammar Gaddafi of Libya (after 42 years), Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe (37 years), Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen (33 years), Omar al-Bashir of Sudan (30 years), Hosni Mubarak of Egypt (29 years), and Ben Ali of Tunisia (23 years).\nThe Arab Winter refers to the resurgence of authoritarianism, absolute monarchies and Islamic extremism evolving in the aftermath of the Arab Spring protests in Arab countries. The term \"Arab Winter\" refers to the events across Arab League countries in the Mid-East and North Africa, including the Syrian Civil War, the Iraqi insurgency and the following civil war, the Egyptian Crisis, the Libyan crisis and the crisis in Yemen. Events referred to as the Arab Winter include those in Egypt that led to the removal of Mohamed Morsi and the seizure of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in an anti-Muslim Brotherhood campaign.\nDemocratic backsliding also occurred in countries such as Hungary, Venezuela, and Turkey.\nIn 2018, China's National People's Congress approved a constitutional change that removed term limits for its leaders, granting Xi Jinping the status of \"leader for life\". Xi is the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (de facto leader).\nDeaths.\nSitting world leaders such as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, Kim Jong-il of North Korea, Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski of Poland, Zillur Rahman of Bangladesh, Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan and Beji Caid Essebsi of Tunisia, all died in office.\nProminent political events.\nCoups.\n\"Coups d'\u00e9tat\" against ruling governments during the decade include:\nThe following tables of events is listed by the region and by chronological order. The prominent political events include, but are not limited to:\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nEconomics.\nThe global economy during the 2010s was generally strong. It saw steady growth, low unemployment, and increasing consumer confidence recovering from the great recession. The decade ended with a strong finish, with 2019 seeing record highs in many areas. A sovereign-debt crisis in Europe began in early 2010, and the Greek government admitted that it was having difficulties servicing its large sovereign debt. In the summer and fall of 2011, bond yields for Italy and Spain spiked above 6 percent. By 2015 bond rates had returned to normal ranges across Europe, save for Greece, which accepted another, even more stringent bailout package. The size of the European Financial Stability Facility was increased from \u20ac440 billion to \u20ac2 trillion. Despite the Eurozone debt crisis, the American Dow Jones Industrial Average had its longest stretch of gains since the late 1990s tech boom. However, economic issues, including inflation and an increase in commodity prices, sparked unrest in many lower-income countries. In some countries, particularly those in the Arab world, political unrest evolved into socioeconomic crises, resulting in the Arab Spring leading to political instability and civil wars.\nAs a result of the global recession, many central banks instituted a zero interest-rate policy, or close to it. Another form of monetary stimulus was that of quantitative easing. The resulting flood of market liquidity caused a rise in asset prices. As a result, for example, United States stock prices reached record highs. Another consequence has been the rise in housing prices in many major world cities. Some of the cities which recorded the most dramatic rises included Sydney, San Francisco, Vancouver, and Auckland.\nIn 2010, China became the second largest global economy, surpassing Japan. Japan also saw a rating downgrade the following year due to debt burden. In August 2011, the S&amp;P downgraded the United States' credit rating from triple AAA to AA-plus following a debt ceiling crisis. Also in 2011, a Gallup poll found that more than half of Americans believed the country was still in a recession. In June 2015, the Shanghai Stock Exchange lost a third of the value of A-shares within one month, an event known as the 2015\u201316 Chinese stock market turbulence. India became the fastest growing major economy of the world in 2015, surpassing China. In 2018, as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates, fears of a yield curve inversion preceding a potential U.S. recession sent inflation higher in several emerging markets, including Argentina, where interest rates hit 40% and an International Monetary Fund bail out was issued. In 2019, Singapore supplanted the United States as the world's most competitive economy, with the U.S. dropping to third, behind Hong Kong.\nGlobal oil production in 2014 reached a historic peak, reaching 93 million barrels/day. In 2018, partially due to a shale boom, the United States overcame Russia and Saudi Arabia in becoming the world's largest crude oil producer, the first time since 1973. Around the year 2017 is a period seen by some economists as being the new peak of a \"goldilocks economy\". The International Monetary Fund's April 2019 World Economic Outlook stated, \"After peaking at close to 4 percent in 2017, global [economic] growth remained strong, at 3.8 percent in the first half of 2018, but dropped to 3.2 percent in the second half of the year.\"\nIn 2018, United States President Donald Trump announced he would put into place new tariffs on some Chinese products, starting the 'US-China Trade War', an economic conflict involving the world's two largest economies. Trump said the reasoning for the trade war was to punish China for \"unfair\" trade practices, such as the appropriation of jobs and the theft of American intellectual property. China responded with tariffs of its own, and a cycle began, escalating the conflict. As part of his 'America First' policy, Trump also announced new tariffs were being placed on countries around the world for various products such as steel and aluminium, which also drew some economic retaliation from traditional U.S. trade partners.\nBy the end of the decade, in North American and some Western European domestic economies, consumer-level purchasing habits had shifted significantly, a partial consequence of the Great Recession's impact on discretionary incomes and a shifting breadwinner model. The so-called \"retail apocalypse\" had commenced as consumers increasingly resorted to online shopping and e-commerce, accelerating the decline of brick-and-mortar retail and the continued decline of indoor shopping malls. The transitioning retail industry and popularity of online shopping facilitated economic phenomena such as bricks and clicks business models, pop-up and non-store retailing, drone delivery services, ghost restaurants, and a quickly maturing online food ordering and delivery service sector. This was only further perpetuated by the rise in cryptocurrency throughout the decade, such as Bitcoin. By May 2018, over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed.\nIn the same vein as cryptocurrency, the trend towards a cashless society continued as non-cash transactions and digital currency saw an increase in favourability in the 2010s. By 2016, only about 2 percent of the value transacted in Sweden was by cash, and only about 20 percent of retail transactions were in cash. Fewer than half of bank branches in the country conducted cash transactions. A report published in 2019 suggested that the percentage of payments conducted in cash in the United Kingdom had fallen to 34% from 63% from 2009. The 2016 United States User Consumer Survey Study claimed that 75 percent of respondents preferred a credit card or debit card as their payment method while only 11 percent of respondents preferred cash.\nScience and technology.\nBelow are the most significant scientific developments of each year, based on the annual Breakthrough of the Year award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science journal \"Science\".\nTechnology.\nThe late 2000s saw the rise of two prominent mobile operating systems, Android developed by Google and iOS developed by Apple. The widespread adoption of smartphones in the early 2010s, particularly following the success of Apple\u2019s iPhone and the proliferation of Android-powered devices from manufacturers such as Samsung and HTC, contributed to the rapid expansion of both platforms. By 2017, Android had become the leading mobile operating system globally, accounting for approximately 85.9% of the market share.\nRobotics, particularly drones like quadcopters, experienced a wide use and application in the 2010s. Autonomous and electric car technology and sales showed considerable growth as well. In addition, sustainable space launch technologies were spearheaded by entrepreneurs like Elon Musk.\nIn 2016, the number of people globally using mobile devices to access the internet overtook those using desktop computers for the first time, having been preceded by the U.S. two years prior in 2014. 3D printers also emerged in the 2010s and were referenced or used in pop culture during the decade.\nIn 2018, during the Falcon Heavy test flight, the first production car was launched into space. The car was attached to the Falcon Heavy rocket, the most powerful rocket in operation at the time, which side boosters successfully landed back on Earth after completing their portion of the mission.\nCyber security and hacking.\nCyber security incidents, such as hacking, leaks or theft of sensitive information, gained increased attention of governments, corporations and individuals.\nHealth and society.\nAIDS, a pandemic responsible for killing over 30 million people since its discovery in the early 1980s, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, became a treatable condition, though by the end of the decade only two cases had been cured. With good treatment patients can generally expect normal lives and lifespans. However, as of 2011[ [update]] only some 5 million of the 12 million affected people had access to such treatment.\nDuring the 2010s, social changes included increases in life expectancy and falling birth rates leading to larger proportions of the population being elderly. This put pressure on pensions and other social security programs in developed nations. The environment became a topic of greater public concern around the world. Many parts of the world moved towards greater acceptance of LGBT people often including the legalisation of same-sex marriage. The internet took an ever greater role in entertainment, communication, politics and commerce, especially for younger people and those living in wealthier countries. In 2011, the world population reached seven billion people.\nPopular culture.\nFashion.\nFashion of the 2010s became slimmer-fit and slightly more formal compared to previous decades. In addition, people's handheld devices such as cellphones (and their colorful cases), selfie sticks (for a brief period during the middle of the decade), tech-like Beats headphones, smart watches, wired and by the end of the decade wireless ear buds, as well as handheld gaming systems became more prevalent personal items.\nThe decade was also defined by new hipster fashion (hipster styles were marked by the wearing of knit beanies, checkered shirts, and clothes from thrift stores; as well as hobbies like horticulture, photography, and specialty coffee) athleisure, and a revival of austerity-era and other nostalgic alternative fashion trends (such as 1980s-style neon streetwear in the first part of the decade, and unisex 1990s-style elements influenced by grunge).\nIn 2018, a subculture of \"e-kids\" came into existence, whom took their style from Japanese street fashion, cosplay, skater aesthetic, and other pieces of pop culture. In contrast to the colorful subculture of \"e-kids\" later in the decade, the early 2010s saw the Emo revival.\nIn the United States, political fashion became a genre of fashion starting around 2016, as people wore hats like MAGA hats (popularized by political outsider, prior TV-star and businessman President Donald Trump), as well as the Pussyhat. These two pieces of fashion wear would be popularized in the 2010s in popular culture on television and further, but would become controversial in their own right.\nThe decade sparked many smaller fashion movements, notable examples including Cottagecore and Normcore (a notable icon of Normcore in the 2010s was Steve Jobs, whom represented the decade's casual clothing). Fad toys and accessories like the Fidget spinner, Silly Bandz, and Shutter shades each had waves of popularity among youth throughout the decade. Funko Pops were a collectible fad during the 2010s.\nInternet.\nInternet users grew from covering 29% to 54% of the world population.\nOver the course of the 2010s, Baidu, Twitter and Instagram emerged to become among the top 10 most visited websites (becoming the 4th, 6th and 8th most popular websites by the end of the decade), while Wikipedia went the 9th to 5th most popular website, almost sextupling its monthly visits (from 1 to 5.7 billion). Meanwhile, Yahoo significantly declined in popularity, descending from being the 1st to 9th most popular site, with monthly visits declining by two-thirds (going from 11.6 to 3.9 billion). Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yandex maintained relatively consistent popularity and remained within the top 10 throughout the decade. In 2015, Discord, one of the largest instant messaging social platforms was launched.\nFilm.\nIn January 2010, James Cameron's \"Avatar\" surpassed $1 billion in sales, becoming the first movie of the decade to do so, and surpassed $2 billion in sales by February 2010. The following year, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" became one of the fastest grossing films of all time, and became the highest-grossing film of 2011. 2019's \"Joker\" became the first R rated movie to gross over $1 billion and cemented itself in popular culture by making the \"Joker Stairs\" a famous tourist destination in New York City at the end of the decade. Motion capture grew in terms of its realism and reach, and was seen in movies like Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", \"The Avengers\", and \"\".\nSuperhero films and franchises.\nSuperhero films became box office leaders, especially with the start of The Infinity Saga of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008 with movies such as the \"Avengers\" franchise.\nMarvel's main competitor, DC Extended Universe also began to produce superhero films starting in 2013, with films such as \"Justice League\" releasing in 2017.\nNon-shared universe superhero films were also successful with the release of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in addition to animated films such as \"Incredibles 2, , The Lego Batman Movie, \", and many others.\nOther prominent franchises.\nThe epic space-opera franchise Star Wars saw a resurgence throughout its decade with the third trilogy aka the sequel trilogy of the franchise and the final act of the \"Skywalker Saga\". These films include ', ', and \"\" with all of them raking in over $4 billion with the first movie became the 3rd highest-grossing film of all time at its release.\nThe science fiction Universal franchise \"Jurassic Park\" also saw a resurgence and popularity with the release of \"Jurassic World\" and \".\" Both of these films each garnered over $1 billion in revenue with the first film became the 3rd highest-grossing film of all time and the second film became the 12th highest-grossing film of all time. Critical reception of the first movie was positive while the second movie had mixed reviews from critics and negative reviews from fans.\nThe action racing heist spy franchise \"The Fast and the Furious\" continued on from the 2000s and became commercially successful in the 2010s becoming one of Universal's biggest franchises besides \"Jurassic Park\" and was the eighth highest-grossing film series. Films include \"Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6, Furious 7,\" and \"The Fate of the Furious.\"\nHorror films.\nThe horror film \"It\", which was based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King, became the highest-grossing horror film of all time. 2018 saw the acclaimed \"Halloween\" sequel, \"Halloween\", the 11th installment of the Halloween franchise and sequel to the first film, \"Halloween\".\nAnimated films.\nDisney, Pixar, DreamWorks, Illumination, and Sony Pictures Animation have dominated the animated films market and have also gained popularity in this decade. The highest-grossing and critically successful franchises included \"Frozen\", \"How to Train Your Dragon\", \"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\" and \"Toy Story\" sequels. Other critically and/or commercially successful films released in this decade included \"\", \"Inside Out\", \"Coco\", \"Zootopia, Song of the Sea\", \"Ernest &amp; Celestine\", \"Megamind\", \"Moana\", \"Brave\", \"Wreck-It Ralph\", \"Big Hero 6\", \"The Boss Baby\", \"The Illusionist\", \"Loving Vincent\", \"Klaus\", \"ParaNorman\", \"Hair Love\", \"Kubo and the Two Strings\", \"In a Heartbeat\", \"My Life as a Courgette\", \"The Red Turtle\", \"Shaun the Sheep Movie\", and \"Isle of Dogs\".\nOther films/genres.\nThe 2010s saw the release of many Disney live-action remakes based on Disney animated movies: \"Alice in Wonderland\" and its sequel \"Alice Through the Looking Glass, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Maleficent\" and its sequel \", Cinderella, The Jungle Book, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Christopher Robin.\" Many of these movies were met with mixed reviews from critics and audiences but were financially successful at the box office, especially \"The Lion King\" which grossed over $1.6 billion and became the 7th-highest-grossing film of all time as well as the 2nd-highest-grossing film of 2019.\nDisney also produced many live action films based on their theme park attractions and on other existing IP. This included movies like \"Tomorrowland\", \"A Wrinkle In Time\", \"Into The Woods\", \"John Carter\", \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"The Lone Ranger\". Most of these films received mixed responses from critics audiences and were generally unsuccessful at the box office, though in retrospect some of these films (particularly \"Tomorrowland\") have come to be viewed as \"emerging cult films\".\nDisney Channel's \"Descendants\" franchise garnered popularity and high viewership with its first three films during the decade along with releasing a short animated series \"Wicked World\". Halloween costumes of the characters also became one of the most searched costumes every year since the release of the first film.\nAcclaimed movies.\nThe decade also saw many popular and critically acclaimed theatrical releases of varying genres, such as \"The Social Network\", \"Her\", \"12 Years a Slave\", \"Boyhood\", \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\", \"The Edge of Seventeen\", \"The Fault in Our Stars\", \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", \"The Artist\", \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", \"Easy A\", \"Rust and Bone\", \"Two Days, One Night\", \"Whiplash\", \"21 Jump Street\", \"Eighth Grade\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Paddington\" and its sequel \"Paddington 2\", \"Lady Bird\", \"La La Land\", \"Green Book\", \"Get Out\", \"Parasite\", \"Love, Simon\", \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\", and \"Uncut Gems\".\nThe critically acclaimed movies of the 2010s mentioned above set new precedents. Movies like \"Boyhood\" (2014) were filmed over the span of a decade in real time to show the growth and childhood of a young boy, and \"Uncut Gems\" (2019) brought Adam Sandler back to a wide screen release, while teenage movies like \"The Edge of Seventeen\" (2016), \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" (2015), \"The Fault in Our Stars\" (2014), and \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" (2012) gained large popularity. \"Her\" (2013) became Spike Jonze's highest-grossing and most critically acclaimed movie, noted for its filming locations and art direction, \"Two Days, One Night\" (2014) became the Dardenne brothers' highest-grossing film and the first to receive an Oscar nomination, with Marion Cotillard becoming the first actor to be nominated for an Oscar for a Belgian film. \"Parasite\" (2019) became the first foreign film to win best picture, and movies like \"Ready Player One\" (2018) helped advance motion capture technologies (winning two Outstanding Achievement Awards from the Visuals Effects Society and a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film), in addition to becoming one of Spielberg's highest-grossing films.\nTelevision.\nThe 2010s decade is often said to be a part of the Golden Age of Television, due to the widespread quality of multiple shows, as well as advancements in technology leading to streaming, cable television, and online outlets bringing this quality and quantity of programming. Cable providers saw a decline in subscriber numbers as cord-cutting viewers switched to lower-cost online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. On cable television, as well as streaming services, a variety of shows gained popularity.\nLive-action TV.\nThe comedy sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\" ran for the entirety of the decade, and was the number-one television sitcom for all of its airing prior to its finale in 2019. Other sitcoms like \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", \"Will &amp; Grace\", \"The Office\", \"Scrubs: Med School\", and Netflix's \"Trailer Park Boys\" were popular in the 2010s. \"How I Met Your Mother\" (narrated by Bob Saget) gained controversy for its 2014 finale, \"Last Forever\", which sparked an alternate finale to be created for the show, a television first. Cult shows like the dark comedy sitcom \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" carried its popularity from the 2000s and lasted through the entirety of the 2010s. CBS's \"Two Broke Girls\" began its run in 2011 (ending in 2017), its pilot being the highest watched on the network in a decade. In 2011, Charlie Sheen was fired from \"Two and a Half Men\", who made his last appearance in the show in Season 8 during February 2011. Sheen's 2011 outbursts and firing from the show were highly publicized. Indian sitcom \"Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah\" became the world's longest-running sitcom, with over 2,500 episodes,\nDramas like \"Breaking Bad\" (2008\u20132013), \"The Walking Dead\" (2010\u20132022), \"Game of Thrones\" (2011\u20132019) and the \"Breaking Bad\" spin-off \"Better Call Saul\" (2015\u20132022) became some of the most popular American television series of all time. \"Stranger Things\" gained a massive following during the decade among teen and youth, and 2019's \"Stranger Things 3\" gained even more recognition for the character of Robin Buckley, who was popularized online.\nScience fiction television gained a renewed sense of interest, thanks in part to \"Black Mirror\" was popularized on Netflix after being broadcast on British television.\nA new era of family television and tween television existed in the 2010s, sitcoms of which were mainly spearheaded by Disney and Nickelodeon, but also appeared on cable channels such as ABC (\"The Middle\" on ABC for example) and on streaming services like Netflix. Nickelodeon and Disney Channel continued to dominate kids TV with many popular shows such as \"iCarly\", \"Victorious\", \"Big Time Rush\", \"Good Luck Charlie\", \"Jessie\", \"Austin &amp; Ally\", \"Shake It Up\", \"K.C. Undercover\", \"Henry Danger\", \"Girl Meets World\", \"Andi Mack\" and \"Raven's Home\" along with PBS Kids' \"Odd Squad\". The short-lived 2018 revival of \"Roseanne\" (a family sitcom on ABC) gained attention for the firing of its main star Roseanne Barr and her outbursts.\nReality television.\nReality television grew an increased following during the decade. \"Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen (UK),\" and \"Hotel Hell\" gained popularity on cable television, as well as getting millions of views on YouTube, making Gordon Ramsay a prominent celebrity chef. \"America's Got Talent\" drew in viewers when radio personality Howard Stern announced his joining of the show in late 2011, staying as host until 2015. Meanwhile, popular reality programming on ABC included \"What Would You Do?\", \"Shark Tank\" and \"The Bachelor\". Corinne Olympios also gained recognition on the 2017 season of \"The Bachelor\" for her behavior on set. \"American Idol\" remained popular into the beginning of the decade, as did \"The Voice\". \"Impractical Jokers\" flourished throughout the 2010s, gaining exposure on YouTube and elsewhere. TMZ became a popular television show and news source in the 2010s on cable television and YouTube respectively. A genre of pawn shows emerged like \"Pawn Stars\" and \"Hardcore Pawn\".\n\"The Apprentice\" was a reality television show that starred media personality and businessman Donald Trump as host until 2015, at which time he resigned as host. Trump would use the success he gained on \"The Apprentice\" to run for President of the United States; which he was elected to in 2016. Additionally, programs such as \"The Celebrity Apprentice\", Comedy Central's \"The Roast Of Donald Trump\", and Donald Trump's November 2015 hosting of \"Saturday Night Live\", would send the reality TV star and businessman into the spotlight to help win the U.S. presidency. Governor in the early 2010s and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger took Trump's place on \"The Celebrity Apprentice\".\nAnimation television.\nNickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel continued to dominate with cartoons. Popular cartoons of the 2010s included the likes of \"Adventure Time\", \"Regular Show\", \"Steven Universe\", \"Gravity Falls\", \"The Amazing World of Gumball\", \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\", \"DuckTales\" (2017 reboot series), ', \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (2012 series), \"Over the Garden Wall\", \"Big City Greens\", \"The Loud House\", \"Amphibia\", \"Mickey Mouse\", \"Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures\" and ' (which became a pop culture phenomenon in its own right and spawned a loyal cult following known as the \"\"), along with long-running cartoons \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"Phineas and Ferb\", \"Arthur\" and \"WordGirl\". Nickelodeon brought back three classic Nicktoons; ', ' (which was themed around late 2010s culture), and \"\" near the end of the decade, turning them into reboot films.\nNick Jr., Disney Junior and PBS Kids led mainstream educational cartoons with many popular shows including \"Paw Patrol\", \"Sofia the First\", \"Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood\", \"Doc McStuffins\", \"Jake and the Never Land Pirates\", \"Dinosaur Train\", \"Wild Kratts\", \"PJ Masks\", \"Team Umizoomi\", \"Bubble Guppies\", \"Octonauts\" and \"The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!\".\nAnime broadened its appeal worldwide with shows such as \"Attack on Titan\", \"Akame ga Kill!\", \"Assassination Classroom\", \"Future Diary\", \"Deadman Wonderland\", \"Madoka Magica\", \"Mob Psycho 100\", \"Darling in the Franxx\", \"Dragon Ball Super\", \"Fairy Tail\", \"Gate\", \"Black Clover\", \"Tokyo Ghoul\", \"Given\", \"KonoSuba\", ', \"Haikyu!!,\" \"Sailor Moon Crystal\", \"Seraph of the End\", \"One Piece\", \" Overlord\", ', \"Bleach\", \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter,\" \"One Punch Man\", \"Little Witch Academia\", \"Devilman Crybaby\", \"My Hero Academia\", \"JoJo's Bizzarre Adventure\", \"Vinland Saga\", \"Parasyte -the maxim-\", ' and \"Steins;Gate\", separately Japanese reality shows like ' reached new and international audiences because of the use of the internet and streaming services (it was Netflix's first international release and one of their earliest international releases).

Memes like Nyan Cat, Dat Boi, \"We Are Number One\", Trollface, Pepe the Frog, bottle flipping, Condescending Wonka (Gene Wilder died in 2016), emerged on YouTube; the use of YouTube and the internet also lead to new and popular vernacular like poggers, bae, Netflix and chill, \"chillax\" (a conbo of \"chill\" and \"relax\") and \"on fleek\".\nEarly in the decade channels like Fred Figglehorn (FRED), The Annoying Orange, Ray William Johnson, CollegeHumor, Smosh, PewDiePie and the Angry Video Game Nerd attracted millions of views, channels and videos becoming viral on the site. The popularity of YouTubers even ended up spawning films based on popular YouTubers, including ' (2014), ' (2015), and the Fred Trilogy (2010\u20132012) starting with \"\". These YouTubers became well known through comedic skits, video game reviews, and \"Let's Play\" videos.\nChildren's content on YouTube was largely dominated by kid-made content involving kids unboxing toys and going on adventures. Many popular channels in this style included Ryan's World, ToyLabTV, Extreme Toys TV and Vlad and Niki. Nerf battles were also a very popular trend on YouTube.\nSeveral new videos and series that debuted on YouTube in the 2010s and achieved popularity included \"Don't Hug Me I'm Scared\", \"Double Rainbow\", \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\", \"Lucas the Spider\", \"Game Grumps\", and \"Critical Role\".\nOther YouTubers that constantly received views within the millions or went viral during the decade included the likes of bill wurtz for his \"history of japan\" and \"history of the entire world i guess\" videos (and music like \"and the day goes on\"), Swoozie, Etika (and his fanbase the \"JOYCONBOYZ\"), REACT, WatchMojo, The Joe Rogan Experience, The Nostalgia Critic, Studio C, Babish Culinary Universe, Good Mythical Morning, Penguinz0, Vsauce, CGP Gray, Kurzgesagt, Matpat, MrBeast, Scott the Woz, TheOdd1sOut, Domics, and Jaiden Animations among many others. YouTube itself would even end up banning controversial content creators like ImJayStation and LeafyIsHere during the decade.\nYouTube made an annual video series called \"YouTube Rewind\" where it would be a recap of each year's YouTubers, viral videos, trends, events, music and memes from 2010 to 2019. The 2018 and 2019 installments was heavily criticized by YouTubers, critics, and viewers alike, receiving millions of dislikes. \"Rewind\" did not return for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and YouTube announced the following year that the series would be discontinued leading to other YouTubers to make their own \"YouTube Rewind\" videos.\nMusic.\nGlobalism and an increased demand for variety and personalisation in the face of music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music created many new subgenres. US digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged in the 2010s, with hip-hop and R&amp;B surpassing rock as the biggest US music genre in 2018.\nGenres.\nElectronic dance music (EDM) achieved mass commercial success in the middle of the decade but fell somewhat into decline by the end. The mass global appeal of EDM music (and subgenres such as dubstep, electro house and trap) from the early-to-mid part of the decade spawned the rise in fame of DJs and digital music producers, such as Skrillex, Ti\u00ebsto, Avicii, Steve Aoki, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris, Baauer and Diplo.\nCountry music also saw a resurgence throughout the 2010s in the United States, with artists like Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood, Eric Church, Kacey Musgraves, Chris Stapleton and Florida Georgia Line topping the charts and garnering many music industry awards.\nWith the rise of the internet in the 2010s, independent music gained a large international cult following, with successful indie bands being Foster the People, Dr. Dog, Tally Hall, Florence and the Machine, Beach House, Alt-J, Of Monsters and Men, the National, Two Door Cinema Club, and M83; as well as successful indie solo artists being Tame Impala, Neil Cicierega, St. Vincent, Father John Misty, Ellie Goulding, Feist, Sufjan Stevens, Lana Del Rey, Justin Vernon and Lorde.\nArtists.\nMusic artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Rihanna and Nicki Minaj (with their albums such as \"The Fame Monster\", \"1989\", \"My World 2.0\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans\", \"Loud\" and \"Pink Friday\" respectively) increased the global commercial appeal of pop music in the 2010s, with each of them selling over 100 million records in the 2010s and becoming some of the best-selling musicians of all time.\n\"Billboard\" named Drake the top artist of the decade in the US. Other popular musical solo artists of the 2010s included Adele, Ed Sheeran, Beyonc\u00e9, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, the Weeknd, Frank Ocean, Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, Khalid, Sam Smith, Travis Scott, Cardi B, Future, Shawn Mendes, Post Malone, Kesha, Selena Gomez and Fetty Wap.\nPopular musical groups of the decade included One Direction, BTS, Imagine Dragons, Mumford &amp; Sons, Arcade Fire, Twenty One Pilots, Migos, Swedish House Mafia, Bon Iver, Zac Brown Band, Maroon 5, Alabama Shakes, the Chainsmokers, OneRepublic, Vampire Weekend, the Lumineers, Lady A, Fun, 5 Seconds of Summer and Anthem Lights.\nSuccessful duos included the Black Keys, Run the Jewels, Matt and Kim, Rae Sremmurd, Love and Theft, LMFAO, Garfunkel and Oates and Dan + Shay.\nSeveral prominent musicians from past decades died in the 2010s, including Ronnie James Dio in 2010, Gil Scott-Heron and Amy Winehouse in 2011, Whitney Houston and Adam Yauch in 2012, Lou Reed in 2013, Joe Cocker in 2014, Ben E. King, B.\u00a0B. King and Lemmy Kilmister in 2015, David Bowie, Glenn Frey, Phife Dawg, Merle Haggard, Prince, Pete Burns, Leonard Cohen and George Michael all in 2016, Chuck Berry, Chris Cornell, Prodigy and Tom Petty in 2017, Aretha Franklin in 2018, and Keith Flint in 2019. There were also several deaths of newer hip-hop artists who had started or first became successful in the 2010s, including Capital Steez, Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, Mac Miller, Nipsey Hussle, Juice Wrld and others.\nVideo games.\nVideo game companies and products.\nThe video game industry continued to be dominated by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft; \"Minecraft\" became the best-selling game of all time in 2019.\nSony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One were released in 2013, and in the United States the PlayStation 4 became the highest-selling console of the decade, surpassing Nintendo, releasing games such as \"Marvel's Spider-Man\", \"God of War, , The Last of Us,\" and \"Bloodborne\". The Nintendo Switch launched in 2017 and was responsible for bringing Nintendo's success back, the success of the console initially spawned by the strong sales of Super Smash Bros Ultimate,\"\" and \"Super Mario Odyssey\", as well as Wii U ports/sequels with \"Super Mario Maker\" (Wii U) and \"Super Mario Maker 2\" (Nintendo Switch), \"Splatoon\" (Wii U) and \"Splatoon 2\" (Nintendo Switch), and updated \"Deluxe\" versions of \"Mario Kart 8\" and \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", among many others. Micro-consoles also emerged during the decade, a notable example being the Ouya, a system which was a commercial and critical failure that received attention online.\nSince 2013, console game revenue was overtaken by PC gaming revenue.\nNvidia released the GeForce RTX 20 series in 2018, introducing ray tracing technology to PC gaming. In December 2018 Epic Games launched the Epic Games Store in an attempt to compete with the largest digital distribution platform for PC games, Valve Corporation's Steam.\nHandheld gaming console revenue was overtaken by mobile gaming revenue in 2011, due to the rise of smartphones and freemium apps. The use of iPods, tablets, and cell phones became one of the most popular forms of gaming as the decade progressed with the rise of mobile games, expanding the industry's appeal among less traditional markets such as women and older adults. Gaming apps such as \"Angry Birds\", \"Cut the Rope\", \"Plants vs. Zombies\", \"Fruit Ninja\", \"Candy Crush\", \"Flappy Bird\", \"Clash of Clans\", \"Temple Run\", \"Smash Hit\", \"Doodle Jump\", \"Geometry Dash\", \"Subway Surfers\", and \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\" became huge hits.\nThe popularity of video games increased across the world, as the Nintendo Wii influenced gaming in the early part of the decade, and the Nintendo 3DS provided 3D gaming through autostereoscopy. The successful Wii was followed by the Wii U in 2012, a commercial failure. Ports and sequels to Wii U games on the Nintendo Switch would sell considerably better than their Wii U counterparts, and even though well-received games like \"Super Mario 3D World\" and \"Nintendo Land\" released on Wii U, the console still ultimately failed due to poor marketing and public confusion. The Nintendo Wii would be responsible for the most critically acclaimed game of the 2010s decade, \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\" (which is also often considered one of the greatest video games of all time by game critics).\nThe Wii (and later to a lesser extent the Wii U) would singlehandedly cause the increased use of motion controls in gaming with its \"Wii\" line up of games such as ', \"Wii Fit U\", \"Wii Sports Club\", \"Wii Party\" and \"Wii Party U\", all released in the 2010s. Motion controls would carry over to Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con in 2017, and would form the foundation of 2010's motion-based PlayStation Move and Xbox Kinect, counterparts and competitors to the Wii. In addition to \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\", it is notable in mentioning that Nintendo Wii released a large group of critically acclaimed games in the early 2010s with popular titles such as \"Kirby's Epic Yarn\", \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\" (both games later in the decade released on 3DS), ', and \"Sonic Colors\"; as well \"Portal 2\" was a critical success on Xbox and PlayStation early in the decade.\nThe 2010s marked the growth, release, and large expansion of the \"Toys To Life\" category. Brands such as Nintendo's Amiibo became massively popular, and allowed figurines to be bought which were scanned into games to level up, train your figurine, or receive goods for your figurine. The Amiibo skyrocketed in success due to the roster of figurines available for \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\", with many posting videos of them online going \"amiibo hunting\" mostly around late 2014 and 2015. Skylanders and Disney Infinity also remained popular at the time, as fads. The Nintendo Labo released in 2018, was also a part of the \"Toys To Life\" brand of video games, using cardboard to create objects such as a fishing pole, a crank, and a race-car wheel to be played with games.\nOnline and multiplayer games.\nBy the early 2010s, online gaming had become a mainstay of console platforms such as Xbox and PlayStation. During the 2010s, as the number of Internet users increased, two new video game genres rapidly gained worldwide popularity \u2013 battle royales and multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBA) \u2013 both designed exclusively for multiplayer gameplay over the Internet. First-person shooters were also a popular genre before and during the decade. These genres are commonly played in esports.\nProfessional gaming, also known as esports, although well known in the 2000s, became tremendously big incurring a large increase in both viewership and prize money. By the late 2010s, it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than US$1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of the global esports revenue in 2020. The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, have become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions.\nSince the 2010s, a common trend among online games has been operating them as games as a service, using monetization schemes such as loot boxes and battle passes as purchasable items atop freely-offered games. Unlike purchased retail games, online games have the problem of not being permanently playable, as they require special servers in order to function.\nLet's Plays.\nYouTube and Twitch became platforms for \"Let's Players\" to upload videos of themselves playing certain games, which led to the popularity of existing games and newer indie games like \"Cuphead\", \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\", \"Undertale\", \"Terraria\", \"Hotline Miami\", ', \"The Binding of Isaac\"/', \"Octodad\"/\"\", \"Shovel Knight\", \"Stardew Valley\", and \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" (indie games like \"Cuphead\" were lauded for its rubber hose animation style, while \"Undertale's\" soundtrack like \"Megalovania\" came to light and \"Five Nights At Freddy's\" became well known for its lore).\n\"Let's Players\" were even referenced in greater pop culture such as the 2014 episode Rehash on \"South Park\", where Pewdiepie would be featured onto the show. Jimmy Kimmel would make a sketch parody on his YouTube channel where he would ridicule the \"let's plays\" culture which led to backlash from the gaming community.\nVideo games and movies.\nIn the 2010s movies based on video game franchises became popular, grossing more and being talked about in the media and among fans more than ever before. Movies like \"Detective Pikachu starring\" Ryan Reynolds (which starred additional actors like Kathryn Newton as Lucy Stevens and Bill Nighy as Howard Clifford) broke box office records for movies based on game series at the time, while movies like Jim Carrey's debut in \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" created buzz in the media and on shows like \"Conan\" (where the film and its fans were satirized) in 2019 for the movie's depiction of a more realistic-looking hedgehog character, which by demand of the fans, was changed into a more cartoon version of the titular character to much like and approval upon the November 2019 trailer and movie's release.\nIn early 2018 Nintendo and Illumination jointly announced (after the 2015 reveal of Nintendo's planned Universal theme parks) that they were working on a \"Super Mario Bros.\" movie. The announcement by Nintendo and Illumination was met with internet speculation; the new Illumination \"Super Mario\" film replaced the Sony\u2013Nintendo \"Super Mario\" film that was leaked during the 2014 Sony Pictures hack.\nVideo game-themed movies became popular as well, with films such as \"Ready Player One\", \"Pixels\", \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\", \"Wreck-It Ralph\", ' and '.\nThe best-selling games of every year throughout this decade were as follows: \nLiterature.\nThe best-selling book of the decade was \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", having sold 15.2 million copies in the United States.\nThe following is a list of the 10 best-selling books of the decade. Note that global data is unavailable and this is limited to the United States:\nThe \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" series also became one of the best-selling book series of all time throughout the 2010s, with installments such as ' and ' winning awards at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.\nIn the comic book industry, Japanese manga began outselling western comics.\nSports.\nPopular athletes of the decade included Alex Ovechkin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Megan Rapinoe, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Tiger Woods, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, Canelo \u00c1lvarez, Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Lewis Hamilton, Kyle Busch, Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey, Mike Trout, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt, Shaun White, Kelly Slater, Simone Biles, Sidney Crosby and many more.\nAt the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, tennis players John Isner and Nicolas Mahut competed in the longest professional tennis match in history, requiring five sets and 183 games for Isner to ultimately defeat Mahut in a match which lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes, and was played over the course of three days. The most dominant male Tennis Players were Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic. Andy Murray was also successful in this decade. Amongst female Tennis, Venus and Serena Williams dominated proceedings.\nA doping scandal and investigation that was concluded in 2012 led to former professional road racing cyclist Lance Armstrong being stripped of all seven of his Tour de France titles.\nOn 14 October 2012, skydiver Felix Baumgartner completed a jump from the stratosphere and set world records for the highest skydive (39\u00a0km or 24\u00a0mi), fastest freefall speed (1,357.64\u00a0km/h or 843.6\u00a0mph, or Mach 1.25), and became the first person in history to break the sound barrier without vehicular power.\nIn 2015, after Thoroughbred racehorse American Pharoah won the American Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup Classic, he became 12th Triple Crown winner in history and the first in more than 30 years, and in winning all four races, became the first horse ever to win the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing.\nIn November 2016, the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908, over the then-Cleveland Indians. Their win, along with Game 7 and the entire 2016 Series, was heavily noted in the sports and baseball community. It is often considered one of the best World Series ever played, due to the underdog nature of both teams, how close the games were and especially the final game, and how it ultimately ended the over 100-year drought of the Cubs not winning a series.\nIn Formula 1, Lewis Hamilton won five F1 World Championships during the decade from 2014\u20132019.\nIn June 2017, rock climber Alex Honnold became the first person in history to free solo climb El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, an accomplishment that one commentator described as \"one of the great athletic feats of any kind, ever.\"\nIn January 2018, the final play of an NFL playoffs game between the Minnesota Vikings and the New Orleans Saints, dubbed the \"Minneapolis Miracle\", became the first time in NFL playoffs history where a game ended in a touchdown as time expired, and prompted a change to the NFL's rules as they pertain to extra-point conversion attempts.\nFootball.\nLeicester City won a notable Premier League title in Club Football in 2015\u201316, with 5000/1 odds at the start of the season. Managers like Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Mauricio Pochettino, Didier Deschamps, Antonio Conte, and Luis Enrique were influential during this era of football.\nIn International Football, European sides won all three World Cups, Spain in 2010, Germany in 2014, and France in 2018. Of the finalists, only one was not European, Argentina in 2014. The other finalists were Croatia in 2018 and the Netherlands in 2010. South Africa hosted the first World Cup of the decade, followed by Brazil and then controversially, Russia in 2018. The Euros were the next biggest footballing tournaments of the decade, with Spain winning the 2012 edition held in Poland and Ukraine, retaining there title from 2008. Iberian dominance persisted in 2016 with Portugal winning their first Major Tournament against France in France. In the Copa America, Uruguay (2011), Chile (2015, 2016) and Brazil (2019) registered tournament wins. In terms of the Africa Cup of Nations, the winners were Egypt in 2010, Zambia in 2012, Nigeria in 2013, Ivory Coast in 2015, Cameroon in 2017, and Algeria in 2019.\nIndividual accolades were dominated by two players in particular, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. This inspired renewed focus on who the \"goat\" was, especially in an increasingly online population, with both players winning Ballon d'Ors: Messi with 5, and Ronaldo with 4. The only other player to win a Ballon d'Or this decade was Luka Modri\u0107. The dominance of Ronaldo and Messi was a key feature of the decade, especially because the two players played in the same League for the majority of the decade, with Ronaldo at Real Madrid, and Messi at Barcelona. The two often met in the famous El Cl\u00e1sico fixture.\nRugby.\nRugby was another well-attended sport in this decade. The landscape of club rugby saw the emergence of the Japanese theatre, with big players heading to Japan. Toulon versus Racing 92 in the 2015\u201316 Top 14 final broke records for club rugby when it clocked over 99,000 in attendance at Camp Nou in Barcelona.\nInternational rugby saw the emergence of several new elite sides, with teams like Ireland as a new major player in the European sphere, and on a larger global sphere, where they peaked at Number 1 in 2019, Wales also saw significant improvement and wins, with their overall achievements leading to a stint at Number 1 in 2019. New Zealand and Japan made headlines during the decade, the latter by beating the South Africa national side in 2015. Wales, England, and Ireland dominated the Six Nations, though France did win in 2010. In the Rugby Championship, Argentina were admitted during the 2011 season, in a general surge in South American rugby, with Uruguay becoming established. New Zealand dominated the Rugby Championship, winning all but 2 of the tournaments, losing out in Rugby World Cup years. Italy earned wins versus France and Ireland as well as a shock win against South Africa alongside semi-regular wins against Scotland.\nThe Rugby World Cup was held three times in the 2010s, firstly in New Zealand in 2011, where hosts New Zealand beat France 8\u20137 in the final. New Zealand beat Australia in 2015, 34\u201317 to become the most successful world cup team and the first team to win Back-to-Back titles. Japan hosted the 2019 World Cup and South Africa, led by their first Black Captain, Siya Kolisi, won against England in the final 32\u201312. This was a World Cup of firsts, being the first in Asia, and because Japan progressed as top of their Group after famous wins versus Ireland and Scotland and were beaten only by the eventual winners in the Quarter final. It also saw Uruguay get their first World Cup win against Fiji.\nAnalysis.\nAs the decade drew to a close, some commentators looked back on it as a politically unstable period. An article in the \"New York Times\" stated: \"With the rise of nationalist movements and a backlash against globalisation on both sides of the Atlantic, the liberal post-World War II order \u2013 based on economic integration and international institutions \u2013 began to unravel.\" It heavily discussed the US presidency of Donald Trump (a reality TV star and businessman with no political experience at the time of taking office, succeeding Barack Obama) whilst also commenting, \"Echoes of Mr. Trump's nationalist populism can be found in Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain's recent electoral victory and the Brexit referendum of 2016, and in the ascent of the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Democracy is under threat in Hungary and Poland. Once fringe right-wing parties with openly racist agendas are rebranding themselves in Sweden and Belgium. And far-right groups in Germany and Spain are now the third-largest parties in those nations' parliaments.\" A December 2019 piece in \"The Guardian\" argued that the 2010s would be remembered \"as a time of crises\", elaborating \"there have been crises of democracy and the economy; of the climate and poverty; of international relations and national identity; of privacy and technology\". The article also noted that, in Britain, \"politics since 2010 has often been manic. Parties have hastily changed their leaders and policies; sometimes their entire guiding philosophies. Last week's general election was the fourth of the decade; the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s had two apiece.\" Similar trends of political unrest were felt beyond the Western world, as suggested in \"The Asian Review\", which described the 2010s as a \"tumultuous time for Asia, sometimes tragic, sometimes triumphant and never dull\".\nSee also.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2023, India overtook China to become the most populous country in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath marked the early 2020s. The first reports of the virus were published on 31 December 2019, though the first cases are said to have appeared nearly a month earlier. The pandemic led to a global economic recession, sustained rise in global inflation, and supply chain crisis. The World Health Organization declared the virus a global state of emergency. With multiple extreme weather events and ecological crises continuing to escalate, several world leaders have called the 2020s the \"decisive decade\" for climate action. The years 2023 and 2024 both broke yearly global temperature records, with 2024 breaching 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nGlobal economic inequality skyrocketed. Widespread democratic backsliding continued and many countries' governance shifted from liberal democracy and towards authoritarianism, marking the end of the Post\u2013Cold War era. Far-right extremist and authoritarian politics became prominent in China, South Korea, Israel, Europe, and Russia. Conservative and right-wing populist leaders maintained or returned to power, such as Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Vladimir Putin, while liberal leaders such as Kamala Harris, Keir Starmer, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy were defeated or are struggling.\nAnti-government demonstrations and revolts occurred, such as the Gen Z protests including the \"Asian Spring\" in Asian countries, predominantly led by the eponymous Generation Z, in response to inequality, declining standards of living, corruption, democratic backsliding and authoritarianism. Social media has been a common tool for activism and coordination. Protests against responses to COVID-19, against racism and police brutality by the Black Lives Matter movement, and against various forms of governmental jurisdiction, corruption, and authoritarianism occurred; along with citizen riots throughout the United States and Brazil attempting to overturn election results, seen by supporters as stolen, taking place. Among democracies in 2024, its elections saw 80% of incumbent parties lose support worldwide, as with the 2024 United States presidential election. In 2025, Trump triggered a global trade war, marking a new era of economic nationalism and the end of free trade.\nOngoing military conflicts include those in Myanmar, Ethiopia, Mali, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Gaza. The year 2021 saw the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, ending nearly 20 years of war. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 resulted in a refugee crisis, global trade disruptions, and economic inflation. In 2023, Hamas carried out the October 7 attacks in Israel, killing over 1,200 Israelis and taking 250 as hostages. This led to the Israeli invasion, bombing, blockade, and starvation of the Gaza Strip, which has killed over 65,000 Palestinians and has been characterized as a genocide by a wide consensus of scholarship. The Gaza conflict spilled over, with Houthi attacks on commercial vessels triggering the Red Sea crisis and Israel invading Lebanon amid its conflict with Hezbollah. In 2024, a quick and renewed rebel offensive during the Syrian civil war led to the toppling of Bashar al-Assad and the fall of his regime. In 2025, Israel launched airstrikes against Iran's military and nuclear facilities, prompting Iran to retaliate and the U.S. to join with its own strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Meanwhile, in the context of the war on cartels, the Mexican drug war and the economic crisis in Venezuela, the U.S. launched a military campaign against the cartels in the Caribbean starting in August 2025 with the aim of combating large-scale drug trafficking and narcoterrorism. \nTechnological advances made during the decade include the widespread use of teleconferencing, online learning, e-commerce and food delivery services to compensate for lockdowns ordered by governments around the world during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Streaming services, such as Disney+ and HBO Max, have increased in popularity during the decade, with cable television continuing to fall out of usage. Several popular social media applications launched, such as Threads, BeReal, Clubhouse, Bluesky, Gettr, and Truth Social, continuing advances in digital technology. 5G networks launched around the globe at the start of the decade and became prevalent in smartphones. Research into outer space further evolved, with the United States mainly leading space exploration, including with the James Webb Space Telescope, \"Ingenuity\" helicopter, and \"Artemis\" program. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are being used for remote collaboration, meetings, and training. Contactless payments, including mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, have grown in popularity. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and NFTs, have also increased in popularity. The growth of cryptocurrencies and AI led to the cryptocurrency bubble and AI bubble, with both involved in a circular flow of investments believed to be artificially significantly inflating their actual values.\nPolitics and wars.\nMajor conflicts.\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\nRevolutions and major protests.\nSuccessful revolutions and otherwise major protests of the decade include, but are not limited to:\nTerrorist attacks.\n\"Note: To be included, entries must be notable (have a stand-alone article) and described by a consensus of as \"terrorism.\"\"\nThe most prominent terrorist attacks committed against civilian populations during the decade include, but are not limited to:\nPolitical trends.\nThe 2020s marked the end of the Post-Cold War era, particularly in post-communist Eastern Europe, east of the former Iron Curtain. Center-right politics underwent a decline throughout the western world in the early 2020s, led by demographic changes such as increased tertiary education and ethnic diversity as well as the waning influence of religion and the rise of identity politics. At this time, center-right parties drifted rightward towards right-wing populism, national conservatism, or were supplanted by new far-right parties. Center-left politics has not declined to the same extent, but center-left politicians have faced significant challenges, most notably Joe Biden (particularly age and health concerns). Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine is also struggling, with the next Ukrainian presidential election indefinitely postponed due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nA deep political divide has arisen in the United States, which has seen acute political polarization, with stark divides along race and ethnicity, educational attainment, and political polarization among states. The 2024 United States presidential election was decided by 1.5% (49.8-48.3%), in one of the closest presidential elections in American history. In 2024, Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris after Harris previously defeated Trump in 2020 as the Vice presidential candidate, in a quasi-rematch.\nWestern Europe, Canada, and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) have largely avoided democratic backsliding and the rise of far-right politics, but even there political instability and polarization has increased. Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom has seen his approval ratings fall precipitously, and Emmanuel Macron of France has faced a French political crisis due to a hung parliament. However, in the 2025 Dutch general election the liberal Democrats 66 party won the most seats.\nIn East Asia, political instability has also increased, particularly in Japan and South Korea. South Korea had a martial law crisis in 2024, while in Japan the Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in both houses of the National Diet. The Gen Z protests in Asia began in 2024, with the July Revolution in Bangladesh being described as the world's first Generation Z revolution. Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City in 2025 at the age of 34, becoming the first Muslim, Indian-Ugandan, and millennial mayor of New York City. \nPolitical economic trends.\nThe 2021-2023 inflation surge discredited or weakened nearly all governing parties and leaders during the early 2020s, across ideological lines. In 2025, Trump triggered a global trade war, repudiating neoliberalism and free trade, in favor of mercantilism and protectionism. This was a sea change in Republican Party ideology, raising tariffs to the highest levels since the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.\nDespite being a capitalist country, the relationship between income and voter support in the United States inverted in 2024, because of educational polarization. Kamala Harris won voters making over $100,000 and $200,000 a year, but lost the election. Similar trends have occurred in Canada and the United Kingdom, as center-left parties lose the support of those without college degrees, including many with lower incomes. The right-wing populist Reform UK party has attracted lower-income voters who tend to be older, did not graduate from university, and male. As early as 2018, French economist Thomas Piketty had predicted that center-left parties would come to represent women, the highly educated and high-income, and ethnic minorities, instead of those with low incomes. \nIn particular, high-income women now vote for liberal parties, while low-income men now vote for conservative parties. This is a reversal from the 20th century, when low-income men voted for liberal parties and high-income women voted for conservative parties. High-income men still vote for conservative parties, and low-income women still vote for liberal parties.\nFormer communist countries, particularly in the former Eastern Bloc, have pivoted towards national conservatism and far-right politics. This includes Russia itself under the authoritarian dictatorship of Vladimir Putin. Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine in 2022 with irredentist motives. The Russo-Ukrainian war (2022\u2013present) represents the deadliest war in Eastern Europe since the Eastern Front of World War II and the Russian Civil War. But the trend was broader, also including Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, the Law and Justice party in Poland, and the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which is strongest in the New states of Germany that once comprised East Germany.\nElectoral trends.\nHaving suffered decline in the years after the Great Recession, the centre-left politics and the 1990s political model (like progressivism, liberalism, and social democracy policies) experienced a resurgence across Europe and the Anglosphere in the early 2020s, with \"New Statesman\" suggesting various causes, including natural shifts in the electoral cycle and conservatives' unpopularity among university graduates and voters under the age of 40.\nThe 2020 United States presidential election saw the election of Kamala Harris as vice president was widely regarded as a historic milestone, as the first woman and multicultural (African American and Asian American) to hold the office, reflecting broader trends toward increased diversity and representation in American politics, culture and society. She was conceded defeat as a presidential candidate at the 2024 United States presidential election to Donald Trump.\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election, the mid-2020s saw the resurgence of right-wing populism and the 1980s political model (like Trumpist ideologies of conservatism, social conservatism, and anti-communist policies).\nPolitical polarization has risen in other Western countries, not just the United States. while those who have very unfavorable opinions of the opposing party are at record highs as of 2022. \"The New York Times\" characterized this as part of a \"new global divide\", between national conservatism, social conservatism, and right-wing populism versus social democracy, liberalism, and pro-Europeanism (in Europe) or ethnic minorities such as African Americans (in the United States). The 2020s saw rise of far-right, ultranationalist, libertarian, and right-wing populist political parties in the Western Bloc, such as the People's Party of Canada, Liberal Party of Brazil, National Rally (France), Alternative for Germany, Reform UK, Reform Party (South Korea), Sanseit\u014d (Japan), and the Trump-faction of the Republican Party. Incumbent parties in all 10 major counties that held elections in 2024 lost, the first time this has ever happened since 1905. All 50 states and the District of Columbia shifted towards the Republican Party in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nDeaths.\nSitting leaders that died such as Qaboos bin Said of Oman, Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi, Amadou Gon Coulibaly of the Ivory Coast, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah of Kuwait, Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa of Bahrain, John Magufuli of Tanzania, Idriss D\u00e9by of Chad, Jovenel Mo\u00efse of Haiti, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait, Hage Geingob of Namibia, Ebrahim Raisi of Iran, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng of Vietnam, Didier Guillaume of Monaco and Pope Francis.\nProminent political events.\nCoups.\n\"Coups d'\u00e9tat\" against ruling governments during the decade include:\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nDisasters.\nNatural disasters.\nEarthquakes and tsunamis.\n\"Note: This table is a chronological list of earthquakes reported with 7.5 or greater or that have reported at least 100 fatalities.\"\nFloods, avalanches, and mudslides.\n\"Note: This section reports only floods with 200 or more deaths and avalanches and landslides involving 30 or more deaths.\"\nOther natural events.\nBeginning in 2019 until 2022, a huge swarm of desert locusts threatened to engulf massive portions of the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\nEconomics.\nThe 2020s were marked by economic troubles, beginning from the COVID-19 recession was a major global economic crisis which has caused both a recession in some nations, and in others a depression. The economic crisis began due to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first major sign of a recession was the collapse of markets during the 2020 stock market crash, which began in late February and lasted through March. As of September 2020, every advanced economy is in a recession or depression, whilst all emerging economies are in recession. Modeling by the World Bank suggests that in some regions a full recovery will not be achieved until 2025 or beyond.\nA worldwide increase in inflation began in mid-2021, with many countries seeing their highest inflation rates in decades. It has been attributed to various causes, including pandemic-related economic dislocation; the fiscal and monetary stimulus provided in 2020 and 2021 by governments and central banks around the world in response to the pandemic were also instrumental. In early 2022, the effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on global oil prices, natural gas, fertilizer, and food prices further exacerbated the situation. Higher gasoline prices were a major contributor to inflation as oil producers saw record profits. Debate arose over whether inflationary pressures were transitory or persistent, and to what extent price gouging was a factor.\nAmerican technology billionaires are largely the wealthiest individuals in the world, including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang. Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, and the wealthiest person of Asian descent. Alice Walton is the wealthiest woman in the world. Elon Musk became the first person to reach a net worth of $500 billion, becoming the wealthiest person in human history, and may become the first trillionaire by 2030. Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November 2025, provided Tesla achieves certain financial milestones.\nTrade.\nThe World Trade Organization reported that trade growth had stagnated and that trade restrictions were increasing as the decade began. The sectors most affected by import restrictions were mineral and fuel oils (17.7%), machinery and mechanical appliances (13%), electrical machinery and parts (11.7%), and precious metals (6%). Regional trade agreements were also found to be increasing.\nUnited States President Donald Trump announced 2 April 2025 to be \"liberation day\", beginning to enforce tariffs on numerous nations in the following week. This triggered an ongoing economic trade war as well as the 2025 stock market crash. It is currently the largest decline in the global stock market since the 2020 stock market crash, which was part of a recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. From January to April 2025, the average applied US tariff rate rose from 2.5% to an estimated 27%\u2014the highest level in over a century. The Supreme Court of the United States heard the case \"Learning Resources v. Trump\" on 5 November 2025 to determine the legality of some of Trump's tariffs.\nTrump's tariffs represented a repudiation of neoliberalism and free trade, instead returning to mercantilism and protectionism. Tariffs have a long history in the United States, dating back to the Import-Export Clause of the U.S. Constitution and even the Navigation Acts when the United States was a British colony.\nScience and technology.\nBelow are the most significant scientific developments of each year, based on the annual Breakthrough of the Year award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science journal Science.\nArtificial intelligence.\nThe AI boom is an ongoing period of rapid progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that started in the late 2010s before gaining international prominence in late 2022 with the public release of ChatGPT and DeepSeek in early 2025. Examples include large language models and generative AI applications developed by OpenAI as well as protein folding prediction led by Google DeepMind. This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring, to contrast it with previous AI winters.\nSpaceflight.\nThe trend towards cost reduction in access to orbit is expected to continue. Vulcan is replacing its more expensive predecessors. Since 2023, SpaceX is testing its fully reusable Starship with orbital missions. In 2024, Blue Origin plans the maiden flight of New Glenn with a reusable first stage and Ariane 6 is expected to replace the retired more expensive Ariane 5.\nMars stays a focus for missions to other planets, with three missions launched in 2020 (by China, the United Arab Emirates and the United States) and at least one mission planned for 2024, 2026 and 2028.\nIn 2028, as part of the NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return mission, NASA plans to launch a Sample Retrieval Lander. In 2027, ESA plans to launch the Earth Return Orbiter, which will transport the retrieved samples from Mars to Earth by 2033. China is also planning to retrieve samples from Mars by 2031.\nNASA plans a return of humans to the Moon by 2026. The first uncrewed launch of the Space Launch System happened in 2022. The first crewed launch is planned for February 2026. In addition NASA plans to assemble the Lunar Gateway in lunar orbit. A crewed exploration of Mars could follow in the mid-2030s. SpaceX, a private company, has also announced plans to land humans on Mars in the 2020s, with the long-term goal of enabling the colonization of Mars.\nIndia plans to launch its first crewed flight with a spacecraft called \"Gaganyaan\" on a home-grown GSLV Mark III rocket in 2025. The mission would make India the fourth nation to launch a crewed spaceflight after Russia, the US and China. India also plans to launch its second Mars probe, Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (\"Mangalyaan 2\").\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched in 2021. NASA plans to launch the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will have a field of view 100 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, between October 2026 and May 2027.\nNASA's NEO Surveyor, scheduled to launch no later than June 2028, is expected to be capable of detecting at least 90% of near-Earth objects larger than , a goal mandated by the US Congress in 2005.\nThe number of small satellites launched annually was expected to grow to around one thousand (2018 estimate), mainly communication satellites in large constellations but launches quickly exceeded this estimate, mainly due to the rapid deployment of the Starlink and OneWeb constellations. From 2020 to 2022, around 3500 Starlink satellites and 500 satellites by OneWeb were launched.\nThe number of total satellites reached 10,000 for the first time in 2024.\nSociety.\nSocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMedical experts advised, and local authorities often mandated stay-at-home orders to prevent gatherings of any size. Such gatherings would be replaced by teleconferencing, or in some cases with unconventional attempts to maintain social distancing with activities such as a balcony sing-along for a concert, or a \"birthday parade\" for a birthday party. Replacements for gatherings were seen as significant to mental health during the crisis. Social isolation among alcohol users also adopted a trend towards \"Kalsarik\u00e4nni\" or \"pantsdrunking\", a Finnish antisocial drinking culture.\nLow-income individuals were more likely to contract the coronavirus and to die from it. In both New York City and Barcelona, low-income neighborhoods were disproportionately hit by coronavirus cases. Hypotheses for why this was the case included that poorer families were more likely to live in crowded housing and work in jobs deemed essential during the crisis, such as supermarkets and elder care. In the United States, millions of low-income people may lack access to health care due to being uninsured or underinsured. Millions of Americans lost their health insurance after losing their jobs. Many low-income workers in service jobs became unemployed.\nThe coronavirus pandemic was followed by a concern for a potential spike in suicides, exacerbated by social isolation due to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and unemployment and financial factors. Many countries reported an increase in domestic violence and intimate partner violence attributed to lockdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial insecurity, stress, and uncertainty led to increased aggression at home, with abusers able to control large amounts of their victims' daily life. Midlife crisis is a major concern in domestic violence, social implications and suicides for middle-aged adults amid the pandemic. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for a domestic violence and midlife crisis \"ceasefire\".\nGender.\n24.3% of all national parliamentarians were women as of February 2019. 11 women were serving as head of state and 12 as head of government in June 2019. 20.7% of government ministers were women as of January 2019.

Rwanda has the highest number of women parliamentarians worldwide, 61.3% of seats in the lower house. About 26% of elected local parliamentarians are women.\nMany states swore in their first female leaders during the 2020s, including Presidents Katerina Sakellaropoulou (Greece), Samia Suluhu Hassan (Tanzania), Sandra Mason (Barbados), Xiomara Castro (Honduras), Katalin Nov\u00e1k (Hungary), Dina Boluarte (Peru), Nata\u0161a Pirc Musar (Slovenia), Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova (North Macedonia) and Prime Ministers Rose Christiane Raponda (Gabon), Victoire Tomegah Dogb\u00e9 (Togo), Kaja Kallas (Estonia), Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'afa (Samoa), Robinah Nabbanja (Uganda), Najla Bouden (Tunisia), Magdalena Andersson (Sweden), Giorgia Meloni (Italy), Judith Suminwa (DRC), Chairwoman Borjana Kri\u0161to (Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Sanae Takaichi (Japan).\nDespite this, nearly all of the world's wealthiest individuals (mostly American technology billionaires) are male, as are the heads of state of most countries.\nEnvironmentalism.\nThe effects of climate change manifested in 2020 with a record 30 named Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes; the highest heat in 80-years recorded at 54.4 Celsius; massive wildfires in Australia, the Western United States, and the Arctic; and the second-lowest annual Arctic sea ice coverage.

During this period, the trend towards individuality and self-expression in clothing continued. Young millennials and Generation Z has witnessed and enjoyed a notable resurgence of fashion styles from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s in the fashion industry. A prominent example of this is the revival of trends such as crop tops, baggy jeans, and elements from the Y2K aesthetic.\nSustainable fashion practices gained significance, with an increased awareness of environmentally friendly materials and production processes.

{"id": "36431", "revid": "37092907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36431", "title": "1340s", "text": "Decade\nDecade\nThe 1340s was a decade that began on 1 January 1340 and ended on 31 December 1349. It was in the midst of a period in human history often referred to as the Late Middle Ages in the Old World and the pre-Columbian era in the New World.\nIn Asia, the Mongol Empire and its breakaway states were in a state of gradual decline. The Ilkhanate had already fragmented into several political territories and factions struggling to place their puppet leaders over the shell of an old state; the Chagatai Khanate was undermined by religious unrest and fell to rebellion. The Black Plague swept through the Kipchak Khanate in 1346, and also affected the Genoese colonies under Mongol siege, thence spreading into Europe. The Yuan dynasty in China was struck by a series of disasters, including frequent flooding, widespread banditry, fires in urban areas, declining grain harvest, increased civil unrest and local rebellion \u2013 the seeds of resistance that would lead to its downfall. Southeast Asia remained free from Mongol power; two major regional powers, the Tran dynasty and Majapahit thrived in the 1340s, after each defeated Mongol attacks in the 1280s and 1290s respectively.\nIn Europe, the decade continued the period of gradual economic decline, often mistitled the \"depression\" of the 1340s. This followed the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the start of the Little Ice Age in the 14th century, and affected most of Western Europe, with the exception of a few Italian city-states. The state increasingly interfered in the socio-economic status of its commoners in the decade. Europe entered a period which saw almost continuous war for the next century. The Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between France and England continued, and Edward III of England led an invasion resulting in notable victories at the Battles of Sluys and Cr\u00e9cy in 1340 and 1346 respectively. The medieval crusading spirit continued in Spain, with a Castilian victory at the Battle of R\u00edo Salado and the recommencement of the Reconquista in 1340; and in the Baltic, with Swedish King Magnus Eriksson's Northern Crusades against Novgorod in 1347\u20131348. In the east, the Byzantine Empire, then under the Palaiologoi, saw the disastrous Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347. Meanwhile, a crisis of confidence in the Florentine banks caused many of them to collapse between 1341 and 1346. The Black Plague which struck Europe in 1348 wiped out a full third of the population by the end of the decade.\nIn Africa, the two great empires were the Christian Ethiopian Empire in the east and the Muslim Mali Empire in the west. Amda Seyon I, who had brought Ethiopia to its height, was succeeded in 1344 by Newaya Krestos, who continued to foster trade in East Africa. Mansa Suleyman assumed office in the Mali Empire in 1341, and similarly took steep measures to reform Mali's finances. Songhai, which had emerged in this decade, was conquered by Mali for the time being. In the Americas, cities of the Mississippian culture such as Cahokia, Kincaid and Moundville went into an accelerated state of decline in this decade. Factors such as depletion of resources, climatic change, war, disease, social unrest and declining political and economic power have been suggested, although the sites were not fully abandoned until the 15th century. Central America saw the decayed Maya civilization ruled from their capital Mayapan in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, while the Mexicas from their capital city of Tenochtitlan were on the rise.\nAsia.\nPolitical developments.\nMongol decline.\nIn the Kipchak Khanate, \u00d6zbeg Khan of the Golden Horde died in 1341, ending what Muslim chroniclers considered a golden age. His elder son Tinibeg ruled for a year or two, before being dethroned and killed at the hands of his younger brother Janibeg in 1342. Janibeg's fifteen-year reign was notable for the appearance and rapid transmission of the Black Plague along the trade routes from inner Asia in this decade. The nation \"struggled into new life\" after the plague had passed in the following decade.\nThe Chagatai Khanate was being split by religious dissensions between the traditionalist Mongol adherents of the \"Yasa\" and the Mongol and Turkish converts to Islam. The eastern half of Chagatai seceded under the conservative Mongol element when Tughluk Tem\u00fcr seized power in Moghulistan around 1345. The Khanate continued in Transoxiana, but the Chatagai khans became the puppets of the now enthusiastically Muslim Turkish amirs, and the amir Kazghan overthrew the Khan Kazan in 1347.\nIn the Persian Ilkhanate, the Mongol House of H\u00fcleg\u00fc had been extinguished in the male line with the death of Il-Khan Abu Sa'id in 1335, . As JJ Saunders wrote, \"A crowd of competitors for the vacant throne started up, but of some history has scarcely condescended to record their names, much less their actions, and an interval of more than thirty years was filled with confused political struggles\". Numerous claimants were set up in the 1330s; by 1339, the two rivals were Jahan Tem\u00fcr set up by Shaik Hasan-i Buzurg, and Suleiman Khan supported by Shaik Hasan-i Kuchak. In June 1340, the two Hasans and their rival khans met in battle on the Jaghatu; \"Hasan-i Buzurg was defeated and fled to Baghdad, where he deposed Jahan-Tem\u00fcr and himself assumed sovereignty as the founder of the Jalayir dynasty\". The deposition of Jahan-Tem\u00fcr can be regarded as the final dissolution of the Ilkhanate. Although his rival retained nominal power among the Chobanids for another year or two, he in turn was deposed by Hasan-i Kuchak's brother and similarly disappears into obscurity. \"So insignificant had these figureheads become\", according to JA Boyle, \"that we are not even informed as to the time and manner of their death\". Suleiman was replaced as puppet by Anushirvan, \"in whose name his Chobanid masters continued to strike coin until 1353\".\nChina.\nIn China, the Mongol Yuan dynasty was in a gradual state of decline, due to complex and longstanding problems such as the \"endemic tensions among its ruling elites\". Toghon Tem\u00fcr had been installed as emperor at age thirteen in 1333, and was to reign as the last Yuan emperor until 1368. In March 1340, the Yuan chancellor, Bayan of the Merkid, was removed in a carefully orchestrated coup, and replaced by his nephew Toqto'a. In Bayan's overthrow by the younger generation, the movement to restore the status quo from reign of Kublai Khan effectively died. Bayan's purges were called off; his supporters dismissed; positions he had closed to the Chinese were reopened; the meritocratic system of examinations for official service was restored. By this time, Tem\u00fcr had just begun to participate in the formal functions of state, and assisted in the \"anti-Bayan coup\": he issued a posthumous denunciation of his uncle Tugh Tem\u00fcr; he exiled the grand empress dowager Budashiri and his cousin El Teg\u00fcs; and entrusted the upbringing of his infant son Ayushiridara to Toghto's household.\nToghto's first term exhibited a fresh new spirit which took a predominantly centralist approach to political solutions. He directed an unsuccessful project to connect the imperial capital to the sea and the Shanxi foothills by water; he was more successful in his attempt to organise funds for the completion of the official histories of the Liao, Qin and Song dynasties. In June 1344, however, he tendered his resignation following a series of local rebellions that had broken out against the Yuan in scattered areas of China.\nToghto's replacement as chancellor was Berke Bukha, an effective provincial administrator who took the opposite, decentralised approach to Toghto. Bukha had learned firsthand from the great Hangzhou fire of 1341 that central regulations had to be violated to provide immediate and effective relief. Accordingly, he promoted able men to local positions and gave them discretionary authority to handle relief and other problems. Similarly, he granted local military garrisons blanket authorisation to prevent the spread of banditry. In 1345, Bukha's administration sent out twelve investigation teams to visit each part of China, correct abuses, and \"create benefits and remove harms\" for the people.\nBukha's approach failed to arrest the mounting troubles of Yuan China in the 1340s, however. The central government was faced with chronic revenue shortfalls. Maritime grain shipments \u2014 vital for the inhabitants of the imperial capital \u2014 had seriously declined from a peak of 3.34 million bushels in 1329 to 2.6 million in 1342. From 1348 on, they continued only when permitted by a major piratical operation led by Fang Kuo-chen and his brothers, which the authorities were unable to suppress. Additionally, the Yellow River was repeatedly swelled by long rains, breaching its dykes and flooding the surrounding areas. When the river finally began shifting its course, it caused \"widespread havoc and ruin\". In 1349, the emperor recalled Toghto to office for a second term. With high enthusiasm and strong belief from his partisans that the problems were soluble, he began a radical process of recentralisation and heavy restriction of regional and local initiative in the following decade.\nIndia.\nThe 1340s saw the founding of the Bahmani Kingdom in central India. Wars between the Muslims of the north and the southern Hindus of the Vijayanagara Empire occurred in this period. In 1341, the Sultan of Delhi chose Ibn Battuta to lead a diplomatic mission to China.\nCulture, religion and philosophy.\nPope Benedict XII had despatched the Italian Franciscan John of Marignolli in 1339, who travelled safely through the Yuan territories of Kipchak and Chagatai Khanate during the Pax Mongolica and reached the imperial capital of Ta-tu in 1342. He was received in an audience with Toghon Tem\u00fcr, to whom he presented some large European horses \u2014 their bulk, according to JJ Saunders, \"surprised Chinese and Mongols alike, accustomed as they were to the small, wiry animals of the steppes\". Marignolli stayed in China for five years, departing by ship in 1347 and returning to Avignon in 1353.\nEurope.\nPolitical developments.\nWar and decline in Western Europe.\nIn Europe, the decade continued the period of gradual economic decline, which followed the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the start of the Little Ice Age in the 1300s. This secular decline, often mistitled a \"depression\", affected most of Western Europe, with the exception of a few Italian city-states. It was the result of factors which had begun earlier in the century, the main cause being the breaking of the balance between Church and state. The more dominant state increasingly interfered in the social and economic life of late medieval Europe, imposing detrimental taxation and regulation. King Edward III of England faced a brief standoff with some dissident barons in 1341 \u2014 one of only two such isolated standoffs in his popular reign. Meanwhile, the role of the Parliament of England became more defined, with the House of Commons regularly petitioning Edward from about 1343 onward.\nEurope entered a period which saw almost continuous war for the next century. Fighting took place in the Duchy of Brittany, \"a country well suited to guerilla warfare\", from 1342 to 1365 in the Breton War of Succession. The Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between France and England continued, and Edward III led an invasion resulting in a number of victories. One of the earlier English victories was at the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340, which annihilated the French fleet and gave the English control of the English Channel for several years. The initial campaigns were frustrating and expensive, so Edward altered his strategy to use English armies that were lightly supported but prepared to forage off the land. It successfully established English control over Brittany in 1342. Further armies were sent to Brittany and Gascony in 1345, and Edward himself crossed the Channel in 1346 with 10,000 men \u2014 an enormous army by contemporary standards. They plundered Caen, an important town in Normandy, and eventually began moving back toward the Channel.\nIn 1346, the Battle of Crecy became the first great land battle of the Hundred Years' War, and the most stunning victory of Edward's career. English longbowmen crippled the French knights for many years to come, allowing Edward to take the key Channel port of Calais in 1347. Meanwhile, public discontent caused the town of Lyon to riot in 1347. Importantly, the English campaign of the 1340s \"brought the hegemony of high medieval France to a decisive close.\"\nCentral Europe.\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, Ludwig the Bavarian was in conflict with the Avignon Papacy. Pope Clement VI influenced the German Prince-electors to elect Charles of Moravia as rival king to Ludwig. He was crowned in 1346 in Bonn. After the death of Emperor Ludwig in September 1347, Charles IV was recognised as King of Germany by all of the German princes.\nIn 1341, Margarete Maultasch, Countess of County of Tyrol, had expelled her husband John Henry of Bohemia. She then married Louis of Bavaria, a son of Ludwig, without an annulment of her previous marriage. The result was the excommunication of the couple.\nNorthern Europe.\nIn 1340, a German law-code was drawn up by the Teutonic Knights for their long-settled Prussian district of Pomesania. The code defined two categories of people: the unfree, who came under peasant law (\"Gebauersrecht\") and were consigned to the jurisdiction of their lords; and the freedmen. The latter group included peasants who had the right to demand trial by the written code and could not be sentenced to death in private courts. However, an appendix to the law-code also made it clear that the Old Prussian peasant converts were discriminated against by the Teutonic Knights, and were allowed remain \"semi-pagan, uncouth and lawless\". Such treatment shocked contemporary commentators such as Saint Bridget of Sweden.\nThe Danish monarchy had disintegrated in the 1330s, but was restored in 1340 by Valdemar IV after a long interregnum. In the Danish crusader state of Estonia, some 80% of the indigenous population was subject to immigrant lords, to whom they owed tithe and military duty. When the lords reacted to falling grain-prices by increasing the level of tithe, which led to the St. George's Night Uprising in 1343. On 23 April, the Estonians rose up and killed their masters \u2014 German sources give a figure of 18,000 dead as a result of the uprising, although this total is unlikely. The Danish government in Estonia was overthrown when a major group of vassals in Tallinn handed over castles to the Teutonic Order in 1344\u20131345. Beset by pressing problems at home and unable to break the monopoly of the Hanseatic League at sea, Valdemar decided to sell the territory to the master of the Teutonic Order for 10,000 marks. The final sale was approved by the king's Danish counsellors, and the shift of sovereignty took place on 1 November 1346.\nIn Sweden, the court was continually reminded of its religious duties by Bridget of Sweden, who was the king's cousin and beginning to win fame as a prophetess. Her primary aim was to reform and purify the upper class, and her posthumously complied \"Revelations\" contain thoughts on the Northern Crusades which must have been expressed in the 1344\u20131348 period. After King Magnus Eriksson had tried and failed to take possession of Denmark in the early 1340s, she advised him not to offend his people by raising taxes to fund wars against their co-religionists, but instead to raise taxes only for self-defence or in crusading against unbelievers. Therefore, after Magnus had at least temporarily resolved difficulties at home, he prepared for a crusade against the Russian Orthodox Novgorod. Envoys were sent to the Russians in 1347, and an army was assembled that included Danish and German auxiliaries, and the support of Henry of Rendsburg. The army set sail for the campaign in 1348.\nAccordingly, there were political divisions in the Russian states in this decade. The southern territories of Novgorod had been subjugated by Prince Algirdas of Lithuania in 1346, and Simeon of Moscow had failed to intervene. The city was divided between competing boyar factions, and the lack of unity between Novgorod and her allies allowed for the success of Magnus' campaign of 1348. Pskov officially broke away from Novgorod that year; and Simeon was again delayed in helping against the Swedes, this time by business with his overlord, the Khan of the Golden Horde. Orekhov was taken by the Swedes, although it was to fall in 1349.\nSouthern Europe.\nIn Rome, the general despair brought on by the Plague and the absence of the Pope have been cited as possible causes for the rise of the Roman notary Cola di Rienzo: in 1347, he assumed the title of censor and claimed to restore the Roman Republic. He utilised popular rhetoric, and invited the men of Trastevere to sack the palaces of the fleeing Roman nobility. Cola tried to establish direct government with elections in the \"rione\" of the city, but he lacked the means to take the Castel Sant'Angelo and he was cut down by the Roman aristocracy in 1354.\nThere were several rulers of the Kingdoms of Spain in the 1340s. Alfonso XI the Just ruled until the end of the decade as King of Castile and Le\u00f3n. Castile and Le\u00f3n surrounded Granada by land, and Alfonso advanced the Christian \"Reconquista\". In 1340, at the Battle of R\u00edo Salado, he won the first Castilian victory over the Moors for over a century, and crossed the straits to Algeciras. In 1345, he attacked Gibraltar, but was unable to conquer it.\nBy 1343, Aragon had acquired the Balearic Islands, and in 1344 Peter deposed James III of Majorca to become King of Majorca himself. Navarre was ruled by Philip III until 1343, his Capetian wife Joanna II until 1349, and finally Charles II the Bad ruled into the late 14th century. The Kingdom of Portugal was meanwhile ruled by Afonso IV, from 1325 until his death in 1357.\nIn 1341, Saluzzo sacked by Manfred V of Saluzzo. In 1342, Louis \"the Child\" became King of Sicily and Duke of Athens. An earthquake and tsunami of 1343 devastated the Maritime Republic of Amalfi.\nSociety and economy.\nEconomic collapse and crisis.\nTo finance the continuing wars of the 1340s, Edward III of England granted to a small group of merchants a monopoly on the export of wool. In return, they agreed to collect the \"poundage\", or wool tax, on his behalf. This included a tariff on the import of woolen cloth, which put out of business the Italian and foreign merchants that had dominated the wool export trade. The monopoly merchants went bankrupt in the following decade.\nEdward also introduced three new gold coins in 1344: the florin, leopard, and helm. However, the gold content of these coins did not match their respective value of 6 shillings, 3 shillings, and 1 shilling and sixpence, so they had to be withdrawn and mostly melted down by August of that year.\nIn France, the king's personal expenditure on dowries, gratuities, the upkeep of the palace, his travels and his wardrobe, consumed the entirety of the royal income. Therefore, a monopoly on salt, an essential commodity, was established in 1341; monopolies in salt had already been established in Kingdom of Castile and Venice in the 1330s. The French salt tax or \"gabelle\" itself never amounted to more than 2%. \"Fouages\" were also levied in 1342 and 1349.\nThe Italian city states were booming at the start of the decade. In 1340, Francesco Balducci Pegolotti wrote his \"Practica della mercatura\". Meanwhile, rulers such as the Neapolitan princes had begun withdrawing massive funds from Florentine banks. England found itself unable to repay its debts, and both factors resulted in a crisis of confidence in the Florentine banks The family-based banks and mercantile associations of Florence and Genoa generally kept only 25\u201330% of their capital in liquid assets, and between 1341 and 1346, many of the most important of the Florentine banks collapsed. \u2014 an \"avalanche of bankruptcies\", in the words of Robert Fossier. These were owned by the following banking families: the Acciaiuolis, the Bonaccorsis, the Cocchis, the Antellesis, the Corsinis, the Uzzanos, the Perendolis, the Peruzzis and the Bardis.\nSocial unrest.\nThe situation in the towns remained delicate: while on one hand the trades were dominant, and Villani counted no fewer than 200 textile workshops in Florence around 1340, working conditions and entry restrictions imposed by the guilds created tensions with the unemployed and unskilled labourers. Strikes or \"gr\u00e8ves\" occurred in Ghent in 1337\u20131345 and in Florence in 1346. In 1349\u20131350, the fullers and weavers of Ghent and Li\u00e8ge massacred each other. The failures in the food supply in the regions of Provence and Lyon, in 1340 and 1348 respectively, affected contemporaries particularly harshly. This was not just because these generations were unused to them, but because they were accompanied by war and followed by epidemic in this decade.\nThe Black Plague.\nIn 1340, the total population of Europe was 54 million; by 1450, it would be 37 million, a 31% drop in only a century. In addition to the earlier social and economic decline, the Black Plague is identified as the superficial cause, which struck Europe and wiped out a full third of the population in short space of 1348\u20131350. It has been described as \"a pandemic of plagues such as the world had not seen since the sixth century and was not destined to see again till the 1890s.\" It was actually three related diseases: bubonic plague and septicaemic plague, carried by fleas hosted by the black rat, and pneumonic plague, the especially fast and lethal airborne variant. The few areas that escaped included Poland, Hungary, Rouergue in France, Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, and the county of B\u00e9arn in the Pyrenees. It has been suggested that these areas were spared due to the predominance of O-Blood type, which had only recently taken root in the heartlands of Europe, although this hypothesis has yet to be proven.\nThe pandemic, which began in central Asia, was first reported in Europe in the summer of 1346. The Genoese colony of Caffa in the Crimea was besieged by the Tartars, who catapulted plague-ridden corpses into the city. The defenders carried the disease back to Italy; in October 1347 it reached Messina in Sicily, in December a ship carried the plague into Marseille, and by January 1348 it was in Genoa. The plague then moved northward through France. According to the French monk Guillaume de Nangis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The reasons for the plague's success are not yet entirely understood. Urban overcrowding, declining sanitary conditions and the \"lively European trade in (rat-infested) grain\" have been cited as causes of the plague's rapid transmission; while favourable climatic conditions and the summer months may also have aided its spread. In the summer of 1348 it reached England, arriving first at Melcombe Regis in Dorset. It had spread through the southwestern shires to London by winter. It peaked in the summer of 1349, when it was passed on into Germany and Austria, and in winter it was in Scotland, Scandinavia and Spain.\nIn general, towns were hit more severely than rural areas, the poor more than the rich, and the young and fit more than the old and infirm. Norman Davies generalises that \"No pope, no kings were stricken.\" Hundreds died in each parish, although some figures may have been exaggerated. Norwich, a city that did not exceed 17,000, was reported as having lost 57,000. The Italian humanist Giovanni Boccaccio records a loss of 100,000 in Florence, exceeding the total population of the city. The figure was probably closer to 50,000. Regardless, modern studies make it clear that the plague's toll in this decade was heavy.\nHeaviest hit were the clergy, who were brought into direct contact with plague victims. Guillaume de Nangis records that \"some monks and friars, being braver, administered the sacraments\", and that the sisters at the hospital of Paris, \"fearless of death, carried out their task to the end with the most perfect gentleness and humility. These sisters were all wiped out by death...\" In the dioceses of York and Lincoln, about 44% of the clergy perished, while nearly 50% died in the Exeter, Winchester, Norwich and Ely. In all, half of the English clergy may have died.In 14th century England, the Black Plague \"served as a somber backdrop to a deepening economic crisis... and growing social tensions and religious restlessness.\" Villages were deserted, herds were untended, wool and grain markets were crippled and land values plummeted. The plague would strike periodically in subsequent decades. However, it is also suggested that in Europe in general, the Black Plague solved the economic recession, in that the reduction in population returned the supply of cash credit and money per capita to its pre-crisis level, laying the foundation for recovery. Wages rose, and the peasantry benefited from a more open, fluid society.[Note 1] At the end of the decade, the economic effects of the Black Plague \"may well have been more purgative than toxic\".\nCulture, religion and philosophy.\nArchitecture.\nA number of European building projects were completed in the 1340s, mainly consisting of cathedrals and universities. In 's-Hertogenbosch, construction was finished on the Romanesque church begun in 1220, which was later rebuilt as the 16th century St. John's Cathedral. In the German city of Mainz, work was completed on the Collegiate Church of St. Stephan, begun in 1267. In Naples, three decades of work were finished on the monastery of Santa Chiara.\nThe High Gothic choir of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, was consecrated in 1340. Mecheln Cathedral, then a collegiate church, was started with the choir in 1342. In 1344, Prague was made an archbishopric, and the foundation stone was laid on the new St. Vitus Cathedral. Cathedrals completed in this decade, excluding later alterations, include Notre Dame de Paris and the Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius, completed around 1345 and 1346 respectively. In Ely Cathedral, the last part of the repairs to the structure was finished with the richly decorated Lady Chapel in 1345.\nIn Venice, the Venetian Gothic Palazzo Ducale, or Doge's Palace, was erected on top of older buildings in 1340. In Switzerland, the walls of the Old City of Berne were extended up to the Christoffelturm, from 1344 to 1346. Berne's K\u00e4figturm was erected from 1256 to 1344 as the second western city gate. In Siena, the Torre della Mangia of the Palazzo Pubblico was completed in 1348. That same year, land in the English town of Charing held by the Archbishop of Canterbury was redeveloped as an episcopal palace.\nThe Scuola della Carit\u00e0, one of the six Scuole Grandi of Venice, was built in 1343. Two medieval universities were established in the 1340s: the University of Pisa (1343) and the University of Prague (1347). The University of Valladolid was also granted a \"licentia ubique docendi\" by Pope Clement VI in 1347, during the reign of Alfonso XI. Queen's College, Oxford, was founded by the chaplain Robert de Eglesfield in 1341, and Queen Philippa secured the lands of a small hospital in Southampton for the college in 1343. Meanwhile, Bablake School was founded in Coventry in 1344 by the Queen Mother, Isabella of France, while Pembroke College, Cambridge, was completed in 1347.\nArt.\nIn religious art, a series of stained glass windows were completed for the choir clerestory of \u00c9vreux Cathedral in Normandy c. 1340. Stained glass was also completed for the former K\u00f6nigsfelden Abbey in Switzerland, around the same time.\nThe possibilities of Giotto's art were developed further in this decade by his pupils Maso di Banco and Bernardo Daddi. Significant of their works is \"\", painted in 1340 by di Banco for the Church of Santa Croce in Florence. An illustration by the artist Domenico Lenzi, the \"City Scene\" of 1340 from the \"Il Biadaiolo\" codex, shows just how much the Florentine artists were influenced by Giotto.\nIn 1340, toward the end of his life, the painter Simone Martini was called to Avignon to work for the papal court. His frescos in the portico of Avignon Cathedral have been lost, but the frescoes in the papal palace, painted by his pupils or colleagues around 1340, survive. Another notable religious artist was the Pisan painter Francesco Traini, who painted the \"Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas\" as part of an Italian altarpiece \"which reflects the divine order of the cosmos\".\nIn sculpture, the main artist was Andrea Pisano, who maintained a workshop in Pisa with his son Nino Pisano from 1343 to 1347. They are noted for the famous sculpture \"Maria lactans\", and their work on Orvieto Cathedral.\nLiterature.\nIn 1341, Petrarch was crowned poet laureate in Rome, the first man since antiquity to be given this honor.\nMilitary technology.\nIt was around this decade that medieval cannon began to be used more widely in Europe, appearing in small numbers in several European states by the 1340s. \"Thunder jar\" weaponry utilizing gunpowder and other firearm technology spread to Spain in 1342 and to the city of Aachen in Northern Germany in 1346. \"Ribaldis\" were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts between 1345 and 1346, during preparations for the campaign in France. The effectiveness of these cannon was limited, as they are believed to have only shot large arrows and simple grapeshot, but they were so valuable that they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe. Contemporary chroniclers such as the French Jean Froissart and the Florentine Giovanni Villani record their destructiveness on the field at the Battle of Crecy in 1346.\nPhilosophy and religion.\nIn the 1340s, Catholic Church was governed under the Avignon Papacy. Pope Benedict XII died on 25 April 1342, and was buried in a mausoleum in Avignon Cathedral. Thirteen days later, the cardinals elected Benedictine cardinal and theologian Pierre Roger de Beaufort as Pope Clement VI. He reigned as pope until 1352.\nIn 1340s, the controversial Franciscan friar and Scholastic philosopher William of Ockham was at Munich under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis of Bavaria, since 1330. During this time, he wrote exclusively on political matters, as an advocate of secular absolutism against papal authority, for which he had previously been excommunicated. Among the followers of Ockhamism \u2014 condensed as the omnipotence of God and Occam's Razor \u2014 were John of Mirecourt (fl. c. 1345) and Nicholas of Autrecourt (fl. c. 1347), both of whom taught at the University of Paris. Ockham, Mirecourt and Autrecourt all agreed on the principle of noncontradiction and experience as bases of certainty.\nOn November 21, 1340, Autrecourt too was summoned him to Avignon to respond to allegations of false teaching. The trial, under Pope Benedict XII and his successor Clement VI, lasted until his conviction in 1346. Autrecourt was charged with 66 erroneous teachings or \"articles\", which he publicly recanted before the papal court. He recanted them in public again, in Paris in 1347. Although Ockham also expressed willingness to resubmit to the Church and Franciscan Order, there is no evidence of a formal reconciliation. Ockham is sometimes said to have died in 1349, but it is more likely to have been 1347.\nIn 1343, Clement VI issued the papal bull \"Unigenitus\". The bull defined the doctrine of \"The Treasury of Merits\" or \"The Treasury of the Church\" as the basis for the issuance of indulgences by the Catholic Church.\nAfrica.\nIn Egypt, the Mameluk sultans were constantly changing. In 1347, the Blue Mosque was completed in Cairo.\nIn the Horn of Africa, the 1340s were part of the century and a half (1314\u20131468) that comprised \"the crowning era of medieval Ethiopia\", which began with the reign of Amda Seyon I. The crusading spirit of Amda's conquests in the previous decades had established an effective Ethiopian hegemony over his divided Muslim neighbours, but the chief concern of his conquests had been above all to maintain trade for both Muslims and Christians. On Amda's death in 1344, the size of his Christian Empire was double what it had been in 1314. Trade flourished in ivory and other animal products from the western and southwestern border regions, while food products were exported from the highlands to the eastern lowlands and coastal ports. He was succeeded as emperor by his eldest son Newaya Krestos, who followed his father's policies toward the Mulisms in the east, most of whom continued to be tributaries of Ethiopia.\nIn the Mali Empire of West Africa, Mansa Souleyman, who had assumed office in 1341, took steep measures to put Mali back into financial shape, developing a reputation for miserliness. However, he proved to be a good and strong ruler despite numerous challenges. It is during his reign that Fula raids on Takrur began. There was also a palace conspiracy to overthrow him hatched by the Qasa (Manding term meaning Queen) and several army commanders. Mansa Souleyman's generals successfully fought off the military incursions, and the senior wife behind the plot was imprisoned. Mali was at this time the dominant empire of West Africa, having conquered Songhai Empire. The Songhai Empire would not regain independence for another three decades.\nAmericas.\nVery little is known of the Americas in this period, save what can be determined from archaeology. In North America, the Mississippian culture was in a continued state of decline. The city of Cahokia had experienced gradual decline since the 1200s, possibly due to contributory factors such as depletion of resources, climatic change, war, disease, social unrest and declining political and economic power. The final abandonment of the city may have taken place some time between this decade and 1400. Radiocarbon dating of wash material from Mound 55 give a date of around 1350, which can be taken as the time the mound was last used.\nOther Mississippian sites which went into decline after this decade, from about 1350 on, include the Kincaid Mounds and the Moundville site. In the case of the latter, the decline was marked by a loss of the appearance of a town and a decrease in the importation of goods. Although the site retained its ceremonial and political functions, some of the mounds were abandoned while others lost their religious importance altogether.\nIn Central America, the Mayans, who centuries earlier had suffered a serious decline, were ruled from a capital in the Yucatan Peninsula called Mayapan. Other pre-Columbian civilisations, however, were on the rise. The precursors to the Aztecs, the Mexicas, had recently founded their capital city of Tenochtitlan. They also had occasional skirmishes with the nearby Mixtec civilization.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "36460", "revid": "40427189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36460", "title": "First Nephi", "text": "First book in the Book of Mormon\nThe First Book of Nephi: His Reign and Ministry (), usually referred to as First Nephi or 1 Nephi, is the first book of the Book of Mormon, the sacred text of churches within the Latter Day Saint Movement, and one of four books with the name Nephi. First Nephi tells the story of his family's escape from Jerusalem prior to the exile to Babylon, struggle to survive in the wilderness, and building a ship and sailing to the \"promised land\", commonly interpreted by Mormons as the Americas. The book is composed of two intermingled genres; one a historical narrative describing the events and conversations that occurred and the other a recounting of visions, sermons, poetry, and doctrinal discourses as shared by either Nephi or Lehi to members of the family.\nStructure.\nFirst Nephi is a first-person narrative of events that the narrative itself reports were recorded on a set of objects referred to by Mormons as the Plates of Nephi by the prophet Nephi. The beginning part of First Nephi consists of Nephi's abridgement of his father Lehi's record (1 Nephi 1\u20139). The next section is Nephi's own narrative of events (1 Nephi 10\u201322). The Second Book of Nephi is a continuation.\nNarrative.\nFleeing Jerusalem.\nBeginning in Jerusalem at the time of King Zedekiah's reign, Nephi's father, Lehi, has a vision and is warned of the imminent Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. Lehi attempts to share this warning with the people of Jerusalem, but they dismiss his warning and try to kill him. Lehi and his family (wife Sariah, four sons Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi, and unnamed daughters) leave Jerusalem and establish a camp in the wilderness.\nKilling Laban and returning for Ishmael's family.\nLehi sends his sons back to Jerusalem to retrieve some brass plates, a record in the possession of Laban, a leader in Jerusalem and relative of Lehi. Nephi and his brothers make two failed attempts after which Nephi tries a third time by himself only to find Laban drunk and unconscious. Prompted by the Holy Spirit, Nephi kills Laban with his own sword and dresses in Laban's clothes. Impersonating Laban, Nephi commands Laban's servant, Zoram, to bring the brass plates outside the city to his brothers. Zoram discovers Nephi's subterfuge and tries to flee, but Nephi persuades him to travel with his family, and they all return with the plates. The brass plates indicate that Lehi is a descendant of Joseph, the son of Jacob. The plates also contain the five books of Moses, the writings of Isaiah and other prophets. Lehi's sons return to Jerusalem once more to retrieve the family of Ishmael, some of whom later become spouses for Lehi's children.\nVisions of Lehi and Nephi.\nLehi has a vision of the tree of life, which includes a revelation that a Messiah would visit the earth within 600 years. In the vision, Lehi sees a tree next to a river and eats its fruit, which makes him joyful. Wishing to share the fruit with his family, he sees his wife, Sariah, and two sons, Nephi and Sam, who come and eat with him. His two oldest sons, Laman and Lemuel, stay near the river and do not eat the fruit. Then Lehi sees an iron rod and a \"strait and narrow path\" which leads to the tree. People try to get to the tree, but are lost in the \"mist of darkness\". Some get to the tree by holding on to the rod, but they are ashamed when they eat the fruit. Across the river, a \"great and spacious building\" is full of people who are making fun of those who ate the fruit, and subsequently, the fruit-eaters become lost.\nNephi prays to the Lord for a similar vision and for help understanding his father's vision. Nephi then has a vision that matches the one his father had. He is told an explanation of its symbolism. Additionally, Nephi is shown past and future events, including the life of the Son of God and his appearances in both the New and the Old World. He also sees, according to a Pentecostal interpretation, \"the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, the troubles faced by latter-day Christianity, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and the final gathering of Israel\". After Nephi's vision, Laman and Lemuel argue over the meaning of Lehi's vision. Nephi chastises them for not asking the Lord for interpretation, and explains the point of disputation. He pleads with them to pray and repent.\nTraveling the desert and building the ship.\nAfter Lehi's sons marry Ishmael's daughters, Lehi discovers a \"ball of curious workmanship\" (a compass) at his tent door which they call a Liahona. Follow the Liahona's direction, they journey in the wilderness. As they travel, Nephi's steel bow breaks while hunting. Upon hearing the news, members of the camp complain and \"murmur against the Lord\" for their misfortune, including Lehi. Lehi repents and gives Nephi the Lord's direction for fertile hunting ground. Ishmael dies on their journey. His daughters, in mourning, respond by complaining. Laman and Lemuel conspire to kill Lehi and Nephi, but the voice of the Lord chastises them, and they repent.\nAfter eight years of wandering, they arrive at a coast and the voice of the Lord commands Nephi to build a ship. As he begins, Laman and Lemuel mock him for attempting an impossible task. Nephi recounts the Israelite's exodus and colonization of Canaan to Laman and Lemuel, and touches them with a divine shock as a sign of God's power. They complete the ship, and depart on the ocean. Laman and Lemuel continue to persecute Nephi. Many days later, they arrive in the promised land, where they settle.\nNephi's explanation of the plates.\nNephi writes about God's command that he chronicle the events of his people, their genealogy, and the gospel. In dialogue with his brothers, he quotes prophecies of Christ and quotes Isaiah 48\u201349. He interprets his quotations from Zenos (who is not found in the Bible) and the Biblical prophet Isaiah, saying that all the ancient prophets testified of the savior, and only through him can they be redeemed for their sins. He writes that God's covenants with Israel will eventually be restored, including to the descendants of his father Lehi.\nInterpretation and themes.\nExodus.\nMultiple scholars have noticed parallels between Nephi's journey in first Nephi and the Exodus story in the Bible. Nephi consciously encourages Laman and Lemuel to compare their situation to Moses's. He compares their situation to that of Moses after failing to get the plates from Laban in 1 Nephi 4:2\u20133. When a miracle provides them with food, Nephi writes that it was like when the Israelites were fed with manna (1 Nephi 17:28). He compares their being led by God to when the Israelites were led by a light at night (1 Nephi 17:13, 30). In one of the first examinations of the Exodus type in the Book of Mormon, George S. Tate, a professor of comparative literature at Brigham Young University, argues that Nephi uses parallels to Moses' Exodus as a rhetorical technique to encourage and unify his people. Nephi's use of the Exodus type sets up other Exodus patterns in the Book of Mormon, which is also a pattern of personal conversion. S. Kent Brown, a professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, states that Nephi uses the Exodus type to prove God's power, and by extension, his own prophetic power. Nephi writes that God gave power to Moses to part the Red Sea, so he could give Nephi a similar power to know \"the judgements that shall come\" (1 Nephi 8:12). Brant Gardner, an LDS scholar of Mesoamerican ethnohistory with previous publications in FARMS, wrote in his commentary on the Book of Mormon that Nephi likely wrote first Nephi to fit the pattern of Exodus in the Old Testament, as a way to create a foundational narrative for his people. In his book \"The Testimony of Two Nations\" published with the University of Illinois Press, Michael Austin examines 1 Nephi 17:33\u201335 passage. Nephi refutes the logic of the Deuteronomists and Laman and Lemuel, who believe that the Exodus story proves God loves His chosen people more than other people. Nephi says that the Exodus story proves that God \"esteemeth all flesh in one\" and favors those who keep his commandments.\nThe Great and Abominable Church.\nNephi sees the persecution of the apostles and their followers by the \"house of Israel\", then later sees a \"great church\" that is, according to the description of the angel, \"...most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron...\".\nThe LDS teaching of a Great Apostasy implies that the Catholic church is no longer true. Early LDS authority figures believed that the \"great and abominable church\" described the Catholic church. LDS general authority Bruce R. McConkie famously identified the \"great and abominable church\" as the Catholic church in his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" (1958). After its publication, church leaders at the time recognized McConkie\u2019s problematic claims and pushed for discontinuation of the book. When a second edition came out, many of McConkie\u2019s opinions of Catholicism were moderated. Official LDS publications discourage the identification of the great and abominable church with the Catholic Church, as well as with any other specific religion, denomination or organization. According to a 1988 article by Stephen E. Robinson in \"Ensign\", an official magazine of LDS Church, \"no single known historical church, denomination, or set of believers meets all the requirements for the great and abominable church... Rather, the role of Babylon has been played by many different agencies, ideologies, and churches in many different times.\"\nKilling Laban.\nMany scholars have commented on the theological implications of Nephi reporting that the Holy Ghost told him to slay Laban. Latter-day Saint critic Eugene England analyzed Laban as a scapegoat figure common in ancient times, but saw this as a flawed argument. For BYU religion professor Charles Swift, Nephi acted out of necessity; but acknowledges that there were many other ways God could have provided the brass plates to Nephi. Jeffrey R. Holland and Swift argue that Nephi had to slay Laban in order to obey God, and that is the most important thing.\nWomen.\nIn First Nephi, the only named woman in the narrative is Nephi's mother, Sariah. Ishmael's wife and daughters are not given names. The existence of Nephi's sisters is not mentioned until 2 Nephi. Nephi refers to Ishmael's daughters as Ishmael's daughters or the wives/women of him and his brothers, showing that their social relation to other men is what gives them importance for Nephi. Similarly, Sariah is always referred to as a mother or wife, not as an individual. The two scenes of female resistance\u00a0\u2013 Sariah worrying that her sons have not returned because they have died and Ishmael's daughters wishing to return to Jerusalem after their father's death\u00a0\u2013 create a type scene with instructive differences between the two. For Spencer, the latter story illustrates how treatment of women has changed after the \"Nephite-Lamanite\" divide. In Sariah's story, she reconciles with Lehi after she sees that the Lord protected her sons. In contrast, no one attempts to comfort the daughters of Ishmael and instead, Laman and Lemuel conspire with the sons of Ishmael to kill Lehi and Nephi, silencing the women and using their discontent for their own designs.\nSignificant textual variants.\nThe original translation of the book's title did not include the word \"first\". First and Second were added to the titles of the Books of Nephi by Oliver Cowdery when preparing the book for printing.\nOriginally, Joseph Smith indicated seven chapter breaks in First Nephi:\nEditions of the Book of Mormon from the Community of Christ still use the original chapter organization. In 1879, Orson Pratt reformatted the LDS edition to include twenty-two thematically-arranged chapters.\nTextual variations in 1 Nephi concern the nature of God. In the first edition of the Book of Mormon, 1 Nephi 11:21 reads \"behold the Lamb of God yea even the Eternal Father\". Joseph Smith inserted \"the Son of\" in this verse and three others in 1 Nephi. According to Skousen, this was simply to clarify that these verses referred to the Son of God, since other references to Christ as the Father are left as is. Joseph Spencer, examining the same passage, writes that the reason for clarifying these passages is unclear, but notes that 1 Nephi 12:18 clearly delineates the three separate members of the Godhead. In that verse, God the Father is referred to as \"the Eternal Father.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36461", "revid": "40427189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36461", "title": "Second Nephi", "text": "Second book of the Book of Mormon\nThe Second Book of Nephi (), usually referred to as Second Nephi or 2 Nephi, is the second book of the Book of Mormon, the primary religious text of the Latter-day Saint Movement. Narrated by Nephi, son of Lehi, unlike the first Book of Nephi, 2 Nephi contains little history of the Nephite people and focuses predominately on visions and prophecies of Nephi himself and other prophets, particularly Isaiah.\nThe book begins with Lehi's blessings and final teachings to his family before his death. Lehi explores themes of cosmological dualism (\"opposition\"), the Fall of man, resurrection, and atonement. After Lehi's death the family splits into two factions: the Nephites, led by Nephi, and the Lamanites led by Nephi's older brother Laman. The Nephites are forced to flee their original settlement and the Lamanites are cursed by God with a \"skin of blackness\". The Nephites build a temple and follow the Law of Moses. Nephi and his younger brother Jacob preach, extensively quoting and analyzing the Book of Isaiah, often word-for-word from the King James Version of the Bible.\nStructure.\nSecond Nephi was originally called the Book of Nephi and was divided into 33 chapters. Later, Oliver Cowdery added First and Second to the titles of the books of Nephi. In the first five chapters, which comprise the narrative section of the book, Nephi continues with the family meeting begun in the end of First Nephi. Much of the rest of Second Nephi includes quotations from Isaiah and further teachings from Nephi and his brother Jacob. Joseph Spencer explains that the simple structure of 2 Nephi is as follows: the division of Lehi\u2019s descendants (chapters 1\u20135), teachings concerning reconciliation with God (chapters 6\u201330), and discussion on baptism (chapters 31\u201333).\nNarration.\nLehi's last counsel.\nSecond Nephi begins with a reminder that Lehi had warned of Jerusalem's destruction and that his\u00a0family had been purposefully led to safety. In the narrative, Lehi receives a vision confirming that Jerusalem has been destroyed; his family also learns the \"promised land\" they were led to is their inheritance as long as they follow God.\nLehi advises each of his sons to follow Nephi\u2019s leadership, particularly Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael. He then blesses Zoram, as a friend of Nephi, saying that his descendants will flourish if they are righteous. Lehi then blesses Jacob, promising that his suffering will be consecrated; he also speaks to him about the Atonement with a focus on opposition and how both good and bad things are important in life. He teaches all of his sons that the Fall of Man was necessary for humans to progress past their original innocent state and have children, emphasizing that all have their own right to choose for themselves. After blessing Jacob, Lehi speaks to Joseph. In his blessing, he says that Joseph's descendants will not be completely destroyed. Further, he cites a prophecy from Joseph of Egypt, which is contained in the brass plates and predicts that God will prepare a seer named Joseph. This seer, Lehi explains, has ancestral connections to both Joseph of Egypt and Joseph, son of Lehi, and will bring the knowledge of the covenant back to Lehi\u2019s descendants. Lehi also reveals that Joseph of Egypt prophesied of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt. Lehi proceeds to bless Laman and Lemuel\u2019s children so that their people will never become extinct. Afterward, he blesses Ishmael\u2019s sons, Sam, and Sam\u2019s family. Nephi does not describe any specific personal blessings he might have received at this time.\nDivision of the people.\nLehi dies sometime after giving these blessings to his family and Nephi follows the account with his own words. In his psalm, Nephi records his struggles with sin and remembers some of the times God has saved him. Later, Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael\u2019s descendants are upset about Nephi being chosen as their leader and try to kill him. He prays about Laman and Lemuel\u2019s murmuring and dissent and is told by God to take his family into the wilderness. In response, he takes the brass plates, the Liahona, and Laban\u2019s sword, and leaves with Zoram, Sam, Jacob, Joseph, and his sisters. This group becomes the Nephites. They work and are obedient to the commandments and build a temple modeled after Solomon\u2019s. Nephi chooses not to be king but continues to help his people. He makes swords based on the sword of Laban for protection in case the Lamanites attack. The Lamanites are cut off from God, cursed, and given a \"skin of blackness\" to make them \"loathsome\" to the Nephites unless they repent. Nephi consecrates Jacob and Joseph as priests and teachers, and the Nephites \"live after the manner of happiness.\"\nJacob's sermon.\nIn chapters 6\u201310, Jacob gives a two-day sermon that includes many words from Isaiah 49:22\u201352:2 in which he invites the people to compare Isaiah\u2019s teachings to their own experiences. He preaches about \"the Holy One of Israel\", God\u2019s plan, the consequences of sin, resurrection, judgment, deliverance from hell, and the righteous' inheritance of God\u2019s kingdom. In his sermon, Jacob warns the prideful wealthy, those who think their intellect sets them above God\u2019s teachings, and various others who ignore God; he states that in these conditions they cannot be saved. He then speaks of the Jews, Gentiles, and descendants of Lehi in the last days before Christ\u2019s coming and explains that the Gentiles will be counted as part of the house of Israel. He also teaches that after Israel is scattered, descendants of the house of Israel who repent and believe will be subsequently restored to their lands. The land Lehi\u2019s family has come to is a land of inheritance and is promised as a land of liberty. Jacob ends with the instruction to turn to God and choose eternal life.\nNephi quotes Isaiah, prophesies, and gives final counsel.\nNephi too writes of likening the words of Isaiah to the Nephites and says that the purpose of the Mosaic covenant is to show that Christ will come. Nephi claims that his entire life and the purpose of his writings is to witness of Christ and be an example so people can receive the blessings of the covenant. Many of the next Isaiah quotations, found in chapters 12\u201324, focus on judgment, restoration, and the Messiah.\nIn chapters 25\u201333, Nephi himself prophesies, still including words from Isaiah. He continues with a focus on the Messiah and then turns to false churches of the future and people fighting against Zion, as well as the emergence of the Book of Mormon. He predicts that churches in the \"last days\" will be prideful and spread false teachings and warns churches against priestcraft, telling them not to keep the free blessings of the gospel away from anyone. Nephi explains that the \"great and abominable\" church will fall and as such records many warnings against sin and its consequences. Nephi also predicts that the Jews, Nephites, and the lost Israelites will eventually receive and have access to each others\u2019 writings. He prophesies of the return of the Gospel to Lehi\u2019s descendants and speaks again on restoration. He says that to be saved, one must repent, be baptized in the name of Christ, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. He explains again the importance of the words of Christ and ends by inviting the reader to pray in order to believe in Christ and know that his words are true.\nInterpretation.\nBreak between First and Second Nephi.\nDifferent theories have emerged as to why Nephi's two books seem to break in the middle of a family event. Frederick Axelgard, Latter-day Saint and Senior Fellow at the Wheatley Institute, suggests the account would be better divided at 2 Nephi 5, which generally marks the end of Nephi's historical narrative. Political science professor and apologist Noel B. Reynolds writes that the first five chapters of Second Nephi seem to be establishing Nephi's authority and leadership qualifications.\nAlternatively, literary scholar Terryl Givens proposes the interruption of the timeline was purposeful to emphasize an important theme of covenants in the Book of Mormon. Lehi's vision confirms Jerusalem and its temple have been destroyed, says Givens, and triggers subsequent explanations to show the family they are still a covenant people to God and that the Israelites will not be lost forever. These are ideas that Givens connects to Moroni's introductory thematic statement on the purpose of the Book of Mormon. He also suggests that Lehi's blessings to his children and many of the Isaiah quotations are aimed at this same purpose and show the family they are part of the covenant as long as they do not reject the Messiah.\nDark skin of the Lamanites a curse.\n2 Nephi 5:21 describes the Lamanites as being cursed and marked with a \"skin of blackness\" because of their unbelief in order to make them less attractive to the Nephites. In 2 Nephi 30:6, the Lamanites are promised to become \"pure and delightsome\" (a passage that was \"white and delightsome\" before 1981). In a book about Mormon conceptions of race, sociologist Armand Mauss writes that modern secular readers see these passages as referring to race, and interpret them as reflecting the 19th-century racism of the day. Mauss argues that \"white\" was \"almost always\" a synonym for pure and clean in the Book of Mormon's original text, but acknowledges that these verses informed the prevailing image of Lamanites as savage Indians who ought to be assimilated among mid-19th-century Latter-day Saints. Mauss calls for a nonracist interpretation of the verses in 2 Nephi. Since the Nephites and Lamanites are both descended from Lehi, he argues, their main differences are cultural, not racial. 2 Nephi 26:33 states that \"all are alike unto God\", specifically referring to \"black and white, bond and free\". Mauss interprets it as a \"repudiation of racism in divine affairs\". In another book on race and the early LDS Church, Max Mueller writes that this purported universalist idea is \"rooted in the limitations of whiteness as a universal racial category, a reality of which the Book of Mormon itself seems to be aware.\" In his \"Annotated Book of Mormon\", Grant Hardy writes that modern readers are justifiably distressed by the Lamanites being marked with a dark skin. Hardy writes that skin color does not prevent the Lamanites from exceeding Nephites in righteousness, and the curse comes with a promise that their lineage will be preserved, while the Nephites eventually die out.\nAtonement in 2 Nephi.\nLehi's discussion with Jacob in 2 Nephi 2 is doctrinally rich and frequently used in theological discussion of the atonement in Latter-day Saint thought. 2 Nephi 2 contains the first mention of \"atone\" in the Book of Mormon. Writing for \"Dialogue\", Jacob Morgan cites two scriptures from 2 Nephi 2 to support his unorthodox argument that the atonement gave mankind the light of Christ, or a conscience, which prevents humans from choosing \"eternal death\" (verse 29). Having a conscience makes humans free to \"act for themselves\" (verse 26) and gives them agency. In his chapter on the atonement in the Book of Mormon, Nicholas J. Frederick, an associate professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University argues that ideas from multiple atonement theories are present in the Book of Mormon and gives two examples from 2 Nephi. He writes that 2 Nephi 2:6\u201310 can support the governmental theory of atonement, where Christ's atonement satisfied the demands of justice. This passage does not mention Christ's suffering in Gethsemane (wherein many Latter-day Saints believe the payment for sins occurred) but only his death and resurrection. Later, Jacob's sermon in 2 Nephi 9:7\u201312 seems to support a Christus Victor theory, where Christ's death was a ransom paid to Satan. Jacob describes how Christ's atonement was infinite in 2 Nephi 9:25\u201326, and allows God to show mercy. Frederick gives a caveat that these interpretations may require imposing too much of previous theories on the text.\nThe Fall in 2 Nephi.\nIn 2 Nephi 2, Lehi's articulation of the fall of man reinterprets it as a necessary component of God's plans for human salvation. 2 Nephi 2:18 identifies \"the serpent\" as the devil.\nAccording to literary critic Michael Austin, 2 Nephi describes prelapsarian reproduction as impossible, making the fall a prerequisite for procreation. According to biblical scholar Julie Smith, 2 Nephi 2 can alternatively be interpreted as meaning reproduction was impossible only during the time when Eve had eaten the fruit but Adam had not.\nThe discussion in 2 Nephi 2, specifically verse 25, which states that \"Adam fell that men might be\", is frequently used in LDS interpretation of the fall to see it as part of God's plan. Some LDS thinkers take the idea further and say that Eve's decision was \"wise\", a stance that Smith calls the \"Wise Choice Theory\". According to Smith, the \"classic statement of the Wise Choice Theory\" among Latter-day Saints is from a 1993 General Conference talk by apostle Dallin H. Oaks who stated that \"we celebrate Eve's act and honor her wisdom and courage in the great episode called the Fall\", and cited Brigham Young and Joseph Fielding Smith to aver that was formally a transgression of law but did not constitute sin. Most official Latter-day Saint discourse interprets Eve's role in the fall \"overwhelmingly positive[ly]\", religious studies scholar Susannia Morrill explains.\nSmith argues that God's curse in response to Adam and Eve's partaking of the fruit makes it difficult to argue that their decision was wise, and that the argument that they were following a higher law requires them to take advice from the serpent. She questions the interpretation of considering Eve eating the fruit a transgression but not a sin. Smith argues this distinction does not exist in the Book of Mormon, and she sees no evidence that a transgression would be wise. She concludes that the \"Wise Choice Theory\" is not supported by the Book of Mormon.\nEarly Latter-day Saint leaders Orson Pratt, George Q. Cannon, and Brigham Young regarded Adam wisely chose to eat the fruit wise but thought Eve was not, and Smith argues that \"in the earliest layers of LDS interpretation, Eve\u2019s choice was not seen as wise\". Morrill, agreeing that the Book of Mormon text itself does not heroize Eve, reports that most Latter-day Saint women's literature in the nineteenth century considered Eve \"a wise and knowing woman\" who acted as a \"savior figure\" by \"safely guid[ing] the course of human salvation on the right path\".\nJacob's sermon.\nEgyptologist and CES instructor John S. Thompson analyzed Jacob\u2019s sermon and identified themes of judgment, clothing, remembrance, creation, fasting, sacrifice, usage of God\u2019s name, repentance, and the Law of Moses. On another note, author Marilyn Arnold suggests that, based on the deliberate structure and language of his sermon, Jacob adopts his style from writings in the brass plates. Additionally, Jacob repeats words such as \"body\", \"flesh\", \"die\", and \"death\" but applies them to his teachings in a way that shifts their connotations.\nNephi's poetry.\nIndependent scholar Matthew Nickerson identifies shared traits between what has been called \"the Psalm of Nephi\" and psalms of the Old Testament. Nephi\u2019s words are specifically connected to the individual lament, each of which contains an invocation, complaint, confession of trust, petition, and vow of praise. Nickerson proposes that each of these elements can be identified, making Nephi\u2019s psalm a true psalm. According to Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Hemming, Nephi's psalm is associated with grief over his father\u2019s death and tensions within the family.\nRichard Rust explains that Nephi incorporates certain literary aspects such as rhythms and structures similar to those found in poetry. One example is when Nephi repeats words and phrases in a way that contributes to the poetic sounds of his writings. Some of the things he repeats include \"the Lord\", \"commanded\", and \"that I may walk...that I may be strict.\" Such repetition is emphatic, says Rust. Because of Nephi's repetition and use of Hebrew structure\u2014which presents and then satisfies an idea\u2014his poetry is similar to Isaiah\u2019s. Bible and Jewish Studies professor David Bokovoy claims another connection to biblical poetry in Nephi's tendency to switch from third to first person. Bokovoy notes other examples in the Bible of the writer switching in the same passage from speaking about God at a distance to speaking to God in proximity. Additionally, Salleh and Hemming suggest that, based on the tone of the psalm, Nephi doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to mourn over his parents' deaths before he has to flee from his brothers.\nEarly LDS interpretation.\nSecond Nephi 28 mentions that priests of different churches will \"contend\" with each other and teach without the Holy Ghost. Early members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints saw many competing religions and began to interpret Joseph Smith's visit to the Sacred Grove to ask God which church was right as fulfillment of this prophecy. Second Nephi 29 goes on to describe a new book of scripture that would be revealed but rejected by many people because they already had the Bible. According to early church leader Heber C. Kimball, the response of many ministers was often \"we need no more revelation\", which he declared as fulfillment of the chapter 29 prophecy.\nJoseph of Egypt's prophecy quoted in Second Nephi 3 was also interpreted by early church members, who believed Joseph Smith to be \"the choice seer\" with the same name as his father.\nThe Isaiah chapters.\nIntertextuality.\nNephi quotes extensively from the Book of Isaiah throughout 1 and 2 Nephi, with passages largely appearing as they do in the Bible. Elizabeth Fenton describes these passages as \"not-quite-exact copying\", with differences being minor. J.N. Washburn, an independent scholar, cites that 199 of 433 verses from Isaiah appear with the same wording and proposes that Joseph Smith used the King James Bible version whenever it was close enough to the original meaning of the plates he was said to be translating and used the new translation when meaning differed. According to author H. Clay Gorton, 2 Nephi 21 is the only Isaiah-quoted chapter in the Book of Mormon that, when compared to the KJV, sustains no textual differences. In a similar vein, 2 Nephi 22 and Isaiah 12 are different only by one word. Gorton has concluded that, where Isaiah verses differ in the Book of Mormon, approximately 38% of those changes are extensive.\nPhilosopher Joseph Spencer calls Isaiah \"the honored keynote speaker of the small plates\". Spencer also emphasizes that even beyond quotations, Jacob and Nephi's teachings both seem to be built on further ideas of Isaiah's. A scholar involved in early studies of the Book of Mormon, Sidney Sperry, suggests that by including Isaiah's writings, Nephi points out the mission of Jesus Christ, the restoration of the house of Israel, and God\u2019s judgments that follow. Additionally, Nephi says he \"delights\" in Isaiah but explains that a knowledge of Jewish tradition is needed to understand his writings, according to literary critic Michael Austin. Nephi admits he has chosen not to teach his people certain knowledge and traditions with which he is familiar as a former resident of Jerusalem.\nDeutero-Isaiah.\nIn more modern times, scholars have theorized based on variation in style and structure that more than one author wrote the book of Isaiah. These authors are referred to as Isaiah, Deutero-Isaiah, and Trito-Isaiah. Deutero-Isaiah is thought to be born after the time Lehi\u2019s family would have left Jerusalem. Many of those writings which are considered to be part of Deutero-Isaiah are cited in Second Nephi as quotations from Isaiah. This implies that the Book of Mormon narrative disagrees that this section of Isaiah was written by someone other than its namesake. An LDS doctrine course teacher's supplement cites the Book of Mormon as evidence that Isaiah wrote the whole book of Isaiah since pieces from throughout the book are said to be from the already compiled brass plates which Lehi's sons took from Jerusalem around 600\u00a0BC.\nChiasmus.\nJoseph Spencer suggests that Isaiah appears as a sort of chiasmus in Nephi\u2019s record, sandwiched between Jacob\u2019s and Nephi\u2019s explanations of his writings. In their explanations both men discuss reconciliation with God, contributing to its chiastic appearance. Additionally, Isaiah\u2019s teachings as they appear in Second Nephi form a chiasmus: chapters 12\u201315 discuss destruction relating to the covenant people; chapter 16 contains a call to repentance, and chapters 17\u201322 follow themes of God\u2019s covenant people returning to him.\nTypology.\nBiblical typology is a practice of interpretation that suggests Old Testament events are types or representations of future fulfillment of prophecy. Isaiah's writing was described in scripture as things that \"have been and will be\", which aligns with typology's idea that written prophecies apply both to events in the writer's own day which create a type for the future, and to the latter days. Many of the prophecies quoted from Isaiah in Second Nephi regard Babylonian captivity, which Nephi believes to have already begun. Despite this understanding, Nephi also claims the prophecies will be useful in future times. According to Isaiah analyst and Latter-day Saint Avraham Gileadi, this can be viewed either as a contradiction in the text or with the lens of Nephi viewing Isaiah typologically.\nIsaiah and the Charles Anthon visit.\nSecond Nephi 27 quotes a prophecy from Isaiah 29 in which the disregarded messages from prophets are compared to a sealed book. The book is delivered to \"one who is learned\", who says, \"I cannot [read it] for it is sealed.\" In the Pearl of Great Price, another Latter-day Saint book of scripture, Martin Harris's visit to professor Charles Anthon with copied characters from the Book of Mormon is recorded. While records of the event vary between Anthon and Harris, Anthon's response as reported by Harris was \"I cannot read a sealed book.\" Many Latter-day Saints see this visit as fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy.\nCultural Reception.\nNephi's psalm has appeared in numerous works by LDS creators. One such example is \"Mazmuur Naafi: The Arabic Psalm of Nephi\" by Ahmed Jamal Qureshi. In this work of visual art, the psalm is translated into Arabic and shaped into a circle. The color of the piece, author Josh E. Probert explains, points to blue tiles found inside mosques. Around the circle with the psalm are four smaller circles. Inside the circles are the names Lehi, Nephi, Moroni, and Joseph as figures related to the Book of Mormon's content. Nephi's psalm has also been set to music, including \"I Love the Lord\" and \"Sometimes My Soul\" by John Tanner, as well as \"I Glory in My Jesus\" written by Millennial Choirs and Orchestras founders Brandon and Brett Stewart.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This book was originally called \"III Nephi\" in the 1879 edition, and \"Third Nephi\" in the 1920 edition of the Book of Mormon. It contains an account of the visit of Jesus Christ to the inhabitants of ancient America. Jesus had told his disciples in Jerusalem according to the Bible in the Gospel of John, \"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\" In this book, Christ declares to those in ancient America that they were these \"other sheep\" of whom he spoke. The account of this visit is recorded beginning in chapter 11 of 3 Nephi.\nNarrative of Christ's Visit.\nBefore Christ visits these people there is a giant storm, a tremendous earthquake, and darkness. Cities burn, cities sink into the sea, mountains are brought down and valleys brought up. There is sharp lightning, wind, and thunderings and many people die. After the great storm comes darkness and the voices of mourning for the dead. The darkness lasts for approximately three days, during which a voice is \"heard among all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying: Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except that they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquities and abominations that they are fallen!\" (3 Nephi 9:1-2) The voice then lists cities \"and the inhabitants thereof\" he had destroyed because of their wickedness: Zarahemla (3 Nephi 9:3), Moroni (9:4), Moronihah (9:5), Gilgal (9:6), Onihah, Mocum, and Jerusalem (the New World city founded by the Lamanites, Amelekites, and Amulonites, not Jerusalem in Judaea) (9:7), Gadiandi, Gadiomnah, Jacob, and Gimgimno (9:8), Jacobugath (9:9), Laman, Josh, Gad, and Kishkumen (9:10), since \"there were none righteous among them\" (9:11). He asks, \"O all ye that are spared because you were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?\" (9:13) \"Yea, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall come unto me, ye shall have eternal life. Behold, my arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive, and blessed are those that come unto me.\" (9:14) \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.\" (9:15)\nAfter three days, the darkness clears. Jesus Christ is resurrected and the people gather to the land of Bountiful where stood a temple. A voice is heard from heaven which the people did not understand it at first, that \"did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.\" The people do not understand the voice a second time but it understand it a third time. The voice is the voice of God Almighty, the very Eternal Father proclaiming His Son Jesus Christ the risen Lord.\nThe resurrected Christ descends from the sky. He stands before them and calls them to come and sees the wounds in His hands and side. He heals them and teaches them precepts that were to guide their Church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This book was originally called \"IV Nephi\" in the 1879 edition, and \"Fourth Nephi\" in the 1920 edition of Book of Mormon.\nFourth Nephi is among the shorter books in the Book of Mormon, containing only a single chapter, but it covers almost three centuries of the history of the Nephites and the Lamanites (\"ca\" AD 35 to 321).\nThe book describes the period of time immediately following the visit of Jesus Christ to the Book of Mormon peoples, in which time the Nephites and the Lamanites are all converted to the Church of Christ. The Nephites stopped obeying the law of Moses and obeyed the commandments of Jesus instead. After the year AD 100, all the original disciples of Jesus had died, except for three which he allowed to live on and on until the end of human history. But new disciples were ordained to replace the ones that died. According to the record, \"surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God\" (4 Ne. 1:16). During this time the distinction between the Lamanites and Nephites disappears: \"neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God\" (4 Ne. 1:17).\nThe Nephi who recorded the coming of Jesus to America died, and the keeping of the plates passed to his son Amos. After that, the people started to get rich, and wear expensive clothing and jewelry, and divide themselves into rich and poor, and the communal sharing of private property came to an end. Then they formed churches which were really businesses for the purpose of gaining profits.\nOne of these churches began to persecute members of the True Church of Christ, casting them into prison (but the prison then broke in two), or casting them into fiery furnaces (but the victims walked out unscathed), or casting them into a lion's den (but the victims played with the animals as if they were lambs). \"And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again.\"\nThe people once again divided into Nephites and Lamanites, and although the Nephites remain righteous longer than the Lamanites, by AD 300, \"both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one like unto another\" (4 Ne. 1:45).\nThe book concludes with Ammaron hiding the sacred records, which he ultimately delivered to Mormon, with the next book detailing the decline of the Nephite civilization and their wars with the Lamanites.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In antiquity, the state was known as Lacedaemon (), while \"Sparta\" referred to its capital, a group of villages in the valley of the Evrotas River in Laconia, in southeastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become one of the major military powers in Greece, a status it retained until 371 BC.\nSparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens. Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC), from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami. Thebes' victory over Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371\u00a0BC ended Spartan hegemony and freed Messenia from Spartan rule; the loss of the slave labor this region provided sent the city into terminal decline as a military power, though it retained its independence until its forcible integration into the Achaean League in 192 BC. The city recovered some autonomy after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC and became a tourist destination during the Roman era, restoring some measure of prosperity. However, Sparta was sacked in 396\u00a0AD by the Visigothic king Alaric, and underwent a long period of decline into the medieval period, when much of its population relocated to Mystras. Modern Sparta is a provincial town and the seat of the Laconia regional administration.\nSparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, which were supposedly introduced by the semi-mythical lawgiver Lycurgus. Spartan society was exceptionally militarized, focusing the entire attention of the Spartiate class on military training and physical development to the point of legally barring them from productive economic activity. The inhabitants of Sparta were rigidly stratified into Spartiates (citizens with full rights), mothakes and perioikoi (free non-citizens), and helots (state-owned enslaved non-Spartan locals), with helots making up the vast majority of the population; social mobility was nearly nonexistent. Spartiate men underwent the harsh \"agoge\" training regimen, and Spartan phalanx units were widely considered to be among the best in battle, though this was as much a matter of propaganda as battlefield prowess. Free Spartiate women enjoyed somewhat greater legal rights than elsewhere in classical antiquity, though helots suffered exceptionally harsh treatment at the hands of the Spartiates (particularly the Crypteia), causing repeated revolts. Sparta was a subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in later Western culture following the revival of classical learning. The admiration of Sparta is known as Laconophilia.\nNames.\nThe ancient Greeks used one of three words to refer to the Spartan city-state and its location. First, \"Sparta\" refers primarily to the main cluster of settlements in the valley of the Eurotas River. The second word, \"Lacedaemon\" (), was often used as an adjective and is the name referenced in the works of Homer and the historians Herodotus and Thucydides. The third term, \"Laconice\" (), referred to the immediate area around the town of Sparta, the plateau east of the Taygetos mountains, and sometimes to all the regions under direct Spartan control, including Messenia.The earliest attested term referring to Lacedaemon is the Mycenaean Greek , \"ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo\", \"Lakedaimonian\", written in Linear B syllabic script, the equivalent of the later Greek , \"Lakedaimonios\" (Latin: \"Lacedaemonius\").\nHerodotus seems to use \"Lacedaemon\" for the Mycenaean Greek citadel at Therapne, in contrast to the lower town of Sparta. This term could be used synonymously with Sparta, but typically it denoted the region in which the city was located. In Homer it is typically combined with epithets of the countryside: wide, lovely, shining and most often hollow and broken (full of ravines), suggesting the Eurotas Valley. \"Sparta\" on the other hand is described as \"the country of lovely women\", an epithet for people.\nThe residents of Sparta were often called Lacedaemonians. This epithet utilized the plural of the adjective Lacedaemonius (Greek: ; Latin: \"Lacedaemonii\", but also \"Lacedaemones\"). The ancients sometimes used a back-formation, referring to the land of Lacedaemon as \"Lacedaemonian country\". As most words for \"country\" were feminine, the adjective was in the feminine: \"Lacedaemonia\" (, \"Lakedaimonia\"). Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.\n\"Lacedaemonia\" was not in general use during the classical period and before. It does occur in Greek as an equivalent of Laconia and Messenia during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, mostly in ethnographers and lexica of place names. For example, Hesychius of Alexandria's \"Lexicon\" (5th century AD) defines Agiadae as a \"place in Lacedaemonia\" named after Agis. The actual transition may be captured by Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologiae\" (7th century AD), an etymological dictionary. Isidore relied heavily on Orosius' \"Historiarum Adversum Paganos\" (5th century AD) and Eusebius of Caesarea's \"Chronicon\" (early 5th century AD), as did Orosius. The latter defines Sparta to be \"Lacedaemonia Civitas\", but Isidore defines Lacedaemonia as founded by Lacedaemon, son of Semele, which is consistent with Eusebius' explanation. There is a rare use, perhaps the earliest of \"Lacedaemonia\", in Diodorus Siculus' \"The Library of History\", but probably with (\"ch\u014dra\", \"country\") suppressed.\nLakedaimona was until 2006 the name of a province in the modern Greek prefecture of Laconia.\nGeography.\nSparta is located in the region of Laconia, in the south-eastern Peloponnese. Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the Eurotas, the largest river of Laconia, which provided it with a source of fresh water. The Eurotas valley was a natural fortress, bounded to the west by Mt. Taygetus (2,407 m) and to the east by Mt. Parnon (1,935 m). To the north, Laconia is separated from Arcadia by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude. These natural defenses worked to Sparta's advantage and protected it from sacking and invasion. Though landlocked, Sparta had a vassal harbor, Gytheio, on the Laconian Gulf.\nMythology.\nLacedaemon (Greek: ) was a mythical king of Laconia. The son of Zeus by the nymph Taygete, he married Sparta, the daughter of Eurotas, by whom he became the father of Amyclas, Eurydice, and Asine. As king, he named his country after himself and the city after his wife. He was believed to have built the sanctuary of the Charites, which stood between Sparta and Amyclae, and to have given to those divinities the names of Cleta and Phaenna. A shrine was erected to him in the neighborhood of Therapne.\nTyrtaeus, an archaic era Spartan writer, is the earliest source to connect the origin myth of the Spartans to the lineage of the hero Heracles; later authors, such as Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, and Apollodorus, also made mention of Spartans understanding themselves to be descendants of Heracles.\nArchaeology of the classical period.\nThucydides wrote:\nSuppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame. Their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages, like the ancient towns of Hellas, and would therefore make a poor show.\nUntil the early 20th century, the chief ancient buildings at Sparta were the theatre, of which, however, little showed above ground except portions of the retaining walls; the so-called Tomb of Leonidas, a quadrangular building, perhaps a temple, constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers; the foundation of an ancient bridge over the Eurotas; the ruins of a circular structure; some remains of late Roman fortifications; several brick buildings and mosaic pavements.\nThe remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions, sculptures, and other objects collected in the local museum, founded by Stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907. Partial excavation of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the American School at Athens. The structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of Hellenic origin that was partly restored during the Roman period.\nIn 1904, the British School at Athens began a thorough exploration of Laconia, and in the following year excavations were made at Thalamae, Geronthrae, and Angelona near Monemvasia. In 1906, excavations began in Sparta itself.\nA \"small circus\" (as described by Leake) proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after 200\u00a0AD around the altar and in front of the Temple of Artemis Orthia. It is believed that musical and gymnastic contests took place here, as well as the famous flogging ordeal administered to Spartan boys (\"diamastigosis\"). The temple, which can be dated to the 2nd century BC, rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century, and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple, dating from the 9th or even the 10th century. The votive offerings in clay, amber, bronze, ivory and lead dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC, which were found in great profusion within the precinct range, supply invaluable information about early Spartan art.\nIn 1907, the location of the sanctuary of Athena \"of the Brazen House\" (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, Chalkioikos) was determined to be on the acropolis immediately above the theatre. Though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed, the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription in Laconia, numerous bronze nails and plates, and a considerable number of votive offerings. The city wall, built in successive stages from the 4th to the 2nd century, was traced for a great part of its circuit, which measured 48 stades or nearly (Polyb. 1X. 21). The late Roman wall enclosing the acropolis, part of which probably dates from the years following the Gothic raid of 262\u00a0AD, was also investigated. Besides the actual buildings discovered, a number of points were situated and mapped in a general study of Spartan topography, based upon the description of Pausanias.\nIn terms of domestic archaeology, little is known about Spartan houses and villages before the Archaic period, but the best evidence comes from excavations at Nichoria in Messenia where postholes have been found. These villages were open and consisted of small and simple houses built with stone foundations and clay walls.\nMenelaion.\nThe Menelaion is a shrine associated with Menelaus, located east of Sparta, by the river Eurotas, on the hill Profitis Ilias (Coordinates: ). Built around the early 8th century BC, the Spartans believed it had been the former residence of Menelaus. In 1970, the British School in Athens started excavations around the Menelaion in an attempt to locate Mycenaean remains in the area. Among other findings, they uncovered the remains of two Mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to Helen and Menelaus. These mansions were destroyed by earthquake and fire.\nExcavations made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around the Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia. The Mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north. Its area was approximately equal to that of the \"newer\" Sparta, but denudation has wreaked havoc with its buildings and nothing is left of its original structures save for ruined foundations and broken potsherds.\nHistory.\nPrehistory, \"dark age\" and archaic period.\nThe prehistory of Sparta is difficult to reconstruct because the literary evidence was written far later than the events it describes and is distorted by oral tradition. The earliest certain evidence of human settlement in the region of Sparta consists of pottery dating from the Middle Neolithic period, found in the vicinity of Kouphovouno some two kilometres () south-southwest of Sparta.\nThis civilization seems to have fallen into decline by the late Bronze Age, when, according to Herodotus, Macedonian tribes from the north (called Dorians by those they conquered) marched into the Peloponnese and, subjugating the local tribes, settled there. The Dorians seem to have set about expanding the frontiers of Spartan territory almost before they had established their own state. They fought against the Argive Dorians to the east and southeast, and also the Arcadian Achaeans to the northwest. The evidence suggests that Sparta, relatively inaccessible because of the topography of the Taygetan plain, was secure from early on: it was never fortified.\nNothing distinctive in the archaeology of the Eurotas River Valley identifies the Dorians or the Dorian Spartan state. The prehistory of the Neolithic, the Bronze Age and the Dark Age (the Early Iron Age) at this moment must be treated apart from the stream of Dorian Spartan history.\nThe legendary period of Spartan history is believed to fall into the Dark Age. It treats the mythic heroes such as the Heraclids and the Perseids, offering a view of the occupation of the Peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements. The subsequent proto-historic period, combining both legend and historical fragments, offers the first credible history.\nBetween the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Spartans experienced a period of lawlessness and civil strife, later attested by both Herodotus and Thucydides. As a result, they carried out a series of political and social reforms of their own society which they later attributed to a semi-mythical lawgiver, Lycurgus. Several writers throughout antiquity, including Herodotus, Xenophon, and Plutarch have attempted to explain Spartan exceptionalism as a result of the so-called Lycurgan Reforms.\nClassical Sparta.\nIn the Second Messenian War, Sparta established itself as a local power in the Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece. During the following centuries, Sparta's reputation as a land-fighting force was unequalled. At its peak around 500 BC, Sparta had some 20,000\u201335,000 citizens, plus numerous helots and perioikoi. The likely total of 40,000\u201350,000 made Sparta one of the larger Greek city-states; however, according to Thucydides, the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000\u2013610,000, making it much larger.\nIn 480 BC, a small force led by King Leonidas (about 300 full Spartiates, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, although these numbers were lessened by earlier casualties) made a legendary last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae against the massive Persian army, led by Xerxes. The Spartans received advance warning of the Persian invasion from their deposed king Demaratus, which prompted them to consult the Delphic oracle. According to Herodotus, the Pythia proclaimed that either one of the kings of Sparta had to die or Sparta would be destroyed. This prophecy was fulfilled after king Leonidas died in the battle. The superior weaponry, strategy, and bronze armour of the Greek hoplites and their phalanx fighting formation again proved their worth one year later when Sparta assembled its full strength and led a Greek alliance against the Persians at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC.\nThe decisive Greek victory at Plataea put an end to the Greco-Persian War along with Persian ambitions to expand into Europe. Even though this war was won by a pan-Greek army, credit was given to Sparta, who besides providing the leading forces at Thermopylae and Plataea, had been the de facto leader of the entire Greek expedition.\nIn 464 BC, a violent earthquake occurred along the Sparta faultline destroying much of what was Sparta and many other city-states in ancient Greece. This earthquake is marked by scholars as one of the key events that led to the First Peloponnesian War.\nIn later Classical times, Sparta along with Athens, Thebes, and Persia were the main powers fighting for supremacy in the northeastern Mediterranean. In the course of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta, a traditional land power, acquired a navy which managed to overpower the previously dominant flotilla of Athens, ending the Athenian Empire. At the peak of its power in the early 4th century BC, Sparta had subdued many of the main Greek states and even invaded the Persian provinces in Anatolia (modern day Turkey), a period known as the Spartan hegemony.\nDuring the Corinthian War, Sparta faced a coalition of the leading Greek states: Thebes, Athens, Corinth, and Argos. The alliance was initially backed by Persia, which feared further Spartan expansion into Asia. Sparta achieved a series of land victories, but many of her ships were destroyed at the Battle of Cnidus by a Greek-Phoenician mercenary fleet that Persia had provided to Athens. The event severely damaged Sparta's naval power but did not end its aspirations of invading further into Persia, until Conon the Athenian ravaged the Spartan coastline and provoked the old Spartan fear of a helot revolt.\nAfter a few more years of fighting, in 387 BC the Peace of Antalcidas was established, according to which all Greek cities of Ionia would return to Persian control, and Persia's Asian border would be free of the Spartan threat. The effects of the war were to reaffirm Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's weakened hegemonic position in the Greek political system. Sparta suffered a severe military defeat to Epaminondas of Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra.\nAs Spartan citizenship was inherited by blood, Sparta increasingly faced a helot population that vastly outnumbered its citizens. The alarming decline of Spartan citizens was commented on by Aristotle.\nHellenistic and Roman Sparta.\nSparta never fully recovered from its losses at Leuctra in 371 BC and the subsequent helot revolts. In 338, Philip II invaded and devastated much of Laconia, turning the Spartans out, though he did not seize Sparta itself. Even during its decline, Sparta never forgot its claim to be the \"defender of Hellenism\" and its Laconic wit. An anecdote has it that when Philip II sent a message to Sparta saying \"If I invade Laconia, I shall turn you out.\", the Spartans responded with the single, terse reply: , \"if\". When Philip created the League of Corinth on the pretext of unifying Greece against Persia, the Spartans chose not to join, since they had no interest in joining a pan-Greek expedition unless it were under Spartan leadership. Thus, upon defeating the Persians at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great sent to Athens 300 suits of Persian armour with the following inscription: \"Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Spartans, give these offerings taken from the foreigners who live in Asia\".\nThe Spartan king Agis III sent a force to Crete in 333 BC to secure the island for the Persian interest. Agis next took action against Macedon by laying siege to Megalopolis in 331 BC, while Alexander campaigned against the Persians in Asia as leader of the Hellenic league. However, a large Macedonian army under general Antipater marched to its relief and defeated the Spartan-led force in a pitched battle. More than 5,300 of the Spartans and their allies were killed in battle, and 3,500 of Antipater's troops. Agis, now wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing Macedonian army so that he could buy them time to retreat. On his knees, the Spartan king slew several enemy soldiers before being finally killed by a javelin. Alexander was merciful, and he only forced the Spartans to join the League of Corinth, which they had previously refused.\nAfter the Diadochi Wars, Sparta continued to be one of the Peloponesian powers until its eventual loss of independence in 192 BC. In 272 BC Pyrrhus of Epirus failed to besiege Sparta. Cleomenes III tried to make Sparta the dominant power of the Peloponnese against the Achaean League with initial successes but he was finally defeated in 222 BC at the battle of Selassia from a Macedonian-Achaean alliance under Antigonus Doson. During the First Macedonian War, Sparta was an ally of the Roman Republic. Spartan political independence was put to an end when it was eventually forced into the Achaean League by Philopoemen, after its defeat in the decisive Laconian War by a coalition of other Greek city-states and Rome, and the resultant overthrow of its final king Nabis, in 192 BC. Sparta played no active part in the Achaean War in 146 BC when the Achaean League was defeated by the Roman general Lucius Mummius. Subsequently, Sparta became a free city under Roman rule, some of the institutions of Lycurgus were restored, and the city became a tourist attraction for the Roman elite who came to observe exotic Spartan customs.\nIn 214 AD, Roman emperor Caracalla, in his preparation for his campaign against Parthia, recruited a 500-man Spartan cohort (\"lokhos\"). Herodian described this unit as a \"phalanx\", implying it fought like the old Spartans as hoplites, or even as a Macedonian phalanx. Despite this, a gravestone of a fallen legionary named Marcus Aurelius Alexys shows him lightly armed, with a pilos-like cap and a wooden club. The unit was presumably discharged in 217 after Caracalla was assassinated.\nAn exchange of letters in the deutero-canonical First Book of Maccabees expresses a Jewish claim to kinship with the Spartans:\nThe letters are reproduced in a variant form by Josephus. Jewish historian Uriel Rappaport notes that the relationship between the Jews and the Spartans expressed in this correspondence has \"intrigued many scholars, and various explanations have been suggested for the problems raised ... including the historicity of the Jewish leader and high priest Jonathan's letter to the Spartans, the authenticity of the letter of Arius to Onias, cited in Jonathan's letter, and the supposed 'brotherhood' of the Jews and the Spartans.\" Rappaport is clear that \"the authenticity of [the reply] letter of Arius is based on even less firm foundations than the letter of Jonathan\".\nSpartans long spurned the idea of building a defensive wall around their city, believing they made the city's men soft in terms of their warrior abilities. A wall was finally erected after 184 BCE, after the peak of the city-state's power had come and gone.\nPost-classical and modern Sparta.\nIn 396 AD, Sparta was sacked by Visigoths under Alaric I.\nAccording to Byzantine sources, some parts of the Laconian region remained pagan until well into the 10th century. The Tsakonian language still spoken in Tsakonia is the only surviving descendant of the ancient Doric language. In the Middle Ages, the political and cultural center of Laconia shifted to the nearby settlement of Mystras, and Sparta fell further in even local importance. Modern Sparta was re-founded in 1834, by a decree of King Otto of Greece. Today it is a provincial town and the capital of the Laconia administrative region.\nStructure of Classical Spartan society.\nConstitution.\nSparta was an oligarchy. The state was ruled by two hereditary kings of the Agiad and Eurypontid families, both supposedly descendants of Heracles and equal in authority, so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague.\nThe duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and military. As chief priests of the state, they maintained communication with the Delphian sanctuary, whose pronouncements exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus c.\u00a0450 BC, their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses (epikleroi), adoptions and the public roads (the meaning of the last term is unclear in Herodotus' text and has been interpreted in a number of ways). Aristotle describes the kingship at Sparta as \"a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship\" (Pol. iii. 1285a), while Isocrates refers to the Spartans as \"subject to an oligarchy at home, to a kingship on campaign\" (iii. 24).\nCivil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the ephors, as well as a council of elders known as the Gerousia. The Gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings. High state decisions were discussed by this council, who could then propose policies to the \"damos\", the collective body of Spartan citizenry, who would select one of the alternatives by vote.\nRoyal prerogatives were curtailed over time. From the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to declare war and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted by the ephors also in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Political power was transferred to the ephors and Gerousia.\nAn assembly of citizens called the Ekklesia was responsible for electing men to the Gerousia for life.\nCitizenship.\nThe Spartan education process known as the \"agoge\" was essential for full citizenship. However, usually the only boys eligible for the \"agoge\" were Spartiates, those who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city.\nThere were two exceptions. \"Trophimoi\" or \"foster sons\" were foreign students invited to study. The Athenian general Xenophon, for example, sent his two sons to Sparta as trophimoi. Also, the son of a helot could be enrolled as a \"syntrophos\" if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way; if he did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate. Spartans who could not afford to pay the expenses of the \"agoge\" could lose their citizenship.\nThese laws meant that Sparta could not readily replace citizens lost in battle or otherwise, which eventually proved near fatal as citizens became greatly outnumbered by non-citizens, and even more dangerously by helots.\nNon citizens.\nThe other classes were the perioikoi, free inhabitants who were non-citizens, and the helots, state-owned serfs. Descendants of non-Spartan citizens were forbidden the \"agoge\".\nHelots.\nThe Spartans were a minority of the Lakonian population. The largest class of inhabitants were the helots (in Classical Greek / \"He\u00edl\u00f4tes\").\nThe helots were originally free Greeks from the areas of Messenia and Lakonia whom the Spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaved. In contrast to populations conquered by other Greek cities (e.g. the Athenian treatment of Melos), the male population was not exterminated and the women and children turned into chattel slaves. Instead, the helots were given a subordinate position in society more comparable to serfs in medieval Europe than chattel slaves in the rest of Greece. The Spartan helots were not only agricultural workers, but were also household servants, both male and female would be assigned domestic duties, such as wool-working. However, the helots were not the private property of individual Spartan citizens, regardless of their household duties, and were instead owned by the state through the \"kleros\" system.\nHelots did not have voting or political rights. The Spartan poet Tyrtaios refers to Helots being allowed to marry and retaining 50% of the fruits of their labor. They also seem to have been allowed to practice religious rites and, according to Thucydides, own a limited amount of personal property.\nInitially, helots couldn't be freed but during the middle Hellenistic period, some 6,000 helots accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom, for example, in 227 BC.\nIn other Greek city-states, free citizens were part-time soldiers who, when not at war, carried on other trades. Since Spartan men were full-time soldiers, they were not available to carry out manual labour. The helots were used as unskilled serfs, tilling Spartan land. Helot women were often used as wet nurses. Helots also travelled with the Spartan army as non-combatant serfs. At the last stand of the Battle of Thermopylae, the Greek dead included not just the legendary three hundred Spartan soldiers but also several hundred Thespian and Theban troops and a number of helots.\nThere was at least one helot revolt (c.\u00a0465\u2013460 BC) that led to prolonged conflict. By the tenth year of this war the Spartans and Messenians had reached an agreement in which Messenian rebels were allowed to leave the Peloponnese. They were given safe passage under the terms that they would be re-enslaved if they tried to return. This agreement ended the most serious incursion into Spartan territory since their expansion in the seventh and eighth centuries BC. Thucydides remarked that \"Spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots.\" On the other hand, the Spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 BC to take a force of 35,000 with them to Plataea, something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away. Slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the Greek world, and in 413 BC 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to join the Spartan forces occupying Attica. What made Sparta's relations with her slave population unique was that the helots, precisely because they enjoyed privileges such as family and property, retained their identity as a conquered people (the Messenians) and also had effective kinship groups that could be used to organize rebellion.\nAs the Spartiate population declined and the helot population continued to grow, the imbalance of power caused increasing tension. According to Myron of Priene of the middle 3rd century BC:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They assign to the Helots every shameful task leading to disgrace. For they ordained that each one of them must wear a dogskin cap ( / \"kun\u1ec5\") and wrap himself in skins ( / \"diphth\u00e9ra\") and receive a stipulated number of beatings every year regardless of any wrongdoing, so that they would never forget they were slaves. Moreover, if any exceeded the vigour proper to a slave's condition, they made death the penalty; and they allotted a punishment to those controlling them if they failed to rebuke those who were growing fat.\nPlutarch also states that Spartans treated the helots \"harshly and cruelly\": they compelled them to drink pure wine (which was considered dangerous \u2013 wine usually being cut with water) \"...and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs...\" during \"syssitia\" (obligatory banquets).\nEach year when the Ephors took office, they ritually declared war on the helots, allowing Spartans to kill them without risk of ritual pollution. This fight seems to have been carried out by \"kryptai\" (sing. \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \"krypt\u0113s\"), graduates of the \"agoge\" who took part in the mysterious institution known as the \"Krypteia\". Thucydides states:\nThe helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against the enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the object being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel. As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, and no one ever knew how each of them perished.\nPerioikoi.\nThe Perioikoi came from similar origins as the helots but occupied a significantly different position in Spartan society. Although they did not enjoy full citizen-rights, they were free and not subjected to the same restrictions as the helots. The exact nature of their subjection to the Spartans is not clear, but they seem to have served partly as a kind of military reserve, partly as skilled craftsmen and partly as agents of foreign trade. Perioikoic hoplites served increasingly with the Spartan army, explicitly at the Battle of Plataea, and although they may also have fulfilled functions such as the manufacture and repair of armour and weapons, they were increasingly integrated into the combat units of the Spartan army as the Spartiate population declined.\nEconomy.\nFull citizen Spartiates were barred by law from trade or manufacture, which consequently rested in the hands of the Perioikoi. This lucrative monopoly, in a fertile territory with a good harbors, ensured the loyalty of the perioikoi. Despite the prohibition on menial labor or trade, there is evidence of Spartan sculptors, and Spartans were certainly poets, magistrates, ambassadors, and governors as well as soldiers.\nAllegedly, Spartans were prohibited from possessing gold and silver coins, and according to legend Spartan currency consisted of iron bars to discourage hoarding. Though the conspicuous display of wealth appears to have been discouraged, this did not preclude the production of very fine decorated bronze, ivory and wooden works of art as well as exquisite jewellery, attested in archaeology.\nAllegedly as part of the Lycurgan Reforms in the mid-8th century BC, a massive land reform had divided property into 9,000 equal portions. Each citizen received one estate, a \"kleros\", which was expected to provide his living. The land was worked by helots who retained half the yield. From the other half, the Spartiate was expected to pay his mess (\"syssitia\") fees, and the \"agoge\" fees for his children. However, nothing is known of matters of wealth such as how land was bought, sold, and inherited, or whether daughters received dowries. However, from early on there were marked differences of wealth within the state, and these became more serious after the law of Epitadeus some time after the Peloponnesian War, which removed the legal prohibition on the gift or bequest of land. By the mid-5th century, land had become concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite, and the notion that all Spartan citizens were equals had become an empty pretence. By Aristotle's day (384\u2013322 BC) citizenship had been reduced from 9,000 to less than 1,000, then further decreased to 700 at the accession of Agis IV in 244 BC. Attempts were made to remedy this by imposing legal penalties upon bachelors, but this could not reverse the trend.\nLife in Classical Sparta.\nBirth and death.\nSparta was above all a militarist state, and emphasis on military fitness began virtually at birth. According to Plutarch, after birth, a mother would bathe her child in wine to see whether the child was strong. If the child survived it was brought before the Gerousia by the child's father. The Gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not. It is commonly stated that if they considered it \"puny and deformed\", the baby was thrown into a chasm on Mount Taygetos known euphemistically as the \"Apothetae\" (Gr., \"\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\", \"Deposits\"). This would, in effect, be a primitive form of eugenics. Plutarch is the sole historical source for the Spartan practice of systemic infanticide motivated by eugenics. Sparta is often viewed as being unique in this regard, however, anthropologist Laila Williamson notes: \"Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule.\" There is controversy about the matter in Sparta, since excavations in the chasm only uncovered adult remains, likely belonging to criminals and Greek sources contemporary to Sparta do not mention systemic infanticide motivated solely by eugenics.\nSpartan burial customs changed over time. The Archaic Spartan poet Tyrtaeus spoke of the Spartan war-dead as follows:\nNever do his [the war-dead's] name and good fame perish,&lt;br&gt;But even though he is beneath the earth he is immortal,&lt;br&gt;Young and old alike mourn him,&lt;br&gt;All the city is distressed by the painful loss,&lt;br&gt;and his tomb and children are pointed out among the people,&lt;br&gt;and his children's children and his line after them.\nWhen Spartans died, marked headstones would only be granted to soldiers who died in combat during a victorious campaign or women who died either in service of a divine office or in childbirth. These headstones likely acted as memorials, rather than as grave markers. Evidence of Spartan burials is provided by the Tomb of the Lacedaimonians in Athens. Excavations at the cemetery of classical Sparta, uncovered ritually pierced kantharoid-like ceramic vessels, the ritual slaughter of horses, and specific burial enclosures alongside individual 'plots'. Some of the graves were reused over time.\nIn the Hellenistic Period, grander, two-storey monumental tombs are found at Sparta. Ten of these have been found for this period.\nEducation.\nWhen male Spartans began military training at age seven, they would enter the \"agoge\" system. The \"agoge\" was designed to encourage discipline and physical toughness and to emphasize the importance of the Spartan state. Boys lived in communal messes and, according to Xenophon, whose sons attended the \"agoge\", the boys were fed \"just the right amount for them never to become sluggish through being too full, while also giving them a taste of what it is not to have enough.\" In addition, they were trained to survive in times of privation, even if it meant stealing. Besides physical and weapons training, boys studied reading, writing, music and dancing. Special punishments were imposed if boys failed to answer questions sufficiently \"laconically\" (i.e. briefly and wittily).\nSpartan boys were expected to take an older male mentor, usually an unmarried young man. According to some sources, the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of Spartan pederasty is not entirely clear). Xenophon, an admirer of the Spartan educational system whose sons attended the \"agoge\", explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.\nSome Spartan youth apparently became members of an irregular unit known as the \"Krypteia\". The immediate objective of this unit was to seek out and kill vulnerable helot Laconians as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population.\nLess information is available about the education of Spartan girls, but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle, broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training. Spartan girls received an education known as \"mousik\u0113\". This included music, dancing, singing and poetry. Choral dancing was taught so Spartan girls could participate in ritual activities, including the cults of Helen and Artemis. In this respect, classical Sparta was unique in ancient Greece. In no other city-state did women receive any kind of formal education.\nMilitary life.\nAt age 20, the Spartan citizen began his membership in one of the \"syssitia\" (dining messes or clubs), composed of about fifteen members each, of which every citizen was required to be a member. Here each group learned how to bond and rely on one another. The Spartans were not eligible for election for public office until the age of 30. Only native Spartans were considered full citizens and were obliged to undergo the training as prescribed by law, as well as participate in and contribute financially to one of the \"syssitia\".\nSparta is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and some scholars claim that it was also the first to formalize pederasty. According to these sources, the Spartans believed that the love of an older, accomplished aristocrat for an adolescent was essential to his formation as a free citizen. The \"agoge\", the education of the ruling class, was, they claim, founded on pederastic relationships required of each citizen, with the lover responsible for the boy's training.\nHowever, other scholars question this interpretation. Xenophon explicitly denies it, but not Plutarch.\nSpartan men remained in the active reserve until age 60. Men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30. They called themselves \"homoioi\" (equals), pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the phalanx, which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades. Insofar as hoplite warfare could be perfected, the Spartans did so.\nThucydides reports that when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or another woman of some significance) would customarily present him with his aspis (shield) and say: \"With this, or upon this\" (\u1f2a \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fb6\u03c2, \"\u00c8i t\u00e0n \u00e8i \u00e8p\u00ec t\u00e0s\"), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it). This is almost certainly propaganda. Spartans buried their battle dead on or near the battle field; corpses were not brought back on their shield. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet, breastplate or greaves than his shield, since the former were designed to protect one man, whereas the shield also protected the man on his left. Thus, the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier's subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms \u2013 messmates and friends, often close blood relations.\nAccording to Aristotle, the Spartan military culture was actually short-sighted and ineffective. He observed:\nIt is the standards of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind, for it is good men not beasts who are capable of real courage. Those like the Spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of city's life, end up making them inferior even in that.\nOne of the most persistent myths about Sparta that has no basis in fact is the notion that Spartan mothers were without feelings toward their off-spring and helped enforce a militaristic lifestyle on their sons and husbands. The myth can be traced back to Plutarch, who includes no less than 17 \"sayings\" of \"Spartan women\", all of which paraphrase or elaborate on the theme that Spartan mothers rejected their own offspring if they showed any kind of cowardice. In some of these sayings, mothers revile their sons in insulting language merely for surviving a battle. These sayings purporting to be from Spartan women were far more likely to be of Athenian origin and designed to portray Spartan women as unnatural and so undeserving of pity.\nAgriculture, food, and diet.\nSparta's agriculture consisted mainly of barley, wine, cheese, grain, and figs. These items were grown locally on each Spartan citizen's kleros and were tended to by helots. Spartan citizens were required to donate a certain amount of what they yielded from their kleros to their syssitia, or mess. These donations to the syssitia were a requirement for every Spartan citizen. All the donated food was then redistributed to feed the Spartan population of that syssitia. The helots who tended to the lands were fed using a portion of what they harvested.\nMarriage.\nPlutarch reports the peculiar customs associated with the Spartan wedding night:\nThe custom was to capture women for marriage... The so-called 'bridesmaid' took charge of the captured girl. She first shaved her head to the scalp, then dressed her in a man's cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark. The bridegroom \u2013 who was not drunk and thus not impotent, but was sober as always \u2013 first had dinner in the messes, then would slip in, undo her belt, lift her and carry her to the bed.\nThe husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage. These customs, unique to the Spartans, have been interpreted in various ways. One of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage, so unaccustomed were men to women's looks at the time of their first intercourse. The \"abduction\" may have served to ward off the evil eye, and the cutting of the wife's hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life.\nRole of women.\nPolitical, social, and economic equality.\nSpartan women, of the citizenry class, enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. The higher status of females in Spartan society started at birth; unlike Athens, Spartan girls were fed the same food as their brothers. Nor were they confined to their father's house and prevented from exercising or getting fresh air as in Athens, but exercised and even competed in sports. Most important, rather than being married off at the age of 12 or 13, Spartan law forbade the marriage of a girl until she was in her late teens or early 20s. The reasons for delaying marriage were to ensure the birth of healthy children, but the effect was to spare Spartan women the hazards and lasting health damage associated with pregnancy among adolescents. Spartan women, better fed from childhood and fit from exercise, stood a far better chance of reaching old age than their sisters in other Greek cities, where the median age for death was 34.6 years or roughly 10 years below that of men.\nUnlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore dresses (peplos) slit up the side to allow freer movement and moved freely about the city, either walking or driving chariots. Girls as well as boys exercised, possibly in the nude, and young women as well as young men may have participated in the Gymnopaedia (\"Festival of Nude Youths\").\nAnother practice that was mentioned by many visitors to Sparta was the practice of \"wife-sharing\". In accordance with the Spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents, many older men allowed younger, more fit men, to impregnate their wives. Other unmarried or childless men might even request another man's wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer. For this reason many considered Spartan women polygamous or polyandrous. This practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could. The Spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss of the men in battle and the intense physical inspection of newborns.\nSpartan women were also literate and numerate, a rarity in the ancient world. Furthermore, as a result of their education and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with their fellow (male) citizens, they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public. Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women's curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato praised Spartan women's ability when it came to philosophical discussion.\nMost importantly, Spartan women had economic power because they controlled their own properties, and those of their husbands. It is estimated that in later Classical Sparta, when the male population was in serious decline, women were the sole owners of at least 35% of all land and property in Sparta. The laws regarding a divorce were the same for both men and women. Unlike women in Athens, if a Spartan woman became the heiress of her father because she had no living brothers to inherit (an \"epikleros\"), the woman was not required to divorce her current spouse in order to marry her nearest paternal relative.\nHistoric women.\nMany women played a significant role in the history of Sparta. Queen Gorgo, heiress to the throne and the wife of Leonidas I, was an influential and well-documented figure. Herodotus records that as a small girl she advised her father Cleomenes to resist a bribe. She was later said to be responsible for decoding a warning that the Persian forces were about to invade Greece; after Spartan generals could not decode a wooden tablet covered in wax, she ordered them to clear the wax, revealing the warning. Plutarch's \"Moralia\" contains a collection of \"Sayings of Spartan Women\", including a laconic quip attributed to Gorgo: when asked by a woman from Attica why Spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men, she replied \"Because we are the only women who are mothers of men\". In 396, Cynisca, sister of the Eurypontid king Agesilaos II, became the first woman in Greece to win an Olympic chariot race. She won again in 392, and dedicated two monuments to commemorate her victory, these being an inscription in Sparta and a set of bronze equestrian statues at the Olympic temple of Zeus.\nLaconophilia.\nLaconophilia is love or admiration of Sparta and its culture or constitution. Sparta was subject of considerable admiration in its day, even in rival Athens. In ancient times \"Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians always considered the Spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice.\" Many Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, would often describe Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money. The French classicist Fran\u00e7ois Ollier in his 1933 book \"Le mirage spartiate\" (The Spartan Mirage) warned that a major scholarly problem is that all surviving accounts of Sparta were by non-Spartans who often excessively idealized their subject. The term \"Spartan Mirage\" has come to refer to \"idealized distortions and inventions regarding the character of Spartan society in the works of non-Spartan writers,\" beginning in Greek and Roman antiquity and continuing through the medieval and modern eras. These accounts of Sparta are typically associated with the social or political concerns of the writer. No accounts survive by the Spartans themselves, if such were ever written.\nWith the revival of classical learning in Renaissance Europe, Laconophilia re-appeared, for example in the writings of Machiavelli. The Elizabethan English constitutionalist John Aylmer compared the mixed government of Tudor England to the Spartan republic, stating that \"Lacedemonia [was] the noblest and best city governed that ever was\". He commended it as a model for England. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau contrasted Sparta favourably with Athens in his \"Discourse on the Arts and Sciences\", arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more sophisticated Athenian life. Sparta was also used as a model of austere purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France.\nA German racist strain of Laconophilia was initiated by Karl Otfried M\u00fcller, who linked Spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the Dorians, the ethnic sub-group of the Greeks to which the Spartans belonged. In the 20th century, this developed into Fascist admiration of Spartan ideals. Adolf Hitler praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting \"the number allowed to live\". He added that \"The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans.\" The Spartans had created \"the first racialist state\". Following the invasion of the USSR, Hitler viewed citizens of the USSR as like the helots under the Spartans: \"They [the Spartans] came as conquerors, and they took everything\", and so should the Germans. A Nazi officer specified that \"the Germans would have to assume the position of the Spartiates, while... the Russians were the Helots.\"\nCertain early Zionists, and particularly the founders of Kibbutz movement in Israel, were influenced by Spartan ideals, particularly in education. Tabenkin, a founding father of the Kibbutz movement and the Palmach strikeforce, prescribed that education for warfare \"should begin from the nursery\", that children should from kindergarten be taken to \"spend nights in the mountains and valleys\".\nIn modern times, the adjective \"Spartan\" means simple, frugal, avoiding luxury and comfort. The term \"laconic phrase\" describes the very terse and direct speech characteristic of the Spartans.\nSparta also features prominently in modern popular culture, most famously the Battle of Thermopylae (see Battle of Thermopylae in popular culture).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36511", "revid": "51055334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36511", "title": "Milan", "text": "Second-largest city in Italy\nMilan ( , , ; ) is the regional capital of Lombardy, in northern Italy, and the second-most populous city in Italy, with a population of 1.36 million in 2025. The Metropolitan City of Milan is the largest city in Italy by urban area. Its wider metropolitan area is the largest in Italy, and the fourth-largest in the European Union, with an estimated population of 6.1 million.\nFounded around 590 BC by a Celtic tribe, Milan was conquered by the Romans in 222 BC, who Latinized the name of the city into Mediolanum and made it the capital of the Western Roman Empire. In the Late Medieval period, the wealthy Duchy of Milan was one of the greatest forces behind the Renaissance. As a major center of the Italian Enlightenment during the Early modern period, Milan's cultural and political struggle against Austrian domination was crucial in the reunification of the Kingdom of Italy. From the 19th century onwards, Milan led the industrial and financial development of Italy. \nMilan is considered the economic capital of Italy, and a major international center of industry, finance, science, communications, fashion, art and tourism. As of 2024[ [update]], Milan was classified as an \"Alpha\" city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Milan's business district hosts Borsa Italiana, Italy's main stock exchange (part of the Euronext consortium, the world's sixth-largest by market capitalization) and the headquarters of numerous national corporations, including eight Fortune 500 Europe companies. As of 2023[ [update]], Milan and its special metropolitan authority have the largest GDP and the highest per-capita GDP of any Italian province. \nMilan is a global fashion capital and a major international tourist destination, appearing among the most visited cities in the world, ranking second in Italy after Rome, fifth in Europe and sixteenth in the world. The city is a major cultural center, with museums and art galleries that feature some of the most important collections in the world, including major works by Leonardo da Vinci. The city also hosts numerous educational institutions, including academies and universities that account for 11% of the national total of enrolled students. Additionally, Milan hosts several international events and fairs, including Milan Fashion Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are among the world's largest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth. The city is served by many luxury hotels and is the fifth most starred in the world by Michelin Guide. It hosted the Universal Exposition in 1906 and 2015. In the field of sports, Milan is home to two of Europe's most successful football teams, AC Milan and Inter Milan, and one of Europe's main basketball teams, Olimpia Milano. Milan will host the Winter Olympic and Paralympic games for the first time in 2026, together with Cortina d'Ampezzo.\nToponymy.\nMilan was founded with the Celtic name of Medhelanon, later Latinized by the ancient Romans into Mediolanum. In Celtic language \"medhe-\" meant \"middle, center\" and the name element \"-lanon\" is the Celtic equivalent of Latin \"-planum\" \"plain\", meant \"(settlement) in the midst of the plain\",&lt;ref name=\"Delamarre 2003 https://archive.org/details/dictionnairedela00dela_348/page/n219 221\u2013222\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or of \"place between watercourses\" (Celtic \"medhe\" = \"in the middle, central\"; \"land\" or \"lan\" = \"land\"), given the presence of the Olona, Lambro, Seveso rivers and the Nirone and Pudiga streams.\nThe Latin name \"Mediolanum\" comes from the Latin words \"medio\" (in the middle) and \"planus\" (plain). However, some scholars believe that \"lanum\" comes from the Celtic root \"lan\", meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the Welsh word \"llan\", meaning \"a sanctuary or church\", ultimately cognate to English/German \"Land\") in which Celtic communities used to build shrines.\nHence \"Mediolanum\" could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman sites in France bore the name \"Mediolanum\", for example: Saintes (\"Mediolanum Santonum\") and \u00c9vreux (\"Mediolanum Aulercorum\"). In addition, another theory links the name to the \"scrofa semilanuta\" (\"half-woolly sow\") an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in Andrea Alciato's \"Emblemata\" (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of \"Mediolanum\" given as \"half-wool\", explained in Latin and in French.\nAccording to this theory, the foundation of Milan is credited to two Celtic peoples, the Bituriges and the Aedui, having as their emblems a ram and a boar; therefore \"The city's symbol is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool.\" Alciato credits Ambrose for his account.\nHistory.\nCeltic era.\nAround 590 BC a Celtic tribe belonging to the Insubres group and belonging to the Golasecca culture settled the city under the name Medhelanon. According to the legend reported by Livy (writing between 27 and 9 BC), the Gaulish king Ambicatus sent his nephew Bellovesus into northern Italy at the head of a party drawn from various Gaulish tribes; Bellovesus allegedly founded the settlement in the times of the Roman monarchy, during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. Tarquin is traditionally recorded as reigning from 616 to 579 BC, according to ancient Roman historian Titus Livy.\nMedhelanon, in particular, was developed around a sanctuary, which was the oldest area of the village. The sanctuary, which consisted of a wooded area in the shape of an ellipse with a central clearing, was aligned according to precise astronomical points. For this reason, it was used for religious gatherings, especially in particular celebratory moments. The sanctuary of Medhelanon was an ellipse with axes of and located near Piazza della Scala. The urban planning profile was based on these early paths, and on the shape of the sanctuary, reached, in some cases, up to the 19th century and even beyond. For example, the route of the modern Corso Vittorio Emanuele, Piazza del Duomo, Piazza Cordusio and Via Broletto, which is curvilinear, could correspond to the south side of the ellipse of the ancient sanctuary of Medhelanon.\nOne axis of the Medhelanon sanctuary was aligned towards the heliacal rising of Antares, while the other towards the heliacal rising of Capella. The latter coincided with a Celtic spring festival celebrated on 24 March, while the heliacal rising of Antares corresponded with 11 November, which opened and closed the Celtic year and which coincided with the point where the Sun rose on the winter solstice. About two centuries after the creation of the Celtic sanctuary, the first residential settlements began to be built around it. Medhelanon then transformed from a simple religious center to an urban and then military centre, thus becoming a real village.\nThe first homes were built just south of the Celtic sanctuary, near the modern Royal Palace of Milan. Subsequently, with the growth of the town centre, other important buildings for the Medhelanon community were built. First, a temple dedicated to the goddess Belisama was built, which was located near the modern Milan Cathedral. Then, near the modern Via Moneta, which is located near today's Piazza San Sepolcro, a fortified building with military functions was built which was surrounded by a defensive moat.\nRoman times.\nDuring the Roman Republic, the Romans, led by consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, fought the Insubres and captured the settlement in 222 BC. The chief of the Insubres then submitted to Rome, giving the Romans control of the settlement. The Romans eventually conquered the entirety of the region, calling the new province \"Cisalpine Gaul\" ()\u2014\"Gaul this side of the Alps\"\u2014and may have given the city its Latinized name of Mediolanum: in Gaulish \"*medio-\" meant \"middle, centre\" and the name element \"-lanon\" is the Celtic equivalent of Latin \"-planum\" \"plain\", thus \"*Mediolanon\" (Latinized as \"Mediol\u0101num\") meant \"(settlement) in the midst of the plain\". Mediolanum became the most important center of Cisalpine Gaul and, in the wake of economic development, in 49 BC, was elevated, within the \"Lex Roscia\", to the status of \"municipium\".\nThe ancient Celtic settlement was, from a topographic point of view, superimposed and replaced by the Roman one. The Roman city was then gradually superimposed and replaced by the medieval one. The urban center of Milan has therefore grown constantly and rapidly, until modern times, around the first Celtic nucleus. The original Celtic toponym Medhelanon then changed, as evidenced by a graffiti in Celtic language present on a section of the Roman walls of Milan which dates back to a period following the Roman conquest of the Celtic village, in Mesiolano. In 286, the Roman Emperor Diocletian moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum. Diocletian himself chose to reside at Nicomedia in the Eastern Empire, leaving his colleague Maximian at Milan.\nDuring the Augustan age Mediolanum was famous for its schools; it possessed a theatre and an amphitheatre (129.5 x 109.3 m), the third largest in Roman Italy after the Colosseum in Rome and the vast amphitheatre in Capua. A large stone wall encircled the city in Caesar's time, and later was expanded in the late third century AD, by Maximian. Maximian built several gigantic monuments including the large circus (470 \u00d7 85 metres) and the \"thermae\" or Baths of Hercules, a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which few visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area to 375 acres by surrounding it with a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5\u00a0km long) with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; the one included later in the construction of the convent of San Maurizio Maggiore remains 16.6 m high.\nIt was from Mediolanum that the Emperor Constantine issued what is now known as the Edict of Milan in AD 313, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, thus paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion of the Empire. Constantine was in Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, Licinius. In 402, the Visigoths besieged the city and the Emperor Honorius moved the Imperial residence to Ravenna. In 452, Attila besieged the city, but the real break with the city's Imperial past came in 539, during the Gothic War, when Uraias (a nephew of Witiges, formerly King of the Italian Ostrogoths) carried out attacks in Milan, with losses, according to Procopius, being about 300,000 men. The Lombards took Ticinum as their capital in 572 (renaming it \"Papia\" \u2013 the modern Pavia), and left early-medieval Milan to the governance of its archbishops.\nMiddle Ages.\nAfter the siege of the city by the Visigoths in 402, the imperial residence moved to Ravenna. Attila, King of the Huns, sacked and devastated the city in 452\u00a0AD. In 539 the Ostrogoths conquered and destroyed Milan during the Gothic War against Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. In the summer of 569 the Lombards (from whom the name of the Italian region Lombardy derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small Byzantine garrison left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule. Milan surrendered to Charlemagne and the Franks in 774.\nThe 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the Holy Roman Emperors. City-states emerged in northern Italy, an expression of the new political power of the cities and their will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the Italian city-states to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers. The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked Frederick I Barbarossa for help. In a sally they captured Empress Beatrice and forced her to ride a donkey backward through the city until getting out. Frederick I Barbarossa brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162.\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its geographical position. During this time, the city was considered one of the largest European cities. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the Peace of Constance in 1183, Milan returned to the commune form of local government first established in the 11th century.\nIn 1395, Gian Galeazzo Visconti became the first Duke of Milan upon receiving the title from Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. In 1447 Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the Ambrosian Republic was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city. Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. Nonetheless, the Republic collapsed when, in 1450, Milan was conquered by Francesco I of the House of Sforza, which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian Renaissance. Under the House of Sforza, Milan experienced a period of great prosperity, which in particular saw the development of mulberry cultivation and silk processing.\nFollowing this economic growth, works such as the Sforza Castle (already existing in the Visconti era under the name of Porta Giovia Castle, but re-adapted, enlarged and completed by the Sforza family) and the Ospedale Maggiore were completed. The Sforzas also managed to attract to Milan personalities such as Leonardo da Vinci, who redesigned and improved the function of the navigli and painted \"The Last Supper\", and Bramante, who worked on the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro, on the basilica of Sant'Ambrogio and to the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, influencing the development of the Lombard Renaissance.\nEarly modern.\nMilan's last independent ruler, Lodovico il Moro, requested the aid of Charles VIII of France against the other Italian states, eventually unleashing the Italian Wars. The king's cousin, Louis of Orl\u00e9ans, took part in the expedition and realized most of Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to come back a few years later in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling Visconti family. At that time, Milan was also defended by Swiss mercenaries. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the Battle of Marignan, the duchy was promised to the French king Fran\u00e7ois I. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor Charles V defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, northern Italy, which included Milan, passed to Habsburg Spain.\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son Philip II and his brother Ferdinand I. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The Great Plague of Milan in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by Alessandro Manzoni in his masterpiece \"The Betrothed\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long pandemic of plague that began with the Black Death.\nIn 1700, the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of Charles II. After his death, the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701. In 1706, the French were defeated in Ramillies and Turin and were forced to yield northern Italy to the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including Lombardy and its capital, Milan.\nNapoleon invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the Cisalpine Republic. Later, he declared Milan capital of the Kingdom of Italy and was crowned King of Italy in the cathedral. After Napoleon's occupation ended, the Congress of Vienna returned Lombardy and Milan to Austrian control in 1815.\nLate modern and contemporary.\nOn 18 March 1848 Milan effectively rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"Five Days\" (), that forced Field Marshal Radetzky to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering Kingdom of Piedmont\u2013Sardinia sent troops to protect the insurgents and organised a plebiscite that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont\u2013Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the Battle of Custoza on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy. About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new French Empire of Napoleon III to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the Battle of Solferino in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the Quadrilateral line. Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into Piedmont-Sardinia, which then proceeded to annex all the other Italian statelets and proclaim the birth of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.\nThe political unification of Italy enhanced Milan's economic dominance over northern Italy. A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the Gotthard (1882) and Simplon (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the Orient Express that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. In May 1898, Milan was shaken by the Bava Beccaris massacre, a riot related to soaring cost of living.\nMilan's northern location in Italy closer to Europe, secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that Benito Mussolini built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist Blackshirts rallied for the first time in the city's Piazza San Sepolcro; here the future Fascist dictator launched his March on Rome on 28 October 1922. During the Second World War Milan's large industrial and transport facilities suffered extensive damage from Allied bombings that often also hit residential districts. When Italy surrendered in 1943, German forces occupied and plundered most of northern Italy, fueling the birth of a massive resistance guerrilla movement. On 29 April 1945, the American 1st Armored Division was advancing on Milan but, before it arrived, the Italian resistance seized control of the city and executed Mussolini along with his mistress and several regime officers, that were later hanged and exposed in Piazzale Loreto, where one year before some resistance members had been executed.\nDuring the post-war economic boom, the reconstruction effort and the Italian economic miracle attracted a large wave of internal migration (especially from rural areas of southern Italy) to Milan. The population grew from 1.3\u00a0million in 1951 to 1.7\u00a0million in 1967. During this period, Milan was rapidly rebuilt, with the construction of several innovative and modernist skyscrapers, such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower, that soon became the symbols of this new era of prosperity. The economic prosperity was, however, overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so-called Years of lead, when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of street violence, labour strikes and political terrorism. The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when a bomb exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing 17 people and injuring 88.\nIn the 1980s, with the international success of Milanese houses (like Armani, Prada, Versace, Moschino and Dolce &amp; Gabbana), Milan became one of the world's fashion capitals. The city saw also a marked rise in international tourism, notably from America and Japan, while the stock exchange increased its market capitalisation more than five-fold. This period led the mass media to nickname the metropolis \"Milano da bere\", literally \"Milan to be drunk\". But in the 1990s Milan was badly affected by Tangentopoli, a political scandal in which many politicians and businessmen were tried for corruption. The city was also affected by a severe financial crisis and a steady decline in textiles, automobile and steel production. Berlusconi's Milano 2 and Milano 3 projects were the most important housing projects of the 1980s and 1990s in Milan and brought to the city new economical and social energy.\nIn the early 21st century Milan underwent a series of sweeping redevelopments over huge former industrial areas. Two new business districts, Porta Nuova and CityLife, were built in the space of a decade, radically changing the skyline of the city. Its exhibition centre moved to a much larger site in Rho. The long decline in traditional manufacturing has been overshadowed by a great expansion of publishing, finance, banking, fashion design, information technology, logistics and tourism. The city's decades-long population decline seems to have partially reverted in recent years, as the gained about 100,000 new residents since the last census. The successful re-branding of the city as a global capital of innovation has been instrumental in its successful bids for hosting large international events such as 2015 Expo and 2026 Winter Olympics.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nMilan is located in the north-western section of the Po Valley, approximately halfway between the river Po to the south and the foothills of the Alps with the great lakes (Lake Como, Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano) to the north, the Ticino river to the west and the Adda to the east. The city's land is flat, the highest point being at above sea level.\nThe administrative , or city proper, covers an area of about , with a population, in 2025, of 1,366,155 and a population density of . Milan's continuous urban area extends beyond the city limits. The administrative Metropolitan City of Milan, a special-status provincial authority, covers and in 2024 had a population estimated at 3,245,459, with a resulting density of , while its wider metropolitan had an estimated population in excess of 6.1 million as of 2025[ [update]].\nThe concentric layout of the city centre reflects the \"Navigli\", an ancient system of navigable and interconnected canals, now mostly covered. The suburbs of the city have expanded mainly to the north, swallowing up many along the roads towards Varese, Como, Lecco and Bergamo. In the 21st century the Navigli region of Milan is a highly active area with a large number of residential units, bars and restaurants. It is also a well-known centre for artists.\nClimate.\nMilan features a mid-latitude, four-season humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\"), according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Milan's climate is similar to much of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot, humid summers and cold, foggy winters. The Alps and Apennine Mountains form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the sea.\nDuring winter daily average temperatures can fall below freezing () and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan's area is in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of in January 1985. In the suburbs the average can reach . The city receives on average seven days of snow per year.\nThe city was often shrouded in thick cloud or fog during winter, although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighbourhoods and the urban heat island effect have greatly reduced this occurrence since the turn of the 21st century. Occasionally, the Foehn winds cause the temperatures to rise unexpectedly: on 22 January 2012 the daily high reached while on 22 February 2012 it reached . Air pollution levels rise significantly in wintertime when cold air clings to the soil, causing Milan to be one of Europe's most polluted cities.\nSummers in Milan are hot and humidity levels are high with peak temperatures reaching above . Due to the high humidity, urban heat effect and lack of wind, nighttimes often remain muggy during the summer months. Usually the summer enjoys clearer skies with an average of more than 13 hours of daylight: when precipitation occurs though, it is more likely to be accompanied by thunderstorms and hail. Springs and autumns are generally pleasant, with temperatures ranging between ; these seasons are characterized by higher rainfall, especially in April and May. Relative humidity typically ranges between 45% (comfortable) and 95% (very humid) throughout the year, rarely dropping below 27% (dry) and reaching as high as 100%. Wind is generally absent: over the course of the year typical wind speeds vary from (calm to gentle breeze), rarely exceeding (fresh breeze), except during summer thunderstorms when winds can blow strong. In the spring, gale-force windstorms may happen, generated either by Tramontane blowing from the Alps or by Bora-like winds from the north. Due to its geographic location surrounded by mountains on 3 sides, Milan is among the least windy cities in Europe.\nAdministration.\nMunicipal government.\nThe legislative body of the Italian is the City Council (\"Consiglio Comunale\"), which in cities with more than one million population is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time of the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (\"Giunta Comunale\"), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Milan is Giuseppe Sala, an independent leading a centre-left alliance led by the Democratic Party.\nThe municipality of Milan is subdivided into nine administrative Borough Councils (\"Consigli di Municipio\"), down from the former twenty districts before the 1999 administrative reform. Each Borough Council is governed by a Council (\"Consiglio\") and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114), the Municipal Statute and several laws, notably the Legislative Decree 267/2000 or Unified Text on Local Administration (\"Testo Unico degli Enti Locali\"). After the 2016 administrative reform, the Borough Councils have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics and are responsible for running most local services, such as schools, social services, waste collection, roads, parks, libraries and local commerce; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding to finance local activities.\nMetropolitan city.\nMilan is the capital of the eponymous Metropolitan city. According to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Milan is one of the 15 Metropolitan municipalities (\"citt\u00e0 metropolitane\"), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Milan is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor (\"Sindaco metropolitano\"), presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 24 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality. The Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (\"Sindaco metropolitano\") and by the Metropolitan Council (\"Consiglio metropolitano\"). Since 21 June 2016, Giuseppe Sala, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.\nRegional government.\nMilan is also the capital of Lombardy, one of the twenty regions of Italy. Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. It is governed by a Regional Council, composed of 80 members elected for a five-year term. On 26 March 2018, a list of candidates of the centre-right coalition, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Attilio Fontana, largely won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists, liberals and ecologists and a third-party candidate from the populist Five Stars Movement. The conservatives have governed the region almost uninterruptedly since 1970. The regional council has 48 members from the centre-right coalition, 18 from the centre-left coalition and 13 from the Five Star Movement. The seat of the regional government is Palazzo Lombardia that, standing at , is the fifth-tallest building in Milan.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nThe architectural and artistic presence in Milan represents one of the attractions of the Lombard capital. Milan has been among the most important Italian centers in the history of architecture, has made important contributions to the development of art history, and has been the cradle of a number of modern art movements.\nThere are only few remains of the ancient Roman city, notably the well-preserved Colonne di San Lorenzo. During the second half of the 4th century, Saint Ambrose, as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, reshaping the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built in Roman times are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: Sant'Ambrogio, San Nazaro in Brolo, San Simpliciano and Sant'Eustorgio, which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan. Milan's Cathedral, built between 1386 and 1877, is the largest church in the Italian Republic\u2014the larger St. Peter's Basilica is in the State of Vatican City, a sovereign state\u2014and the third largest in the world, as well as the most important example of Gothic architecture in Italy. The gilt bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, placed in 1774 on the highest pinnacle of the Duomo, soon became one of the most enduring symbols of Milan.\nIn the 15th century, when the Sforza ruled the city, an old Viscontean fortress was enlarged and embellished to become the Castello Sforzesco, the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects involved in the project included the Florentine Filarete, who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio. The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence's Cosimo de' Medici bore to Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the Ospedale Maggiore and Bramante's work in the city, which includes Santa Maria presso San Satiro (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie and three cloisters for Sant'Ambrogio. The Counter-Reformation in the 16th to 17th centuries was also the period of Spanish domination and was marked by two powerful figures: Saint Charles Borromeo and his cousin, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, in a building designed by Francesco Maria Richini, and the nearby Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, Pellegrino Tibaldi, Galeazzo Alessi and Richini himself.\nEmpress Maria Theresa of Austria was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century. This urban and artistic renewal included the establishment of Teatro alla Scala, inaugurated in 1778, and the renovation of the Royal Palace. The late 1700s Palazzo Belgioioso by Giuseppe Piermarini and Royal Villa of Milan by Leopoldo Pollack, later the official residence of Austrian viceroys, are often regarded among the best examples of Neoclassical architecture in Lombardy. The Napoleonic rule of the city in 1805\u20131814, having established Milan as the capital of a satellite Kingdom of Italy, took steps to reshape it accordingly to its new status, with the construction of large boulevards, new squares (Porta Ticinese by Luigi Cagnola and Foro Bonaparte by Giovanni Antonio Antolini) and cultural institutions (Art Gallery and the Academy of Fine Arts). The massive Arch of Peace, situated at the bottom of Corso Sempione, is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the Second Industrial Revolution. The great Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, realised by Giuseppe Mengoni between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate Vittorio Emanuele II, is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the Burlington Arcade in London. Several other arcades such as the Galleria del Corso, built between 1923 and 1931, complement it. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the Cimitero Monumentale graveyard, built in a Neo-Romanesque style between 1863 and 1866.\nThe tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture. Art Nouveau, also known as \"Liberty\" in Italy, is recognisable in Palazzo Castiglioni, built by architect Giuseppe Sommaruga between 1901 and 1903. Other examples include Hotel Corso, Casa Guazzoni with its wrought iron and staircase, and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city. A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past. An important example of Art Deco, which blended such styles with Fascist architecture, is the huge Central railway station inaugurated in 1931.\nThe post-World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly two-fold increase in population. In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including Gio Ponti's Pirelli Tower (1956\u201360), Velasca Tower (1956\u201358), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low-quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably Porta Nuova in downtown Milan and FieraMilano in the suburb of Rho. In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the Citylife regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the Isozaki Arata\u2014when completed, the tallest building in Italy, the twisted Hadid Tower, and the curved Libeskind Tower.\nTwo business districts dominate Milan's skyline: \"Porta Nuova\" in the north-east (boroughs No. 9 and 2) and \"CityLife\" (borough No. 8) in the north-west part of the commune. The tallest buildings include the Unicredit Tower at 231 m (though only 162 m without the spire), and the 209 m Allianz Tower, a 50-story tower.\nParks and gardens.\nThe largest parks in the central area of Milan are Sempione Park, at the north-western edge, and Montanelli Gardens, situated north-east of the city. English-style Sempione Park, built in 1890, contains the Civic Arena, the Civic Aquarium of Milan (which is the third oldest aquarium in Europe), a steel lattice panoramic tower, an art exhibition centre, a Japanese garden and a public library. The Montanelli gardens, created in the 18th century, hosts the Natural History Museum of Milan and a planetarium. Slightly away from the city centre, heading east, Forlanini Park is characterised by a large pond and a few preserved shacks which remind of the area's agricultural past. In recent years Milan's authorities pledged to develop its green areas: they planned to create twenty new urban parks and extend the already existing ones, and announced plans to plant three million trees by 2030.\nAlso notable is Monte Stella (\"Starmount\"), also informally called Montagnetta di San Siro (\"Little mountain of San Siro\"), an artificial hill and surrounding city park in Milan. The hill was created using the debris from the buildings that were bombed during World War II, as well as from the last remnants of the Spanish walls of the city, demolished in the mid 20th century. Even at only height, the hill provides a panoramic view of the city and hinterland, and in a clear day, the Alps and Apennines can be distinguished from atop. A notable area of the park is called \"Giardino dei Giusti\" (Garden of the Just), which is a memorial to distinguished opponents of genocide and crimes against humanity; each tree in the garden is dedicated to one such person. Notable people who have been dedicated a tree in the Giardino dei Giusti include Moshe Bejski, Andrej Sakharov, Svetlana Broz, and Pietro Kuciukian.\nThe Orto Botanico di Brera a botanical garden located behind Palazzo Brera at Via Brera 28 in the center of Milan, is another major park in the city. The garden consists primarily of rectangular flower-beds, trimmed in brick, with elliptical ponds from the 18th century, and specula and greenhouse from the 19th century (now used by the Academy of Fine Arts). It contains one of the oldest \"Ginkgo biloba\" trees in Europe, as well as mature specimens of \"Firmiana platanifolia\", \"Juglans nigra\", \"Pterocarya fraxinifolia\", and \"Tilia\".\nIn addition, even though Milan is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Italy, it is surrounded by a belt of green areas and features numerous gardens even in its very centre. The farmlands and woodlands north (Parco Nord Milano since 1975) and south (Parco Agricolo Sud Milano since 1990) of the urban area have been protected as regional parks. West of the city, the Parco delle Cave (Sand pit park) has been established on a neglected site where gravel and sand used to be extracted, featuring artificial lakes and woods.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2025[ [update]], 1,366,155 people live in Milan's city proper, while 3,247,623 people live in the province-level municipality. The population of Milan today is lower than its historical peak. With rapid industrialization in post-war years, the population of Milan peaked at 1,743,427 in 1973. Thereafter, during the following decades, about one third of the population moved to the outer belt of suburbs and new satellite settlements that grew around the city proper.\nToday, Milan's conurbation extends well beyond the borders of the city proper and of its special-status provincial authority: its contiguous built-up urban area was home to 5.27 million people in 2015, while its wider metropolitan area, the largest in Italy and fourth largest in the EU, is estimated to have a population in excess of 6.1 million as of 2025.\nForeign residents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2024[ [update]], some 269,397 foreign residents lived in the municipality of Milan, representing 19.6% of the total resident population. These figures suggest that the immigrant population has more than doubled in the last 15 years.\nAfter World War II, Milan experienced two main waves of immigration: the first, dating from the 1950s to the early 1970s, saw a large influx of migrants from poorer and rural areas within Italy; the second, starting from the late 1980s, has been characterized by the preponderance of foreign-born immigrants.\nThe early period coincided with the so-called Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and underdeveloped Southern Italy.\nDecades of continuing high immigration have made the city one of the most cosmopolitan and multicultural in Italy. Immigrants came mainly from Africa (in particular Eritreans, Egyptians, Moroccans, Senegalese and Nigerian), and the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (notably Albanians, Romanians, Ukrainians, Macedonians, Moldovans, and Russians), in addition to a growing number of Asians (in particular Chinese, Sri Lankans and Filipinos) and Latin Americans (Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the total).\nMilan is home to the second-largest Far East Asian community in Europe after Paris, with the Philippines and China, making up about a quarter of its foreign population (around 76,000 out of 301,000 in 2023). Another 4,000 foreigners come from other East Asian countries; notably, Milan hosts more than 2,000 Japanese nationals and 1,000 Koreans, excluding those who also hold Italian citizenship. Foreigners holding East-Asian citizenship thus make up around 5.36% of the city's population. Milan notably hosts the oldest and largest (along with Prato) Chinese community in Italy, with around 37,000 people in 2023, excluding Italians of Chinese descent such as immigrants who have acquired Italian citizenship or their descendants. Situated in the 8th district, and centered on Via Paolo Sarpi, an important commercial avenue, the Milanese Chinatown was originally established in the 1920s by immigrants from Wencheng County, in the Zhejiang, and used to operate small textile and leather workshops. Milan also hosts a Japanese International school as well as various Chinese schools throughout the city.\nThe city also hosts an historical African community originating from the Horn of Africa. As of 2023[ [update]], there were around 4,000 Eritrean, Ethiopian or Somali-born people living in Milan, the overwhelming majority being double-citizens of Italy, and not counting second and third generation migrants. The three countries were all Italian colonies at a time, from 1869 (Eritrea) to 1943 (East African campaign). Due to the historical links with Italy, a small community originating from the Horn of Africa has established its presence near Porta Venezia district starting from the 1970s. It is estimated that in the \"Asmarina\" area (Little Asmara) there are around 2,000-2,500 people from the Horn of Africa still living there, along with multiple restaurants, institutes as well as an Ethiopian Church.\nAnother notable area with a large presence of foreign residents coming from a specific country is the so-called \"quadrilatero di San Siro\" or \"San Siro casbah\" in reference to the large Arab-speaking population living in the area. The neighbourhood, consisting of around 6,000 municipal flats, is characterised by the fact of having an estimated 25% share of Arab-speaking inhabitants, mostly hailing from Egypt. The area has often been described as a \"banlieue\" within Milan and has historically had a higher crime rate than the rest of the city. Nevertheless, in recent years many projects have been presented so as to mitigate the marginalisation of its inhabitants. Other areas hosting large Arabic-speaking populations include Maciachini-Imbonati, Corvetto, Comasina and piazza Arcole.\nMilan has a substantial English-speaking community (around 4,500 US citizens, British, Irish and Australian expatriates, excluding double-citizens), and several English schools and English-language publications, such as \"Hello Milano\", \"Where Milano\" and \"Easy Milano\".\nReligion.\nMilan's population, like that of Italy as a whole, is mostly Catholic. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Milan. Greater Milan is also home to Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist communities.\nMilan has been a Christian-majority city since the late Roman Empire. Its religious history was marked by the figure of St. Ambrose, whose heritage includes the Ambrosian Rite (Italian: \"Rito ambrosiano\"), used by some five million Catholics in the greater part of the Archdiocese of Milan, which consider the largest in Europe. The Rite varies slightly from the canonical Roman Rite liturgy, with differences in the mass, liturgical year (Lent starts four days later than in the Roman Rite), baptism, rite of funerals, priest clothes and sacred music (use of the Ambrosian chant rather than Gregorian).\nIn addition, the city is home to the largest Orthodox community in Italy. Lombardy is the seat of at least 78 Orthodox parishes and monasteries, the vast majority of them located in the area of Milan. The main Romanian Orthodox church in Milan is the Catholic church of Our Lady of Victory (Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria), currently granted for use to the local Romanian community. Similarly, the point of reference for the followers of the Russian Orthodox Church is the Catholic church of San Vito in Pasquirolo.\nThe Jewish community of Milan is the second largest in Italy after Rome, with about 10,000 members, mainly Sephardi. The main city synagogue, Hechal David u-Mordechai Temple, was built by architect Luca Beltrami in 1892 and is also the community's main headquarters, is located in Via della Guastalla. The interior was renovated in 1997.\nMilan hosts also one of the largest Muslim communities in Italy, and the city saw the construction of the country's first new mosque featuring a dome and minaret, since the destruction of the ancient mosques of Lucera in the year 1300. In 2014 the City Council agreed on the construction of a new mosque amid bitter political debate, since it is strenuously opposed by right-wing parties such as the Northern League. As of 2018[ [update]], the Muslim population is estimated at 9% of the city's population.\nCurrently, accurate statistics on the Hindu and Sikh presence in Milan metro area are not available; however, various sources estimate that about 40% of the total Indian population living in Italy, or about 50,000 individuals, reside in Lombardy, where a number of Hindu and Sikh temples exist and where they form the largest such communities in Europe after the ones in Britain.\nEconomy.\nWhereas Rome is Italy's political and cultural capital, Milan is the country's industrial and financial heart, and it is widely considered the economic capital of Italy and one of the wealthiest cities in the country in terms of per-capita GDP. According to Eurostat, Milan's metropolitan region GDP was \u20ac228\u00a0billion ($265\u00a0billion) in 2024, while the whole Lombardy's gross regional product was \u20ac490 billion ($568\u00a0billion), the second-largest among EU regions.\nMilan is a member of the Blue Banana corridor and of the Four Motors for Europe among Europe's economic leaders. The urban region of Milan is home to about 45% of businesses in the Lombardy region and more than 8 percent of all businesses in Italy, including three \"Fortune\" 500 companies. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Milan was the 11th-most-expensive city in Europe and the 22nd-most-expensive city in the world in 2019. Via Monte Napoleone has been defined as the most-expensive street in the world (2024).\nMilan is one of the fashion capitals of the world, where the sector can count on 12,000 companies, 800 show rooms and 6,000 sales outlets; the city hosts the headquarters of global fashion houses such as Armani, Bottega Veneta, Costume National, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Dsquared\u00b2, Etro, Jil Sander, Loro Piana, Luxottica, Marni, Moncler, Moschino, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Trussardi and Zegna and four weeks a year are dedicated to fashion events.\nSince the late 1800s, the area of Milan has been a major industrial and manufacturing center. Alfa Romeo automobile company and Falck steel group employed thousands of workers in the city until the closure of their sites in Arese in 2004 and Sesto San Giovanni in 1995.\nOther global industrial companies, such as Edison, Prysmian Group, Riva Group, Saras, Saipem, Luxottica, Pirelli, UniCredit and Techint, maintain their headquarters and significant employment in the city and its suburbs. Other relevant industries active in metro Milan include chemicals (e.g. Mapei, Versalis, Tamoil Italy), home appliances (e.g. Candy), hospitality (UNA Hotels &amp; Resorts), food &amp; beverages (e.g. Bertolli, Campari), machinery, medical technologies (e.g. Amplifon, Bracco), plastics and textiles. The construction (e.g. Webuild), retail (e.g. Esselunga, La Rinascente) and utilities (e.g. A2A, Edison S.p.A., Snam, Sorgenia) sectors are also large employers in the Greater Milan. Other major companies based in Milan include Fininvest, TIM Group and Banco BPM.\nThe main national insurance companies and banking groups (for a total of 198 companies) and over forty foreign insurance and banking companies are located in the city, as well as a number of asset management companies, including Anima Holding, Azimut Holding, ARCA SGR and Eurizon Capital. The Associazione Bancaria Italiana representing the Italian banking system, and Milan Stock Exchange (225 companies listed on the stock exchange) are both located in the city. Porta Nuova, the main business district of Milan and one of the most important in Europe, hosts the Italian headquarters of numerous global companies, such as Accenture, Axa, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Celgene, China Construction Bank, Deutsche Bank, FM Global, Herbalife, Amazon, Iliad, KPMG, Maire Tecnimont, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Panasonic, Pirelli, Ubisoft, Shire, Tata Consultancy Services, Telecom Italia, UniCredit and UnipolSai.\nOther large multinational service companies, such as Allianz, Generali, Alleanza Assicurazioni and PwC, have their headquarters in the CityLife business district, a new development project designed by prominent modernist architects Zaha Hadid, Daniel Liebskind and Arata Isozaki.\nThe city is home to numerous media and advertising agencies, national newspapers and telecommunication companies, including both the public service broadcaster RAI and private television companies like Mediaset and Sky Italia. In addition, it hosts the headquarters of the largest Italian publishing companies, such as Feltrinelli, Giunti Editore, Messaggerie Italiane, Mondadori, RCS Media Group and Rusconi Libri. Milan has also seen a rapid increase in the presence of IT companies, with both domestic and international companies such as Altavista, Google, Italtel, Lycos, Microsoft, Virgilio and Yahoo! establishing their Italian operations in the city.\nThe city is also a global hub for event management and trade fairs. Fiera Milano operates the most important trade fair organiser in Italy and the world's fourth-largest exhibition hall in Rho, were international exhibitions like Milan Furniture Fair, EICMA, EMO take place on 400,000 square metres of exhibition areas with more than 4\u00a0million visitors in 2018.\nTourism.\nTourism is an increasingly important part of the city's economy: with 8.81\u00a0million registered international arrivals in 2018 (up 9.92% on the previous year), Milan ranked as the world's 15th-most-visited city. One source has 56% of international visitors to Milan are from Europe, 44% of the city's tourists are Italian, and 56% are from abroad. The most important European Union markets are the United Kingdom (16%), Germany (9%) and France (6%). Most of the visitors who come from the United States to the city go on business matters, while Chinese and Japanese tourists mainly take up the leisure segment. Milan is one of the international tourism destinations, appearing among the forty most visited cities in the world, ranking second in Italy after Rome, fifth in Europe and sixteenth in the world.\nThe city boasts several popular tourist attractions, such as the Milan Cathedral and Piazza del Duomo, the Teatro alla Scala, the San Siro Stadium, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the Castello Sforzesco, the Pinacoteca di Brera and the Via Montenapoleone. Most tourists visit sights such as Milan Cathedral, the Castello Sforzesco and the Teatro alla Scala; however, other main sights such as the Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio, the Navigli and the Brera district are less visited and prove to be less popular. The city also has numerous hotels, including the ultra-luxurious Town House Galleria, which is the world's first seven-star hotel according to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance (\"five-star superior luxury\" according to state law, however) and one of The Leading Hotels of the World.\nCulture.\nMuseums and art galleries.\nMilan is home to many cultural institutions, museums and art galleries, that account for about a tenth of the national total of visitors and receipts. The Pinacoteca di Brera is one of Milan's most important art galleries. It contains one of the foremost collections of Italian painting, including masterpieces such as the \"Brera Madonna\" by Piero della Francesca. The Castello Sforzesco hosts numerous art collections and exhibitions, especially statues, ancient arms and furnitures, as well as the Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco, with an art collection including Michelangelo's last sculpture, the \"Rondanini Piet\u00e0\", Andrea Mantegna's \"Trivulzio Madonna\" and Leonardo da Vinci's \"Codex Trivulzianus\" manuscript. The Castello complex also includes The Museum of Ancient Art, The Furniture Museum, The Museum of Musical Instruments and the Applied Arts Collection, The Egyptian and Prehistoric sections of the Archaeological Museum and the Achille Bertarelli Print Collection (Civica Raccolta delle Stampe Bertarelli).\nMilan's figurative art flourished in the Middle Ages, and with the Visconti family being major patrons of the arts, the city became an important centre of Gothic art and architecture (Milan Cathedral being the city's most formidable work of Gothic architecture). Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the \"Virgin of the Rocks\" for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and \"The Last Supper\" for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.\nThe city was affected by the Baroque in the 17th and 18th centuries, and hosted numerous formidable artists, architects and painters of that period, such as Caravaggio and Francesco Hayez, which several important works are hosted in Brera Academy. The Museum of Risorgimento is specialised on the history of Italian unification Its collections include iconic paintings like Baldassare Verazzi's \"Episode from the Five Days\" and Francesco Hayez's 1840 \" of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria\". The Triennale is a design museum and events venue located in Palazzo dell'Arte, in Sempione Park. It hosts exhibitions and events highlighting contemporary Italian design, urban planning, architecture, music and media arts, emphasising the relationship between art and industry.\nMilan in the 20th century was the epicentre of the futurist artistic movement. Filippo Marinetti, the founder of Italian Futurism wrote in his 1909 \"\"Manifesto of Futurism\" (in Italian, \"Manifesto Futuristico\"), that Milan was \"grande...tradizionale e futurista\" (\"grand...traditional and futuristic\"\", in English). Umberto Boccioni was also an important Futurism artist who worked in the city. Today, Milan remains a major international hub of modern and contemporary art, with numerous modern art galleries. The Modern Art Gallery, situated in the Royal Villa, hosts collections of Italian and European painting from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. The Museo del Novecento, situated in the Palazzo dell'Arengario, is one of the most important art galleries in Italy about 20th-century art; of particular relevance are the sections dedicated to Futurism, Spatialism and Arte povera. In the early 1990s architect David Chipperfield was invited to convert the premises of the former Ansaldo Factory into a Museum. Museo delle Culture (MUDEC) opened in April 2015. The Gallerie di Piazza Scala, a modern and contemporary museum located in Piazza della Scala in the Palazzo Brentani and the Palazzo Anguissola, hosts 195 artworks from the collections of Fondazione Cariplo with a strong representation of nineteenth-century Lombard painters and sculptors, including Antonio Canova and Umberto Boccioni. A new section was opened in the Palazzo della Banca Commerciale Italiana in 2012. Other private ventures dedicated to contemporary art include the exhibiting spaces of the Prada Foundation and HangarBicocca. The Nicola Trussardi Foundation is renewed for organising temporary exhibition in venues around the city. Milan is also home to many public art projects, with a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally renowned artists, including Arman, Kengiro Azuma, Francesco Barzaghi, Alberto Burri, Pietro Cascella, Maurizio Cattelan, Leonardo da Vinci, Giorgio de Chirico, Kris Ruhs, Emilio Isgr\u00f2, Fausto Melotti, Joan Mir\u00f3, Carlo Mo, Claes Oldenburg, Igor Mitoraj, Gianfranco Pardi, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Carlo Ramous, Aldo Rossi, Aligi Sassu, Giuseppe Spagnulo and Domenico Trentacoste.\nMusic.\nMilan is considered an international capital of the performing arts. The city hosts La Scala opera house, widely considered one of the world's most prestigious, with a 200-year history of premieres of major operas, such as \"Nabucco\" by Giuseppe Verdi in 1842, \"La Gioconda\" by Amilcare Ponchielli, \"Madama Butterfly\" by Giacomo Puccini in 1904, \"Turandot\" by Puccini in 1926, and more recently \"Teneke\", by Fabio Vacchi in 2007. Other relevant theatres in Milan include Teatro degli Arcimboldi, Teatro Dal Verme, Teatro Lirico. The city is also the seat of a renowned symphony orchestra and musical conservatory, and has been, throughout history, a major centre for musical composition: numerous famous composers and musicians such as Gioseppe Caimo, Simon Boyleau, Hoste da Reggio, Giuseppe Verdi, Giulio Gatti-Casazza, Paolo Cherici and Alice Edun lived and worked in Milan. The city is also the birthplace of many modern ensembles and bands, including I Camaleonti, Camerata Mediolanense, Gli Spioni, Dynamis Ensemble, Elio e le Storie Tese, Krisma, Premiata Forneria Marconi, Quartetto Cetra, Stormy Six, Le Vibrazioni and Lacuna Coil.\nFashion and design.\nMilan is widely regarded as a global capital in industrial design, fashion and architecture. In the 1950s and 60s, as the main industrial centre of Italy and one of Europe's most dynamic cities, Milan became a world capital of design and architecture. There was such a revolutionary change that Milan's fashion exports accounted for US$726\u00a0million in 1952, and by 1955 that number grew to US$72.5\u00a0billion. Modern skyscrapers, such as the Pirelli Tower and the Torre Velasca were built, and artists such as Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni gathered in the city. Today, Milan is still particularly well known for its high-quality furniture and interior design industry. The city is home to FieraMilano, Europe's largest permanent trade exhibition, and Salone Internazionale del Mobile, one of the most prestigious international furniture and design fairs.\nMilan is also regarded as one of the fashion capitals of the world, along with New York City, Paris and London. Milan is synonymous with the Italian pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter industry, as many of the most famous Italian fashion brands, such as Valentino, Versace, Prada, Armani and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, are headquartered in the city. Numerous international fashion labels also operate shops in Milan. Furthermore, the city hosts the Milan Fashion Week twice a year, one of the most important events in the international fashion system. Milan's main upscale fashion district, \"quadrilatero della moda\", is home to the city's most prestigious shopping streets (Via Monte Napoleone, Via della Spiga, Via Sant'Andrea, Via Manzoni and Corso Venezia), in addition to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the world's oldest shopping malls. The term \"sciura\" encapsulates the look and culture of fashionable, elderly Milanese women.\nLanguages and literature.\nIn the late 18th century and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The Enlightenment found here a fertile ground. Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria, with his famous \"Dei delitti e delle pene\", and Count Pietro Verri, with the periodical \"Il Caff\u00e8\" were able to exert a considerable influence over the new middle-class culture.\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the Romantic movement made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus Romantic poetry. Additionally, Giuseppe Parini and Ugo Foscolo published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship.\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, Alessandro Manzoni wrote his novel \"The Betrothed\", considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period Carlo Porta, reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in Lombard Language. The periodical \"Il Conciliatore\" published articles by Silvio Pellico, Giovanni Berchet, Ludovico di Breme, who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\nAfter the Unification of Italy in 1861, Milan retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus Realism and Naturalism gave birth to prewar Italian movement of \"Verismo\" in Southern Italy, its greatest \"Verista\" novelist Giovanni Verga formed in Sicily who wrote his most important books in Milan.\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2\u00a0million people in Northern Italy can speak the Milanese dialect or other Western Lombard variation.\nMedia.\nMilan is an important national and international media center. RCS, a major international multimedia publishing group, is the publisher of both (established in 1876, it is one of the oldest Italian newspapers) and (a daily dedicated to sports, and the most widely-read in Italy). Other local dailies are the general broadsheets , , the Catholic newspaper , and , a daily business newspaper owned by Confindustria (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include and \"Metro\". Milan is also home to many architecture, art and fashion periodicals, including \"Abitare\", \"Casabella\", \"Domus\", \"Flash Art\", \"Gioia\", \"Grazia\" and \"Vogue Italia\". \"Panorama\" and \"Oggi\", two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan. Several major television networks have their national headquarters in Milan and its metropolitan area, including Mediaset (the largest commercial broadcaster in the country), Sky Italia, the Italian division of Paramount Skydance, Telelombardia. National radio stations based in Milan include Radio DeeJay, Radio 105 Network, R101 (Italy), Radio Popolare, RTL 102.5, Radio Capital and Virgin Radio Italia.\nCuisine.\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, butter than vegetable oil and features almost no tomato or fish. Milanese traditional dishes include \"cotoletta alla milanese\", a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese Wiener Schnitzel). Other typical dishes are \"cassoeula\" (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with Savoy cabbage), \"ossobuco\" (braised veal shank served with a condiment called \"gremolata\"), \"risotto alla milanese\" (with saffron and beef marrow), \"busecca\" (stewed tripe with beans), \"mondeghili\" (meatballs made with leftover meat fried in butter) and \"brasato\" (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).\nSeason-related pastries include \"chiacchiere\" (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and \"tortelli\" (fried spherical cookies) for Carnival, \"colomba\" (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for Easter, \"pane dei morti\" (\"bread of the (Day of the) Dead\", cookies flavoured with cinnamon) for All Souls' Day and panettone for Christmas. The \"salame Milano\", a salami with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy.

{"id": "36517", "revid": "664832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36517", "title": "The Who", "text": "English rock band\nThe Who are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their classic lineup (1964\u20131978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. Considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th\u00a0century, their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesizers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as The Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top\u00a0ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\", \"My Generation\" (both 1965), \"Substitute\", \"I'm a Boy\", \"Happy Jack\" (all 1966) and \"Pictures of Lily\" (1967). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top ten single. The group's 1969 concept album \"Tommy\" included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success.\nFurther festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album \"Live at Leeds\" (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to \"Tommy\", \"Lifehouse\", was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album \"Who's Next\" (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, \"Quadrophenia\" (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of \"Tommy\" (1975). Following the release of \"The Who by Numbers\" (1975), they continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of \"Who Are You\" (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\nFormer Small Faces and Faces drummer Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring. In 1979, they released a film adaptation of \"Quadrophenia\" and the retrospective rockumentary \"The Kids Are Alright\". The early 1980s brought two more albums, \"Face Dances\" (1981) and \"It's Hard\" (1982), and more successful world tours, though Townshend became weary of the group during this time, and they officially split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 with Simon Phillips on drums, and a tour of \"Quadrophenia\" during 1996\u20131997 with Zak Starkey on drums. A full-time reunion began in 1999, with Starkey as drummer. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with \"Endless Wire\". Since Entwistle's death, The Who have continued to perform and tour officially as a duo of Daltrey and Townshend, augmented by various other musicians. Their twelfth album, \"Who\" was released in 2019 and supported with more touring.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe founding members of The Who, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle, grew up in Acton, London and attended Acton County Grammar School. Townshend's father, Cliff, played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the Royal Air Force during World War II, and both supported their son's interest in rock and roll. Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a trad jazz group; Entwistle also played French horn in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired Cliff Richard's d\u00e9but single, \"Move It\". Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of Duane Eddy. He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home. After Acton County, Townshend attended Ealing Art College, a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of The Who.\nDaltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from Shepherd's Bush, a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll. He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site. In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into The Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.\nDaltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours. In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist, Daltrey on rhythm guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals. The band played instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers. Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them\". Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by Doug Sandom, though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.\nDawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey and was briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, before Daltrey moved to lead vocals. Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce, who started booking the band as a support act. The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including Screaming Lord Sutch, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, Mick Green, who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style. Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument, playing melodies. In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours, and changed their name. Townshend and his house-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including \"No One\" and \"the Group\". Townshend preferred \"the Hair\", and Barnes liked \"The Who\" because it \"had a pop punch\". Daltrey chose \"The Who\" the next morning.\n1964\u20131978.\nEarly career.\nBy the time the Detours had become The Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.\nDuring a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon. Moon grew up in Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to The Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.\nThe Who changed managers to Peter Meaden. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing mod movement in Britain which involved fashion, scooters and music genres such as rhythm and blues, soul and modern jazz. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in mod clothes, secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the lyrics for both sides of their single \"Zoot Suit\"/\"I'm the Face\" to appeal to mods. The tune for \"Zoot Suit\" was \"Misery\" by the Dynamics, and \"I'm the Face\" borrowed from Slim Harpo's \"I Got Love If You Want It\". Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed to reach the top 50 and the band reverted to calling themselves The Who. The group\u00a0\u2013 none of whom played their instruments conventionally\u00a0\u2013 began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his microphone cable as a whip on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed machine-gunning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion, or stood with his arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed \"the Bird Man\".\nMeaden was replaced as manager by two filmmakers, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. They were looking for a young, unsigned rock group that they could make a film about, and had seen the band at the Railway Hotel in Wealdstone, which had become a regular venue for them. Lambert related to Townshend and his art school background, and encouraged him to write songs. In August, Lambert and Stamp made a promotional film featuring the group and their audience at the Railway. The band changed their set towards soul, rhythm and blues and Motown covers, and created the slogan \"Maximum R&amp;B\".\nIn June 1964, during a performance at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke the head of his guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of The Who's live set.\nFirst singles and \"My Generation\".\nBy late\u00a01964, The Who were becoming popular in London's Marquee Club, and a rave review of their live act appeared in \"Melody Maker\". Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer Shel Talmy, who had produced the Kinks. Townshend had written a song, \"I Can't Explain\", that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company, and sold the recording to the US arm of Decca Records, which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on Brunswick Records, one of UK Decca's labels for US artists. \"I Can't Explain\" was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in Marble Arch with the Ivy League on backing vocals, and Jimmy Page played fuzz guitar on the B-side, \"Bald Headed Woman\".\n\"I Can't Explain\" became popular with pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and BBC Radio played little pop music. The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme \"Ready Steady Go!\" Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding \"typical teens\", and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club. Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10. In early 1965, The Who made their first appearance on the television music show, \"Top of the Pops\", at the BBC's Dickenson Road Studios in Manchester, with \"I Can't Explain\".\nThe follow-up single, \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\", by Townshend and Daltrey, features guitar noises such as pick sliding, toggle switching and feedback, which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top\u00a010 in the UK and was used as the theme song to \"Ready Steady Go!\"\nThe transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&amp;B covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.\nThe next single, \"My Generation\", followed in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal stutter to simulate the speech of a mod on amphetamines, and two key changes. Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics \"Hope I die before I get old\" were not meant to be taken literally. Peaking at No.\u00a02, \"My Generation\" is the group's highest-charting single in the UK. The debut album \"My Generation\" was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and \"The Kids Are Alright\", the album has several James Brown covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured.\nAfter \"My Generation\", The Who fell out with Talmy, which meant an abrupt end to their recording contract. The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002. The Who were signed to Robert Stigwood's label, Reaction, and released \"Substitute\". Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of the Rolling Stones's \"19th Nervous Breakdown\". It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic twelve-string guitar. Talmy took legal action over the B-side, \"Instant Party\", and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, \"Waltz for a Pig\", was recorded by the Graham Bond Organisation under the pseudonym \"The Who Orchestra\".\nIn 1966 The Who released \"I'm a Boy\", about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called \"Quads\"; \"Happy Jack\"; and an EP, \"Ready Steady Who\", that tied in with their regular appearances on \"Ready Steady Go!\" The group continued to have conflict; on 20 May, Moon and Entwistle were late to a gig having been on the \"Ready Steady Go!\" set with the Beach Boys' Bruce Johnston. During \"My Generation\", Townshend attacked Moon with his guitar; Moon suffered a black eye and bruises, and he and Entwistle left the band, but changed their minds and rejoined a week later. Moon kept looking for other work, and Jeff Beck had him play drums on his song \"Beck's Bolero\" (with Page, John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins) because he was \"trying to get Keith out of The Who\".\n\"A Quick One\" and \"The Who Sell Out\".\nTo alleviate financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed \"Boris the Spider\" and \"Whiskey Man\" and found a niche role as second songwriter. The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, \"A Quick One, While He's Away\". The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven. The album was titled \"A Quick One\" (\"Happy Jack\" in the US), and reached No.\u00a04 in the UK charts. It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single \"Pictures of Lily\".\nBy 1966, \"Ready Steady Go!\" had ended, the mod movement was becoming unfashionable, and The Who found themselves in competition on the London circuit with groups including Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter Frank Barsalona for a short package tour in New York. The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received, and led to their first major US appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the hippie movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act, and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with The Who winning the argument. The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full Marshall stack. According to biographer Tony Fletcher, Hendrix sounded \"so much better than The Who it was embarrassing\". The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and \"Happy Jack\" reached the top 30.\nThe group followed Monterey with a US tour supporting Herman's Hermits. The Hermits were a straightforward pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes. They bonded with Moon, who was excited to learn that cherry bombs were legal to purchase in Alabama. Moon acquired a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour, with a particular interest in blowing up toilets. Entwistle said the first cherry bomb they tried \"blew a hole in the suitcase \"and\" the chair\". Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: \"[A]ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful\". After a gig in Flint, Michigan on Moon's 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth. Daltrey later said that the tour brought the band closer, and as the support act, they could turn up and perform a short show without any major responsibilities.\nAfter the Hermits tour, The Who recorded their next single, \"I Can See for Miles\", which Townshend had written in 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well. Townshend called it \"the ultimate Who record\", and was disappointed it reached only No.\u00a010 in the UK. It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.\u00a09. The group toured the US again with Eric Burdon and the Animals, including an appearance on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", miming to \"I Can See For Miles\" and \"My Generation\". Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by a flying piece of a cymbal. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.\nThe next album was \"The Who Sell Out\"\u00a0\u2013 a concept album parodying pirate radio, which had been outlawed in August 1967 by the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967. It included humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, a mini rock opera called \"Rael\", and \"I Can See For Miles\". The Who declared themselves a pop art group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded a wide variety of radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the American Cancer Society, in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture. Townshend stated, \"We don't change offstage. We live pop art\". Later that year, Lambert and Stamp formed a record label, Track Records, with distribution by Polydor. As well as signing Hendrix, Track became the imprint for all The Who's UK output until the mid-1970s.\nThe group started 1968 by touring Australia and New Zealand with the Small Faces. The groups had trouble with the local authorities and the \"New Zealand Truth\" called them \"unwashed, foul-smelling, booze-swilling no-hopers\". After an incident that took place on a flight to Sydney, the band were briefly arrested in Melbourne and then forced to leave the country; Prime Minister John Gorton sent a telegram to The Who telling them never to return to Australia. The Who would not return to Australia again until 2004. They continued to tour across the US and Canada during the first half of the year.\n\"Tommy\", Woodstock, Isle of Wight and \"Live at Leeds\".\nBy 1968, The Who had started to attract attention in the underground press. Townshend had stopped using drugs and became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. In August, he gave an interview to \"Rolling Stone\" editor Jann Wenner describing in detail the plot of a new album project and its relationship to Baba's teachings. The album went through several names during recording, including \"Deaf Dumb and Blind Boy\" and \"Amazing Journey\"; Townshend settled on \"Tommy\" for the album about the life of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and his attempt to communicate with others. Some songs, such as \"Welcome\" and \"Amazing Journey\", were inspired by Baba's teaching, and others came from observations within the band. \"Sally Simpson\" is about a fan who tried to climb on stage at a gig by the Doors that they attended and \"Pinball Wizard\" was written so that \"New York Times\" journalist Nik Cohn, a pinball enthusiast, would give the album a good review. Townshend later said, \"I wanted the story of \"Tommy\" to have several levels\u00a0... a rock singles level and a bigger concept level\", containing the spiritual message he wanted as well as being entertaining. The album was projected for a Christmas 1968 release but recording stalled after Townshend decided to make a double album to cover the story in sufficient depth.\nBy the end of the year, 18 months of touring had led to a well-rehearsed and tight live band, which was evident when they performed \"A Quick One While He's Away\" at \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\" television special. The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast. The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of \"Tommy\", which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends. Lambert was a key figure in keeping the group focused and getting the album completed, and typed up a script to help them understand the story and how the songs fitted together.\nThe album was released in May with the accompanying single, \"Pinball Wizard\", a debut performance at Ronnie Scott's, and a tour, playing most of the new album live. \"Tommy\" sold 200,000 copies in the US in its first two weeks, and was a critical success, \"Life\" saying, \"for sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, \"Tommy\" outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio\". \"Melody Maker\" declared: \"Surely The Who are now the band against which all others are to be judged\". Daltrey had significantly improved as a singer, and set a template for rock singers in the 1970s by growing his hair long and wearing open shirts on stage. Townshend had taken to wearing a boiler suit and Doctor Martens shoes.\nIn August, The Who performed at the Woodstock Festival, despite being reluctant and demanding $13,000 up front. Pete Townshend gave journalist Robert Christgau a ride to Woodstock. The group were scheduled to appear on Saturday night, 16 August, but the festival ran late and they did not take to the stage until 5am on Sunday; they played most of \"Tommy\". During their performance, Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman interrupted the set to give a political speech about the arrest of John Sinclair; Townshend kicked him off stage, shouting: \"Fuck off my fucking stage!\" During \"See Me, Feel Me\", the sun rose almost as if on cue; Entwistle later said, \"God was our lighting man\". At the end, Townshend threw his guitar into the audience. The set was professionally recorded and filmed, and portions appear on the \"Woodstock\" film, \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\" and \"The Kids Are Alright\". The Who were later critical of the festival: Roadie John \"Wiggie\" Wolff, who arranged the band's payment, described it as \"a shambles\"; Daltrey declared it as \"the worst gig [they] ever played\"; and Townshend said, \"I thought the whole of America had gone mad\". \nA more enjoyable appearance came a few weeks later at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival in England, which Townshend described as \"a great concert for\" the band. According to Townshend, at the end of the Isle of Wight gig the field was covered in rubbish left by fans (which the band's roadies helped to clear up), which inspired the line \"teenage wasteland\" from their single \"Baba O'Riley\".\nBy 1970, The Who were widely considered one of the best and most popular live rock bands; Chris Charlesworth described their concerts as \"leading to a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about\". They decided a live album would help demonstrate how different the sound at their gigs was to \"Tommy\", and set about listening to the hours of recordings they had accumulated. Townshend baulked at the prospect of doing so, and demanded that all the tapes be burned. Instead, they booked two shows, one in Leeds on 14 February, and one in Hull the following day, with the intention of recording a live album. Technical problems from the Hull gig resulted in the Leeds gig being used, which became \"Live at Leeds\". The album is viewed by several critics including \"The Independent\", \"The Telegraph\" and the BBC, as one of the best live rock albums of all time.\nThe \"Tommy\" tour included shows in European opera houses and saw The Who become the first rock act to play at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. In March The Who released the UK top\u00a020 hit \"The Seeker\", continuing a theme of issuing singles separate to albums. Townshend wrote the song to commemorate the common man, as a contrast to the themes on \"Tommy\". The tour included their second appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival. A record attendance in England which the \"Guinness Book of Records\" estimated at between 600,000 and 700,000 people, The Who began their set at 2:00 A.M. on Sunday 30 August.\n\"Lifehouse\" and \"Who's Next\".\n\"Tommy\" secured The Who's future, and made them millionaires. The group reacted in different ways\u00a0\u2013 Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was at odds with Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously.\nDuring the latter part of 1970, Townshend conceived a follow-up \"Tommy\": \"Lifehouse\", which was to be a multi-media project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned \"Lifehouse\". Entwistle was the first member of the group to release a solo album, \"Smash Your Head Against the Wall\", in May 1971.\nRecording at the Record Plant in New York City in March 1971 was abandoned when Lambert's addiction to hard drugs interfered with his ability to produce. The group restarted with Glyn Johns in April. The album was mostly \"Lifehouse\" material, with one unrelated song by Entwistle, \"My Wife\", and was released as \"Who's Next\" in August. The album reached No.\u00a01 in the UK and No.\u00a04 in the US. \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to \"Baba O'Riley\" was programmed based on Meher Baba's vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus. The album was a critical and commercial success, and has been certified 3\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. The Who continued to issue \"Lifehouse\"-related material over the next few years, including the singles \"Let's See Action\", \"Join Together\" and \"Relay\".\nThe band went back on tour, and \"Baba O' Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" became live favourites. In November they performed at the newly renovated Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights, continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described The Who as \"the Greatest Show on Earth\". The tour was slightly disrupted at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on 12 December when Moon passed out over his kit after overdosing on brandy and barbiturates. He recovered and completed the gig, playing to his usual strength.\n\"Quadrophenia\", \"Tommy\" film, and \"The Who by Numbers\".\nAfter touring \"Who's Next\", and needing time to write a follow-up, Townshend insisted that The Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group activity until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, \"Rock Is Dead\u2014Long Live Rock!\", but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, and a desire to party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, \"Lambert &amp; Stamp\". Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of \"Tommy\" with Lou Reizner.\nBy 1973, The Who turned to recording the album \"Quadrophenia\" about mod and its subculture, set against clashes with Rockers in early 1960s Britain. The story is about a boy named Jimmy, who undergoes a personality crisis, and his relationship with his family, friends and mod culture. The music features four themes, reflecting the four personalities of The Who. Townshend played multi-tracked synthesizers, and Entwistle played several overdubbed horn parts. By the time the album was being recorded, relationships between the band and Lambert and Stamp had broken down irreparably, and Bill Curbishley replaced them. The album reached No.\u00a02 in both the UK and US.\nThe Quadrophenia tour started in Stoke on Trent in October and was immediately beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add Joe Cocker's keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". The technology was not sophisticated enough to deal with the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold. At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an \"oldies\" set, at the end of which Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. \"The Independent\" described this gig as one of the worst of all time. The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and during \"Magic Bus\". Townshend asked the audience, \"Can anyone play the drums?\u00a0\u2013 I mean somebody good\". An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.\nBy 1974, work had begun in earnest on a \"Tommy\" film. Stigwood suggested Ken Russell as director, whose previous work Townshend had admired. The film featured a star-studded cast, including the band members. David Essex auditioned for the title role, but the band persuaded Daltrey to take it. The cast included Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Eric Clapton, Tina Turner, Elton John and Jack Nicholson. Townshend and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for most of the year, handling the bulk of the instrumentation. Moon had moved to Los Angeles, so they used session drummers, including Kenney Jones (who would later join The Who). Elton John used his own band for \"Pinball Wizard\". Filming was from April until August. 1,500\u00a0extras appeared in the \"Pinball Wizard\" sequence.\nThe film premiered on 18 March 1975 to a standing ovation. Townshend was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. \"Tommy\" was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but not in the main competition. It won the award for Rock Movie of the Year in the First Annual Rock Music Awards and generated over $2\u00a0million in its first month. The soundtrack reached number\u00a0two on the \"Billboard\" charts.\nWork on \"Tommy\" took up most of 1974, and live performances by The Who were restricted to a show in May at the Valley, the home of Charlton Athletic, in front of 80,000 fans, and a few dates at Madison Square Garden in June. Towards the end of the year, the group released the out-takes album \"Odds &amp; Sods\", which featured several songs from the aborted \"Lifehouse\" project.\nIn 1975, Daltrey and Townshend disagreed about the band's future and criticised each other via interviews in the music paper \"New Musical Express\". Daltrey was grateful that The Who had saved him from a career as a sheet-metal worker and was unhappy at Townshend not playing well; Townshend felt the commitment of the group prevented him from releasing solo material. The next album, \"The Who by Numbers\", had introspective songs from Townshend that dealt with disillusionment such as \"However Much I Booze\" and \"How Many Friends\"; they resembled his later solo work. Entwistle's \"Success Story\" gave a humorous look at the music industry, and \"Squeeze Box\" was a hit single. The group toured from October, playing little new material and few \"Quadrophenia\" numbers, and reintroducing several from \"Tommy\". The American leg of the tour began in Houston to a crowd of 18,000 at The Summit Arena, and was supported by Toots and the Maytals. On 6 December 1975, The Who set the record for largest indoor concert at the Pontiac Silverdome, attended by 78,000. On 31 May 1976, they played a second concert at the Valley which was listed in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as the world's loudest concert at over 120\u00a0dB. Townshend had become fed up of touring but Entwistle considered live performance to be at a peak.\n\"Who Are You\" and Moon's death.\nAfter the 1976 tour, Townshend took most of the following year off to spend time with his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of The Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, \"Who Are You\".\nThe group reconvened in September 1977, but Townshend announced there would be no live performances for the immediate future, a decision that Daltrey endorsed. By this point, Moon was so unhealthy that The Who conceded it would be difficult for him to cope with touring. The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, filmed for the documentary \"The Kids Are Alright\". The band had not played for 14 months, and their performance was so weak that the footage was not used. Moon's playing was particularly lacklustre and he had gained a lot of weight, though Daltrey later said, \"even at his worst, Keith Moon was amazing\".\nRecording of \"Who Are You\" started in January 1978. Daltrey clashed with Johns over the production of his vocals, and Moon's drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered firing him. Moon's playing improved, but on one track, \"Music Must Change\", he was replaced as he could not play in time. In May, The Who filmed another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios for \"The Kids Are Alright\". This performance was strong, and several tracks were used in the film. It was the last gig Moon performed with The Who.\nThe album was released on 18 August, and became their biggest and fastest seller to date, peaking at No.\u00a06 in the UK and No.\u00a02 in the US. Instead of touring, Daltrey, Townshend and Moon did a series of promotional television interviews, and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for \"The Kids Are Alright\".\nOn 6 September, Moon attended a party held by Paul McCartney to celebrate Buddy Holly's birthday. Returning to his flat, Moon took 32 tablets of clomethiazole which had been prescribed to combat his alcohol withdrawal. He passed out the following morning and was discovered dead later that day.\n1978\u20131983.\nThe day after Moon's death, Townshend issued the statement: \"We are more determined than ever to carry on, and we want the spirit of the group to which Keith contributed so much to go on, although no human being can ever take his place\". Drummer Phil Collins, having a temporary break from Genesis after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked Kenney Jones, who had previously played with the Small Faces and Faces. Jones officially joined the band in November 1978. John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist. On 2 May 1979, The Who returned to the stage with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, followed by the Cannes Film Festival in France and dates at Madison Square Garden in New York.\nThe \"Quadrophenia\" film was released that year. It was directed by Franc Roddam in his feature-directing d\u00e9but, and had straightforward acting rather than musical numbers as in \"Tommy\". John Lydon was considered for Jimmy, but the role went to Phil Daniels. Sting played Jimmy's friend and fellow mod, the Ace Face. The soundtrack was Jones' first appearance on a Who record, performing on newly written material not on the original album. The film was a critical and box office success in the UK and appealed to the growing mod revival movement. The Jam were influenced by The Who, and critics noticed a similarity between Townshend and the group's leader, Paul Weller.\n\"The Kids Are Alright\" was also completed in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band's career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included footage of the band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers' show and \"Russell Harty Plus\". Moon had died one week after seeing the rough cut with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of him playing over silent footage of himself was the last time he ever played the drums.\nIn December, The Who became the third band, after the Beatles and the Band, to appear on the cover of \"Time\". The article, by Jay Cocks, said the band had outpaced, outlasted, outlived and outclassed all of their rock band contemporaries.\nCincinnati tragedy.\nOn 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans. This was partly due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band's soundcheck for the concert, and attempted to force their way inside. As only a few entrance doors were opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.\nThe Who were not told until after the show because civic authorities feared crowd problems if the concert were cancelled. The band were deeply shaken upon learning of it and requested that appropriate safety precautions be taken in the future. The following evening, in Buffalo, New York, Daltrey told the crowd that the band had \"lost a lot of family last night and this show's for them\".\nChange and break-up.\nDaltrey took a break in 1980 to work on the film \"McVicar\", in which he took the lead role of bank robber John McVicar. The soundtrack album is a Daltrey solo album, though all members of The Who are included in the supporting musicians, and was his most successful solo release.\nThe Who released two studio albums with Jones as drummer, \"Face Dances\" (1981) and \"It's Hard\" (1982). \"Face Dances\" produced a US top\u00a020 and UK top ten hit with the single \"You Better You Bet\", whose video was one of the first shown on MTV. Both \"Face Dances\" and \"It's Hard\" sold well and the latter received a five-star review in \"Rolling Stone\". The single \"Eminence Front\" from \"It's Hard\" was a hit, and became a regular at live shows. By this time Townshend had fallen into depression, wondering if he was no longer a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, \"Empty Glass\" (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.\nTownshend wanted The Who to stop touring and become a studio act; Entwistle threatened to quit, saying, \"I don't intend to get off the road\u00a0... there's not much I can do about it except hope they change their minds\". Townshend did not change his mind, and so The Who embarked on a farewell tour of the US and Canada with the Clash as support, ending in Toronto on 17 December 1982.\nTownshend spent part of 1983 writing material for a Who studio album owed to Warner Bros. Records from a contract in 1980, but he found himself unable to generate music appropriate for The Who and at the end of 1983 paid for himself and Jones to be released from the contract. On 16 December 1983, Townshend announced at a press conference that he was leaving The Who, effectively ending the band.\nAfter The Who break-up, Townshend focused on solo albums such as ' (1985), ' (1989, featuring Daltrey and Entwistle and two songs credited to The Who), and \"Psychoderelict\" (1993).\nReunions.\nIn July 1985, The Who performed at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London. The BBC transmission truck blew a fuse during the set, temporarily interrupting the broadcast. At the 1988 Brit Awards, at the Royal Albert Hall, the band were given the British Phonographic Industry's Lifetime Achievement Award. The short set they played there was the last time Jones played with The Who until 2014.\n1989 tour.\nIn 1989, the band embarked on a 25th-anniversary \"The Kids Are Alright\" reunion tour with Simon Phillips on drums and Steve \"Boltz\" Bolton as a second guitarist. Townshend had announced in 1987 that he suffered from tinnitus and alternated acoustic, rhythm and lead guitar to preserve his hearing. Their two shows at Sullivan Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, sold 100,000 tickets in less than eight hours, beating previous records set there by U2 and David Bowie. The tour was briefly marred at a gig in Tacoma, Washington, where Townshend injured his hand on-stage. Some critics disliked the tour's over-produced and expanded line-up, calling it \"The Who on Ice\"; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the tour \"tarnished the reputation of The Who almost irreparably\". The tour included most of \"Tommy\" and included such guests as Phil Collins, Billy Idol and Elton John. A 2-CD live album, \"Join Together\", was released in 1990.\nPartial reunions.\nIn 1990, The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group have a featured collection in the hall's museum, including one of Moon's velvet suits, a Warwick bass of Entwistle's, and a drumhead from 1968.\nIn 1991, The Who recorded a cover of Elton John's \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" for the tribute album \"\". It was the last studio recording to feature Entwistle. In 1994, Daltrey turned 50 and celebrated with two concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall. The shows included guest spots by Entwistle and Townshend. Although all three surviving original members of The Who attended, they appeared on stage together only during the finale, \"Join Together\", with the other guests. Daltrey toured that year with Entwistle, Zak Starkey on drums and Simon Townshend filling in for his brother as guitarist.\nRe-formation.\nRevival of \"Quadrophenia\".\nIn 1996, Townshend, Entwistle and Daltrey performed \"Quadrophenia\" with guests and Starkey on drums at Hyde Park. The performance was narrated by Daniels, who had played Jimmy in the 1979 film. This was the first live performance of \"Quadrophenia\" in its entirety. Despite technical difficulties the show led to a six-night residency at Madison Square Garden and a US and European tour through 1996 and 1997. Townshend played mostly acoustic guitar, but eventually was persuaded to play some electric. In 1998, VH1 ranked The Who ninth in their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Rock 'n' Roll\".\nCharity shows and Entwistle's death.\nIn late 1999, The Who performed as a five-piece for the first time since 1985, with Bundrick on keyboards and Starkey on drums. The first show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena was partially broadcast on TV and the Internet and released as the DVD \"The Vegas Job\". They then performed acoustic shows at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, followed by gigs at the House of Blues in Chicago and two Christmas charity shows at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. Critics were delighted to see a rejuvenated band with a basic line-up comparable to the tours of the 1960s and 1970s. Andy Greene in \"Rolling Stone\" called the 1999 tour better than the final one with Moon in 1976.\nThe band toured the US and UK from June to October 2000, to generally favourable reviews, culminating in a charity show at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer Trust with guest performances from Paul Weller, Eddie Vedder, Noel Gallagher, Bryan Adams and Nigel Kennedy. Stephen Tomas Erlewine described the gig as \"an exceptional reunion concert\". In October 2001 the band performed at The Concert for New York City at Madison Square Garden for families of firefighters and police who had lost their lives following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center; with \"Forbes\" describing their performance as a \"catharsis\" for the law enforcement in attendance. Earlier that year the band were honoured with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nThe Who played concerts in the UK in early 2002 in preparation for a full US tour. On 27 June, the day before the first date, Entwistle, 57, was found dead of a heart attack at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. Cocaine was a contributing factor.\nAfter Entwistle: Tours and \"Endless Wire\".\nEntwistle's son, Christopher, gave a statement supporting The Who's decision to carry on. The US tour began at the Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino. Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle, and ended with a montage of pictures of him. The tour lasted until September. The loss of a founding member of The Who caused Townshend to re-evaluate his relationship with Daltrey, which had been strained over the band's career. He decided their friendship was important, and this ultimately led to writing and recording new material.\nTo combat bootlegging, in 2002 the band began to release the Encore Series of official soundboard recordings via themusic.com. An official statement read: \"to satisfy this demand they have agreed to release their own official recordings to benefit worthy causes\". In 2004, The Who released \"Old Red Wine\" and \"Real Good Looking Boy\" (with Palladino and Greg Lake, respectively, on bass guitar) on a singles anthology, \"\", and went on an 18-date tour of Japan, Australia, the UK and the US, including a return appearance at the Isle of Wight. Later that year, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked The Who No.\u00a029 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\nThe Who announced in 2005 that they were working on a new album. Townshend posted a novella called \"The Boy Who Heard Music\" on his blog, which developed into a mini-opera called \"Wire\u00a0&amp; Glass\", forming the basis for the album. \"Endless Wire\", released in 2006, was the first full studio album of new material since 1982's \"It's Hard\" and contained the band's first mini-opera since \"Rael\" in 1967. The album reached No.\u00a07 in the US and No.\u00a09 in the UK. Starkey was invited to join Oasis in April 2006 and The Who in November 2006, but he declined and split his time between the two.\nIn November 2007, the documentary \"\" was released, featuring unreleased footage of the 1970 Leeds appearance and a 1964 performance at the Railway Hotel when the group were the High Numbers. \"Amazing Journey\" was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award.\nThe Who toured in support of \"Endless Wire\", including the BBC Electric Proms at the Roundhouse in London in 2006, headlining the 2007 Glastonbury Festival, a half-time appearance at the Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 and being the final act at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. In November 2012, The Who released \"Live at Hull\", an album of the band's performance the night after the \"Live at Leeds\" gig.\n\"Quadrophenia and More\".\nIn 2010, The Who performed \"Quadrophenia\" with parts played by Vedder and Tom Meighan at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust series of 10 gigs. A planned tour for early 2010 was jeopardised by the return of Townshend's tinnitus. He experimented with an in-ear monitoring system that was recommended by Neil Young and his audiologist.\nThe \"Quadrophenia and More\" tour started in November 2012 in Ottawa with keyboardists John Corey, Loren Gold and Frank Simes, the last of whom was also musical director. In February 2013, Starkey pulled a tendon and was replaced for a gig by Scott Devours, who performed with less than four hours' notice. The tour moved to Europe and the UK, and ended at the Wembley Arena in July 2013.\n\"The Who Hits 50!\" and beyond.\nIn October 2013, Townshend announced The Who would stage their final tour in 2015, performing in locations they have never played before. Daltrey clarified that the tour was unrelated to the band's 50th anniversary and indicated that he and Townshend were considering recording new material. Daltrey stated, \"We can't go on touring forever\u00a0... it could be open-ended, but it will have a finality to it\".\nKenney Jones reunited with The Who in June 2014 at a charity gig for Prostate Cancer UK in his Hurtwood Polo Club, alongside Jeff Beck, Procol Harum and Mike Rutherford. Later that month, The Who announced plans for a world tour with a possible accompanying album. In September, The Who released the song \"Be Lucky\", which was included on the compilation \"The Who Hits 50!\" in October. That November, the group released a virtual reality app co-designed by Daltrey's son, Jamie, featuring events and images from the band's history.\nThe Who headlined 2015's Hyde Park Festival in June, and two days later, the Glastonbury Festival. Townshend suggested to \"Mojo\" that it could be the group's last UK gig. To coincide with The Who's 50th anniversary, all studio albums, and the new compilation \"The Who Hits 50!\", were reissued on vinyl. In September 2015, all remaining US tour dates were cancelled after Daltrey contracted viral meningitis. Then Townshend promised the band would come back \"stronger than ever\".\nThe Who embarked on the Back to the Who Tour 51! in 2016, a continuation of the previous year's tour. This included a return visit to the Isle of Wight Festival (at the Seaclose Park in Newport) on 11 June opening date. After 13 concerts, it concluded with a performance at the Desert Trip festival at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California on 16 October. In November, The Who announced that five UK dates the following April (previously scheduled for that August and September) would include a full live performance of \"Tommy\". The five-date tour was renamed \"2017 Tommy &amp; More\" and included the largest selections from the album since 1989. Two preliminary concerts at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer Trust on 30 March and 1 April featured \"Tommy\" in full.\nIn January 2019, the band announced the Moving On! Tour, followed by their first studio album in thirteen years, \"Who\", to critical and commercial success.\n\"The Who Hits Back\" and \"The Song Is Over\".\nIn February 2022, the band announced they would embark on a new North American tour entitled The Who Hits Back beginning 22 April 2022 in Hollywood, Florida and concluding 5 November 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. In April 2025, it was announced that Zak Starkey would no longer be touring with the band after a dispute about playing style at a Royal Albert Hall gig earlier that year. Starkey stated that he was \"surprised and saddened anyone would have an issue with my performance that night\" but that he would \"remain their biggest fan\". However, Townshend clarified a few days later that there had been a miscommunication and that Starkey would remain in the group. The band announced their North American tour in mid-2025 would be their last.\nStarkey left the band, to be replaced by Scott Devours (who had played in Daltrey's solo touring band) for the remainder of the year; Starkey remarked he had been fired. The band released a formal announcement reiterating their upcoming retirement and that Starkey \"needs to devote all his energy\" towards his other projects.\nMusical style and equipment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The music of The Who can only be called rock &amp; roll\u00a0... it is neither derivative of folk music nor the blues; the primary influence is rock &amp; roll itself.\"\n \u2014 Jann Wenner\nThe Who have been regarded primarily as a rock band, yet have taken influence from several other styles of music during their career. The original group played a mixture of trad jazz and contemporary pop hits as the Detours, and R&amp;B in 1963. The group moved to a mod sound the following year, particularly after hearing the Small Faces fuse Motown with a harsher R&amp;B sound. The group's early work was geared towards singles, though it was not straightforward pop. In 1967, Townshend coined the term \"power pop\" to describe The Who's style. Like their contemporaries, the group were influenced by the arrival of Hendrix, particularly after The Who and the Experience met at Monterey. This and lengthy touring strengthened the band's sound. In the studio, they began to develop softer pieces, particularly from \"Tommy\" onwards, and turned their attention towards albums more than singles.\nFrom the early 1970s, the band's sound included synthesizers, particularly on \"Who's Next\" and \"Quadrophenia\". Although groups had used synthesizers before, The Who were one of the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure. In \"By Numbers\" the group's style had scaled back to more standard rock, but synthesisers regained prominence on \"Face Dances\".\nTownshend and Entwistle were instrumental in making extreme volumes and distortion standard rock practices. The Who were early adopters of Marshall Amplification. Entwistle was the first member to get two 4\u00d712 speaker cabinets, quickly followed by Townshend. The group used feedback as part of their guitar sound, both live and in the studio. In 1967, Townshend changed to using Sound City amplifiers, customised by Dave Reeves, then in 1970 to Hiwatt. The group were the first to use 1000-watt PA systems for live gigs, which led to competition from bands such as the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd.\nThroughout their careers, the members of The Who have said their live sound has never been captured as they wished on record. Live gigs and the audience have always been important to the group. \"Irish\" Jack Lyons said, \"The Who weren't a joke, they were fucking real, and so were we\".\nVocals.\nDaltrey initially based his style on Motown and rock and roll, but from \"Tommy\" onwards he tackled a wider range of styles. His trademark sound with the band, as noted in 1983, has been a characteristic scream, as heard at the end of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\".\nGroup backing vocals are prominent in The Who. After \"I Can't Explain\" used session men for backing vocals, Townshend and Entwistle resolved to do better themselves on subsequent releases, producing strong backing harmonies. Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle sang lead on various songs, and occasionally Moon joined in. \"Who's Next\" featured Daltrey and Townshend sharing the lead vocals on several songs, and biographer Dave Marsh considers the contrast between Daltrey's strong, guttural tone and Townshend's higher and gentler sound to be one of the album's highlights.\nDaltrey's voice is negatively affected by marijuana smoke, to which he says he is allergic. On 20 May 2015, during a Who concert at Nassau Coliseum, he smelled a joint burning and told the smoker to put it out or \"the show will be over\". The fan obliged, without taking Pete Townshend's advice that \"the quickest way\" to extinguish a joint is \"up your fucking arse\".\nGuitars.\nTownshend considered himself less technical than guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck and wanted to stand out visually instead. His playing style evolved from the banjo, favouring down strokes and using a combination of the plectrum and fingerpicking. His rhythm playing frequently used seventh chords and suspended fourths, and he is associated with the power chord, an easy-to-finger chord built from the root and fifth that has since become a fundamental part of the rock guitar vocabulary. Townshend also produced noises by manipulating controls on his guitar and by allowing the instrument to feedback.\nIn the group's early career, Townshend favoured Rickenbacker guitars as they allowed him to fret rhythm guitar chords easily and move the neck back and forwards to create vibrato. From 1968 to 1973, he favoured a Gibson SG Special live, and later used customised Les Pauls in different tunings.\nIn the studio for \"Who's Next\" and thereafter, Townshend used a 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins hollow-body guitar, a Fender Bandmaster amp and an Edwards volume pedal, all gifts from Joe Walsh. Townshend started his career with an acoustic guitar and has regularly recorded and written with a Gibson J-200.\nBass.\nA distinctive part of the original band's sound was Entwistle's lead bass playing, while Townshend concentrated on rhythm and chords. Entwistle's was the first popular use of Rotosound strings in 1966, trying to find a piano-like sound. His bassline on \"Pinball Wizard\" was described by Who biographer John Atkins as \"a contribution of its own without diminishing the guitar lines\"; he described his part on \"The Real Me\" from \"Quadrophenia\", recorded in one take, as \"a bass solo with vocals\". Entwistle's basses include a \"Frankenstein\" assembled from five Fender Precision and Jazz basses, and Warwick, Alembic, and Status Graphite basses.\nDrums.\nMoon further strengthened the reversal of traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as the Kinks' Mick Avory and the Shadows' Brian Bennett, who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.\nJones' concise, supportive drumming style was in sharp contrast to Moon's. The Who were initially enthusiastic about working with a completely different drummer. Townshend later stated, \"we've never really been able to replace Keith\" and Daltrey ultimately believed Jones was not right for the band, while still speaking highly of him as a friend and drummer. Starkey knew Moon from childhood and Moon gave him his first drum kit.\nStarkey has been praised for his playing style which echoes Moon's without being a copy.\nLyrics.\nTownshend focused on writing meaningful lyrics inspired by Bob Dylan, whose words dealt with subjects other than boy\u2013girl relationships that were common in rock music; in contrast to Dylan's intellectualism, Townshend believed his lyrics should be about things kids could relate to. Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences, which Townshend said was a result of \"searching for [his] niche\". By \"The Who Sell Out\", he began to work narrative and characters into songs, which he fully developed by \"Tommy\", including spiritual themes influenced by Baba. From the mid-1970s onwards, his songs tended to be more personal, which influenced his decision to go solo.\nEntwistle's songs, by contrast, typically feature black humour and darker themes. His two contributions to \"Tommy\" (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") appeared because Townshend did not believe he could write songs as \"nasty\" as Entwistle's.\nPersonal relationships.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"We're not mates at all.\"\n\u2014Roger Daltrey, 1965\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I just couldn't get through to Pete and Roger. We have absolutely nothing in common apart from music.\"\n\u2014Keith Moon, 1965\nThe Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship. In the original band, Doug Sandom acted as the peacemaker and settled disputes. Moon, by contrast, was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend. Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments. The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members, and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically \"because we always disagreed\".\nThe only genuine friendship in the band during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a \"chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness\". Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour. When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle admitted he \"was standing behind him with the matches\".\nThe group regularly argued in the press, though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things. \"Tommy\" mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey's standing in the band because of the former's songwriting and the latter's stage presence, yet even this did not make them close friends. The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid-1970s, over the group's direction. During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.\nEntwistle's death in 2002 came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey, and caused them to re-evaluate their relationship. Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends. In 2015, Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong, adding their acceptance of each other's differences \"brought us to a really genuine and compassionate relationship, which can only be described as love\".\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The one thing that disgusts me about The Who is the way they smashed through every door in the uncharted hallway of rock 'n' roll without leaving much more than some debris for the rest of us to lay claim to.\"\n\u2014Eddie Vedder\nThe Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts and they have been credited with originating the \"rock opera\".\nThe group's contributions to rock include \"perfecting the power chord\", windmill strum and the use of non-musical instrument noise such as feedback. The band influenced fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art and the use of the Union Jack for clothing. The guitar-smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"50\u00a0Moments That Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll\".\nPink Floyd began to use feedback from their early shows in 1966, inspired by The Who, whom they considered a formative influence. Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Jimi Hendrix visited Marshall's music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend's and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said The Who \"are the most exciting thing around\" and was inspired to write \"Helter Skelter\" in the group's \"heavy\" style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in \"Pinball Wizard\" for \"Polythene Pam\". Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone has stated that The Who was what first inspired him to make music and named their debut as one of his favorite albums.\nThe loud volume of the band's live show influenced the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. A wide variety of proto-punk, punk rock, and alternative rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, and Melvins cite The Who as an influence. An early influence on Queen, guitarist Brian May referred to The Who as being \"among our favourite groups\". The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by The Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by The Who. The Who have also influenced pop rock band Panic! at the Disco.\nThe Who have inspired many tribute bands; Daltrey has endorsed the Whodlums, who raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Many bands have covered Who songs; Elton John's version of \"Pinball Wizard\" reached No.\u00a07 in the UK.\nMedia.\nDuring The Who's hiatuses in the 1980s and 90s, Townshend developed his skills as a music publisher to be financially successful from The Who without recording or touring. He countered criticism of \"selling out\" by saying that licensing the songs to other media allows a wider exposure and widens the group's appeal.\nThe American police procedural franchise \"CSI\" (', ', ', ' and \"\") feature Who songs as theme music, \"Who Are You\", \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"I Can See for Miles\" respectively. The group's songs have featured in other popular TV series such as \"The Simpsons\", and \"Top Gear\", which had an episode where the presenters were tasked with being roadies for the band.\nRock-oriented films such as \"Almost Famous\", \"School of Rock\" and \"Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny\" refer to the band and feature their songs, and other films have used the band's material in their soundtracks, including \"Apollo 13\" (which used \"I Can See For Miles\") and \"\" (which used a take of \"My Generation\" recorded for the BBC). Several of the band's tracks have appeared in the video game \"Rock Band\" and its sequels.\nAwards and nominations.\nThe Who have received many awards and accolades from the music industry for their recordings and their influence. They received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001.\nThe band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 where their display describes them as \"prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World's Greatest Rock Band\", and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.\nThe single \"My Generation\" and the albums \"Tommy\" and \"Who's Next\" have each been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2008, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey received Kennedy Center Honors as members of The Who. In 2009, \"My Generation\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry.\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included \"Who's Next\" at number 28, \"Tommy\" at number 96, \"The Who Sell Out\" at number 113, \"Live at Leeds\" at number 170, \"My Generation\" at number 236, \"Quadrophenia\" at number 266, and \"A Quick One\" at number 383. And in 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, \"Rolling Stone\" included \"My Generation\" at number 11, \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" at number 133, \"I Can See for Miles\" at number 258, \"Baba O'Riley\" at number 340, and \"I Can't Explain\" at number 371. The same publication ranked them the 29th greatest artist of all time. Eddie Vedder wrote in tribute: The Who began as spectacle. They became spectacular. Early on, the band was in pure demolition mode; later, on albums like \"Tommy\" and \"Quadrophenia\", it coupled that raw energy with precision and desire to complete musical experiments on a grand scale. They asked, \"What were the limits of rock &amp; roll? Could the power of music actually change the way you feel?\" Pete Townshend demanded that there be spiritual value in music. They were an incredible band whose main songwriter happened to be on a quest for reason and harmony in his life. He shared that journey with the listener, becoming an inspiration for others to seek out their own path. They did all this while also being in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the world's loudest band...\nThe songwriter-listener relationship grows deeper after all the years. Pete saw that a celebrity in rock is charged by the audience with a function, like, \"You stand there and we will know ourselves\". Not \"You stand there and we will pay you loads of money to keep us entertained as we eat our oysters\". He saw the connection could be profound. He also realized the audience may say, \"When we're finished with you, we'll replace you with somebody else\". For myself and so many others (including shopkeepers, foremen, professionals, bellboys, gravediggers, directors, musicians), they won't be replaced. Yes, Pete, it's true, music can change you.\nBand members.\nFormer touring musicians.\n\"For a complete list, see former touring members\"\nTours and performances.\nHeadlining 1960s\u20131990s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHeadlining 2000s\u20132010s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "36526", "revid": "1883085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36526", "title": "Cartel", "text": "Mutually beneficial collusion among competing corporations\nA cartel is a group of independent market participants who collaborate with each other and avoid competing with each other in order to improve their profits and dominate the market. They seek to limit competition, fix prices, and increase prices by creating artificial shortages through low production quotas, stockpiling, and marketing quotas. Jurisdictions frequently consider cartelization to be anti-competitive behavior, leading them to outlaw or curtail cartel practices. Anti-trust law targets cartel behavior in markets.\nThe doctrine in economics that analyzes cartels is cartel theory. Cartels are distinguished from other forms of collusion or anti-competitive organization such as corporate mergers. Cartels are inherently unstable due to the temptation by members of the cartel to cheat and defect on each other by improving their individual profits, which may lead to falling prices for all members. Advancements in technology or the emergence of substitutes can undermine cartel pricing power, leading to the breakdown of the cooperation needed to sustain the cartel. Outside actors often respond to the undersupply of a good by bolstering their production of the good, investing in technologies that use the good more efficiently, or investing in substitutes.\nCartels can be organized on an international basis; examples of international cartels include the OPEC cartel to collude on oil production and the International Rubber Regulation Agreement to collude on rubber production. They can also exist at a national level; examples of American cartels include the United States Gunpowder Trade Association (which was dissolved by U.S. courts in 1912) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association which restricts the kind of compensation that collegiate athletes can receive.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"cartel\" comes from the Italian word ('leaf of paper' or 'placard'), itself derived from the Latin 'card'. In Middle French, the Italian word became , which was borrowed into English. In English, the word was originally used for a written agreement between warring nations to regulate the treatment and exchange of prisoners from the 1690s onward. From 1899 onwards, the usage of the word became generalized as to mean any intergovernmental agreement between rival nations.\nThe use of the English word cartel to describe an economic group rather than international agreements was derived much later in the 1800s from the German , which also has its origins in the French . It was first used between German railway companies in 1846 to describe tariff and technical standardization efforts. The first time the word was referred to describe a kind of restriction of competition was by the Austro-Hungarian political scientist Lorenz von Stein, who wrote on tariff cartels:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There's no more one-sided perspective than the one saying that such rate-cartels are \"monopoly cartels\" or cartels for the \"exploitation of carriers\".\u2014\u200a\nHistory.\nCartels have existed since ancient times. Guilds in the European Middle Ages, associations of craftsmen or merchants of the same trade, have been regarded as cartel-like. Tightly organized sales cartels existed in the mining industry of the late Middle Ages, like the 1301 salt syndicate in France and Naples, or the Alaun cartel of 1470 between the Papal State and Naples. Both unions had common sales organizations for overall production called the \"Societas Communis Vendicionis\" ('Common Sales Society').\nLaissez-faire (liberal) economic conditions dominated Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries. Around 1870, cartels first appeared in industries formerly under free-market conditions. Although cartels existed in all economically developed countries, the core area of cartel activities was in central Europe. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary were nicknamed the \"lands of the cartels\". Cartels were also widespread in the United States during the period of robber barons and industrial trusts.\nThe creation of cartels increased globally after World War\u00a0I. They became the leading form of market organization, particularly in Europe and Japan. In the 1930s, authoritarian regimes such as Nazi Germany, Italy under Mussolini, and Spain under Franco used cartels to organize their corporatist economies. Between the late 19th century and around 1945, the United States was ambivalent about cartels and trusts. There were periods of both opposition to market concentration and relative tolerance of cartels. During World War\u00a0II, the United States strictly turned away from cartels. After 1945, American-promoted market liberalism led to a worldwide cartel ban, where cartels continue to be obstructed in an increasing number of countries and circumstances.\nTypes.\nCartels have many structures and functions that ideally enable corporations to navigate and control market uncertainties and gain collusive profits within their industry. A typical cartel often requires what competition authorities refer to as a CAU (Contact, Agreement or Understanding). Typologies have emerged to distinguish distinct forms of cartels:\nEffects.\nA survey of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last 200 years is about 23 percent. Private international cartels (those with participants from two or more nations) had an average price increase of 28 percent, whereas domestic cartels averaged 18 percent. Less than 10 percent of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices.\nIn general, cartel agreements are economically unstable in that there is an incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the cartel's agreed price or selling more than the cartel's production quotas. Many cartels that attempt to set product prices are unsuccessful in the long term because of cheating punishment mechanisms such as price wars or financial punishment. An empirical study of 20th-century cartels determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years and overcharged by approximately 32%. This distribution was found to be bimodal, with many cartels breaking up quickly (less than a year), many others lasting between five and ten years, and still some that lasted decades. Within the industries that have operating cartels, the median number of cartel members is 8. Once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form a new cartel return, and the cartel may be re-formed. Publicly known cartels that do not follow this business cycle include, by some accounts, OPEC.\nCartels often practice price fixing internationally. When the agreement to control prices is sanctioned by a multilateral treaty or protected by national sovereignty, no antitrust actions may be initiated. OPEC countries partially control the price of oil.\nOrganization.\nDrawing upon research on organizational misconduct, scholars in economics, sociology and management have studied the organization of cartels. They have paid attention to the way cartel participants work together to conceal their activities from antitrust authorities. Even more than reaching efficiency, participating firms need to ensure that their collective secret is maintained. \u201cHowever, the orchestrator, often the vendor with all information, typically remains unnoticed by antitrust authorities, raising questions about the culpability of unaware distributors.\u201d\nCartel theory versus antitrust concept.\nThe scientific analysis of cartels is based on cartel theory. It was pioneered in 1883 by the Austrian economist Friedrich Kleinw\u00e4chter and in its early stages was developed mainly by German-speaking scholars. These scholars tended to regard cartels as an acceptable part of the economy. At the same time, American lawyers increasingly turned against trade restrictions, including all cartels. The Sherman act, which impeded the formation and activities of cartels, was passed in the United States in 1890. The American viewpoint, supported by activists like Thurman Arnold and Harley M. Kilgore, eventually prevailed when governmental policy in Washington could have a larger impact in World War II.\nLegislation and penalties.\nBecause cartels are likely to have an impact on market positions, they are subjected to competition law, which is executed by governmental competition regulators. Very similar regulations apply to corporate mergers. A single entity that holds a monopoly is not considered a cartel but can be sanctioned through other abuses of its monopoly.\nPrior to World War II, members of cartels could sign contracts that were enforceable in courts of law except in the United States. Before 1945, cartels were tolerated in Europe and specifically promoted as a business practice in German-speaking countries. In \"U.S. v. National Lead Co. et al.\", the Supreme Court of the United States noted the testimony of individuals who cited that a cartel, in its versatile form, is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a combination of producers for the purpose of regulating production and, frequently, prices, and an association by agreement of companies or sections of companies having common interests so as to prevent extreme or unfair competition.\nThe first legislation against cartels to be enforced was the Sherman Act 1890, which also prohibits price fixing, market-sharing, output restrictions and other anti-competitive conduct. Section 1 and 2 of the Act outlines the law in regards to cartels,Section 1:\nEvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\nSection 2:\nEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100 million if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1 million, or by imprisonment not exceeding ten years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\nIn practice, detecting and desisting cartels is undertaken through the use of economic analysis and leniency programmes. Economic analysis is implemented to identify any discrepancies in market behaviour between both suspected and unsuspected cartel engaged firms. A structural approach is done in the form of screening already suspicious firms for industry traits of a typical cartel price path. A typical path often includes a formation phase in which prices decline, followed by a transition phase in which prices tend to rise, and end with a stationary phase in which price variance remains low. Indicators such as price changes alongside import rates, market concentration, time period of permanent price changes and stability of companies' market shares are used as economic markers to help supplement the search for cartel behaviour. On the contrary, when aiming to create suspicion around potential cartels, a behavioural approach is often used to identify behavioural collusive patterns, to initiate further economic analysis into identifying and prosecuting those involved in the operations. For example, studies have shown that industries are more likely to experience collusion where there are fewer firms, products are homogeneous and there is a stable demand.\nLeniency programmes.\nLeniency programmes were first introduced in 1978 in the US, before being successfully reformed in 1993. The underlying principle of a leniency program is to offer discretionary penalty reductions for corporations or individuals who are affiliated with cartel operations, in exchange for their cooperation with enforcement authorities in helping to identify and penalise other participating members. According to the Australian Department of Justice, the following 6 conditions must be met for admission into a leniency program:\nThe application of leniency programme penalties varies according to individual countries policies and are proportional to cartel profits and years of infringement. However, typically the first corporation or individual to cooperate will receive the most reduced penalty in comparison to those who come forward later. The effectiveness of leniency programmes in destabilising and deterring cartels is evidenced by the decreased formation and discovery of cartels in the US since the introduction of the programmes in 1993. Some prosecuted examples include:\nPrice fixing.\nToday, price fixing by private entities is illegal under the antitrust laws of more than 140 countries. The commodities of prosecuted international cartels include lysine, citric acid, graphite electrodes, and bulk vitamins. In many countries, the predominant belief is that cartels are contrary to free and fair competition, considered the backbone of political democracy. Maintaining cartels continues to become harder for cartels. Even if international cartels cannot be regulated as a whole by individual nations, their individual activities in domestic markets are affected.\nUnlike other cartels, export cartels are legal in virtually all jurisdictions, despite their harmful effects on affected markets.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36527", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36527", "title": "Cohabitation", "text": "Living arrangement for unmarried couples\nCohabitation is an arrangement where people who are not legally married live together as a couple. They are often involved in a romantic or sexually intimate relationship on a long-term or permanent basis. Such arrangements have become increasingly common in Western countries since the late 20th century, led by changing social views, especially regarding marriage. The term dates from the mid 16th century, being used with this meaning as early as 1530.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSocial changes leading to increase.\nCohabitation is a common pattern among people in the Western world.\nIn Europe, the Scandinavian countries began this trend, although many countries have since followed. Mediterranean Europe has traditionally been very conservative, with religion playing a strong role. Until the mid-1990s, cohabitation levels remained low in this region, but have since increased; for example, in Portugal the majority of children have been born of unwed parents since 2015, constituting 60% of the total in 2021.\nIn the United States, over the past few decades there has been an increase in unmarried couples cohabiting. Historically, Western countries have been influenced by Christian doctrine on sex, which opposes unmarried cohabitation. As social norms have changed, such beliefs have become less widely held and some Christian denominations view cohabitation as a precursor to marriage. Pope Francis has performed the marriages of cohabiting couples who had children, while former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the archbishop of York John Sentamu have expressed tolerance of cohabitation.\nIn recent decades, high rates of participation of women in the workforce and the widespread availability of highly effective long acting reversible contraceptives has led to women making individual choices over their reproduction with decreased reliance on male partners for financial stability. All these changes favored alternative living arrangements to marriage.\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were major political changes, such as the fall of Communist governments. These societies entered a new era of increased social freedom, less rigid rules, and less authoritarian governments. They interacted with Western Europe and some became members of the European Union. As a result, the patterns of family life started to change: marriage rates have declined, and marriage was postponed to a later age. Cohabitation and births to unmarried mothers increased, and in some countries the increase was quick.\nThe \"deinstitutionalization of marriage\" refers to the weakening of the social and legal norms that regulate peoples' behavior in regard to marriage. The rise in cohabitation is part of other major social changes such as higher divorce rate, older age at first marriage and childbearing, and more births outside marriage. Factors such as secularization, increased participation of women in the labor force, changes in the meaning of marriage, risk reduction, individualism, and changing views on sexuality have been cited as contributing to these social changes. There has also been a change in modern sexual ethics, with a focus on consent, rather than marital status (i.e. decriminalization of adultery and fornication; criminalization of marital rape), reflecting new concepts on the role and purpose of sexual interaction, and new conceptualizations of female sexuality and of self-determination. There have been objections against the legal and social regulation of female sexuality; with such regulations being often seen as violations of women's rights. In addition, some individuals may feel that marriage is unnecessary or outdated, leading to couples not formalizing their relation. For instance, in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, the percentage of respondents who agreed with the assertion that \"Marriage is an outdated institution\" was 37.5% in Luxembourg, 35.4% in France, 34.3% in Belgium, 31.2% in Spain, 30.5% in Austria, 29.2% in Germany, 27.7% in Switzerland, 27.2% in Bulgaria, 27.0% in the Netherlands, 25.0% in Slovenia.\nThe fact that many couples choose to live together without formalizing their relation is also recognized by the European Union. A 2004 directive forbids EU members from denying entry or residence of partners \"with whom the Union citizen has a durable relationship, duly attested.\"\nReasons for cohabitation in the United States.\nCohabitation in the United States is often a part of the dating process. In fact, \"cohabitation is increasingly becoming the first coresidential union formed among young adults\".\nBy 1996, more than two-thirds of married couples in the US said that they lived together before getting married. \"In 1994, there were 3.7 million cohabiting couples in the United States.\" This is a major increase from a few decades earlier. According to Dr. Galena Rhoades, \"Before 1970, living together outside marriage was uncommon, but by the late 1990s at least 50% to 60% of couples lived together premaritally.\"\nPeople may live together for a number of reasons. Cohabitants could live together to save money, or because of the convenience of living with another, or a need to find housing.\nLower income individuals facing financial uncertainty may delay or avoid marriage, not only because of the cost of a wedding but also because of fear of financial hardship if a marriage were to end in divorce.\nWhen responding to a survey of the reasons for cohabitation, most couples listed reasons such as spending more time together, convenience-based reasons, and testing their relationships, while few gave the reason that they do not believe in marriage. The extremely high costs of housing and tight budgets of the economy are also factors that can lead a couple to cohabitation.\nSixty percent of all marriages are preceded by a period of cohabitation. Researchers suggest that couples live together as a way of trying out marriage to test compatibility with their partners, while still having the option of ending the relationship without legal implications. In 1996, \"More than three-quarters of all cohabitors report[ed] plans to marry their partners, which implies that most of them viewed cohabitation as a prelude to marriage.\" Cohabitation shares many qualities with marriage. Often couples who are cohabiting share a residence, personal resources, exclude intimate relations with others, and more than 10% of cohabiting couples have children. \"Many young adults believe cohabitation is a good way to test their relationships prior to marriage.\" Couples who have plans to marry before moving in together or who are engaged before cohabiting typically marry within two years of living together. The state of cohabitation of a couple often ends either in marriage or in break-up; according to a 1996 study about 10% of cohabiting unions remained in this state more than five years. According to a survey done by The National Center for Health Statistics, \"over half of marriages from 1990 to 1994 among women began as cohabitation.\"\nCohabitation can be an alternative to marriage in situations where marriage is not possible for legal or religious reasons (such as same-sex, interracial or interreligious marriages).\nCohabitation, sometimes called de facto marriage, is becoming a more common substitute for conventional marriage. Common-law marriage in the United States can still be contracted in nine US states, and in two others under restriction. This helps provide the surviving partner a legal basis for inheriting the decedent's belongings in the event of the death of their cohabiting partner. In modern cohabiting relationships, forty percent of households include children, giving an idea of how cohabitation could be considered a new normative type of family dynamic. In 2012, 41% of all births in the US were to unmarried women. In three states (Mississippi \u2013 55%, Louisiana \u2013 53%, and New Mexico \u2013 52%) births outside marriage were in the majority; the lowest percentage of births outside marriage was in Utah, at 19%. During the period 2006\u20132010, 58% of births outside marriage were to cohabiting parents.\nContemporary objections to cohabitation.\nContemporary objections to cohabiting couples include religious opposition to non-marital unions, social pressure for couples to get married, and potential effects of cohabitation on a child's development.\nThe rise in the number of cohabiting couples and children born out of wedlock in the Western world has made cohabitation a strong focus of sociological research. The rise in cohabiting couples in the United States, from around 450,000 in 1960 to 7.5\u00a0million in 2011 has been accompanied by US research performed on child development within cohabiting households. Opponents of cohabitation say non-marital parenting is an unsuitable environment for a child's development. One study from 2002 correlated lower numeracy skills and higher delinquency to children of cohabiting couples; however, recent studies that control for factors including poverty, the educational level of parents and violence in the home show children of cohabiting couples are developmentally similar to peers of comparable married couples.\nEffect on children.\nIn 2001, researchers compared teenage children in the United States living in a cohabiting household (a single mother and her boyfriend who was not related to the teenager) against peers in single-parent households. The results showed white and Hispanic teenagers had lower performance in school, greater risk of suspension or expulsion than peers from single-parent households, and the same rate of behavioral and emotional problems.\nA study on the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth found increases in both the prevalence and duration of unmarried cohabitation. The study found that 40% of children in the United States would live in a cohabiting household by age 12, and children born to single mothers were more likely than those born to married mothers to live in a cohabiting household. The percentage of women ages 19\u201344 who had ever cohabited increased from 45% in 1995 to 54% in 2002.\nIn 2002, 63% of women who graduate from high school were found to spend some time cohabiting, compared to only 45% of women with a four-year college degree. Cohabiting couples who have children often get married. One study found that children born of parents who cohabit are 90% more likely to end up living in households with married parents than children born to single mothers. 67% of unmarried Hispanic mothers are expected to marry, while 40% of African American mothers are expected to marry.\nReligious views.\nStudies have found that religious affiliation correlates with cohabitation and marriage entry. People frequently cite religious reasons for their opposition to cohabitation. The Roman Catholic Church and nearly all mainstream Protestant denominations around the world oppose cohabitation and consider it to be the sin of fornication. However, others, such as the Church of England \"welcome cohabiting couples in the Church and encourage them to regard cohabitation as a prelude to Christian marriage.\"\nReligion can also lead to societal pressures against cohabitation especially within highly religious communities. Some couples may refrain from cohabitation because one or both partners fear disappointing or alienating conservative family members. Young adults who grew up in families that oppose cohabitation have lower rates than their peers.\nThe increase in cohabitation in the United States and other developed nations has been linked to the secularization of those countries. Researchers have noted that changes in the religious demographics of a society have accompanied the rise in cohabitation.\nNon-marital and same-sex relationships are forbidden by the Islamic law of Zina, and cohabitation is against the law in many Muslim majority countries including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen.\nEffects on marriage and family life.\nLikelihood of split.\nConflicting studies on the effect of cohabitation on subsequent marriage have been published. In countries where the majority of people disapprove of unmarried individuals living together, or a minority of the population cohabits before marriage, marriages resulting from cohabitation are more prone to divorce. But in a study on European countries, those where around half of the population cohabits before marriage, cohabitation is not selective of divorce-prone individuals, and no difference in couples that have cohabited before and after marriage is observed. In countries such as Italy, the increased risk of marital disruption for people who experienced premarital cohabitation can be entirely attributed to the selection of the most divorce-prone into cohabitation.\nIn 2002, the CDC found that for married couples the likelihood percentage of the relationship ending after five years is 20%, for unmarried cohabitators the likelihood percentage is 49%. After 10 years the likelihood percentage for the relationship to end is 33% for married couples and 62% for unmarried cohabitators. One German study found that in regions with high rates of childbirth to cohabitating parents, no negative effect is observed in cohabitation. The study states \"union stability of cohabiting mothers is positively related to their prevalence\".\nA 2004 study of 136 couples (272 individuals) from researchers at the University of Denver found differences among couples that cohabited before engagement, after engagement, or not until marriage. The longitudinal study collected survey data before marriage and 10 months into marriage, with findings suggesting those who cohabit before engagement are at greater risk for poor marital outcomes than those who cohabit only after engagement or at marriage.\nA follow-up survey by the researches of over 1,000 married men and women married in the past 10 years found those who moved in with a lover before engagement or marriage reported significantly lower quality marriages and a greater possibility of a separation than other couples.\nAbout 20% of those who cohabited before getting engaged had since suggested splitting \u2013 compared with only 12% of those who only moved in together after getting engaged and 10% who did not cohabit prior to marriage. \nAnother 2004 study of 92 couples linked communication to cohabitation and instability. They found that married couples who cohabited before they were married had more negative problem-solving and communication skills. They also found that those who had cohabited expressed more (verbal) aggression throughout their conversations. This negative communication could be contributing to the cohabitation effect and causing a larger amount of marital instability.\nThe researchers from Denver suggest that relationships with pre-engagement cohabitation \"may wind up sliding into marriage\", whereas those that only cohabit post engagement or marriage make a more clear decision. This could explain their 2006 study of 197 heterosexual couples finding that men who cohabited with their spouse before engagement were less dedicated than men who cohabited only after engagement or not at all before marriage.\nIn some heterosexual couples, women are more likely to understand cohabitation as an intermediary step preceding marriage, and men more likely to perceive it without an explicit connection to marriage.\nAn analysis of data from the CDC's National Survey of Family Growth data from 1988, 1995, and 2002 suggests that the positive relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital instability has weakened for more recent birth and marriage cohorts, as the total number of couples cohabiting before marriage has increased.\nLater CDC work found that between 2002 and 2006-2010, the number of couples in opposite-sex cohabiting relationships increased from 9.0% to 11.2% for women, and from 9.2% to 12.2% for men.\nDrawing on the 2006\u20132008 data, Princeton University researchers examined whether and to what extent variation in premarital cohabitation experiences influence marital stability. They found that the relationship between cohabitation and marital instability is complex and depends in part on marriage cohort, race/ethnicity, and marriage plans. Their analyses reveal that a 'cohabitation effect' exists only for women married prior to 1996, and that, until marriage plans are considered, there is no cohabitation effect among women married since 1996.\nRecent research from 2011 by the Pew Research Center has found that the number of couples that cohabit before marriage has increased. 44% of adults (and more than half of 30- to 49-year-olds) say they have cohabited at some point. Nearly two-thirds of adults who ever cohabited (64%) say they thought about it as a step toward marriage. The report also notes a trend toward rising public acceptance of cohabiting couples over the years. Most Americans now say the rise in unmarried couples living together either makes no difference to society (46%) or is good for society (9%).\nA 2012 study found that, among cohabiting individuals, those who were engaged prior to cohabitation or had \"definite plans for marriage\" were linked to lower risks of marital instability among women, but the relationship was not observed with men.\nOne study on low to moderate income couples living with minor children found that respondents who became sexually involved within the first month of their relationship were correlated to lower scores of relationship quality among women. Another study found respondents to a mail-in survey self-reported higher levels of commitment in the cohabiting group, as well as lower relationship satisfaction and more negative communication.\nA 2018 study found that cohabiting before marriage was linked to a lower risk of divorce during the first year of marriage, but a greater risk of divorce in the long run. However, a report published by the Council on Contemporary Families that same year found that couples who cohabited before marriage were less likely to divorce than couples who did not.\nAbuse and infidelity.\nUniversity of Chicago sociologist Linda Waite found that \"16 percent of cohabiting women reported that arguments with their partners became physical during the past year, while only 5 percent of married women had similar experiences.\" Most cohabiting couples have a faithful relationship, but Waite's surveys also demonstrated that 20% of cohabiting women reported having secondary sex partners, compared to only 4% of married women.\nAccording to an article by Judith Treas and Deirdre Giesen, cohabiting couples are twice as likely to experience infidelity within the relationship than married couples.\nFertility.\nRegarding cohabitation as a fertility factor, a large survey in the United States came to the result that married women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the confounder that married people have their children earlier in life.\nA study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to cohabit after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in Eastern Europe. Another study, on the contrary, came to the result that cohabiting couples in France have equal fertility as married ones. Also, Russians have a higher fertility within cohabitation, while Romanians rather tend to have childless marriages.\nSurvey data from 2003 in Romania came to the result that marriage equalized the total fertility rate among both highly educated and low educated people to approximately 1.4. Among those cohabiting, on the other hand, lower level of education increased fertility rate to 1.7, and a higher level of education decreased it to 0.7. On the other hand, another study came to the result that Romanian women with little education have about equal fertility in marital and cohabiting partnerships.\nFinancial effects.\nIn the United States, married couples that submit a combined tax return may face a marriage penalty, where tax credits for low-income single earners are not applied to the combined income.\nIn October 1998, Senate GOP leader Trent Lott decided to pull a bill to abolish \"the marriage penalty, which in the tax code reflects the fact that married couples who both work for wages frequently pay more in taxes than if they earned the same amount of income but weren't married. And the more equal the incomes of the couple, the steeper the marriage tax penalty.\" The earned income tax credit (EITC) is cash welfare for low-income workers, but the problem is the EITC is not for married couples because they have to combine their wages, which again leads to \"the marriage penalty\". If couples do not get married then their wages do not have to combine and the EITC in a way is \"paying for\" low-income couples not to marry. Opponents of cohabitation believe that some cohabiting couples choose not to marry because they would suffer a tax penalty.\nDespite the perceived disincentive to marry that the EITC provides, cohabiting couples suffer many financial losses as their unions are not recognized with the same legal and financial benefits as those who are legally married. These financial penalties can include the costs of separate insurance policies and the costs of setting up legal protections similar to those that are automatically granted by the state upon marriage.\nNo effect.\nA conflicting study, published by the National Center for Health Statistics, with a sample of 12,571 people, concludes that \"those who live together after making plans to marry or getting engaged have about the same chances of divorcing as couples who never cohabited before marriage\".\nAdditionally, William Doherty, a professor in the Department of Family Social Science at the University of Minnesota has remarked that in his research he has found that \"committed cohabiting relationships seem to confer many of the benefits of marriage\".\nA 2003 study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that \"The differences in measured outcomes for those from direct and indirect marriages appear to be entirely attributable to other factors.\" The study concluded that the evidence suggests that premarital cohabitation has \"little impact one way or the other\" on the chances of any subsequent marriage surviving.\nBy region.\nAmericas.\nCanada.\nCanadian laws on the recognition of unmarried cohabitation for legal purposes vary significantly by province/territory; and in addition to this, federal regulations also have an impact across the country (see Common-law marriage#Canada). Family formation has undergone significant changes in Canada during the last decades of the 20th century, but the patterns vary widely across the country, suggesting differing cultural norms in different regions. From 1995, births to cohabiting parents have increased, particularly in Quebec. In Canada, it is difficult to obtain exact data on the percentage of births outside marriage, because data on the marital status of mothers is collected differently across the provinces and territories of Canada, and in some (such as Alberta) it is not broken down in detail in regard to whether the mother was legally married at the birth of her child. As of 2012, the statistical category of \"single mothers\" (defined as \"never married\" at the time of the birth) encompassed 28.3% of mothers, the category \"divorced\" (i.e. mothers who were unmarried at the time of birth, but had been previously married during their lives) encompassed 1%, while for 10% of mothers the marital status was unknown (\"not stated\"). There are, however, very significant differences by province/territory; for example in 2012, 77.8% of births in Nunavut were listed to \"single mothers\", by contrast, less than 20% of mothers in Ontario were listed in this category. Latest data from the Quebec Statistical Institute shows that as of 2015, in Quebec, 63% of children were born to unmarried women. In Canada, legal issues regarding cohabitation are complicated by the fact that family law in this regard differs by province/territory, which is confusing to the public,\nas this contrasts to criminal law which is uniform across Canada, as well as to marriage and divorce law, which is also the same across the country, under the 1986 \"Divorce Act (Canada)\" (although provinces/territories have jurisdiction over some marital issues, including the solemnization of marriage, spousal and child support, and property division). The marital status of Canadians also varies by province/territory: in 2011, 46.4% of the population aged 15 and over was legally married; ranging from the lowest percentage of married people in Nunavut (29.7%), Northwest Territories (35.0%), Quebec (35.4%), and Yukon (37.6%); to highest in Newfoundland and Labrador (52.9%), Prince Edward Island (51.7%), Ontario (50.3%) and Alberta (50.2%). While Quebec is known for liberal family formation and cohabitation, this is a recent development: during the first half of the 20th century, family life in the province was conservative and strongly dominated by Roman Catholicism; before 1968, there was no provincial divorce legislation in Quebec, and spouses could only end their marriage if they obtained a private act of Parliament. One explanation of the high rates of cohabitation in Quebec is that the traditionally strong social control of the church and Catholic doctrine over people's private relations and sexual morality has led the population to rebel against traditional, conservative social values. While some provinces were early to modernize family law, in others this only occurred in the 1990s and the 21st century, such as in Alberta, through the \"Family Law Act (Alberta)\" which came into force in 2005. This Act overhauled family legislation, replacing the \"Domestic Relations Act\", the \"Maintenance Order Act\", the \"Parentage and Maintenance Act\", and parts of the \"Provincial Court Act\" and the \"Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act\", which were seen as outdated. Also, the \"Adult Interdependent Relationships Act\" (S.A. 2002, c. A-4.5) amended 69 Alberta laws. The Canadian Prairies provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan have strong common-law spousal. regulations, imposing rights and obligations on common-law couples. Nova Scotia has also been very slow to advance family law \u2013 it was only in 1999 that this province abolished discrimination against \"illegitimate\" children with regard to inheritance (through section 16 of \"NS Intestate Succession Act\" amended in 1999). In general, provinces in Western Canada give more rights to common-law spouses than those in Atlantic Canada and in Quebec. This may seem paradoxical, because the eastern provinces have the strongest tradition of cohabitation; according to a study \"unmarried cohabitation seems to be more common in Eastern Canada than in Western Canada, which might be related to internal and international migration\". (as of 2012, 48% of births in New Brunswick, 47.1% in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 45.2% in Nova Scotia, were listed to \"single mothers\", way above the national average). In British Columbia, the \"Family Law Act\" came into force in 2013.\nUnited States.\nCohabitation in the United States became common in the late 20th century. As of 2005[ [update]], 4.85\u00a0million unmarried couples were living together, and as of 2002[ [update]], about half of all women aged 15 to 44 had lived unmarried with a partner. In 2007, it is estimated that 6.4 million households were maintained by two opposite sex persons who said they were unmarried. In 2012, the General Social Survey found that public disapproval of cohabitation had dropped to 20% of the population.\nResearchers at the National Center for Family and Marriage Research estimated in 2011 that 66% of first marriages are entered after a period of cohabitation. According to the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau, the proportion of 30- to 44-year-olds living together has almost doubled since 1999, from 4% to 7%. Fifty-eight percent of women aged 19 to 44 had ever cohabited in data collected in 2006\u201308, while in 1987 only 33% had. Cohabitation is more prevalent among those with less education. \"Among women ages 19 to 44, 73% of those without a high school education have ever cohabited, compared with about half of women with some college (52%) or a college degree (47%),\" note the Pew study's authors, Richard Fry and D'Vera Cohn.\nBefore the mid-20th century, laws against cohabitation, fornication, adultery and other such behaviors were common in the US (especially in Southern and Northeastern states), but these laws have been gradually abolished or struck down by courts as unconstitutional.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cohabitation was almost impossible in the United States prior to the 1960s. Laws prevented unmarried couples from registering in hotels and it was very difficult for an unmarried couple to obtain a home mortgage. From 1960 to 1998, cohabitation moved from disreputable and difficult to normal and convenient.\nAs of December 2023, cohabitation of unmarried couples remains illegal in two states (Mississippi and North Carolina), while as of 2023 fornication remains illegal in two states (Georgia and South Carolina). These laws are almost never enforced and are now believed to be unconstitutional since the legal decision \"Lawrence v. Texas\" in 2003. However, these laws may have indirect effects. For example, one consequence may be that one may not claim their partner as a dependent (for a tax exemption), whereas in the other states it may be possible to do so after meeting four criteria: residency, income, support and status.\nIn 2006, in North Carolina, Pender County Superior Court judge Benjamin G. Alford ruled that North Carolina's cohabitation law is unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court of North Carolina has never had the opportunity to rule on it, so the law's statewide constitutionality remains unclear.\nOn 13 December 2013, US Federal judge Clark Waddoups ruled in \"Brown v. Buhman\" that the portions of Utah's anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. This decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, thus effectively recriminalizing polygamy as a felony. In 2020, Utah voted to downgrade polygamy from a felony to an infraction, but it remains a felony if force, threats or other abuses are involved. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act.\nLatin America.\nCohabitation in Latin America is becoming more common. Indeed, although this is a largely Roman Catholic region, it has the highest rates of non-marital childbearing in the world (55\u201374% of all children in this region are born to unmarried parents). In Mexico, 18.7% of all couples were cohabiting as of 2005[ [update]]. Among young people, the figures are much higher.\nAs of 2000, in Argentina 58% of births were to unmarried women.\nThe percentage of births outside marriage has increased throughout Latin America during the past decades, and there is also a relation to place of residence: women living in the capital city are more likely to have children outside marriage than those living in other parts of the country. Recent data shows figures for non-marital childbearing to be 74% for Colombia, 69% for Peru, 68% for Chile, 66% for Brazil and 55% for Mexico.\nAsia.\nNepal.\nIn Nepal, living together is socially acceptable only after marriage. However, cohabitation is an emerging trend in urban areas of Nepal. Reports have shown that there may be significant number of unmarried couples cohabiting in cities, especially in the capital, Kathmandu. Even when unmarried couples cohabit they either prefer to remain anonymous or pose themselves as a married couple. Cohabitation is not recognized by the law of Nepal and there is no special provision to secure the right of cohabitants in Nepalese law.\nBangladesh.\nIn Bangladesh, there are no laws prohibiting cohabitation but it is still socially unacceptable. However, cohabitation is becoming more common in urban areas due to western influence. An unmarried couple may feel immense pressure to marry by their family, and will probably choose to live as if they were married and, if exposed, can be expelled from housing or university. Cohabitation has become tolerant in recent years, especially among youths.\nChina.\nIn China, cohabitation has become popular among young adults. One study shows that the cohabitation rate before first marriage was over 20% for those born after 1977. Another recent study shows that cohabitation increases the divorce likelihood for those married in the early-reform period, but premarital cohabitation has no effect on divorce for those married in the late-reform period in China.\nIndia.\nCohabitation in India had been historically a taboo in traditional Hindu and Muslim societies. However, recently, this is more acceptable and relatively frequent in the middle and upper classes in the major cities and other urban areas, but is not as common in rural areas and smaller rural towns which are more social conservative. Legally recognised as Live-in relationships, they have been legal in India ever since independence. Recent Indian court rulings have ascribed some rights to long-term cohabiting partners. Female live-in partners have protection rights under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 subject to following conditions as laid by Honourable Supreme Court of India in case of \"D. Velusamy v D. Patchaiammal\":\nOn 12 June 2020, the Uttarakhand High Court reiterated in the case of Madhu Bala v. State of Uttarakhand and others (Habeas Corpus Petition No. 8 of 2020) that consensual cohabitation between two adults of the same-sex is legal and akin to an opposite sex relationship.\nIndonesia.\nIn Indonesia, an Islamic penal code proposed in 2005 would have made cohabitation punishable by up to two years in prison, but failed to pass. The practice is still frowned upon, and many low-end hotels and boarding houses have been raided by police for allowing unmarried couples to share a room.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, according to M. Iwasawa at the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, less than 3% of females between 25 and 29 are currently cohabiting, but more than one in five have had some experience of an unmarried partnership, including cohabitation. A more recent Iwasawa study has shown that there has been a recent emergence of non-marital cohabitation. Couples born in the 1950s cohort showed an incidence of cohabitation of 11.8%, where the 1960s and 1970s cohorts showed cohabitation rates of 30%, and 53.9% respectively. The split between urban and rural residence for people who had cohabited is indicates 68.8% were urban and 31.2% were rural.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, around 2.4\u00a0million Filipinos were cohabiting as of 2004[ [update]]. The 2000 census placed the percentage of cohabiting couples at 19%. The majority of individuals are between the ages of 20\u201324. Poverty was often the main factor in decision to cohabit.\nIran.\nIn Iran, the cohabitation of two people is known as 'white marriage'. According to researchers, the number of white marriages in Iranian metropolises is increasing.&lt;ref name=\"article/370805\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nUnder Iranian law, which is based on Islamic Sharia law, the cohabitation of a man and a woman outside the framework of official marriage is a crime.\nIt is estimated that the duration of a cohabitation in Iran is between one and three years. \nCohabitation has no place in Iran from traditional social, legal and religious points of view. However, cohabitation in Iran can be explained by considering recent cultural changes in Iranian society, including the growth of individualism, modernity, and fluid relationships, and the gaps and conflicts between values.\nVarious factors such as economic crises and cultural and social changes in cities are reasons for the increase in the number of cohabitation in Iran. In other words, the emergence of capitalism, the increase of job insecurity, the emergence of moral liberalism, the revision of cultural traditions, the anonymity of people in cities, the elimination of the concepts and functions of neighborhoods, changes in family structures and the emergence of temporary relationships are among the major reasons for white marriage in Iran.\nNew research published by social anthropologist Kameel Ahmady and his team under the title \"House with Open Door\": \"A Comprehensive Research Study on White Marriage (Cohabitation) in Iran\" reveals the previously concealed and multi-dimensional aspects of this phenomenon at the macro level, focusing on the Tehran, Mashhad and Isfahan metropolitan areas. The research pieces argues that this phenomenon is more prevalent among educated and post-graduate young people who have migrated to metropolitan areas for work and education.\nEurope.\nIn the European Union, cohabitation is very common. In 2014, 42% of all births in the 28 EU countries were nonmarital. In the following European countries the majority of births occur outside marriage: Iceland (69.9% in 2016), France (59.7% in 2016), Bulgaria (58.6% in 2016), Slovenia (58.6% in 2016), Norway (56.2% in 2016), Estonia (56.1% in 2016), Sweden (54.9% in 2016), Denmark (54% in 2016), Portugal (52.8% in 2016), and the Netherlands (50.4% in 2016).\nWhile couples of all ages cohabit, the phenomenon is much more common among younger people. In late 2005, 21% of families in Finland consisted of cohabiting couples (all age groups). Of couples with children, 18% were cohabiting. Of ages 18 and above in 2003, 13.4% were cohabiting. Generally, cohabitation amongst Finns is most common for people under 30. Legal obstacles for cohabitation were removed in 1926 in a reform of the Criminal Code, while the phenomenon was socially accepted much later on. In France, 17.5% of couples were cohabiting as of 1999.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom today, nearly half of babies are born to people who are not married (in the United Kingdom 47.3% in 2011; in Scotland in 2012 the proportion was 51.3%). It is estimated that by 2016, the majority of births in the United Kingdom will be to unmarried parents.\nThe Victorian era of the late 19th century is famous for the Victorian standards of personal morality. Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards and rejected cohabitation. They have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births in London slums. However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low\u2014under 5% \u2013 for the working class and the urban poor.\nFalling marriage rates and increased births outside marriage have become a political issue, with questions of whether the government should promote marriage or focus on the status of a parent rather than a spouse; the Conservative Party support the former whilst Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats support the latter. There are also differences between England and Wales and Scotland, with the latter being more accepting of cohabitation.\nBulgaria.\nIn Bulgaria, there has been a rapid increase in cohabitation after the fall of Communism. The transition from communism to market economy had a great impact on the demographic behavior of the population. After the fall of Communism, the legal and social pressure to get married has declined, and the population has started to experience new life styles. As of 2014, 58.8% of children were born to unmarried mothers.\nCzech Republic.\nThe marriage rates in Czech Republic have fallen dramatically during the past decades. In the 1970s to 1980s, about 96\u201397% of women married; in 2000 it was estimated that only 75% of women would ever marry. The age at first marriage for women has increased from being in the range of 21.4\u201321.8 years in the 1970s and 1980s, to being 29.6 in 2011. In the early 1990s, predictions were made by some Czech demographers that cohabitation would increase during the next decades; and indeed, there has been a marked increase in the number of people who live in non-marital couple relations. In 2016, 48.6% of births were to unmarried women.\nGermany.\nUntil the 1980s, it was illegal for unmarried couples to cohabitate, which made it impossible for many same-sex couples to live together. At this point the Bundesgerichtshof ruled that cohabitation could not be banned as it was protected by the Basic Law.\nAs in other western societies, patterns of family life have been changing in Germany during the past decades. This has not created a moral panic, but has been seen more as an ongoing social evolution. Cohabitation, divorce rates, lone parents, and people's reluctance to marry or to have children have increased. However, with regards to family formation and long term cohabitation instead of marriage, there are very strong differences between the regions of former West Germany and East Germany (which was formally Communist). Significantly more children are born out of wedlock in eastern Germany than in western Germany. In 2012, in eastern Germany 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, while in western Germany only 28.4% were. A longitudinal survey found that union stability was significantly higher for cohabiting mothers in eastern Germany than western Germany, due to differences in German society.\nGreece.\nIn Greece, family dynamics remain conservative. The principal form of partnership is marriage, and extramarital childbearing and long term cohabitation are not widespread. For instance, in 2016 only 9.4% of births were outside marriage, which is the lowest percentage among the European Union member states. Religion in Greece plays a very important role in society; it was only in 1983 that civil marriage was introduced in the country. The new laws modernized family law, abolished dowry, and provided for equal rights for \"illegitimate\" children. According to a 2008 study: \"Greek society still remains conservative and birthing outside marriage, although protected by law, remains in many ways socially unacceptable.\" Despite this, there have been further legal changes providing for a modern \"western\" outlook on family life, including Law 3719/2008 dealing with family issues, including Article 14 of the law, which reduced the separation period (necessary before a divorce in certain circumstances) from four years to two years.\nHungary.\nThe literature on second demographic transition argues as well that highly educated women are more prone to engage in cohabitation, although the reasons are different: they are less concerned with respecting the societal norms. Some scholars argued that cohabitation is very similar to being single in the sense of not giving up independence and personal autonomy.\nIn Hungary, cohabitation was an uncommon phenomenon until the late 1980s and it was largely confined to the divorced or widowed individuals. Among the ethnic groups, Gypsy/Roma tended to have higher rates of cohabitation, mainly due to their reluctance to register their marriages officially. Since the 1980s, cohabitation became much more frequent among all ethnic groups and it has been argued to have strongly influenced the decline in fertility. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women.\nIreland.\nCohabitation in Ireland has increased in recent years, and 36.6% of births were to unmarried women in 2016. Until a few decades ago, women who had children outside marriage were severely stigmatized and often detained in Magdalene laundries. The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 gives some rights to unmarried cohabitants (under this act same-sex couples can enter into civil partnerships, while long term unmarried couples \u2013 both heterosexual and same sex \u2013 who have not registered their relation have some limited rights and obligations).\nItaly.\nIn Italy, where Roman Catholicism had a historically strong presence, cohabitation is not as common as in other countries of Europe, yet it has increased in recent years. There are significant regional differences, with non-marital unions being more common in Northern Italy than in Southern Italy. A study published in 2006 found that long term cohabitation was still novel to Italy, though more common among young people. As of 2015, the share of births outside marriage was 28.7%, but this varied by statistical regions as follows: Central Italy (33.8%), Northeast Italy (33.1%), Northwest Italy (31.3%), Insular Italy (24.2%), and South Italy (20.3%).\nThe Netherlands.\nDutch researchers have found that research participants see cohabitation as a risk-reduction strategy in a country with high relationship instability. As of 2016, 50.4% births were to unmarried women.\nNorway.\nCohabitation is a common type of partnership in Norway. Cohabitants have some rights if they have joint children, or if they have lived together for five years. Cohabitants can also regulate their relationship through a cohabitation agreement. In Norway, in 2016, 56.2% of children were born outside marriage.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, after the fall of Communism, the influence of religion has increased. Indeed, Poland has one of the most religious populations in Europe (see religion in Europe). Cohabitation in Poland has traditionally been associated with the lower social classes, but in recent years an increase has been seen among the more educated. Family structure in Poland remains traditional: Marriages are contracted at relatively young ages, and the incidence of divorce is relatively low (by European standards). The exact incidence of cohabitation is not well established, but it is quite low compared to other Western countries. However, Poland is not completely 'immune' to Western influence and, in 2016, 25% of children were born outside marriage.\nSlovakia.\nSlovakia is more conservative and religious than neighboring Czech Republic. The principal form of partnership is marriage, but extramarital childbearing and cohabitation are slowly spreading, yet this trend is not without criticism; and some view these phenomena as a threat to traditional values. In 2016, 40.2% of births were to unmarried women. Fertility in Slovakia has been described in a 2008 study as \"between tradition and modernity\".\nSwitzerland.\nSwitzerland has a tradition of strong conservatism; which can be seen in its legal and social history: in Europe, Switzerland was one of the last countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). Adultery was decriminalized in 1989. Until the late 20th century, most cantons had regulations banning unmarried cohabitation of couples; the last canton to end such prohibition was Valais, in 1995. As of 2015, 22.5% of births were to unmarried women.\nBirths outside marriage are most common in the French speaking part (highest percentage in the cantons of Vaud, Neuch\u00e2tel, Geneva, Jura) and least common in the eastern German speaking cantons (lowest percentage in the cantons of St. Gallen, Zug, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden).\nSpain.\nSpanish society has undergone major changes since the fall of the Franco regime. Important legal changes which have occurred throughout the 1970s and 1980s include legalization of divorce, decriminalization of adultery, gender equality in family law, and removing the ban on contraception. The liberalization of the political climate has allowed for alternative family formation. In the mid-1990s, cohabitation in Spain was still described as a \"marginal\" phenomenon, but since the 1990s, cohabitation has increased dramatically in Spain. In Spain, in 2016, 45.9% of births were outside marriage. As in other countries, there are regional differences: in 2011, in Catalonia the figure was 42% \u2013 highest in mainland Spain in that year (Canary Islands 59% and Balearic Islands 43.5% were highest) while in Murcia it was only 30.7% (lowest).\nRussia.\nIn Russia, many couples express a desire to cohabit before marriage, then register a civil marriage, and then at a later stage have a large church wedding.\nMiddle East.\nThe cohabitation rate in West Asian countries is much lower than in European countries. In some parts of the continent it is however becoming more common for young people. As of 1994, the rate of premarital cohabitation in Israel was 25%.\nCohabitation is illegal according to Sunni sharia law. Cohabitation, Bi'ah, is a legal status, \"Yadua BetTzibbur\", by the Jews Halakha (Halacha) religious Law.\nKuwait.\nSome legal recognition is extended to former common-law unions in Kuwait. Kuwaiti Family law applies the law of the father's, husband's or male partner's country in case of expatriate familial disputes. Hence, if the father's country of nationality recognises common-law marriages (like the United Kingdom), matters such as child support dues and maintenance can be considered in a Kuwaiti court. However, out-of-marriage sexual intercourse is an offence punishable in Kuwait with a prison sentence between 6 months and 6 years if caught in action by an official or an administrative deportation order. This meaning that common-law marriage recognition can only be practically seen in exceptional cases like where the illegitimate child was born aboard and/or former couples who have since expatriated to Kuwait. Single expat parents including expat mothers can legally sponsor their children for residency permits. Couples where one or both parties are Kuwaiti are covered by local family law and hence do not have recourse to the limited recognition of common-law marriage.\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nChildren born out-of-wedlock are given partial recognition. Their single expat mother or single expat father can sponsor them for residency. However, sexual relations outside of marriage were illegal in the UAE until November 2020, when restrictions were eased.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, 22% of couples were cohabiting as of 2005[ [update]]. 78% of couples who marry have lived together beforehand in 2008, rising from 16% in 1975. In 2013, 34% of all births were to unmarried women. Australia recognizes de facto relationships. The proportion of births outside marriage varies by state/territory, being, in 2009, lowest in Victoria (at 28%), Australian Capital Territory (at 29%), and New South Wales (at 30%); and highest in Northern Territory (at 63%) and Tasmania (at 51%).\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand according to the 2001 census, 20.5% of couples were in \"de facto\" relationships. In New Zealand, 23.7% of couples were cohabiting as of 2006. In 2010, 48% of births were outside marriage. Like Australia, New Zealand recognizes \"de facto\" relationships.\nAfrica.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, the 2011 census revealed that of South Africans aged 20 or older, 43.7% had never been married, 36.7% were married at the time of the census, 11.0% were living together like married partners. Civil marriages fell by 22,5% between 2011 and 2019 and declined by a further 31,1% in 2020.\nIn popular culture.\nOne example of how cohabitation is referenced in popular culture is in the 1978 novel Prudence by British author Jilly Cooper, where it is used as an example of where American language used to describe relationships - in this case \"permanent commitment\" - and is mocked in popular culture.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its mouth is formed by the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the eastern side and Dauphin Island, a barrier island on the western side. The Mobile River and Tensaw River empty into the northern end of the bay, making it an estuary. Several smaller rivers also empty into the bay: Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River on the western side of the bay, and Fish River on the eastern side. Mobile Bay is the fourth-largest estuary in the United States with a discharge of of water per second. Annually, and often several times during the summer months, the fish and crustaceans will swarm the shallow coastline and shore of the bay. This event, appropriately named a jubilee, draws a large crowd because of the abundance of fresh, easily caught seafood.\nMobile Bay is in area. It is long by a maximum width of . The deepest areas of the bay are located within the shipping channel, sometimes in excess of deep, but the average depth of the bay is .\nHistory.\nLong occupied by cultures of indigenous peoples, this area was still under the chiefs of Mississippian culture at the time of Hernando de Soto's exploration.\nThe recorded history of Mobile Bay begins about 1500, when Spanish explorers were sailing into the area. On early maps, the bay was named as \"Bah\u00eda del Esp\u00edritu Santo\" (Bay of the Holy Spirit). The area was explored in more detail in 1516 by Diego Miruelo and in 1519 by Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda. In 1528, P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez travelled through what was likely the Mobile Bay area, encountering Native Americans who fled and burned their towns at the approach of the expedition. This response was a prelude to the journeys of Hernando de Soto, more than eleven years later.\nEuropean exploration into the region.\nHernando de Soto explored the area of Mobile Bay and beyond in 1540, finding the area inhabited by indigenous Mississippian culture people. During this expedition his forces destroyed the fortified town of Mauvila, also spelled Maubila, from which the name Mobile was later derived. It was a town of the paramount Chief Tuscaloosa, located in inland Alabama, well to the north of the current site of Mobile. The next large expedition was that of Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano, in his unsuccessful attempt to establish a permanent colony for Spain nearby at Pensacola in 1559.\nAlthough Spain's presence in the area had been sporadic, in 1702 French colonists created a deep-sea port at Dauphin Island and founded French Louisiana's capital at Mobile, a few miles north of Mobile Bay on the Mobile River. Following a series of floods, the original settlement of \"Fort Louis de la Mobile\" was relocated in 1711 to the head of Mobile Bay.\nRole in wars.\nDuring the American Civil War Mobile Bay was used as a major port for blockade runners bringing in badly needed supplies for the Confederacy. On August 5, 1864, Admiral David Farragut led a Union flotilla through Confederate defenses and sealed off one of the last major Southern ports of the bay in the Battle of Mobile Bay. A number of Civil War-era shipwrecks remain in Mobile Bay, including \"American Diver\", CSS \"Gaines\", CSS \"Huntsville\", USS \"Philippi\", CSS \"Phoenix\", USS \"Rodolph\", USS \"Tecumseh\", and CSS \"Tuscaloosa\".\nMobile's role as a seaport has continued to the present day, though the commodities have changed through time. Cotton was the chief commodity in the nineteenth century. During the Second World War, Mobile's shipbuilding industry expanded, and the city's population surged as both black and white migrants moved there for work. Growth has been rapid since then.\nNatural disasters in the area.\nThe city has endured several devastating hurricanes in its history, the most recent being Hurricane Frederic in 1979 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Areas of low elevation, including the downtown business district, have been flooded repeatedly in hurricanes. However, much of the city is at an elevation exceeding above sea level, which is unusually high for the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.\nOn September 13, 1979, Hurricane Frederic entered the bay with winds reaching , destroying the bridge to Dauphin Island. On August 28\u201329, 2005, Hurricane Katrina pushed a massive storm surge into Mobile Bay; it measured high at Bayou La Batre (Alabama), with higher waves on top, and high at Mobile, at the far northern end of the 31-mile-long Mobile Bay. Thousands of boats, piers, and beach houses were damaged by waves exceeding high, and the battleship was pushed off her moorings, leaving her listing to port (tilted to the left). Downtown Mobile was flooded several feet, and the south-end towns of Bayou La Batre and Bon Secour were severely damaged. Dozens of vessels of various sizes were left stranded inland.\nShoreline towns.\nThe city of Mobile is situated at the head of the bay on the western shore. On the Eastern Shore of the bay are found several small communities, including Spanish Fort, Daphne, Fairhope, Point Clear, and Bon Secour. The town of Gulf Shores lies just outside the bay, on the Fort Morgan peninsula, while the town of Fort Morgan is located directly south of the bay. The Middle Bay Lighthouse has been located in the center of the bay since 1885.\nThe head of the bay is crossed by two major thoroughfares, Interstate 10, known as the Jubilee Parkway, and US 90/US 98, known as the Battleship Parkway. These two bridges serve as the primary connections between the city of Mobile and the Eastern Shore. On warm summer nights, the residents living around Mobile Bay sometimes enjoy the fruits of a mysterious natural phenomenon called a Jubilee, when fish and crabs swarm toward shore and can be easily harvested by people wading in the shallows.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

IMSO ensures that the provision of maritime mobile satellite communications services (currently provided by Inmarsat Ltd and Iridium Ltd).\nHistory.\nINMARSAT.\nThe International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) was established under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization by the Convention on the International Maritime Satellite Organization, signed at London on 3 September 1976 and entered into force on 16 July 1979. The organization was modeled after Intelsat, an international consortium which provided satellite communications among the member countries. The Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), a founding member of Intelsat, took the lead in the founding of Inmarsat. In coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization in the 1980s, the convention governing INMARSAT was amended to include improvements in aeronautical communications, notably for public safety.\nThe first Director General was appointed in January 1980 and operations began in 1982. Olof Lundberg, who had previously managed and developed mobile and specialized services at Swedish Telecom (now Telia), served as Director General and CEO until 1995.\nIMSO.\nIn the mid-1990s, there was contrasting views among member states for the agency's future. There was a growing realization among the member states that the organization's business assets needed to be privatized, mainly because of the competitive nature of the satellite communication industry and the unwillingness of many member states to invest money into INMARSAT to improve its network. There were also many which believed in the importance of maintaining the organization's role in overseeing maritime satellite communication. The issue was resolved in a session in April 1998, which resulted in the amendment of the Convention on the International Mobile Satellite Organization, in which the operational assets would be split and privatized while the agency would continue as a regulatory organization.\nOn 15 April 1999, INMARSAT became the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO). At the time, the operational assets of INMARSAT were separated to become Inmarsat Ltd., a private UK-based company which agreed to inherit, overseen by the IMSO, certain public safety obligations related to the satellite system's operation.\nAn agreement between the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the IMSO was signed in Montreal, Canada, on 20 September 2000 and addresses the relationship between ICAO and IMSO. As of November 2018, Inmarsat has 103 state parties that represent approximately 95 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant fleet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term comes from the Hebrew Bible (see, \"Old Testament\"), initially concerning a recurring religious observance involving a set number of years, that notably involved freeing of debt slaves. Emperors of ancient Rome customarily marked anniversaries of their rule with celebrations, although they did not use the term \"jubilee.\" Jubilee is also a term used in Roman Catholicism for special years. The term came into English usage from translation of the Bible, together with customary celebration of a reign, and at least since the 19th century is regularly used to denote the celebrations associated with the reign of monarchs after a milestone number of years have passed.\nReligious usage.\nThe jubilee ( \"yovel\") year (every 50th year) and the sabbatical year (every seventh year) are Biblical commandments concerning ownership of land and slaves. The laws concerning the sabbatical year are still observed by many religious Jews in the State of Israel, while the jubilee has not been observed for many centuries, if at all (before the 'peshitto' era of the Vulgate-inspired bible). According to the Hebrew Bible, every seventh year farmers in the land of Israel are commanded to let their land lie fallow, and slaves were freed. The celebration of the jubilee is the fiftieth year, that is, the year after seven sabbatical cycles. Jubilee was to recognize that by tradition all property belongs to God, not the individual Jew. For the Jew, returning of possessions to God was/is a religious vow or dedication.\nIn Roman Catholic tradition, a jubilee is \"a special year called by the church to receive blessing and pardon from God\" instituted every 50 or 25 years since the year 1300.\nTerms for anniversaries.\nFollowing the model of Augustus, the Roman emperors typically celebrated major jubilees on the 10th years of their reigns. The decennalia marked the 10th year, the vicennalia the 20th, and\u2014in the case of Constantine the Great\u2014the tricennalia the 30th. Smaller festivals sometimes occurred on the 5th years between these. For modern monarchs, the dates are typically connected with precious metals and gemstones:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Repeats are regularly aired on the Food Network in Canada, the Cooking Channel in the United States until Asian-American specialty television channel ChimeTV took over reruns in 2022, and on Special Broadcasting Service in Australia; in the United States, it is streamed by Peacock TV and Pluto TV. There are 5 spinoffs, with the latest being \"\".\nFuji TV aired a new version of the show, titled , premiering on October 26, 2012.\nFeatures &amp; Story.\nThe host of the show is the flamboyant Takeshi Kaga, known on the show as the aristocrat . He begins most episodes with his signature words, taken from Arthur Rimbaud, \"If memory serves me right...\"(Jadis) \"si je me souviens bien\"...\" and starts the cooking time with the phrase \"\"Allez Cuisine!\". The show has two regular commentators, Kenji Fukui, who narrated the action on the floor, and Yukio Hattori, a food scholar and founder of the Hattori Nutrition College. A floor reporter, Shinichiro Ohta, reports to Fukui on what the challengers and Iron Chefs are preparing, their strategy, and their comments, breaking Fukui's train of commentary with a polite \"Fukui-san?\"\". One or two guest commentators (who also serve as judges) also made frequent appearances. The commentary covers ingredients, history of contenders, and other background information to give viewers context for what was happening in the kitchen.\nThe kayfabe \"story\" behind \"Iron Chef\" is recounted at the beginning of every episode of the English dub. A title card, with a quote from famed French food author Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin first appeared: \"Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.\" Then, it was said that Kaga \"realized his dream in a form never seen before\" and specially constructed a cooking arena called \"Kitchen Stadium\". There, visiting chefs from \"around the world\" would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself was a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire. The English name \"Iron Chef\" comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs at the beginning of the \"battle\".\nIron Chefs &amp; Statistics.\nFrom the beginning of the show in 1993, the three Iron Chefs were: Iron Chef Japanese Rokusaburo Michiba, Iron Chef Chinese Chen Kenichi, and Iron Chef French Yutaka Ishinabe. After the first season, Ishinabe decided to step down and become an 'honorary Iron Chef', thus passing the mantle of Iron Chef French to Hiroyuki Sakai in 1994. Ishinabe returned for two more battles during season three. At the beginning of season four in 1996, Michiba announced his retirement and debuted Koumei Nakamura as the new Iron Chef Japanese. Michiba returned on rare occasions for special Kitchen Stadium battles. In 1997, Chairman Kaga announced a new, additional Iron Chef to the group: Iron Chef Italian Masahiko Kobe. He was the youngest of the Iron Chefs and battled sparingly throughout the rest of the show, ascending to the stage separately from the three main Iron Chefs, and surrounded by a chamber string ensemble. In 1998, Nakamura also decided to retire and passed the title of Iron Chef Japanese to Masaharu Morimoto.\nOn-Screen Talent &amp; Show Staff.\nThe show staff was gleaned from many of the original Japanese episodes.\nOriginal format.\nOriginally, challengers vied with each other in preliminary \"battles\" to earn the right to face an Iron Chef in a 90-minute competition, and should a challenger win twice against Iron Chefs, the challenger would be given the title of \"Honorary Iron Chef\". However, this format proved unpopular, the preliminary round was scrapped and the main contest was reduced to the now familiar 60 minutes. The awarding of honorary Iron Chef titles to challengers was also discontinued (although this was largely a moot point as few challengers ever defeated two Iron Chefs in separate contests), but was given as an emeritus title for a retiring Iron Chef. Once honorary titles were no longer issued, challengers who beat an Iron Chef had to settle for, according to the English version's introduction, \"the people's ovation and fame forever\".\nIn each episode, chefs have one hour to cook and improvise a multicourse meal around a theme ingredient that must be present in each dish. Before the actual taping, the chefs are given a short list of possible themes, allowing the producers of the show to get any ingredients that may be needed. Judges' primary goal was said to be determining which chef was able to \"best express the unique qualities of the theme ingredient\". In rare cases, the format changed\u2014angler fish battles were typically 75 minutes in length, and noodle battles had the Iron Chef stop after 50 minutes of cooking, only to resume after the challenger's dishes were tasted so that the noodles could be served right after cooking.\nPreliminary Round.\nThe first five episodes featured a preliminary round between five challengers. The one who made the dish that impressed the judges the most would battle the Iron Chef. Challengers who are bolded were the winners of this round.\nOctober 10, 1993 (Theme dish: Gyoza)\nOctober 17, 1993 (Theme dish: Omelet rice)\nOctober 31, 1993 (Theme dish: Spaghetti)\nNovember 7, 1993 (Theme dish: Croquettes)\nNovember 14, 1993 (Theme dish: Spring rolls)\nTheme ingredients.\nFeatured ingredients tend toward the exotic and expensive. Many theme ingredients reflect the Japanese origin of the show\u2014river eel, tofu, udon\u2014though ingredients more familiar in the West, such as bell peppers, summer corn, and peaches, are spotlighted, as well. In one episode devoted to asparagus, the challenger boasted that he used over $1,000 worth of lobster (which he then discarded) simply to flavor his asparagus in this battle against Iron Chef Morimoto.\nInitially, a minimum of three dishes was to be prepared, although some challengers have finished only a single dish; four is the typical number. The record for highest number of dishes prepared for a battle was eight, first set by challenger Kenji Kaji against Iron Chef Michiba in \"Battle Umeboshi\". Five (later six) servings of each dish are prepared, one each for the chairman and judges, and one for photography and presentation.\nAssistant chefs.\nEach chef is also given two assistants, who are supposedly students of Kaga's \"Gourmet Academy\" (in reality, they are students of Hattori Nutrition College). If the challenger does not speak Japanese, students who can speak in the challenger's native language are sometimes provided. In a notable exception, San Francisco chef Ron Siegel struggled with his assistants, who did not speak English. One assistant, Kenichi Miyanaga, became a challenger himself, taking on Iron Chef Morimoto in a sweetfish battle.\nCommentary and judging.\nThroughout the cook-off, running commentary is made in a booth near the cooking area by an announcer, Kenji Fukui; a commentator, Yukio Hattori, and one or two of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally Shinichiro Ohta) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show's screenwriters based on the chef's explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four, and later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes the dishes and judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality. Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with 10 given for taste and five each for presentation and originality. The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef who makes the highest points total.)\nBeginning in October 1995, in addition to expanding the number of judges from three to four, a scoring system was issued. As many as 20 points from each judge for a total of 80 could be earned. Below are two examples of how judging and scoring worked:\nChairman Kaga tastes the dishes along with the judges. While he occasionally makes comments and seeks input from judges during tasting, he generally does not participate in scoring; he did do so, however, during the \"2000th Dish\" Battle. During this episode, a team of French cuisine chefs\u2014captain Hiroyuki Sakai, the original Iron Chef French Yutaka Ishinabe, and former challenger Etsuo Joh\u2014battled a team of Chinese cuisine chefs composed of captain Chen Kenichi, former challenger Sozo Myamoto, and former challenger Yuji Wakiya (who would later be Iron Chef Chinese on the 2012 revival). To break the tie, Chairman Kaga asked them to allow him this one instance of selfishness, and he cast his vote for the French team.\nTies.\nIn the case of a deadlock (as was possible during the era of the four-judge panel), first place is awarded to the chef with the greater number of points. On the rare occasions that the scores were also tied, an immediate \"overtime battle\" was held to determine the winner. In overtime, the chefs are given 30 minutes to prepare dishes with a different key ingredient, having to make do with what remains of their pantry or with items that were previously prepared for the main battle. The overtime battles are aired as a separate episode. On one occasion, the overtime battle itself resulted in a tie, prompting Chairman Kaga to declare both the Iron Chef and challenger winners.\nBroadcast history.\nThe stage setting for the show, , the high-quality (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in the cooking battles, and Kaga's extravagant costumes required the show to have a budget far higher than those of most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of \"foie gras\", 54 sea bream, 827 \"Ise\" shrimp, 964 \"matsutake\" mushrooms, 4,593 eggs, 1,489 truffles, 4,651\u00a0g of caviar, and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to \u00a5843,354,407 (or about $7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle Swallow's Nest, which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark's fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.\nFinal episode and specials.\nFor the show's grand finale, aired from September 10, 1999, to September 24, 1999, the Iron Chefs faced off against each other in a three-part battle, with the winner to face French chef Alain Passard, owner of Michelin three-star restaurant L'Arpege, with the winner dubbed the \"King of Iron Chefs\".\nIn the first round, Iron Chef Chinese Chen defeated Iron Chef Italian Kobe in Battle Pork (Tokyo X). In the second round, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto in Battle Bell Pepper. In the final match, Sakai defeated Chen in Battle Homard Lobster and was dubbed \"King of Iron Chefs\". Prior to that episode, Sakai had never won a lobster battle.\nIn the final bonus match in Kitchen Stadium, with all of the current and previous Iron Chefs looking on, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Alain Passard in Battle Long-Gang Chicken. Thus, Hiroyuki Sakai was dubbed as both \"King of Iron Chefs\" and \"The No. 1 in the World\".\nTwo reunion specials were produced in 2000. The first was \"The Millennium Special\"; the second was \"New York Special\", staged in a makeshift Kitchen Stadium at Webster Hall in New York City, and was the first appearance of Bobby Flay. Dave Spector served as translator and commentator. The New York special also included Michiba and Morimoto on Gordon Elliott's \"Door Knock Dinners\" (with footage aired on both shows) surprising a family in Rye by preparing dinner for them with just leftovers and other items in the family's refrigerator. Another reunion episode of the show (entitled \"Iron Chef: 21st Century Battle\") was produced and broadcast in 2001. A final reunion episode was produced and broadcast in 2002, entitled \"The Japan Cup\". This special was hosted by celebrity Masahiro Motoki, and began with a mock funeral for the character of Chairman Kaga, citing fugu poisoning as his cause of death.\nSakai, Chen, Kobe and Michiba, along with celebrity chefs including Chen's son Chen Kentaro and Singaporean patissier Janice Wong, also participated in an Iron Chef All Stars charity dinner at the Sydney Opera House in August 2017 that raised AU$26,500 for Opportunity International Australia and was eventually Kobe's last Iron Chef event before his death.\nUnited States reception, International Syndication, and U.S. streaming.\nBeginning on September 9, 1995 with Battle Sole from July 7 of that same year, \"Iron Chef\" was shown on KTSF in San Francisco, and other stations such as KSCI in Long Beach, Nippon Golden Network in Hawaii, and WMBC-TV in the New York City area following suit, in its original Japanese version with English subtitles, and quickly became a cult hit. In the summer of 1998, the show stopped using subtitles; Fuji TV released a statement saying that the show was intended as a \"service to the Japanese community abroad\" and due to Japanese copyright laws were to be aired without subtitles, which had previously been provided \"inadvertently\". KTSF continued to air the show until the station reached the end of its six-year run around February 2000.\nWhile always a success in Japan, \"Iron Chef\" became a surprise hit in the United States when it was picked up by the Food Network in 1999, beginning on July 9, and dubbed into English, continuing to do so until December 3, 2004. Part of the U.S. appeal was due to the dubbing, which gave the show a campy charm that evoked English-dubbed Chinese kung fu movies of the 1970s. Audiences also found amusing some of the over-the-top culinary concoctions regularly featured on the show, eventually leading to a spoof on \"Saturday Night Live\".\nThe Japanese channel SKY PerfecTV! has aired extended uncut versions (meaning with the complete hour-long cooking time) of some of the 1994-middle of 1995 episodes, consisting of footage that was not seen on Fuji TV when they originally aired. These extended versions ran for 85 minutes without commercials. Regular episodes were 37 minutes and 30 seconds minus commercials (25 minutes early on), with 48 minutes being typically edited out.\nThe show was presented in the United States and Canada on the Food Network, dubbed and/or subtitled into English. It was also broadcast on SBS TV in Australia. In the case of SBS, this is unusual as the network has a policy favoring in-house subtitling of acquired programs; it may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps by the fact that in most episodes, the flamboyant chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed.\nThe show was also broadcast on the Finnish channel SubTV, and the Swedish channel TV400 (TV4). \"Iron Chef\" was broadcast on Challenge in the UK in 2003 and 2004, as part of its \"Japanese Christmas Cracker\" and \"Japanorama\" strands.\nThe show had again aired in the U.S. on the Fine Living Network from May 5, 2008, until the channel went off the air on May 30, 2010; however, the music from earlier broadcasts, taken from international films such as \"Backdraft\" and \"A Zed &amp; Two Noughts\", had been replaced due to music-licensing issues with NBC Universal. The Cooking Channel picked up the series on June 1, 2010, when it replaced Fine Living. The stations that have carried the series, Fine Living, Cooking Channel, and Food Network, are all owned by Scripps Networks Interactive.\nFilmRise acquired the exclusive rights to the original Iron Chef episodes in October 2021. The following month, episodes began streaming for free on Paramount's Pluto TV service.\nSince the acquisition by FilmRise, Iron Chef has begun to appear on U.S. Streaming services. As of June 2022, this includes FuboTV, PlutoTV, Peacock and Amazon Prime (via Freevee). These episodes are not presented in strict broadcast order; they are dubbed and have different music than the original broadcasts. Two episodes with Masahiko Kondo as a Judge that were shown on Food Network were not listed on FilmRise.\nNotable challengers.\nCertain challengers have made repeat appearances, or have been particularly memorable (including if they were the lone chefs specializing in their particular cuisines in the show's history).\n An interesting side note is that the second female challenger, cooking show host Katsuyo Kobayashi, also faced Chen. Kobayashi indirectly picked Chen because she allowed Kaga to pick for her. Chen lost both battles, and purportedly caught some flak from chef-friends of his. Chen fought another two female challengers in separate battles and won.\nNotable judges.\nThe result of a battle may be influenced by the lineup of judges, which changes from show to show. A list of some of the more notable judges, some of which were previous Iron Chefs or challengers, includes:\n \"These names are not in the traditional East Asian style [i.e. family name first] but have been written in standard western style [i.e. family name last], as they appeared on the English dub of the show.\"\nNotable dishes.\nDuring the 2,000th Dish Battle, Chairman Kaga selected the five best and three worst dishes from the history of the show.\n2012 revival.\nIn 2012, Fuji Television announced that it was recording new episodes of \"Iron Chef\". The first episode debuted on October 26, 2012, as a two-hour special, thereafter reverting to a one-hour show airing on Friday evenings at 19:57 Japan time. Unlike the original \"Ry\u014dri no Tetsujin\", the new show was titled Iron Chef (\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5) in katakana characters. The chairman's role was assumed by Japanese actor Hiroshi Tamaki. Fuji TV commentator Mizuki Sano hosted the program, and the reporters were Yurika Mita and Daisuke Miyagawa. Dr. Yukio Hattori returned from the original \"Iron Chef\" series to provide commentary. Three new Iron Chefs were chosen; Jun Kurogi as Iron Chef Japanese, Y\u016bji Wakiya as Iron Chef Chinese, and Y\u014dsuke Suga as Iron Chef French.\nThe first battle in the new show was a two-hour special with two battles. The first challenger was former Kitchen Stadium challenger (referred as \"nominee\") Kenichi Miyanaga, recommended by Iron Chef Rokusaburo Michiba. Miyanaga is Michiba's top apprentice and battled Iron Chef Suga. The challenger (\"nominee\") in the second battle was Kentaro Chen, recommended by his father Iron Chef Chen Kenichi, who battled Iron Chef Wakiya.\nIt was announced, after airing thirteen episodes, that the new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013. Mr. Tatematsu, General Manager of Editing, explained, \u0081\"Iron Chef is a high quality show and we can say it is FujiTV\u0081's treasure. Currently we are struggling for the ratings. We think we have a time slot problem, too, so we would like to consider about a way to make it as special program and forward it into the next stage.\u0081\" On July 3, 2013, the Iron Chefs reunited for an American Chef Special with beef as the secret ingredient. All three Iron Chefs were paired with an American challenger, and then for a fourth round, all six competed. Currently, there are no plans for any more Iron Chef specials.\nInternational editions.\n\"Iron Chef America\".\n\"Iron Chef USA\".\nAround Christmas 2001, the UPN network presented two one-hour episodes of \"Iron Chef USA\" hosted by William Shatner as \"The Chairman of the American Culinary Academy\". Competition took place inside \"Kitchen Arena\" (built in Garden Arena in the Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel). Commentary was provided by Michael Burger and Anthony Dias Blue, with floor reporting by Sissy Biggers. The show featured four Iron Chefs: Iron Chef American Todd English (whose specialty is actually Mediterranean food), Iron Chef French Jean Francois Meteigner, Iron Chef Italian Alessandro Stratta, and Iron Chef Asian Roy Yamaguchi. In the show's only two battles, English defeated Kerry Simon in a dungeness crab battle, and Stratta defeated Marcus Samuelsson in a turkey battle.\nThese shows were neither a critical nor popular success, perhaps because the show focused little on cooking\u2014a major part of the Japanese program. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.\n\"Iron Chef America\".\nIn 2004, Food Network announced that it would air an Iron Chef special, called \"Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters\", featuring Sakai and Morimoto dueling with American Iron Chefs Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, and Wolfgang Puck, all Food Network personalities and renowned American celebrity chefs. (Morimoto and Flay battled in two previous Iron Chef specials that were made after the original series aired.) The specials featured Alton Brown as the announcer and Mark Dacascos playing the role of The Chairman (in the storyline, this chairman is the nephew of Takeshi Kaga).\nThe show received high ratings and rave reviews and in October 2004, and Food Network began taping weekly episodes that premiered starting in January 2005. Some changes were made to the show, most notably replacing Puck with Morimoto as an Iron Chef (a fourth Iron Chef, Cat Cora, was added later), and the location was moved from Los Angeles to New York City. The fifth Iron Chef, Michael Symon, was added after his win in \"The Next Iron Chef\". In 2009, Chef Jose Garces became the sixth Iron Chef following his own victory in the second season of that show. In 2010, Chef Marc Forgione won its third season, becoming the seventh Iron Chef on Iron Chef America. Chef Geoffrey Zakarian won that show's fourth season in 2011, making him the eighth Iron Chef. In 2012, Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli, who had served as Sous Chef on Iron Chef episodes, became the ninth after winning the fifth season of \"The Next Iron Chef\", while Stephanie Izard became the tenth and final Iron Chef.\nEven though both Todd English and Kerry Simon from \"Iron Chef USA\" competed on \"Iron Chef America\", the episodes did not mention their IC-USA appearances.\n\"Iron Chef Gauntlet\".\n\"Iron Chef Gauntlet\" is a two-season reformat of \"Iron Chef America\" where seven chefs from around the country compete in an elimination contest, with the last chef remaining facing a \"gauntlet\" challenge of defeating three other Iron Chefs in order to earn the title. It aired from 2017 to 2018\n\"Iron Chef Showdown\".\n\"Iron Chef Showdown\" was a reimagining of \"America\" that also aired on Food Network for a single season of 10 episodes from 2017 to 2018.\n\"Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend\".\n\"Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend\" premiered on Netflix on June 15, 2022. Brown and Dacascos return to their respective roles, with Brown joined by Kristen Kish as co-host. There are eight episodes.\n\"Iron Chef Israel\".\n\"Krav Sakinim\".\nIn 2007, \"Krav Sakinim\" (, Knife Fight), a show based on \"Iron Chef\", began airing on Israel's Channel 10. Each episode features a different prominent Israeli chef, who competes against one of the show's featured foreign chefs. All Israeli winners compete against one another in the finals and the winner competes against a foreign chef for the title of season champion. Season 1 featured only French chef St\u00e9phane Froidevaux, who won the season's finale, while season 2 saw the inclusion of Italian chef Alfredo Russo, meaning both Michelin star holders would have to compete against each other for a spot in the final bout. The show is actively hosted by actor Oded Menashe and the regular commentators are chef Yaron Kastenboim and catering company owner Ran Shmueli. While in season 1, the panel of judges was made up mostly of celebrities from the entertainment industry, season 2 features renowned persons from the culinary industry, such as restaurant critics and chefs. The competitors prepare a three-course meal, with each dish given a score of up to 10 points by each member of the panel and commentators, accumulating up to 150 points per chef (compared to 90 points in season 1, where the commentators had relatively more points to give).\n\"Iron Chef UK\".\nIn 2010, UK public television network Channel 4 debuted \"Iron Chef UK\", based on \"Iron Chef\". The show airs five days a week, and is hosted by Olly Smith and Nick Nairn. The four Iron Chefs are Tom Aikens, Martin Blunos, Sanjay Dwivedi and Judy Joo. Like the original \"Iron Chef\", the competitions are held in Kitchen Stadium and presided over by The chairman. Judging occurs in two rounds, with the first round being appetizers, and the second being the main courses. Two challengers prepare the appetizer, producing one appetizer each, while the Iron Chef prepares two. These are judged, and the standing for the team versus the Iron Chef are announced. Then the second half begins: the challenging team and the Iron Chef return to the kitchen to prepare the main course. The two challengers each prepare one dish, while the Iron Chef prepares two. Judging resumes, and the results are announced. Either the Challenging team wins, or the Iron Chef wins in overall score, and the best dish from the challenging team is also announced. The challengers with the best dish returns on Friday to compete against the best Iron Chef of the week.\n\"Iron Chef Australia\".\nThe Seven Network announced in August 2010 that an Australian version was planned, in part to capitalize on the success of the highly popular \"MasterChef Australia\".\nThe Australian Iron Chefs were Neil Perry, Guy Grossi and Guillaume Brahimi, while the show features a static judging panel composed of food critics Larissa Dubecki, Simon Thomsen and Leo Schofield. Mark Dacascos reprises his role as The chairman from \"Iron Chef America\", and the program is hosted by Grant Denyer, with additional commentary provided by Richard Cornish.\n\"Iron Chef Australia\" began airing on October 19, 2010, attracting an audience of 1.13 million viewers for its first episode.\nIt was cancelled at the end of its first season.\n\"Iron Chef Thailand\".\nOn January 25, 2012, the first ever episode of \"Iron Chef Thailand\" broadcast on BBTV Channel 7 and is produced by Heliconia H Group. Santi Svetavimala played his role as chairman of this version from inception until his departure on March 21, 2020, after 8 years of initial launch. In this version of Iron Chef, there are four Iron Chefs: Chumpol Chaengprai (Thai cuisine), Boontham Pakpo (Japanese cuisine), Pongtawat \"Ian\" Chalermkittichai (Western cuisine) and Chaitep \"Mr. Lee\" Pattarapornpaisarn (Chinese cuisine). The program is hosted by Shahkrit Yamnam and the field reporter is DJ Pong (Nattapong Taengkasem). The format is different at first version, in the first half of the program, there are three challengers who competing with each other to find out who is the best chef, the winner will competing against the Iron Chef on the second half of the program, this format was used for only three episodes.\nOn February 22, 2012, the format of \"Iron Chef Thailand\" was changed to: the first 30 minutes of the program is where the Challenger Chef will present his/her \"Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient\" to the guests. Then followed by the actual \"Iron Chef Battle\" in similar to Iron Chef Japan where the host will asked the Challenger Chef to select the Iron Chef he/she wants to challenge, after the Challenger Chef has selected the Iron Chef, the chairman will reveal the \"Secret Ingredient\" and once the Chairman says \"Allez Cuisine\" the battle begins. The battle time is 60 minutes, where they will need to complete at least four dishes, the order in which Chefs present to the judges will be determined by a coin toss conducted by the host. The last 30 minutes of the program is \"Cooking with Iron Chef\" segment, guests learned how to cook from the Iron Chef and win the \"Best Student\" at the end of the program.\nThe program underwent to several major changes since after first format revamped in February 2012 with further changes on the set in April 2015 which introduced new Iron Chefs to the stage. By November 2017 saw changes to the host, after Shahkrit Yamnam leaves from his role and their set were revamped. The most recent format revamped of \"Iron Chef Thailand\" was on June 18, 2022, with more modern set arrived to the stage, and introduced \"One-On-One Battle\" and \"Fast &amp; Delicious\" segments, at the end of this program, a higher score from the judges who given to the winner as Challenger Chef will received Iron Chef Trophy to the program.\n\"Iron Chef Thailand\" is now a longest-tenure franchise program from outside of Japan as originator, following the cancellation of Iron Chef America and even adopted \"The Next Iron Chef Thailand\" as reality program in similar to American format.\n\"Iron Chef Vietnam\".\nThe Vietnamese version was aired from June 6, 2012, on VTV3. In this version there are only three Iron Chefs: David Th\u00e1i, Long Chef and Yu Zhi Da. The ultimate winner would be a 2013 Iron Chef.\n\"Iron Chef Indonesia\".\nThere have been two adaptations of \"Iron Chef\" for Indonesian television.\n\"Allez Cuisine\".\nThe first Indonesian adaptation of \"Iron Chef\" series, also known as \"Allez Cuisine\", which came from Chairman Kaga's catchphrase in the original series, was aired on Indosiar from March 1, 2003, until August 12, 2006. The Kitchen Stadium owner role was played by Derry Drajat, and the main commentator was Gunardjo, an Indonesian food expert. The show featured three Super Chefs or Iron Chefs. Episodes were 1 hour long. The show also featured a mini-game segment with 6 competitors featuring the main ingredient of the episode. The mini game segment usually lasts for 2 minutes. After the main cooking segment was finished, the Super Chef will give verdict on the results of the mini-game and declare the mini-game winner.\n\"Iron Chef Indonesia\".\nThe second \"Iron Chef\" series, also known as \"Iron Chef Indonesia\", was aired on RCTI from April 22, 2017, until November 19, 2017. Just like the first series, the concept of this show was still a battle between one of the three Super Chefs or Iron Chefs that has been selected by a Challenger Chef to serve the three or four dishes with a predetermined main ingredients. The winner will be announced by the chairman based on the scores that have been given by the guest judges. The chairman role was played by Edward Akbar, the field reporter by Yuda Bustara, and the commentator by Kevindra Prianto Soemantri, with guest judges selected from chefs, celebrities, businesspersons, and executives every week.\n\"Iron Chef Canada\".\nOn October 17, 2018, \"Iron Chef Canada\" premiered on Food Network Canada, the first Iron Chef spin-off in Canada.\nThe chairman in this version is Jai West (in the storyline, the chairman is the grandnephew of Takeshi Kaga). It is hosted by Gail Simmons, with play-by-play done by floor reporter Chris Nuttall-Smith. The Iron Chefs in this version include Hugh Acheson, Amanda Cohen, Lynn Crawford, Rob Feenie, Susur Lee, and Anna Olson.\nThe competition is similar to early seasons of\"Iron Chef America,\" with two key differences introduced in that show's latter seasons:\n1) Both the Iron Chef and the challenger must serve their first dish to the panel of judges within the first 20 minutes of competition (the Chairman does not taste these dishes).

The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive U.S. land grants. Building was financed by both state and U.S. government subsidy bonds as well as by company-issued mortgage bonds. The Western Pacific Railroad Company built of track from the road's western terminus at Alameda/Oakland to Sacramento, California. The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California (CPRR) constructed east from Sacramento to Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) built from the road's eastern terminus at the Missouri River settlements of Council Bluffs and Omaha, Nebraska, westward to Promontory Summit.\nThe railroad opened for through traffic between Sacramento and Omaha on May 10, 1869, when CPRR President Leland Stanford ceremonially tapped the gold \"Last Spike\" (later often referred to as the \"Golden Spike\") with a silver hammer at Promontory Summit. In the following six months, the last leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay was completed. The resulting coast-to-coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West. It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast-to-coast considerably quicker, safer and less expensive.\nThe first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad's original western terminus at the Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869, where they transferred to the steamer \"Alameda\" for transport across the Bay to San Francisco. The road's rail terminus was moved two months later to the Oakland Long Wharf, about a mile to the north, when its expansion was completed and opened for passengers on November 8, 1869. Service between San Francisco and Oakland Pier continued to be provided by ferry.\nThe CPRR eventually purchased of UPRR-built grade from Promontory Summit (MP 828) to Ogden, Utah Territory (MP 881), which became the interchange point between trains of the two roads. The transcontinental line became popularly known as the \"Overland Route\" after the name of the principal passenger rail service to Chicago that operated over the length of the line until 1962.\nOverall significance.\nRailroads not only increased the speed of transport, they also dramatically lowered its cost. The first transcontinental railroad resulted in passengers and freight being able to cross the country in a matter of days instead of months and at one tenth the cost of stagecoach or wagon transport. With economical transportation in the West (which had been referred to as the Great American Desert) now farming, ranching and mining could be done at a profit. As a result, railroads transformed the country, particularly the West (which had few navigable rivers).\nFor example, before the railroads were built in the West, if a farmer were to ship a load of corn only 200 miles to Chicago, the shipping cost by wagon would exceed the price for which the corn could be sold. So, under such circumstances, farming could not be done at a profit. Mining and other economic activity in the West were similarly inhibited because of the high cost of wagon transportation. One Congressman, referring to the West, bluntly stated that, \u201cAll that land wasn\u2019t worth ten cents until the railroads came.\u201d\nFreight rates by rail were a small fraction of what they had been with wagon transport. When the United States concluded the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, people thought that it would take 300 years to populate it. With the introduction of the railroad, it took only 30 years. The low cost of shipping by rail resulted in the Great American Desert becoming the great American breadbasket.\nOrigins.\nAmong the early proponents of building a railroad line that would connect the coasts of the United States was Dr. Hartwell Carver, who in 1847 submitted to the U.S. Congress a \"Proposal for a Charter to Build a Railroad from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean\", seeking a congressional charter to support his idea.\nPreliminary exploration.\nCongress agreed to support the idea. Under the direction of the Department of War, the Pacific Railroad Surveys were conducted from 1853 through 1855. These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes. A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the American West, covering at least . It included the region's natural history and illustrations of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.\nThe report did not include detailed topographic maps of potential routes needed to estimate the feasibility, cost and select the best route. However, the survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the Gila River boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert, through the future territories of Arizona and New Mexico. This in part motivated the United States to complete the Gadsden Purchase.\nIn 1856, the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph of the US House of Representatives published a report recommending support for a proposed Pacific railroad bill:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The necessity that now exists for constructing lines of railroad and telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of this continent is no longer a question for argument; it is conceded by every one. In order to maintain our present position on the Pacific, we must have some more speedy and direct means of intercourse than is at present afforded by the route through the possessions of a foreign power.\nPossible routes.\nThe U.S. Congress was strongly divided on where the eastern terminus of the railroad should be\u2014in a southern or northern city. Three routes were considered:\nOnce the central route was chosen, it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento. But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus. Three locations along of Missouri River were considered:\nCouncil Bluffs had several advantages: It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement. Durant had hired the future president Abraham Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri. Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus, and he relied on Durant's counsel.\nKey people.\nAsa Whitney.\nOne of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was Asa Whitney. He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California, paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route. Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians, printed maps and pamphlets, and submitted several proposals to Congress, all at his own expense. In June 1845, he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility.\nLegislation to begin construction of the \"Pacific Railroad\" (called the \"Memorial of Asa Whitney\") was first introduced to Congress by Representative Zadock Pratt. Congress did not immediately act on Whitney's proposal.\nTheodore Judah.\nTheodore Judah was a fervent supporter of the central route railroad. He lobbied vigorously in favor of the project and undertook the survey of the route through the rugged Sierra Nevada, one of the chief obstacles of the project.\nIn 1852, Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed Sacramento Valley Railroad, the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River. Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville, California, were depleted, Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East.\nIn 1856, Judah wrote a 13,000-word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries, congressmen and other influential people. In September 1859, Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention, which indeed approved his plan to survey, finance and engineer the road. Judah returned to Washington in December 1859. He had a lobbying office in the United States Capitol, received an audience with President James Buchanan, and represented the Convention before Congress.\nJudah returned to California in 1860. He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad. In mid-1860, local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road, which he realized would also suit a railroad. He described his discovery in a letter to Judah. Also in 1860, Charles Marsh, a surveyor, civil engineer and water company owner, met with civil engineer Judah. Marsh, who had already surveyed a potential railroad route between Sacramento and Nevada City, California, a decade earlier, went with Judah into the Sierra Nevada Mountains. There they examined the Henness Pass Turnpike Company's route (Marsh was a founding director of that company). They measured elevations and distances and discussed the possibility of a transcontinental railroad. Both were convinced that it could be done. Judah, Marsh and Strong then met with merchants and businessmen to solicit investors in their proposed railroad.\nFrom January or February 1861 until July, Judah and Strong led a 10-person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and Emigrant Gap, over Donner Pass, and south to Truckee. They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad, although it still needed a lot of work.\nThe Big Four.\nFour northern California businessmen formed the Central Pacific Railroad: Leland Stanford, (1824\u20131893), President; Collis Potter Huntington, (1821\u20131900), Vice President; Mark Hopkins, (1813\u20131878), Treasurer; Charles Crocker, (1822\u20131888), Construction Supervisor. All became substantially wealthy from their association with the railroad. Judah, Marsh, Strong, Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins and Crocker, along with James Bailey and Lucius Anson Booth, became the first board of directors of the Central Pacific Railroad.\nThomas Durant.\nFormer ophthalmologist Dr. Thomas Clark \"Doc\" Durant was nominally only a vice president of Union Pacific, so he installed a series of respected men like John Adams Dix as president of the railroad. While serving as vice president of Union Pacific he would be a key figure in the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal which ultimately led to his removal from the company.\nGrenville M. Dodge.\nMajor General Grenville M. Dodge served as the chief engineer of Union Pacific during the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad. In 1865 while fighting against Native-American tribes he would discover a pass in the Laramie Mountains, which would serve as a vital passage for the First Transcontinental Railroad. Dodge would serve in the United States House of Representatives for from 1867 until 1869. During this time he would push for legislation to help the construction of the railroad.\nAuthorization and funding.\nIn February 1860, Iowa Representative Samuel Curtis introduced a bill to fund the railroad. It passed the House but died when it could not be reconciled with the Senate version because of opposition from southern states who wanted a southern route near the 42nd parallel. Curtis tried and failed again in 1861. After the southern states seceded from the Union, the House of Representatives approved the bill on May 6, 1862, and the Senate on June 20. Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 into law on July 1. It authorized creation of two companies, the Central Pacific in the west and the Union Pacific in the mid-west, to build the railroad. The legislation called for building and operating a new railroad from the Missouri River at Council Bluffs, Iowa, west to Sacramento, California, and on to San Francisco Bay. Another act to supplement the first was passed in 1864. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 established the standard gauge to be used in these federally financed railways.\nFederal financing.\nTo finance the project, the act authorized the federal government to issue 30-year U.S. government bonds (at 6% interest). The railroad companies were paid $16,000 per mile (approximately $ per mile today) for track laid on a level grade, $32,000 per mile (about $ per mile today) for track laid in foothills, and $48,000 per mile (or about $ per mile today) for track laid in mountains. The two railroad companies sold similar amounts of company-backed bonds and stock.\nUnion Pacific financing.\nWhile the federal legislation for the Union Pacific required that no partner was to own more than 10 percent of the stock, the Union Pacific had problems selling its stock. One of the few subscribers was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints leader Brigham Young, who also supplied crews for building much of the railroad through Utah.\nDurant manipulated market prices on his stocks by spreading rumors about which railroads he had an interest in were being considered for connection with the Union Pacific. First he touted rumors that his fledgling M&amp;M Railroad had a deal in the works, while secretly buying stock in the depressed Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad. Then he circulated rumors that the CR&amp;M had plans to connect to the Union Pacific, at which point he began buying back the M&amp;M stock at depressed prices. It is estimated his scams produced over $5\u00a0million in profits for him and his cohorts.\nCentral Pacific financing.\nCollis Huntington, a Sacramento hardware merchant, heard Judah's presentation about the railroad at the St. Charles Hotel in November 1860. He invited Judah to his office to hear his proposal in detail. Huntington persuaded Judah to accept financing from himself and four others: Mark Hopkins, his business partner; James Bailey, a jeweler; Leland Stanford, a grocer; and Charles Crocker, a dry-goods merchant. They initially invested $1,500 each and formed a board of directors. These investors became known as The Big Four, and their railroad was called the Central Pacific Railroad. Each eventually made millions of dollars from their investments and control of the Central Pacific Railroad.\nBefore major construction could begin, Judah traveled back to New York City to raise funds to buy out The Big Four. Shortly after arriving in New York, Judah died on November 2, 1863, of yellow fever that he had contracted while traveling over the Panama Railroad's transit of the Isthmus of Panama. The CPRR Engineering Department was taken over by his successor Samuel S. Montegue, as well as Canadian trained Chief Assistant Engineer (later Acting Chief Engineer) Lewis Metzler Clement who also became Superintendent of Track.\nLand grants.\nTo allow the companies to raise additional capital, Congress granted the railroads a right-of-way corridor, lands for additional facilities like sidings and maintenance yards. They were also granted alternate sections of government-owned lands\u2014 per mile (1.6\u00a0km)\u2014for on both sides of the track, forming a checkerboard pattern. The railroad companies were given the odd-numbered sections while the federal government retained the even-numbered sections. The exception was in cities, at rivers, or on non-government property. The railroads sold bonds based on the value of the lands, and in areas with good land like the Sacramento Valley and Nebraska sold the land to settlers, contributing to a rapid settlement of the West. The total area of the land grants to the Union Pacific and Central Pacific was larger than the area of the state of Texas: federal government land grants totaled about 130,000,000 acres, and state government land grants totaled about 50,000,000 acres.\nIt was far from a given that the railroads operating in the thinly-settled west would make enough money to repay their construction and operation. If the railroad companies failed to sell the land granted them within three years, they were required to sell it at prevailing government price for homesteads: . If they failed to repay the bonds, all remaining railroad property, including trains and tracks, would revert to the U.S. government. To encourage settlement in the west, Congress (1861\u20131863) passed the Homestead Acts which granted an applicant of land with the requirement that the applicant improve the land. This incentive encouraged thousands of settlers to move west.\nIn return for the land grants, the railroads were required to haul government personnel and cargo at significantly reduced rates (generally half of the normal rate). In addition, the land was granted in a checkerboard fashion, with the government retaining every other section. The land that the government retained typically doubled in value as a result of the railroad being built. The land grants were a good deal for the government.\nThe government guaranteed loans to several Pacific railroads, which were all paid off by 1899 ($63 million in principal, and $105 million in interest). After receiving rate discounts of approximately 50% on government personnel and cargo for 80 years (including during two world wars), Congress finally discontinued the rate reductions at the end of World War II. The land grants had been more than paid for (several times over).\nRailroad self-dealing.\nThe federal legislation lacked adequate oversight and accountability. The two companies took advantage of these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves. Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government, the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months, possibly years. They determined to make a profit on the construction itself. Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project, and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures. This self-dealing allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies. In the west, the four men heading the Central Pacific chose a simple name for their company, the \"Contract and Finance Company.\" In the east, the Union Pacific selected a foreign name, calling their construction firm \"Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America.\" The latter company was later implicated in a far-reaching scandal which would greatly affect the railroad's purpose, described later.\nAlso, the lack of federal oversight provided both companies with incentives to continue building their railroads past one other, since they were each being paid, and receiving land grants, based on how many miles of track they laid, even though only one track would eventually be used. This tacitly-agreed profiteering activity was captured (probably accidentally) by Union Pacific photographer Andrew J. Russell in his images of the Promontory Trestle construction.\nLabor and wages.\nMany of the civil engineers and surveyors who were hired by the Union Pacific had been employed during the American Civil War to repair and operate the over of railroad line the U.S. Military Railroad controlled by the end of the war. The Union Pacific also utilized their experience repairing and building truss bridges during the war. Most of the semi-skilled workers on the Union Pacific were recruited from the many soldiers discharged from the Union and Confederate armies along with emigrant Irishmen.\nAfter 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad received the same Federal financial incentives as the Union Pacific Railroad, along with some construction bonds granted by the state of California and the city of San Francisco. The Central Pacific hired some Canadian and European civil engineers and surveyors with extensive experience building railroads, but it had a difficult time finding semi-skilled labor. Most Caucasians in California preferred to work in the mines or agriculture. The railroad experimented by hiring local emigrant Chinese as manual laborers, many of whom were escaping the poverty and terrors of the war (especially the Punti\u2013Hakka Clan Wars) in the Sze Yup districts in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong province in China. When they proved themselves as workers, the CPRR from that point forward preferred to hire Chinese, and even set up recruiting efforts in Canton. Despite their small stature and lack of experience, the Chinese laborers were responsible for most of the heavy manual labor since only a very limited amount of that work could be done by animals, simple machines, or black powder. The railroad also hired some black people escaping the aftermath of the American Civil War. Most of the black and white workers were paid $30 per month and given food and lodging. Most Chinese were initially paid $31 per month and provided lodging, but they preferred to cook their own meals. In 1867 the CPRR raised their wage to $35 (equivalent to $ in 2024) per month after a strike. CPRR came to see the advantage of good workers employed at low wages: \"Chinese labor proved to be Central Pacific's salvation.\"\nTranscontinental route.\nConstruction begun.\nThe Central Pacific broke ground on January 8, 1863. Because of insufficient transportation alternatives from the manufacturing centers on the east coast, virtually all of their tools and machinery including rails, railroad switches, railroad turntables, freight and passenger cars, and steam locomotives were transported first by train to east coast ports. They were then loaded on ships which either sailed around South America's Cape Horn, or offloaded the cargo at the Isthmus of Panama, where it was sent across via paddle steamer and the Panama Railroad. The Panama Railroad gauge was , which was incompatible with the gauge used by the CPRR equipment. The latter route was about twice as expensive per pound. Once the machinery and tools reached the San Francisco Bay area, they were put aboard river paddle steamers which transported them up the final of the Sacramento River to the new state capital in Sacramento. Many of these steam engines, railroad cars, and other machinery were shipped dismantled and had to be reassembled. Wooden timbers for railroad ties, trestles, bridges, firewood, and telegraph poles were harvested in California and transported to the project site.\nThe Union Pacific Railroad did not start construction for another 18 months until July 1865. They were delayed by difficulties obtaining financial backing and the unavailability of workers and materials due to the Civil War. Their start point in the new city of Omaha, Nebraska, was not yet connected via railroad to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Equipment needed to begin work was initially delivered to Omaha and Council Bluffs by paddle steamers on the Missouri River. The Union Pacific was so slow in beginning construction during 1865 that they sold two of the four steam locomotives they had purchased.\nAfter the American Civil War ended in 1865, the Union Pacific still competed for railroad supplies with companies who were building or repairing railroads in the south, and prices rose.\nRail standards.\nAt that time in the United States, there were two primary standards for track gauge, as defined by the distance between the two rails. In Britain, the gauge was , and this had been adopted by the majority of northern railways. However, much of the south had adopted a gauge. Transferring railway cars across a break of gauge required changing out the trucks. Alternatively, cargo was offloaded and reloaded, a time-consuming effort that delayed cargo shipments. For the transcontinental railroad, the builders adopted what is now known as the standard gauge.\nThe Bessemer process and open hearth furnace steel-making were in use by 1865, but the advantages of steel rails which lasted much longer than iron rails had not yet been demonstrated. The rails used initially in building the railway were nearly all made of an iron flat-bottomed modified I-beam profile weighing . The railroad companies were intent on completing the project as rapidly as possible at a minimum cost. Within a few years, nearly all railroads converted to steel rails.\nTime zones and telegraph usage.\nTime was not standardized across the United States and Canada until November 18, 1883. In 1865, each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors. To communicate easily up and down the line, the railroads built telegraph lines alongside the tracks. These lines eventually superseded the original First Transcontinental Telegraph which followed much of the Mormon Trail up the North Platte River and across the very thinly populated Central Nevada Route through central Utah and Nevada. The telegraph lines along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain. Many of the original telegraph lines were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad telegraph lines.\nUnion Pacific route.\nThe Union Pacific's of track started at MP 0.0 in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on the eastern side of the Missouri River. Omaha was chosen by President Abraham Lincoln as the location of its Transfer Depot where up to seven railroads could transfer mail and other goods to Union Pacific trains bound for the west.\nTrains were initially transported across the Missouri River by ferry before they could access the western tracks beginning in Omaha, Nebraska Territory. The river froze in the winter, and the ferries were replaced by sleighs. A bridge was not built until 1872, when the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge was completed.\nAfter the rail line's initial climb through the Missouri River bluffs west of Omaha and out of the Missouri River Valley, the route bridged the Elkhorn River and then crossed over the new Loup River bridge as it followed the north side of the Platte River valley west through Nebraska along the general path of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails.\nBy December 1865, the Union Pacific had only completed of track, reaching Fremont, Nebraska, and a further of roadbed.\nAt the end of 1865, Peter A. Dey, Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific, resigned over a routing dispute with Thomas C. Durant, one of the chief financiers of the Union Pacific.\nWith the end of the Civil War and increased government supervision in the offing, Durant hired his former M&amp;M engineer Grenville M. Dodge to build the railroad, and the Union Pacific began a mad dash west.\nFormer Union General John \"Jack\" Casement was hired as the new Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific. He equipped several railroad cars to serve as portable bunkhouses for the workers and gathered men and supplies to push the railroad rapidly west. Among the bunkhouses, Casement added a galley car to prepare meals, and he even provided for a herd of cows to be moved with the railhead and bunk cars to provide fresh meat. Hunters were hired to provide buffalo meat from the large herds of American bison.\nThe small survey parties who scouted ahead to locate the roadbed were sometimes attacked and killed by raiding Native Americans. In response, the U.S. Army instituted active cavalry patrols that grew larger as the Native Americans grew more aggressive. Temporary, \"Hell on wheels\" towns, made mostly of canvas tents, accompanied the railroad as construction headed west.\nThe Platte River was too shallow and meandering to provide river transport, but the Platte river valley headed west and sloped up gradually at about , often allowing to lay a mile (1.6\u00a0km) of track a day or more in 1866 as the Union Pacific finally started moving rapidly west. Building bridges to cross creeks and rivers was the main source of delays. Near where the Platte River splits into the North Platte River and South Platte River, the railroad bridged the North Platte River over a bridge (nicknamed \u00bd mile bridge). It was built across the shallow but wide North Platte resting on piles driven by steam pile drivers. Here they built the \"railroad\" town of North Platte, Nebraska, in December 1866 after completing about of track that year. In late 1866, former Major General Grenville M. Dodge was appointed Chief Engineer on the Union Pacific, but hard-working General \"Jack\" Casement continued to work as chief construction \"boss\" and his brother Daniel Casement continued as a financial officer.\nThe original emigrant route across Wyoming of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails, after progressing up the Platte River valley, went up the North Platte River valley through Casper, Wyoming, along the Sweetwater River and over the Continental Divide at the South Pass. The original westward travelers in their ox and mule pulled wagons tried to stick to river valleys to avoid as much road building as possible\u2014gradients and sharp corners were usually of little or no concern to them. The ox and mule pulled wagons were the original off-road vehicles in their day since nearly all of the Emigrant Trails went cross country over rough, unimproved trails. The route over South Pass's main advantage for wagons pulled by oxen or mules was a shorter elevation over an \"easy\" pass to cross and its \"easy\" connection to nearby river valleys on both sides of the continental divide for water and grass. The emigrant trails were closed in winter. The North Platte\u2013South Pass route was far less beneficial for a railroad, as it was about longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow, steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte. The route along the North Platte was also further from Denver, Colorado, and went across difficult terrain, while a railroad connection to that City was already being planned for and surveyed.\nEfforts to survey a new, shorter, \"better\" route had been underway since 1864. By 1867, a new route was found and surveyed that went along part of the South Platte River in western Nebraska and after entering what is now the state of Wyoming, ascended a gradual sloping ridge between Lodgepole Creek and Crow Creek to the Evans pass (also called Sherman's Pass) which was discovered by the Union Pacific employed English surveyor and engineer, James Evans, in about 1864. This pass now is marked by the Ames Monument () marking its significance and commemorating two of the main backers of the Union Pacific Railroad. From North Platte, Nebraska (elevation ), the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the Nebraska Territory and Wyoming Territory (then part of the Dakota Territory) along the north bank of the South Platte River and into what would become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine, Wyoming. Evans Pass was located between what would become the new \"railroad\" towns of Cheyenne and Laramie. Connecting to this pass, about west of Cheyenne, was the one place across the Laramie Mountains that had a narrow \"guitar neck\" of land that crossed the mountains without serious erosion at the so-called \"gangplank\" () discovered by Major General Grenville Dodge in 1865 when he was in the U.S. Army. The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over shorter, had a flatter profile, allowing for cheaper and easier railroad construction, and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the Wasatch and Laramie Ranges.\nThe railroad gained about in the climb to Cheyenne from North Platte, Nebraska\u2014about \u2014a very gentle slope of less than one degree average. This \"new\" route had never become an emigrant route because it lacked the water and grass to feed the emigrants' oxen and mules. Steam locomotives did not need grass, and the railroad companies could drill wells for water if necessary.\nCoal had been discovered in Wyoming and reported on by John C. Fr\u00e9mont in his 1843 expedition across Wyoming, and was already being exploited by Utah residents from towns like Coalville, Utah, and later Kemmerer, Wyoming, by the time the Transcontinental railroad was built. Union Pacific needed coal to fuel its steam locomotives on the almost treeless plains across Nebraska and Wyoming. Coal shipments by rail were also looked on as a potentially major source of income\u2014this potential is still being realized.\nThe Union Pacific reached the new railroad town of Cheyenne in December 1867, having laid about that year. They paused over the winter, preparing to push the track over Evans (Sherman's) Pass. At , Evans Pass was the highest point reached on the transcontinental railroad. About beyond Evans pass, the railroad had to build an extensive bridge over the Dale Creek canyon (). The Dale Creek Crossing was one of their more difficult railroad engineering challenges. Dale Creek Bridge was long and above Dale Creek. The bridge components were pre-built of timber in Chicago, Illinois, and then shipped on rail cars to Dale Creek for assembly. The eastern and western approaches to the bridge site, near the highest elevation on the transcontinental railroad, required cutting through granite for nearly a mile on each side. The initial Dale Creek bridge had a train speed limit of per hour across the bridge. Beyond Dale Creek, railroad construction paused at what became the town of Laramie, Wyoming, to build a bridge across the Laramie River.\nLocated from Evans pass, Union Pacific connected the new \"railroad\" town of Cheyenne to Denver and its Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company railroad line in 1870. Elevated above sea level, and sitting on the new Union Pacific route with a connection to Denver, Cheyenne was chosen to become a major railroad center and was equipped with extensive railroad yards, maintenance facilities, and a Union Pacific presence. Its location made it a good base for helper locomotives to couple to trains with snowplows to help clear the tracks of snow or help haul heavy freight over Evans pass. The Union Pacific's junction with the Denver Railroad with its connection to Kansas City, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri, and the railroads east of the Missouri River again increased Cheyenne's importance as the junction of two major railroads. Cheyenne later became Wyoming's largest city and the capital of the new state of Wyoming.\nThe railroad established many townships along the way: Fremont, Elkhorn, Grand Island, North Platte, Ogallala and Sidney as the railroad followed the Platte River across Nebraska territory. The railroad even dipped into what would become the new state of Colorado after crossing the North Platte River as it followed the South Platte River west into what would become Julesburg before turning northwest along Lodgepole Creek into Wyoming. In the Dakota Territory (Wyoming) the new towns of Cheyenne, Laramie, Rawlins (named for Union General John Aaron Rawlins, who camped in the locality in 1867), Green River and Evanston (named after James Evans) were established, as well as many more fuel and water stops. The Green River was crossed with a new bridge, and the new \"railroad\" town of Green River constructed there after the tracks reached the Green River on October 1, 1868\u2014the last big river to cross.\nOn December 4, 1868, the Union Pacific reached Evanston, having laid almost of track over the Green River and the Laramie Plains that year. By 1871, Evanston became a significant maintenance shop town equipped to carry out extensive repairs on the cars and steam locomotives.\nIn the Utah Territory, the railroad once again diverted from the main emigrant trails to cross the Wasatch Mountains and went down the rugged Echo Canyon (Summit County, Utah) and Weber River canyon. To speed up construction as much as possible, Union Pacific contracted several thousand Mormon workers to cut, fill, trestle, bridge, blast and tunnel its way down the rugged Weber River Canyon to Ogden, Utah, ahead of the railroad construction. The Mormon and Union Pacific rail work was joined in the area of the present-day border between Utah and Wyoming. The longest of four tunnels built in Weber Canyon was Tunnel 2. Work on this tunnel started in October 1868 and was completed six months later. Temporary tracks were laid around it and Tunnels 3 (), 4 () and 5 () to continue work on the tracks west of the tunnels.\nThe tunnels were all made with the new dangerous nitroglycerine explosive, which expedited work but caused some fatal accidents. While building the railroad along the rugged Weber River Canyon, Mormon workers signed the Thousand Mile Tree which was a lone tree alongside the track from Omaha. A historic marker has been placed there.\nThe tracks reached Ogden, Utah, on March 8, 1869, although finishing work would continue on the tracks, tunnels and bridges in Weber Canyon for over a year. From Ogden, the railroad went north of the Great Salt Lake to Brigham City and Corinne using Mormon workers, before finally connecting with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit in Utah territory on May 10, 1869. Some Union Pacific officers declined to pay the Mormons all of the agreed upon construction costs of the work through Weber Canyon, and beyond, claiming Union Pacific poverty despite the millions they had extracted through the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America scandal. Only partial payment was secured through court actions against Union Pacific.\nCentral Pacific route.\nThe Central Pacific laid of track, starting in Sacramento, California, in 1863 and continuing over the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains at Donner Pass into the new state of Nevada. The elevation change from Sacramento (elev. ) to Donner Summit (elev. ) had to be accomplished in about with an average elevation change of 76\u00a0feet per\u00a0mile (14\u00a0meters per\u00a0km), and there were only a few places in the Sierra where this type of \"ramp\" existed. The discovery and detailed map survey with profiles and elevations of this route over the Sierra Nevada is credited to Theodore Judah, chief engineer of the Central Pacific Railroad until his death in 1863. This route is up a ridge between the North fork of the American River on the south and Bear and South Yuba Rivers on the north. As the railroad climbed out of Sacramento up to Donner Summit, there was only one section near \"Cape Horn CPRR\" where the railroad grade slightly exceeded two percent.\nIn June 1864, the Central Pacific railroad entrepreneurs opened Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road (DFDLWR). Costing about $300,000 and a years worth of work, this toll road wagon route was opened over much of the route the Central Pacific railroad (CPRR) would use over Donner Summit to carry freight and passengers needed by the CPRR and to carry other cargo over their toll road to and from the ever-advancing railhead and over the Sierra to the gold and silver mining towns of Nevada. As the railroad advanced, their freight rates with the combined rail and wagon shipments would become much more competitive. The volume of the toll road freight traffic to Nevada was estimated to be about $13,000,000 a year as the Comstock Lode boomed, and getting even part of this freight traffic would help pay for the railroad construction. When the railroad reached Reno, it had the majority of all Nevada freight shipments, and the price of goods in Nevada dropped significantly as the freight charges to Nevada dropped significantly. The rail route over the Sierras followed the general route of the Truckee branch of the California Trail, going east over Donner Pass and down the rugged Truckee River valley.\nThe route over the Sierra had been plotted out by Judah in preliminary surveys before his death in 1863. Judah's deputy, Samuel S. Montague was appointed as Central Pacific's new Chief Engineer, with Lewis M. Clement as Assistant Chief Engineer and Charles Cadwalader as second assistant. To build the new railroad, detailed surveys had to be run that showed where the cuts, fills, trestles, bridges and tunnels would have to be built. Work that was identified as taking a long time was started as soon as its projected track location could be ascertained and work crews, supplies and road work equipment found to be sent ahead. Tunnels, trestles and bridges were nearly all built this way. The spread-out nature of the work resulted in the work being split into two divisions, with L. M. Clement taking the upper division from Blue Ca\u00f1on to Truckee and Cadwalader taking the lower division from Truckee to the Nevada border. Other assistant engineers were assigned to specific tasks such as building a bridge, tunnel or trestle which was done by the workers under experienced supervisors.\nIn total, the Central Pacific had eleven tunnel projects (Nos. 3 through 13) under construction in the Sierra from 1865 to 1868, with seven tunnels located in a stretch on the east side of Donner Summit. The tunnels were usually built by drilling a series of holes in the tunnel face, filling them with black powder and detonating it to break the rock free. The black powder was provided by the California Powder Works near Santa Cruz, California. These works had started production in 1864 after the American Civil War had cut off shipments of black powder from the East to the mining and railroad industry of California and Nevada. The Central Pacific was a prolific user of black powder, often using up to 500 kegs of per day.\nThe summit tunnel (Number 6), , was started in late 1865, well ahead of the railhead. Through solid granite, the summit tunnel progressed at a rate of only about per day per face as it was being worked by three eight-hour shifts of workers, hand drilling holes with a rock drill and hammer, filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose. One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion. The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865\u20131866 as there was no way to supply them, nor quarters they could have lived in. The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon.\nIn 1866, they put in a vertical shaft in the center of the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces, giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress. A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces. By the winter of 1866\u201367, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel face was a , oval with an vertical wall. Progress on the tunnel sped up to over per day per face when they started using the newly invented nitroglycerin\u2014manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle. Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated, they were left unlined or lined with brick, rock walls or timber and post. Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature. Despite this potential complication, nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within or so. The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required was nearly all done by the Canadian-born and -trained Lewis Clement, the CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track, and his assistants.\nHills or ridges in front of the railroad road bed would have to have a flat-bottomed, V-shaped \"cut\" made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill. The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade\u2014cut and fill construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment that could be used to make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a V-shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way through the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill. Initially, many valleys were bridged by \"temporary\" trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier\u2014load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.\nThe route down the eastern Sierras was done on the south side of Donner Lake with a series of switchbacks carved into the mountain. The Truckee River, which drains Lake Tahoe, had already found and scoured out the best route across the Carson Range of mountains east of the Sierras. The route down the rugged Truckee River Canyon, including required bridges, was done ahead of the main summit tunnel completion. To expedite the building of the railroad through the Truckee River canyon, the Central Pacific hauled two small locomotives, railcars, rails and other material on wagons and sleighs to what is now Truckee, California, and worked the winter of 1867\u201368 on their way down Truckee canyon ahead of the tracks being completed to Truckee. This feat was dramatized in John Ford's film \"The Iron Horse\" with one of Central Pacific's actual locomotives, C.P. Huntington. In Truckee canyon, five Howe truss bridges had to be built. This gave them a head start on getting to the \"easy\" miles across Nevada.\nIn order to keep the higher portions of the Sierra grade open in the winter, of timber snow sheds were built between Blue Ca\u00f1on and Truckee in addition to utilizing snowplows pushed by locomotives, as well as manual shovelling. With the advent of more efficient oil fired steam and later diesel electric power to drive plows, flangers, spreaders, and rotary snow plows, most of the wooden snowsheds have long since been removed as obsolete. Tunnels 1\u20135 and Tunnel 13 of the original 1860s tunnels on Track 1 of the Sierra grade remain in use today, while additional new tunnels were later driven when the grade was double tracked over the first quarter of the twentieth century. In 1993, the Southern Pacific Railroad (which operated the CPRR-built Oakland\u2013Ogden line until its 1996 merger with the Union Pacific) closed and pulled up the section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1) and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8) about a mile east of the old flyover at Eder, bypassing and abandoning the tunnel 6\u20138 complex, the concrete snowsheds just beyond them, and tunnels 9\u201312 ending at MP 195.7, all of which had been located on Track 1 within two miles of the summit. Since then all east- and westbound traffic has been run over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit about south of Donner Pass through the Tunnel #41 (\"The Big Hole\") running under Mt. Judah between Soda Springs and Eder, which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was double tracked. This routing change was made because the Track 2 and Tunnel 41 Summit crossing is far easier and less expensive to maintain and keep open in the harsh Sierra winters.\nOn June 18, 1868, the Central Pacific reached Reno, Nevada, after completing of railroad up and over the Sierras from Sacramento, California. By then the railroad had already been prebuilt down the Truckee River on the much flatter land from Reno to Wadsworth, Nevada, where they bridged the Truckee for the last time. From there, they struggled across a forty mile desert to the end of the Humboldt river at the Humboldt Sink. From the end of the Humboldt, they continued east over the Great Basin Desert bordering the Humboldt River to Wells, Nevada. One of the most troublesome problems found on this route along the Humboldt was at Palisade Canyon (near Carlin, Nevada), where for the line had to be built between the river and basalt cliffs. From Wells, Nevada, to Promontory Summit, the Railroad left the Humboldt and proceeded across the Nevada and Utah desert. Water for the steam locomotives was provided by wells, springs, or pipelines to nearby water sources. Water was often pumped into the water tanks with windmills. Train fuel and water cranes for the early trains with steam locomotives may have been as often as every . On one memorable occasion, not far from Promontory, the Central Pacific crews organized an army of workers and five train loads of construction material, and laid of track on a prepared rail bed in one day\u2014a record that still stands today. The Central Pacific and Union Pacific raced to get as much track laid as possible, and the Central Pacific laid about of track from Reno to Promontory Summit in the one year before the Last Spike was driven on May 10, 1869.\nCentral Pacific had 1,694 freight cars available by May 1869, with more under construction in their Sacramento yard. Major repairs and maintenance on the Central Pacific rolling stock was done in their Sacramento maintenance yard. Near the end of 1869, Central Pacific had 162 locomotives, of which 2 had two drivers (drive wheels), 110 had four drivers, and 50 had six drivers. The steam locomotives had been purchased in the eastern states and shipped to California by sea. Thirty-six additional locomotives were built and coming west, and twenty-eight more were under construction. There was a shortage of passenger cars and more had to be ordered. The first Central Pacific sleeper, the \"Silver Palace Sleeping Car\", arrived at Sacramento on June 8, 1868.\nThe CPRR route passed through Newcastle and Truckee in California, Reno, Wadsworth, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain, Elko and Wells in Nevada (with many more fuel and water stops), before connecting with the Union Pacific line at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory. When the eastern end of the CPRR was extended to Ogden by purchasing the Union Pacific Railroad line from Promontory for about $2.8\u00a0million in 1870, it ended the short period of a boom town for Promontory, extended the Central Pacific tracks about and made Ogden a major terminus on the transcontinental railroad, as passengers and freight switched railroads there.\nSubsequent to the railhead's meeting at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory, the San Joaquin River Bridge at Mossdale Crossing (near present-day Lathrop, California) was completed on September 8, 1869, with the first through freight train carrying freight from the East Coast leaving Sacramento and crossing the bridge to arrive that evening at the Alameda Wharf on San Francisco Bay. As a result, the western part of the route was extended from Sacramento to the Alameda Terminal in Alameda, California, and shortly thereafter, to the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point in Oakland, California, and on to San Jose, California. Train ferries transferred some railroad cars to and from the Oakland wharves and tracks to wharves and tracks in San Francisco. Before the CPRR was completed, developers were building other feeder railroads like the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to the Comstock Lode diggings in Virginia City, Nevada, and several different extensions in California and Nevada to reach other cities there. Some of their main cargo was the thousands of cords ( each) of firewood needed for the many steam engines and pumps, cooking stoves, heating stoves etc. in Comstock Lode towns and the tons of ice needed by the miners as they worked ever deeper into the \"hot\" Comstock Lode ore body. In the mines, temperatures could get above at the work face and a miner often used over of ice per shift. This new railroad connected to the Central Pacific near Reno, and went through Carson City, the new capital of Nevada.\nAfter the transcontinental railroads were completed, many other railroads were built to connect up to other population centers in Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oregon, Washington territories, etc. In 1869, the Kansas Pacific Railway started building the Hannibal Bridge, a swing bridge across the Missouri River between Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, which connected railroads on both sides of the Missouri while still allowing passage of paddle steamers on the river. After completion, this became another major east\u2013west railroad. To speed completion of the Kansas Pacific Railroad to Denver, construction started east from Denver in March 1870 to meet the railroad coming west from Kansas city. The two crews met at a point called Comanche Crossing, Kansas, on August 15, 1870. Denver was now firmly on track to becoming the largest city and the future capital of Colorado. The Kansas Pacific Railroad linked with the Denver Pacific Railway via Denver to Cheyenne in 1870.\nThe original transcontinental railroad route did not pass through the two biggest cities in the so-called Great American Desert\u2014Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Feeder railroad lines were soon built to service these two and other cities and states along the route.\nModern-day Interstate 80 roughly follows the path of the railroad from Sacramento across modern day California, Nevada, Wyoming and Nebraska, with a few exceptions. Most significantly, the two routes are different between Wells, Nevada, and Echo, Utah. In this area the freeway passes along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake and passes through Salt Lake City, cresting the Wasatch Mountains at Parley's Summit. The railroad was originally routed along the north shore, and later with the Lucin Cutoff directly across the center of the Great Salt Lake, passing through the city of Ogden instead of Salt Lake City. The railroad crosses the Wasatch Mountains via a much gentler grade through Weber Canyon. Most of the other deviations are in mountainous areas where interstate highways allow for grades up to six-percent grades, which allows them to go many places the railroads had to go around, since their goal was to hold their grades to less than two percent.\nConstruction.\nMost of the capital investment needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as it did not have to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were Union Army veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.\nSurvey teams were put out to produce detailed contour maps of the options on the different routes. The engineering team looked at the available surveys and chose what was the \"best\" route. Survey teams under the direction of the engineers closely led the work crews and marked where and by how much hills would have to be cut and depressions filled or bridged. Coordinators made sure that construction and other supplies were provided when and where needed, and additional supplies were ordered as the railroad construction consumed the supplies. Specialized bridging, explosive and tunneling teams were assigned to their specialized jobs. Some jobs like explosive work, tunneling, bridging, heavy cuts or fills were known to take longer than others, so the specialized teams were sent out ahead by wagon trains with the supplies and men to get these jobs done by the time the regular track-laying crews arrived. Finance officers made sure the supplies were paid for and men paid for their work. An army of men had to be coordinated and a seemingly never-ending chain of supplies had to be provided. The Central Pacific road crew set a track-laying record by laying of track in a single day, commemorating the event with a signpost beside the track for passing trains to see.\nIn addition to the track-laying crews, other crews were busy setting up stations with provisions for loading fuel, water and often also mail, passengers and freight. Personnel had to be hired to run these stations. Maintenance depots had to be built to keep all of the equipment repaired and operational. Telegraph operators had to be hired to man each station to keep track of where the trains were so that trains could run in each direction on the available single track without interference or accidents. Sidings had to be built to allow trains to pass. Provision had to be made to store and continually pay for coal or wood needed to run the steam locomotives. Water towers had to be built for refilling the water tanks on the engines, and provision made to keep them full.\nLabor.\nThe majority of the Union Pacific track across the Nebraska and Wyoming territories was built by veterans of the Union and Confederate armies, as well as many recent immigrants. Brigham Young, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, landed contracts with the Union Pacific that offered jobs for around 2,000 members of the church with the hope that the railroad would support commerce in Utah. Church members built most of the road through Utah. Construction superintendent Durant repeatedly failed to pay the wages agreed upon. The Union Pacific train carrying him to the final spike ceremony was held up by a strike by unpaid workers in Piedmont, Wyoming, until he paid them for their work. Representatives of Brigham Young had less success, and failed in court to force him to honor the contract.\nThe manual labor to build the Central Pacific's roadbed, bridges and tunnels was done primarily by many thousands of emigrant workers from China under the direction of skilled non-Chinese supervisors. The Chinese were commonly referred to at the time as \"Celestials\" and China as the \"Celestial Kingdom\". Labor-saving devices in those days consisted primarily of wheelbarrows, horse or mule pulled carts, and a few railroad pulled gondolas. The construction work involved an immense amount of manual labor. Initially, Central Pacific had a hard time hiring and keeping unskilled workers on its line, as many would leave for the prospect of far more lucrative gold or silver mining options elsewhere. Despite the concerns expressed by Charles Crocker, one of the \"big four\" and a general contractor, that the Chinese were too small in stature and lacking previous experience with railroad work, they decided to try them anyway. After the first few days of trial with a few workers, with noticeably positive results, Crocker decided to hire as many as he could, looking primarily at the California labor force, where the majority of Chinese worked as independent gold miners or in the service industries (e.g.: laundries and kitchens). Most of these Chinese workers were represented by a Chinese \"boss\" who translated, collected salaries for his crew, kept discipline and relayed orders from an American general supervisor. Most Chinese workers spoke only rudimentary or no English, and the supervisors typically only learned rudimentary Chinese. Many more workers were imported from the Guangdong Province of China, which at the time, beside great poverty, suffered from the violence of the Taiping Rebellion. Most Chinese workers were planning on returning with their newfound \"wealth\" when the work was completed. Most of the men received between one and three dollars per day, the same as unskilled white workers; but the workers imported directly from China sometimes received less. A diligent worker could save over $20 per month after paying for food and lodging\u2014a \"fortune\" by Chinese standards. A snapshot of workers in late 1865 showed about 3,000 Chinese and 1,700 white workers employed on the railroad. Nearly all of the white workers were in supervisory or skilled craft positions and made more money than the Chinese.\nMost of the early work on the Central Pacific consisted of constructing the railroad track bed, cutting and/or blasting through or around hills, filling in washes, building bridges or trestles, digging and blasting tunnels and then laying the rails over the Sierra Nevada mountains. Once the Central Pacific was out of the Sierras and the Carson Range, progress sped up considerably as the railroad bed could be built over nearly flat ground. In those days, the Central Pacific once did a section of of track in one day as a \"demonstration\" of what they could do on flat ground like most of the Union Pacific had in Wyoming and Nebraska.\nThe track laying was divided up into various parts. In advance of the track layers, surveyors consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers\u2014the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work had to be done manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor-saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.\nTunnels were blasted through hard rock by drilling holes in the rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled out of the tunnel for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.\nSupply trains carried all the necessary material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it the rest of the ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and leveled to get ready for the rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.\nTrack ballast was put between the ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed had already been prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed supplies included \"food, water, ties, rails, spikes, fishplates, nuts and bolts, track ballast, telegraph poles, wire, firewood (or coal on the Union Pacific) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc.\" After a flatcar was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another flatcar with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would be brought to the end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.\nThe railroad tracks, spikes, telegraph wire, locomotives, railroad cars, supplies etc. were imported from the east on sailing ships that sailed the nearly , 200-day trip around Cape Horn. Some freight was put on Clipper ships which could do the trip in about 120 days. Some passengers and high-priority freight were shipped over the newly completed (as of 1855) Panama Railroad across the Isthmus of Panama. Using paddle steamers to and from Panama, this shortcut could be traveled in as little as 40 days. Supplies were normally offloaded at the Sacramento, California, docks where the railroad started.\nCentral Pacific construction.\nOn January 8, 1863, Governor Leland Stanford ceremonially broke ground in Sacramento, California, to begin construction of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. On January 7, 1865, a want ad for 5,000 laborers was placed in the Sacramento Union. Consequently, after a trial crew of Chinese workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborers\u2014mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the Taiping Rebellion, seemed to be more willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.\nThe first step of construction was to survey the route and determine the locations where large excavations, tunnels and bridges would be needed. Crews could then start work in advance of the railroad reaching these locations. Supplies and workers were brought up to the work locations by wagon teams and work on several different sections proceeded simultaneously. One advantage of working on tunnels in winter was that tunnel work could often proceed since the work was nearly all \"inside\". Living quarters would have to be built outside and getting new supplies was difficult. Working and living in winter in the presence of snow slides and avalanches caused some deaths.\nTo carve a tunnel, one worker held a rock drill on the granite face while one to two other workers swung eighteen-pound sledgehammers to sequentially hit the drill which slowly advanced into the rock. Once the hole was about deep, it would be filled with black powder, a fuse set and then ignited from a safe distance. Nitroglycerin, which had been invented less than two decades before the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, was used in relatively large quantities during its construction. This was especially true on the Central Pacific Railroad, which owned its own nitroglycerin plant to ensure it had a steady supply of the volatile explosive. This plant was operated by Chinese laborers as they were willing workers even under the most trying and dangerous of conditions.\nChinese laborers were also crucial in the construction of 15 tunnels along the railroad's line through the Sierra Nevada mountains. These were about high and wide. When tunnels with vertical shafts were dug to increase construction speed, tunneling began in the middle of the tunnel and at both ends simultaneously. At first hand-powered derricks were used to help remove loose rocks up the vertical shafts. These derricks were later replaced with steam hoists as work progressed. By using vertical shafts, four faces of the tunnel could be worked at the same time, two in the middle and one at each end. The average daily progress in some tunnels was only a day per face, which was very slow, or daily according to historian George Kraus.49 J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that \"The Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west end of Tunnel No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen and a \"boss/translator\". A single foreman (often Irish) with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 men worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom, removing blasted material. When a gang was small or the men were needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going.\"49 The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers. Once out of the Sierra, construction was much easier and faster. Under the direction of construction superintendent James Harvey Strobridge, Central Pacific track-laying crews set a record with of track laid in one day on April 28, 1869. Horace Hamilton Minkler, track foreman for the Central Pacific, laid the last rail and tie before the Last Spike was driven.\nIn order to keep the CPRR's Sierra grade open during the winter months, beginning in 1867, of massive wooden snow sheds and galleries were built between Blue Ca\u00f1on and Truckee, covering cuts and other points where there was danger of avalanches. 2,500 men and six material trains were employed in this work, which was completed in 1869. The sheds were built with two sides and a steep peaked roof, mostly of locally cut hewn timber and round logs. Snow galleries had one side and a roof that sloped upward until it met the mountainside, thus permitting avalanches to slide over the galleries, some of which extended up the mountainside as much as . Masonry walls such as the \"Chinese Walls\" at Donner Summit were built across canyons to prevent avalanches from striking the side of the vulnerable wooden construction. A few concrete sheds (mostly at crossovers) are still in use today.\nUnion Pacific construction.\nThe major investor in the Union Pacific was Thomas Clark Durant, who had made his stake money by smuggling Confederate cotton with the aid of Grenville M. Dodge. Durant chose routes that would favor places where he held land, and he announced connections to other lines at times that suited his share dealings. He paid an associate to submit the construction bid to another company he controlled, Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier, manipulating the finances and government subsidies and making himself another fortune. Durant hired Dodge as chief engineer and Jack Casement as construction boss.\nIn the East, the progress started in Omaha, Nebraska, by the Union Pacific Railroad which initially proceeded very quickly because of the open terrain of the Great Plains. This changed as the work entered Indian-held lands, because the railroad violated Native American treaties with the United States. War parties began to raid the moving labor camps that followed the progress of the line. Union Pacific responded by increasing security and hiring marksmen to kill American Bison, which were both a physical threat to trains and the primary food source for many of the Plains Indians. The Native Americans then began killing laborers when they realized that the so-called \"Iron Horse\" threatened their existence. Security measures were further strengthened, and progress on the railroad continued.\nGen. William Tecumseh Sherman's first postwar command (Military Division of the Mississippi) covered the territory west of the Mississippi and east of the Rocky Mountains, and his top priority was to protect the construction of the railroads. In 1867, he wrote to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, \"we are not going to let thieving, ragged Indians check and stop the progress\" of the railroads.\n\"On the ground in the West, Gen. Philip Henry Sheridan, assuming Sherman's command, took to his task much as he had done in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, when he ordered the \"scorched earth\" tactics that presaged Sherman's March to the Sea.\"\n\"The devastation of the buffalo population signalled the end of the Indian Wars, and Native Americans were pushed into reservations. In 1869, the Comanche chief Tosawi was reported to have told Sheridan, \"Me Tosawi. Me good Indian,\" and Sheridan allegedly replied, \"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.\" The phrase was later misquoted, with Sheridan supposedly stating, \"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\" Sheridan denied he had ever said such a thing.\"\n\"By the end of the 19th century, only 300 buffalo were left in the wild. Congress finally took action, outlawing the killing of any birds or animals in Yellowstone National Park, where the only surviving buffalo herd could be protected. Conservationists established more wildlife preserves, and the species slowly rebounded. Today, there are more than 200,000 bison in North America.\"\n\"Sheridan acknowledged the role of the railroad in changing the face of the American West, and in his \"Annual Report of the General of the U.S. Army\" in 1878, he acknowledged that the Native Americans were scuttled to reservations with no compensation beyond the promise of religious instruction and basic supplies of food and clothing\u2014promises, he wrote, which were never fulfilled.\"\n\"We took away their country and their means of support, broke up their mode of living, their habits of life, introduced disease and decay among them, and it was for this and against this they made war. Could any one expect less? Then, why wonder at Indian difficulties?\"\nThe \"Last Spike\" ceremony.\n \nSix years after the groundbreaking, laborers of the Central Pacific Railroad from the west and the Union Pacific Railroad from the east met at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. On the Union Pacific side was Union Pacific No 119, an 1868 4-4-0 type. Thrusting westward, the last two rails were laid by Irishmen. On the Central Pacific side was their Central Pacific No 60 Jupiter, another 1868 4-4-0 type. Thrusting eastward, the last two rails were laid by the Chinese.\nIt was at Promontory Summit on May 10, 1869, that the two engines met. Leland Stanford drove \"The Last Spike\" (or golden spike) that joined the rails of the transcontinental railroad. The spike is now on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, while a second \"Last\" Golden Spike is also on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. In perhaps the world's first live mass-media event, the hammers and spike were wired to the telegraph line so that each hammer stroke would be heard as a click at telegraph stations nationwide\u2014the hammer strokes were missed, so the clicks were sent by the telegraph operator. As soon as the ceremonial \"Last Spike\" had been replaced by an ordinary iron spike, a message was transmitted to both the East Coast and West Coast that simply read, \"DONE\". Travel from coast to coast was reduced from six months or more to just one week.\nAftermath.\nRailroad developments.\nWhen the golden spike was driven, the rail network was not yet connected to the Atlantic or Pacific but merely connected Omaha, Nebraska to Sacramento, California. To get from Sacramento to the Pacific, the Central Pacific purchased in 1867 the struggling Western Pacific Railroad (unrelated to the railroad of the same name that would later parallel its route) and in February 1868 resumed construction on it, which had halted in October 1866 because of funding troubles. Upon completing the last link at the Mossdale crossing of the San Joaquin River on September 6, 1869, the first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad's original western terminus on the east side of San Francisco Bay at the Alameda Terminal, where they transferred to the steamer \"Alameda\" for transport across the Bay to San Francisco. On November 8, 1869, the Central Pacific finally completed the rail connection to its western terminus at Oakland, California, also on the East Bay, where freight and passengers completed their transcontinental link to San Francisco by ferry.\nThe original route from the Central Valley to the Bay skirted the Delta by heading south out of Sacramento through Stockton and crossing the San Joaquin River at Mossdale, then climbed over the Altamont Pass and reached the east side of the San Francisco Bay through Niles Canyon. The Western Pacific was originally chartered to go to San Jose, but the Central Pacific decided to build along the East Bay instead, as going from San Jose up the Peninsula to San Francisco itself would have brought it into conflict with competing interests. The railroad entered Alameda and Oakland from the south, roughly paralleling what would later become U.S. Route 50 and later still Interstates 5, 205, and 580. A more direct route was obtained with the purchase of the California Pacific Railroad, crossing the Sacramento River and proceeding southwest through Davis to Benicia, where it crossed the Carquinez Strait by means of the enormous Solano train ferry, then followed the shores of the San Pablo and San Francisco bays to Richmond and the Port of Oakland (paralleling U.S. Route 40 which ultimately became Interstate 80). In 1930, a rail bridge across the Carquinez replaced the Benicia ferries.\nVery early on, the Central Pacific learned that it would have trouble maintaining an open track in winter across the Sierras. At first they tried plowing the road with special snowplows mounted on their steam engines. When this was only partially successful, an extensive process of building snow sheds over some of the track was instituted to protect it from deep snows and avalanches. These eventually succeeded at keeping the tracks clear for all but a few days of the year.\nBoth railroads soon instituted extensive upgrade projects to build better bridges, viaducts and dugways as well as install heavier duty rails, stronger ties, better road beds etc. The original track had often been laid as fast as possible with only secondary attention to maintenance and durability. The primary incentive had been getting the subsidies, which meant that upgrades of all kinds were routinely required in the following years. The cost of making these upgrades was relatively small once the railroad was operating. Once the railroad was complete supplies could be moved from distant factories directly to the construction site by rail.\nThe Union Pacific would not connect Omaha to Council Bluffs until completing the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge in 1872.\nSeveral years after the end of the Civil War, the competing railroads coming from Missouri finally realized their initial strategic advantage and a building boom ensued. In July 1869, the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad finished the Hannibal Bridge in Kansas City which was the first bridge to cross the Missouri River. This in turn connected to Kansas Pacific trains going from Kansas City to Denver, which in turn had built the Denver Pacific Railway connecting to the Union Pacific. In August 1870, the Kansas Pacific drove the last spike connecting to the Denver Pacific line at Strasburg, Colorado, and the first true Atlantic to Pacific United States railroad was completed.\nKansas City's head start in connecting to a true transcontinental railroad contributed to it rather than Omaha becoming the dominant rail center west of Chicago.\nThe Kansas Pacific became part of the Union Pacific in 1880.\nOn June 4, 1876, an express train called the \"Transcontinental Express\" arrived in San Francisco via the first transcontinental railroad only 83 hours and 39 minutes after it had left New York City. Only ten years before, the same journey would have taken months over land or weeks on ship, possibly all the way around South America.\nThe Central Pacific got a direct route to San Francisco when it was merged with the Southern Pacific Railroad to create the Southern Pacific Company in 1885. The Union Pacific initially took over the Southern Pacific in 1901 but was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to divest it because of monopoly concerns. The two railroads would once again unite in 1996 when the Southern Pacific was sold to the Union Pacific.\nHaving been bypassed with the completion of the Lucin Cutoff in 1904, the Promontory Summit rails were pulled up in 1942 to be recycled for the World War\u00a0II effort. This process began with a ceremonial \"undriving\" at the Last Spike location.\nCr\u00e9dit Mobilier.\nDespite the transcontinental success and millions in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy less than three years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad. The scandal hit epic proportions in the 1872 United States presidential election, which saw the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant and became the biggest scandal of the Gilded Age. It would not be resolved until the death of the congressman who was supposed to have reined in its excesses but instead wound up profiting from it.\nDurant had initially come up with the scheme to have Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier subcontract to do the actual track work. Durant gained control of the company after buying out employee Herbert Hoxie for $10,000. Under Durant's guidance, Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier was charging Union Pacific often twice or more the customary cost for track work. The process mired down Union Pacific work.\nLincoln asked Massachusetts Congressman Oakes Ames, who was on the railroad committee, to clean things up and get the railroad moving. Ames got his brother Oliver Ames Jr. named president of the Union Pacific, while he became president of Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier.\nAmes then in turn gave stock options to other politicians while at the same time continuing the lucrative overcharges. The scandal was to implicate Vice President Schuyler Colfax (who was cleared) and future President James Garfield among others.\nThe scandal broke in 1872 when the \"New York Sun\" published correspondence detailing the scheme between Henry S. McComb and Ames. In the ensuing Congressional investigation, it was recommended that Ames be expelled from Congress, but this was reduced to a censure and Ames died within three months.\nDurant later left the Union Pacific and a new rail baron, Jay Gould, became the dominant stockholder. As a result of the Panic of 1873, Gould was able to pick up bargains, among them the control of the Union Pacific Railroad and Western Union.\nVisible remains.\nVisible remains of the historic line are still easily located\u2014hundreds of miles are still in service today, especially through the Sierra Nevada Mountains and canyons in Utah and Wyoming. While the original rail has long since been replaced because of age and wear, and the roadbed upgraded and repaired, the lines generally run on top of the original, handmade grade. Vista points on Interstate 80 through California's Truckee Canyon provide a panoramic view of many miles of the original Central Pacific line and of the snow sheds which made winter train travel safe and practical.\nIn areas where the original line has been bypassed and abandoned, primarily because of the Lucin Cutoff re-route in Utah, the original road grade is still obvious, as are numerous cuts and fills, especially the Big Fill a few miles east of Promontory. The sweeping curve which connected to the east end of the Big Fill now passes a Thiokol rocket research and development facility.\nIn 1957, Congress authorized the Golden Spike National Historic Site, which was redesignated the Golden Spike National Historical Park in 2019. Today the site features replica engines of Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Pacific Jupiter. The engines are fired up periodically by the National Park Service for the public. On May 10, 2006, on the anniversary of the driving of the spike, Utah announced that its state quarter design would be a representation of the driving of the Last Spike.\nCurrent passenger service.\nAmtrak's \"California Zephyr\", a daily passenger service from Emeryville, California (in the San Francisco Bay Area) to Chicago, uses the first transcontinental railroad from Sacramento to central Nevada. Because this rail line currently operates in a directional running setup across most of Nevada, the \"California Zephyr\" will switch to the Central Corridor at either Winnemucca or Wells.\nIn popular culture.\nThe joining of the Union Pacific line with the Central Pacific line in May 1869 at Promontory Summit, Utah, was one of the major inspirations for French writer Jules Verne's book entitled \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", published in 1873.\nWhile not exactly accurate, John Ford's 1924 silent movie \"The Iron Horse\" captures the fervent nationalism that drove public support for the project. Among the cooks serving the film's cast and crew between shots were some of the Chinese laborers who worked on the Central Pacific section of the railroad.\nThe feat is depicted in various movies, including the 1939 film \"Union Pacific\", starring Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Cecil B. DeMille, which depicts the fictional Central Pacific investor Asa Barrows obstructing attempts of the Union Pacific to reach Ogden, Utah.\nThe 1939 movie is said to have inspired the \"Union Pacific\" Western television series starring Jeff Morrow, Judson Pratt and Susan Cummings which aired in syndication from 1958 until 1959.\nThe 1962 film \"How the West Was Won\" has a whole segment devoted to the construction; one of the movie's most famous scenes, filmed in Cinerama, is of a buffalo stampede over the railroad.\nThe construction of what presumably is\u2014or is suggested to be\u2014the transcontinental railroad provides the backdrop of the 1968 epic Spaghetti Western \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", directed by Italian director Sergio Leone.\nGraham Masterton's 1981 novel \"A Man of Destiny\" (published in the UK as \"Railroad\") is a fictionalized account of the line's construction.\nThe 1993 children's book \"Ten Mile Day\" by Mary Ann Fraser tells the story of the record setting push by the Central Pacific in which they set a record by laying of track in a single day on April 28, 1869, to settle a $10,000 bet.\nKristiana Gregory's 1999 book \"The Great Railroad Race\" (part of the \"Dear America\" series) is written as the fictional diary of Libby West, who chronicles the end of the railroad construction and the excitement that engulfed the country at the time.\nIn the 1999 Will Smith film \"Wild Wild West\", the joining ceremony is the setting of an assassination attempt on then U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant by the film's antagonist Dr. Arliss Loveless.\nThe main character in \"The Claim\" (2000) is a surveyor for the Central Pacific Railroad, and the film is partially about the efforts of a frontier mayor to have the railroad routed through his town.\nIn the 2002 DreamWorks Animation movie \"\", the title character, a horse named Spirit, is delivered with other horses to pull a steam locomotive at a work site for the transcontinental railroad.\nThe \"American Experience\" series' 2002\u20132003 season documents the railway in the episode titled \"Transcontinental Railroad\".\nThe building of the railway is covered by the 2004 BBC documentary series \"Seven Wonders of the Industrial World\" in episode 6, \"The Line\".\nThe popular sci-fi television show \"Doctor Who\" featured the transcontinental railroad in a 2010 BBC audiobook entitled \"The Runaway Train\", read by Matt Smith and written for audio by Oli Smith.\nThe construction of the transcontinental railroad provides the setting for the AMC television series \"Hell on Wheels\". Thomas Durant is a regular character in the series and is portrayed by actor Colm Meaney.\nThe campaign mode of Kalypso Media's 2018 video game \"Railway Empire\" covers the construction of the transcontinental railroad and features key figures such as Thomas Durant and Collis Huntington.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nFor maps and railroad pictures of this era shortly after the advent of photography see:"}
{"id": "36545", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36545", "title": "Gaul", "text": "Historical region of Western Europe inhabited by Celtic tribes\nGaul () was a region of Western Europe first clearly described by the Romans, encompassing present-day France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, and Northern Italy. It covered an area of . According to Julius Caesar, who took control of the region on behalf of the Roman Republic, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica, and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La T\u00e8ne culture during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. This material culture was found throughout Gaul and as far east as modern-day southern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary.\nWarbands led by the Gaul Brennos sacked Rome in 387 BC, becoming the only time Rome was conquered by a foreign enemy in 800 years. However, Gallia Cisalpina was conquered by the Romans in 204 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120\u00a0BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103\u00a0BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the largest part of Gaul in his campaigns from 58 to 51 BC. Roman control of Gaul lasted for five centuries, until the last Roman rump state, the Domain of Soissons, fell to the Franks in AD 486.\nWhile the Gauls shifted from a primarily Celtic culture during Late Antiquity, becoming amalgamated into a Gallo-Roman culture, \"Gallia\" remained the conventional name of the territory throughout the Early Middle Ages, until it acquired a new identity as the Capetian Kingdom of France in the high medieval period. \"Gallia\" remains a name of France in modern Greek (\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1) and modern Latin (besides the alternatives \"Francia\" and \"Francogallia\").\nEtymology.\nThe Greek and Latin names \"Galatia\" (first attested by Timaeus of Tauromenium in the 4th century BC) and \"Gallia\" are ultimately derived from a Celtic ethnic term or clan \"Gal(a)-to-\". The \"Galli\" of \"Gallia Celtica\" were reported to refer to themselves as \"Celtae\" by Caesar. Hellenistic etymology connected the name of the Galatians (\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \"Gal\u00e1tai\") to the supposedly \"milk-white\" skin (\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1, \"g\u00e1la\" \"milk\") of the Gauls. Modern researchers say it is related to Welsh \"gallu\", , \"capacity, power\", thus meaning \"powerful people\".\nDespite its superficial similarity, the normal English translation of \"Gallia\" since the Middle Ages, \"Gaul\", has a different origin from the Latin term. It stems from the French \"Gaule\", deriving from the Old Frankish \"*Walholant\" (via a Latinized form \"*Walula\"), literally the \"Land of the Foreigners/Romans\". \"*Walho-\" is a reflex of the Proto-Germanic \"*walhaz\", \"foreigner, Romanized person\", an exonym applied by Germanic speakers to Celts and Latin-speaking people indiscriminately. It is cognate with the names Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia, and Wallachia. The Germanic \"w-\" is regularly rendered as \"gu-\" / \"g-\" in French (cf. \"guerre\" \"war\", \"garder\" \"ward\", \"Guillaume\" \"William\"), and the historic diphthong \"au\" is the regular outcome of \"al\" before a following consonant (cf. \"cheval\" ~ \"chevaux\"). French \"Gaule\" or \"Gaulle\" cannot be derived from Latin \"Gallia\", since \"g\" would become \"j\" before \"a\" (cf. \"gamba\" &gt; \"jambe\"), and the diphthong \"au\" would be unexplained; the regular outcome of Latin \"Gallia\" is \"Jaille\" in French, which is found in several western place names, such as, La Jaille-Yvon and Saint-Mars-la-Jaille. Proto-Germanic \"*walha\" is derived ultimately from the name of the Volcae.\nAlso unrelated, in spite of superficial similarity, is the name \"Gael\". The Irish word \"gall\" did originally mean \"a Gaul\", i.e. an inhabitant of Gaul, but its meaning was later widened to \"foreigner\", to describe the Vikings, and later still the Normans. The dichotomic words \"gael\" and \"gall\" are sometimes used together for contrast, for instance in the 12th-century book \"Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib\".\nAs adjectives, English has the two variants: \"Gaulish\" and \"Gallic\". The two adjectives are used synonymously, as \"pertaining to Gaul or the Gauls\", although the Celtic language group once spoken in Gaul is predominantly known as Gaulish.\nHistory.\nPre-Roman.\nThere is little written information concerning the peoples that inhabited the regions of Gaul, save what can be gleaned from coins. Therefore, the early history of the Gauls is predominantly a matter of archaeology, and the relationships between their material culture, genetic relationships (the study of which has been aided, in recent years, through the field of archaeogenetics) and linguistic divisions rarely coincide.\nBefore the rapid spread of the La T\u00e8ne culture in the 5th to 4th centuries BC, the territory of eastern and southern France already participated in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture (c.\u200912th to 8th centuries BC) out of which the early iron-working Hallstatt culture (7th to 6th centuries BC) would develop. By 500 BC, there is strong Hallstatt influence throughout most of France (except for the Alps and the extreme north-west).\nOut of this Hallstatt background, the La T\u00e8ne culture arose during the 7th and 6th century BC, presumably representing an early form of Continental Celtic culture and likely under Mediterranean influence from the Greek, Phoenician, and Etruscan civilizations. This culture spread out along the Seine, the Middle Rhine and the upper Elbe. By the late 5th century BC, La T\u00e8ne influence spread rapidly across the entire territory of Gaul. The La T\u00e8ne culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) not only in France but also what is now Switzerland, northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia and Hungary. A major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age, during the 500-year period from 1300 to 800 BC. The newcomers were genetically most closely related to ancient individuals from Gaul. The authors describe this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".\nThe major source of early information on the Celts of Gaul is Poseidonios of Apamea, whose writings were quoted by Timagenes, Julius Caesar, the Sicilian Greek Diodorus Siculus, and the Greek geographer Strabo. In the 4th and early 3rd century BC, Gallic clan confederations expanded far beyond the territory of what would become Roman Gaul (which defines usage of the term \"Gaul\" today), into Pannonia, Illyria, northern Italy, Transylvania and even Asia Minor. By the 2nd century BC, the Romans described Gallia Transalpina as distinct from Gallia Cisalpina. In his \"Gallic Wars\", Julius Caesar distinguishes among three ethnic groups in Gaul: the Belgae in the north (roughly between the Rhine and the Seine), the Celtae in the center and in Armorica, and the Aquitani in the southwest, the southeast being already colonized by the Romans. While some scholars believe the Belgae north of the Somme were a mixture of Celtic and Germanic elements, their ethnic affiliations have not been definitively resolved.\nIn addition to the Gauls, there were other peoples living in Gaul, such as the Greeks and Phoenicians who had established outposts such as Massilia (present-day Marseille) along the Mediterranean coast. Also, along the southeastern French Mediterranean coast, the Ligures had merged with the Celts to form a Celto-Ligurian culture.\nRoman conquest.\nIn the 2nd century BC Mediterranean Gaul had an extensive urban fabric and was prosperous. Archeologists know of cities in northern Gaul including the Biturigian capital of Avaricum (Bourges), Cenabum (Orl\u00e9ans), Autricum (Chartres) and the excavated site of Bibracte near Autun in Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, along with a number of hill forts (or oppida) used in times of war. The prosperity of Mediterranean Gaul encouraged Rome to respond to pleas for assistance from the inhabitants of Massilia, who found themselves under attack by a coalition of Ligures and Gauls. The Romans intervened in Gaul in 154 BC and again in 125 BC. Whereas on the first occasion they came and went, on the second they stayed. In 122 BC Domitius Ahenobarbus managed to defeat the Allobroges (allies of the Salluvii), while in the ensuing year Quintus Fabius Maximus \"destroyed\" an army of the Arverni led by their king Bituitus, who had come to the aid of the Allobroges. Rome allowed Massilia to keep its lands, but added to its own territories the lands of the conquered tribes. As a direct result of these conquests, Rome now controlled an area extending from the Pyrenees to the lower Rh\u00f4ne river, and in the east up the Rh\u00f4ne valley to Lake Geneva. By 121 BC Romans had conquered the Mediterranean region called \"Provincia\" (later named \"Gallia Narbonensis\"). This conquest upset the ascendancy of the Gaulish Arverni peoples.\nThe Roman proconsul and general Julius Caesar led his army into Gaul in 58 BC, ostensibly to assist Rome's Gaullish allies against the migrating Helvetii. With the help of various Gallic clans (e.g., the Aedui) he managed to conquer nearly all of Gaul. While their military was just as strong as the Romans', the internal division between the Gallic tribes guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. Caesar was checked by Vercingetorix at a siege of Gergovia, a fortified town in the center of Gaul. Caesar's alliances with many Gallic clans broke. Even the Aedui, their most faithful supporters, threw in their lot with the Arverni but the ever-loyal Remi (best known for its cavalry) and Lingones sent troops to support Caesar. The Germani of the Ubii also sent cavalry, which Caesar equipped with Remi horses. Caesar captured Vercingetorix in September 52 BC in the Battle of Alesia, which ended the majority of Gallic resistance to Rome.\nAs many as one million people (probably 1 in 5 of the Gauls) died, another one million were enslaved, 300 clans were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed during the Gallic Wars. The entire population of the city of Avaricum (Bourges) (40,000 in all) were slaughtered. Before Caesar's campaign against the Helvetii (Switzerland), the Helvetians had numbered 263,000, but afterwards only 100,000 remained, most of whom Caesar took as slaves.\nRoman Gaul.\nAfter Gaul was absorbed as \"Gallia\", a set of Roman provinces, its inhabitants gradually adopted aspects of Roman culture and assimilated, resulting in the distinct Gallo-Roman culture. Citizenship was granted to all in 212 AD by the Constitutio Antoniniana. From the 3rd to 5th centuries, Gaul was exposed to raids by the Franks. The Gallic Empire\u2014consisting of the provinces of Gaul, Britannia, and Hispania, including the peaceful Baetica in the south\u2014broke away from Rome from 260 to 273. In addition to the large number of natives, Gallia also became home to some Roman citizens from elsewhere and also immigration of Germanic and Scythian tribes such as the Alans.\nThe religious practices of inhabitants became a combination of Roman and Celtic practice, with Celtic deities such as Cobannus and Epona subjected to . The imperial cult and Eastern mystery religions also gained a following. Eventually, after it became the official religion of the empire, and paganism became suppressed, Christianity won out in the twilight days of the Western Roman Empire. A small but notable Jewish presence also became established.\nThe Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture. The last record of spoken Gaulish deemed to be plausibly credible concerned the destruction by Christians of a pagan shrine in Auvergne \"called Vasso Galatae in the Gallic tongue\". Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French. The Vulgar Latin in the region of Gallia took on a distinctly local character, some of which is attested in graffiti, which evolved into the Gallo-Romance dialects which include French and its closest relatives. The influence of substrate languages may be seen in graffiti showing sound changes that matched changes that had earlier occurred in the indigenous languages, especially Gaulish. The Vulgar Latin in the north of Gaul evolved into the langues d'o\u00efl and Franco-Provencal, while the dialects in the south evolved into the modern Occitan and Catalan tongues. Other languages held to be \"Gallo-Romance\" include the Gallo-Italic languages and the Rhaeto-Romance languages.\nFrankish Gaul.\nFollowing Frankish victories in the Franco-Roman War (486) and the Franco\u2013Gothic War (507) and Autun (532), Gaul (except for Brittany and Septimania) came under the rule of the Merovingians, the first kings of France. Gallo-Roman culture persisted particularly in the areas of Gallia Narbonensis that developed into Occitania, Gallia Cisalpina and to a lesser degree, Aquitania. The north developed into Merovingian culture. Roman life, centered on the public events and cultural responsibilities of urban life in the \"res publica\" and the sometimes luxurious life of the self-sufficient rural villa system, took longer to collapse in the Gallo-Roman regions, where the Visigoths largely inherited the status quo in the early 5th century. Gallo-Roman language persisted in the northeast into the Silva Carbonaria that formed an effective cultural barrier, with the Franks to the north and east, and in the northwest to the lower valley of the Loire. Gallo-Roman culture interfaced with Frankish culture in urban areas like Tours.\nCulture.\nSocial structure, indigenous nation and clans.\nThe fundamental unit of Gallic politics was the clan, which consisted of one or more of what Caesar called \"pagi\". Each clan had a council of elders and initially a king. Later, the executive was an annually-elected magistrate. Among the Aedui, a clan of Gaul, the executive held the title of \"Vergobret\", a position much like a king, but his powers were held in check by rules laid down by the council.\nThe regional ethnic groups, or \"pagi\" as the Romans called them (singular: \"pagus\"; the French word \"pays\", \"region\" [a more accurate translation is 'country'], comes from this term), were organized into larger multi-clan groups, which the Romans called \"civitates\". These administrative groupings would be taken over by the Romans in their system of local control, and these \"civitates\" would also be the basis of France's eventual division into ecclesiastical bishoprics and dioceses, which would remain in place\u2014with slight changes\u2014until the French Revolution.\nAlthough the clans were moderately stable political entities, Gaul as a whole tended to be politically divided, there being virtually no unity among the various clans. Only during particularly trying times, such as the invasion of Caesar, could the Gauls unite under a single leader like Vercingetorix. Even then, however, the faction lines were clear.\nThe Romans divided Gaul broadly into \"Provincia\" (the conquered area around the Mediterranean), and the northern Gallia Comata (\"free Gaul\" or \"long-haired Gaul\"). Caesar divided the people of Gallia Comata into three broad groups: the \"Aquitani\"; \"Galli\" (who in their own language were called \"Celtae\"); and \"Belgae\". In the modern sense, Gaulish peoples are defined linguistically, as speakers of dialects of the Gaulish language. While the Aquitani were probably Vascons, the Belgae would thus probably be a mixture of Celtic and Germanic elements.\nJulius Caesar wrote in \"The Gallic Wars\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in our Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the civilization and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in valor, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone; it is bounded by the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae; it borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the river Rhine, and stretches toward the north. The Belgae rises from the extreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the river Rhine; and look toward the north and the rising sun. Aquitania extends from the river Garonne to the Pyrenaean mountains and to that part of the ocean which is near Spain: it looks between the setting of the sun, and the north star.\nReligion.\nThe Gauls practiced a form of animism, ascribing human characteristics to lakes, streams, mountains, and other natural features and granting them a quasi-divine status. Also, worship of animals was not uncommon; the animal most sacred to the Gauls was the boar which can be found on many Gallic military standards, much like the Roman eagle. Their system of gods and goddesses was loose, there being certain deities which virtually every Gallic person worshipped, as well as clan and household gods.\nPerhaps the most intriguing facet of Gallic religion is the practice of the druids. The druids presided over human or animal sacrifices that were made in wooded groves or crude temples. They also appear to have held the responsibility for preserving the annual agricultural calendar and instigating seasonal festivals which corresponded to key points of the lunar-solar calendar. The religious practices of druids were syncretic and borrowed from earlier pagan traditions, with probably Indo-European roots. Caesar mentions in \"The Gallic Wars\" that those Celts who wanted to make a close study of druidism went to Britain to do so. In a little over a century later, Gnaeus Julius Agricola mentions Roman armies attacking a large druid sanctuary in Anglesey in Wales.\nThere is no certainty concerning the origin of the druids, but it is clear that they guarded the secrets of their order and held sway over the people of Gaul. Indeed, they claimed the right to determine questions of war and peace and thereby held an \"international\" status. In addition, the druids monitored the religion of ordinary Gauls and were in charge of educating the aristocracy. They also practiced a form of excommunication from the assembly of worshippers, which in ancient Gaul meant a separation from secular society as well. Thus the druids were an important part of Gallic society. The nearly complete and mysterious disappearance of the Celtic language from most of the territorial lands of ancient Gaul, with the exception of Brittany, can be attributed to the fact that Celtic druids refused to allow the Celtic oral literature or traditional wisdom to be committed to the written letter.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is Canada's largest book, gift, and specialty toy retailer. Indigo operates stores in all ten provinces and one territory, and through a website offering a selection of books, toys, home d\u00e9cor, stationery, and gifts. Most Chapters and Indigo stores include a Starbucks caf\u00e9 inside. As of 2022, Indigo has started selling music (vinyl, CDs), and select audio equipment (headphones, turntables).\nAt the end of its fiscal year in March 2018, the company reported a record annual revenue surpassing CAD $1 billion. As of July 1, 2017, the company operated 86 superstores under the banners Chapters and Indigo and 123 small format stores, under the banners Coles, Indigospirit, and The Book Company. Indigo is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario and employed more than 7,000 people throughout Canada.\nAfter a series of mergers and acquisitions in the Canadian bookstore industry, Indigo stands as Canada's last remaining national bookstore chain. In late 2017, announcements were made to expand to the United States, starting with a location in The Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, New Jersey.\nHistory.\nThe company was founded in 1996 by Heather Reisman, who is married to Gerry Schwartz, majority owner and CEO of Onex Corporation.\nThe company's first big-box bookstore initially called \"Indigo Books, Music &amp; More\", was opened in Burlington, Ontario on September 4, 1997. With financing from Onex Corporation, Indigo bought Chapters, their largest Canadian competitor, in 2001 and continues to operate many stores under the Chapters banner. Indigo also gained the ownership of the Coles chain of small-format bookstores, which was also owned by Chapters.\nIndigo closed three high-profile stores in Toronto in the spring of 2014, including the World's Biggest Bookstore, which it acquired when it bought Chapters. In June 2014, Reisman said the company was headed into a new phase, selling a much higher percentage of non-book items.\nIn late 2017, it was announced that it would expand to the United States, with its first location opening in \"The Mall at Short Hills\" in October 2018.\nIn September 2022, Reisman stepped down as CEO and became executive chair, with Peter Ruis being named CEO.\nIn February 2023, Indigo was the victim of a ransomware attack that rendered them unable to process non-cash transactions, returns, and gift cards for approximately four days. They got back their card transactions through a wireless pinpad, but the rewards system was still down. Online shopping remained unavailable for almost two months. While Indigo has assured the public that customer data was not compromised, they notified current and former employees that employee data had been. LockBit has claimed responsibility for the attack. Indigo made the decision not to pay the ransom due to the possibility that the money would be used to fund terrorism or organized crime.\nIn June 2023, Reisman announced her retirement, effective August 22, 2023. This came after four out of ten board members stepped down, citing loss of confidence and mistreatment from the board leadership.\nIn September 2023, founder Heather Reisman returned as chief executive officer, after Peter Ruis abruptly resigned earlier in the month.\nIn November 2023, Indigo's flagship store in Toronto was vandalized by posters and painted slogans accusing Reisman of raising funds for the Israeli military. The arrest of the Indigo 11 resulted in four guilty pleas for mischief.\nIn May 2024, Indigo's shareholders approved a deal to take the company private for $2.50 a share, the deal closed on May 31 and the stock was delisted from the TSX on June 4th\nIn August 2024, Indigo served a cease and desist letter to the pro-Palestinian activist group Indigo Kills Kids. Demands in the letter included that the group stop infringing intellectual property laws, remove \"false and defamatory content,\" and stop interfering with the business and reputation of Indigo. On September 17, 2024, the Federal Court of Canada granted interim emergency approval to a lawsuit from Indigo requesting internet service providers take down the organization's website.\nOperations.\nThe company sells books, magazines, gifts, and toys through its website and in its stores. Its banners currently include Indigo Books &amp; Music, Chapters, Coles, SmithBooks, IndigoSpirit, and The Book Company (small format).\nIndigo began a partnership with Apple and iUniverse publishing in the 2010s. Indigo also manufactures its own brand of products, called IndigoLife. In addition, the chain's Indigo Trusted Advisor Program offers book recommendations from experts in health, finance, and the environment, such as David Bach and David Suzuki.\nCharitable activities.\nIn 2004, Indigo started the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation, a program that helps provide new books and learning materials to high-needs elementary schools. Indigo commits $1.5 million annually to schools across Canada.\nThe money is raised by Indigo itself, customers, staff, suppliers, and proceeds from Love of Reading fundraising products (i.e., gift card sleeves). Only 80% of customer donations have been granted to over 1800 schools since the Love of Reading Foundation's inception, with Indigo covering all of the operating costs of the foundation. The funding given to the schools is split across a 90% credit to spend at Indigo and 10% cash to be spent anywhere, as long as it contributes to advancement of literacy.\nIn addition to the regularly collected funds, the annual Adopt a School program has increased the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation's donations up to a total of CAD 26 million given to more than 3,000 school libraries in Canada since 2004. During the month-long Adopt a School program, each retail store selects a local school to be the recipient of the donations the store collects during that time period.\nIn 2007, the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation produced a documentary chronicling the issue of funding for books in Canadian elementary schools. The documentary \"Writing on the Wall\" recounts the establishment of the foundation, while revealing the current conditions of school libraries and literacy in Canada. A follow-up documentary was created in 2017 titled \"Read Between the Lines\".\nRakuten Kobo.\nRakuten Kobo, an e-reader platform and manufacturer, was founded and spun off of Indigo in November 2009. By August 2011, the Kobo e-reading platform had become the dominant player in Canada, with research firm Ipsos Reid estimating that it represented 36% of the Canadian market as of that date.\nIn November 2011, Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten purchased the company for US$315 million in cash. Around 58% of Kobo was owned by Indigo at the time of the purchase.\nEmployee programs.\nIndigo was listed as one of Canada's Top 20 Employer Brands in the 2018 survey by Randstad NV. This is due in part to staff rewards program which includes benefits eligibility for both full-time and part-time employees. Indigo also offers a company-matched RRSP program and yearly employee scholarships.\nCriticism and controversies.\nCharity scandal.\nCBC Marketplace showed that Indigo is doubly profiting from its own charity \"Love of Reading Foundation\": the charity forced schools to buy books only from Indigo at full retail price. Other vendors usually sell to charities at wholesale price.https:// Then, the charity used the profits to get charity tax refund for the donation to its own charity. Based on data provided by the CBC documentary, the profits obtained is almost equal to the charity it gives if the tax refunds is taken into account.\nProduct removal.\nIn 2001, Indigo removed Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" from the shelves. In 2006, Indigo decided not to sell the June issue of \"Harper's Magazine\", which reprinted the controversial cartoons of the Muslim prophet Muhammad that had led to violent demonstrations around the world. Indigo also did not distribute the issue of \"Western Standard\" which reprinted and discussed those same cartoons. The company has also reportedly refused to stock several titles by David Icke, and firearms magazines.\nCompetitive position.\nThe Indigo/Chapters chain has been criticized over what some perceive as a virtual monopoly over retail-based book sales in Canada. In 2002, the company strongly opposed the entry of Amazon into the Canadian marketplace with accusations the U.S.-based company was skirting regulations about foreign ownership of Canadian booksellers.\nIndigo's expansion has been blamed, among other factors, for the financial difficulties of some independent booksellers in Canada. In particular, its rise coincided with the bankruptcy of Lichtman's, once Canada's largest independent bookseller.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field.ch13278 A permanent magnet's magnetic field pulls on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. In addition, a nonuniform magnetic field exerts minuscule forces on \"nonmagnetic\" materials by three other magnetic effects: paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism, although these forces are usually so small they can only be detected by laboratory equipment. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, electric currents, and electric fields varying in time. Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, it is described mathematically by a function assigning a vector to each point of space, called a vector field (more precisely, a pseudovector field).\nElectromagnetics.\nIn electromagnetics, the term \"magnetic field\" is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols B and H. In the International System of Units, the unit of B, magnetic flux density, is the tesla (in SI base units: kilogram per second squared per ampere),21 which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere. The unit of H, magnetic field strength, is ampere per meter (A/m).22 B and H differ in how they take the medium and/or magnetization into account. In vacuum, the two fields are related through the vacuum permeability, formula_1; in a magnetized material, the quantities on each side of this equation differ by the magnetization field of the material.\nMagnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, their spin.ch1 Magnetic fields and electric fields are interrelated and are both components of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature.\nMagnetic fields are used throughout modern technology, particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is conceptualized and investigated as magnetic circuits. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the solar wind and is important in navigation using a compass.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDescription.\nThe force on an electric charge depends on its location, speed, and direction; two vector fields are used to describe this force.ch1 The first is the electric field, which describes the force acting on a stationary charge and gives the component of the force that is independent of motion. The magnetic field, in contrast, describes the component of the force that is proportional to both the speed and direction of charged particles.ch13 The field is defined by the Lorentz force law and is, at each instant, perpendicular to both the motion of the charge and the force it experiences.\nThere are two different, but closely related vector fields which are both sometimes called the \"magnetic field\" written B and H. While both the best names for these fields and exact interpretation of what these fields represent has been the subject of long running debate, there is wide agreement about how the underlying physics work. Historically, the term \"magnetic field\" was reserved for H while using other terms for B, but many recent textbooks use the term \"magnetic field\" to describe B as well as or in place of H.\nThere are many alternative names for both (see sidebars).\nThe B-field.\nThe magnetic field vector B at any point can be defined as the vector that, when used in the Lorentz force law, correctly predicts the force on a charged particle at that point:204\nLorentz force law (\"vector form, SI units\")\nformula_2\nHere F is the force on the particle, \"q\" is the particle's electric charge, E is the external electric field, v, is the particle's velocity, and \u00d7 denotes the cross product. The direction of force on the charge can be determined by a mnemonic known as the \"right-hand rule\" (see the figure). Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field \"can\" distinguish between these, see Hall effect below.\nThe first term in the Lorentz equation is from the theory of electrostatics, and says that a particle of charge \"q\" in an electric field E experiences an electric force:\nformula_3\nThe second term is the magnetic force:\nformula_4\nUsing the definition of the cross product, the magnetic force can also be written as a scalar equation:357\nformula_5\nwhere \"F\"magnetic, v, and B are the scalar magnitude of their respective vectors, and \u03b8 is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. The vector B is \"defined\" as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. In other words,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe B field can also be defined by the torque on a magnetic dipole, m.174\nMagnetic torque (\"vector form, SI units\")\nformula_6\nThe SI unit of B is tesla (symbol: T). The Gaussian-cgs unit of B is the gauss (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1\u00a0T \u2258 10000\u00a0G.) One nanotesla corresponds to 1 gamma (symbol: \u03b3).\nThe H-field.\nThe magnetic H field is defined:269192ch36\nDefinition of the H field \"(vector form, SI units)\"\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 is the vacuum permeability, and M is the magnetization vector. In a vacuum, B and H are proportional to each other. Inside a material they are different (see H and B inside and outside magnetic materials). The SI unit of the H-field is the ampere per metre (A/m), and the CGS unit is the oersted (Oe).286\nMeasurement.\nAn instrument used to measure the local magnetic field is known as a magnetometer. Important classes of magnetometers include using induction magnetometers (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, rotating coil magnetometers, Hall effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that is detectable in radio waves. The finest precision for a magnetic field measurement was attained by Gravity Probe B at ().\nVisualization.\nThe field can be visualized by a set of \"magnetic field lines\", that follow the direction of the field at each point. The lines can be constructed by measuring the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of points (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a vector) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. Connecting these arrows then forms a set of magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like streamlines in fluid flow, in that they represent a continuous distribution, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.\nAn advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the \"number\" of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly \"translated\" to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.237\nVarious phenomena \"display\" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to \"field lines\". Magnetic field \"lines\" are also visually displayed in polar auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\nField lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. \"Unlike\" poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; \"like\" poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other.\nMagnetic field of permanent magnets.\n\"Permanent magnets\" are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.\nThe magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's \"strength\" (called its magnetic dipole moment m). The equations are non-trivial and depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, m points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its m by 180 degrees.\nThe magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own m. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.\nThere are two simplified models for the nature of these dipoles: the magnetic pole model and the Amperian loop model. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, H and B. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.\nA realistic model of magnetism is more complicated than either of these models; neither model fully explains why materials are magnetic. The monopole model has no experimental support. The Amperian loop model explains some, but not all of a material's magnetic moment. The model predicts that the motion of electrons within an atom are connected to those electrons' orbital magnetic dipole moment, and these orbital moments do contribute to the magnetism seen at the macroscopic level. However, the motion of electrons is not classical, and the spin magnetic moment of electrons (which is not explained by either model) is also a significant contribution to the total moment of magnets.\nMagnetic pole model.\nHistorically, early physics textbooks would model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. At the microscopic level, this model contradicts the experimental evidence, and the pole model of magnetism is no longer the typical way to introduce the concept.258 However, it is still sometimes used as a macroscopic model for ferromagnetism due to its mathematical simplicity.\nIn this model, a magnetic H-field is produced by fictitious \"magnetic charges\" that are spread over the surface of each pole. These \"magnetic charges\" are in fact related to the magnetization field M. The H-field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field E, which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all H-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all H-field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the H-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H-field.\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength \"q\"m separated by a small distance vector d, such that m = \"q\"m\u2009d. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field H both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that H is opposite to the magnetization field M inside a permanent magnet.\nSince it is based on the fictitious idea of a \"magnetic charge density\", the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north\u2013south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents, nor the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism.\nThe pole model usually treats magnetic charge as a mathematical abstraction, rather than a physical property of particles. However, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that physically has only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a \"magnetic charge\" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end. Some theories (such as Grand Unified Theories) have predicted the existence of magnetic monopoles, but so far, none have been observed.\nAmperian loop model.\nIn the model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop with current \"I\" and loop area \"A\". The dipole moment of this loop is \"m\" = \"IA\".\nThese magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic B-field.\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current \"I\" and an area \"a\". Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of\nformula_9\nwhere the direction of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area \"a\" has been reduced to zero and its current \"I\" increased to infinity such that the product \"m\" = \"Ia\" is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein\u2013de Haas effect \"rotation by magnetization\" and its inverse, the Barnett effect or \"magnetization by rotation\". Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.\nInteractions with magnets.\nForce between magnets.\nSpecifying the force between two small magnets is quite complicated because it depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and their distance and direction relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the other.\nTo understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the \"magnetic pole model\" given above. In this model, the \"H-field\" of one magnet pushes and pulls on \"both\" poles of a second magnet. If this H-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is \"nonuniform\" (such as the H near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.\nThis is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.\nThe details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment m due to a magnetic field B is:Eq. 11.42\nformula_10\nwhere the gradient \u2207 is the change of the quantity m \u00b7 B per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of m \u00b7 B. The dot product m \u00b7 B = \"mB\"cos(\"\u03b8\"), where \"m\" and \"B\" represent the magnitude of the m and B vectors and \"\u03b8\" is the angle between them. If m is in the same direction as B then the dot product is positive and the gradient points \"uphill\" pulling the magnet into regions of higher B-field (more strictly larger m \u00b7 B). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own m then summing up the forces on each of these very small regions.\nMagnetic torque on permanent magnets.\nIf two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a \"magnetic torque\" on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque \u03c4 tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.\n In terms of the pole model, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same H also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of m as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to \"\u03c4\" = \"\u03bc\"0 \"m H\" sin\u2009\"\u03b8\", where \"\u03bc\"0 is a constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m) and \u03b8 is the angle between H and m.\nMathematically, the torque \u03c4 on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment m of the magnet:\nformula_11\nwhere \u00d7 represents the vector cross product. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if m is in the same direction as the magnetic field, since the cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction. Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.\nInteractions with electric currents.\nCurrents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.\nMagnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents.\nAll moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges, such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.\nMagnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the \"right-hand grip rule\" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)\nBending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or \"solenoid\" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron core may act as an \"electromagnet\", generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.\nThe magnetic field generated by a steady current I (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point) is described by the \"Biot\u2013Savart law\":224\nformula_12\nwhere the integral sums over the wire length where vector d\u2113 is the vector line element with direction in the same sense as the current \"I\", \"\u03bc\"0 is the magnetic constant, \"r\" is the distance between the location of d\u2113 and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and r\u0302 is a unit vector in the direction of r. For example, in the case of a sufficiently long, straight wire, this becomes:\nformula_13\nwhere \"r\" = |r|. The direction is tangent to a circle perpendicular to the wire according to the right hand rule.225\nA slightly more general way of relating the current formula_14 to the B-field is through Amp\u00e8re's law:\nformula_15\nwhere the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and formula_16 is the current enclosed by that loop. Amp\u00e8re's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the B-field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.\nIn a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Amp\u00e8re's law is one of four Maxwell's equations that describe electricity and magnetism.\nForce on moving charges and current.\nForce on a charged particle.\nA charged particle moving in a B-field experiences a \"sideways\" force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the \"Lorentz force\", and is given by\nformula_17\nwhere F is the force, \"q\" is the electric charge of the particle, v is the instantaneous velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field (in teslas).\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary magnetic dipole, or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.\nForce on current-carrying wire.\nThe force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the \"Laplace force\".\nConsider a conductor of length \"\u2113\", cross section \"A\", and charge \"q\" due to electric current \"i\". If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude \"B\" that makes an angle \u03b8 with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge \"q\" is\nformula_18\nso, for \"N\" charges where\nformula_19\nthe force exerted on the conductor is\nformula_20\nwhere \"i\" = \"nqvA\".\nRelation between H and B.\nThe formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the spin of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The H-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of \"magnetization\" first.\nMagnetization.\nThe \"magnetization\" vector field M represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment m of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A\u22c5m2, the SI unit of magnetization M is ampere per meter, identical to that of the H-field.\nThe magnetization M field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)\nIn the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called \"bound current\". This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic B field due to the magnet. Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:\nformula_21\nwhere the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and \"I\"b is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.\nIn the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive \"magnetic pole strength\" (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\nformula_22\nwhere the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface \"S\" and \"q\"M is the \"magnetic charge\" (in units of magnetic flux) enclosed by \"S\". (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.\nH-field and magnetic materials.\nIn SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by\nformula_23\nIn terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is\nformula_24\nwhere If represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of H does not depend at all on the bound currents.\nFor the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition\nformula_25\nwhere Kf is the surface free current density and the unit normal formula_26 points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.\nSimilarly, a surface integral of H over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the \"magnetic charges\" within that closed surface:\nformula_27\nwhich does not depend on the free currents.\nThe H-field, therefore, can be separated into two independent parts:\nformula_28\nwhere H0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and Hd is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents.\nThe magnetic H-field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of \"magnetic charges\". The H field lines loop only around \"free current\" and, unlike the magnetic B field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.\nMagnetism.\nMost materials respond to an applied B-field by producing their own magnetization M and therefore their own B-fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term \"magnetism\" describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:\nIn the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization M is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:\nformula_29\nwhere \"\u03bc\" is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that H may not point in the same direction as B. These relations between B and H are examples of constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex B-to-H relation; see magnetic hysteresis.\nStored energy.\nEnergy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.\nFor linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that B = \"\u03bc\"H where \"\u03bc\" is frequency-independent), the energy density is:\nformula_30\nIf there are no magnetic materials around then \"\u03bc\" can be replaced by \"\u03bc\"0. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.\nIn general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume \"\u03b4W\" needed to cause a small change of magnetic field \"\u03b4\"B is:\nformula_31\nOnce the relationship between H and B is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.\nAppearance in Maxwell's equations.\nLike all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its \"sources\". (For B the \"sources\" are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up \"Maxwell's Equations\". Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism.\nThe first property is the divergence of a vector field A, \u2207 \u00b7 A, which represents how A \"flows\" outward from a given point. As discussed above, a B-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of B is zero. (Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields.) This property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles.\nThe second mathematical property is called the curl, such that \u2207 \u00d7 A represents how A curls or \"circulates\" around a given point. The result of the curl is called a \"circulation source\". The equations for the curl of B and of E are called the Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell equation and Faraday's law respectively.\nGauss' law for magnetism.\nOne important property of the B-field produced this way is that magnetic B-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, B is a solenoidal vector field); a field line may only extend to infinity, or wrap around to form a closed curve, or follow a never-ending (possibly chaotic) path. Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet B-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north. If a B-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point.\nMore formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the \"number\" of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to Gauss's law for magnetism:\nformula_32\nwhere the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface \"S\" (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since dA points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for B-field pointing out and negative for B-field pointing in.\nFaraday's Law.\nA changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an electric field (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as \"Faraday's law\" and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors. Mathematically, Faraday's law is:\nformula_33\nwhere formula_34 is the electromotive force (or \"EMF\", the voltage generated around a closed loop) and \u03a6 is the magnetic flux\u2014the product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area. (This definition of magnetic flux is why B is often referred to as \"magnetic flux density\".)210 The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that \"opposes\" the \"change\" in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as Lenz's law. This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions.\nformula_35\nAmp\u00e8re's Law and Maxwell's correction.\nSimilar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as \"Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law\" and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)\nThe full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.\nThe Maxwell term \"is\" critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnetic waves, such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.\nformula_36\nwhere J is the complete microscopic current density, and \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity.\nAs discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric E field and an applied magnetic B field by producing their own internal \"bound\" charge and current distributions that contribute to E and B but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, H and D fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the \"free current density\" Jf:\nformula_37\nThese equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the \"bound\" charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between B and H as well as that between E and D. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.\nFormulation in special relativity and quantum electrodynamics.\nRelativistic electrodynamics.\nAs different aspects of the same phenomenon.\nAccording to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.\nThe magnetic field existing as electric field in other frames can be shown by consistency of equations obtained from Lorentz transformation of four force from Coulomb's Law in particle's rest frame with Maxwell's laws considering definition of fields from Lorentz force and for non accelerating condition. The form of magnetic field hence obtained by Lorentz transformation of four-force from the form of Coulomb's law in source's initial frame is given by:\nformula_38\nwhere formula_39 is the charge of the point source, formula_40 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_41 is the position vector from the point source to the point in space, formula_42 is the velocity vector of the charged particle, formula_43 is the ratio of speed of the charged particle divided by the speed of light and formula_44 is the angle between formula_41 and formula_42. This form of magnetic field can be shown to satisfy Maxwell's laws within the constraint of particle being non accelerating. The above reduces to Biot-Savart law for non relativistic stream of current (formula_47).\nFormally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 tensor, called the \"electromagnetic tensor\". Changing reference frames \"mixes\" these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity \"mixes\" space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum, and energy into four-momentum. Similarly, the energy stored in a magnetic field is mixed with the energy stored in an electric field in the electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor.\nMagnetic vector potential.\nIn advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the \"magnetic vector potential\" A, and the electric scalar potential \"\u03c6\", are defined using gauge fixing such that:\nformula_48\nThe vector potential, \"A\" given by this form may be interpreted as a \"generalized potential momentum per unit charge\" just as \"\u03c6\" is interpreted as a \"generalized potential energy per unit charge\". There are multiple choices one can make for the potential fields that satisfy the above condition. However, the choice of potentials is represented by its respective gauge condition.\nMaxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials in Lorenz gauge can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity. In relativity, A together with \"\u03c6\" forms a four-potential regardless of the gauge condition, analogous to the four-momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler\u2014and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.\nPropagation of Electric and Magnetic fields.\nSpecial theory of relativity imposes the condition for events related by cause and effect to be time-like separated, that is that causal efficacy propagates no faster than light. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism are found to be in favor of this as electric and magnetic disturbances are found to travel at the speed of light in space. Electric and magnetic fields from classical electrodynamics obey the principle of locality in physics and are expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the cause of a measured field originated given that the influence of field travelled at speed of light. The retarded time for a point particle is given as solution of:\nformula_49\nwhere formula_50 is retarded time or the time at which the source's contribution of the field originated, formula_51 is the position vector of the particle as function of time, formula_52 is the point in space, formula_53 is the time at which fields are measured and formula_54 is the speed of light. The equation subtracts the time taken for light to travel from particle to the point in space from the time of measurement to find time of origin of the fields. The uniqueness of solution for formula_50 for given formula_56, formula_41 and formula_58 is valid for charged particles moving slower than speed of light.\nMagnetic field of arbitrary moving point charge.\nThe solution of maxwell's equations for electric and magnetic field of a point charge is expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the particle in the past causes the field at the point, given that the influence travels across space at the speed of light.\nAny arbitrary motion of point charge causes electric and magnetic fields found by solving maxwell's equations using green's function for retarded potentials and hence finding the fields to be as follows:\nformula_59\nformula_60\nalong the axis of the loop, where formula_14 is the uniform current flowing through the loop. \nalong the axis of the solenoid carrying current formula_14 with formula_64, uniform number of loops of currents per length of solenoid; and the direction of magnetic field as shown.\noutside the solenoid carrying current formula_14 with formula_64, uniform number of loops of currents per length of solenoid. \ninside the solenoid carrying current formula_14 with formula_64, uniform number of loops of currents per length of solenoid, with the direction of magnetic field as shown.\nalong the bulk of the circular toroid carrying uniform current formula_14 through formula_73 number of uniformly distributed poloidal loops, with the direction of magnetic field as indicated.\non the equatorial plane, where formula_75 is the magnetic dipole moment.\non the axial plane (given that formula_77), where formula_78 can also be negative to indicate position at the opposite direction on the axis, and formula_75 is the magnetic dipole moment.\nAdditional magnetic field values can be found through the magnetic field of a finite beam, for example, that the magnetic field of an arc of angle formula_44 and radius formula_81 at the center is formula_82, or that the magnetic field at the center of a N-sided regular polygon of side formula_83 is formula_84, both outside of the plane with proper directions as inferred by right hand thumb rule.\nHistory.\nEarly developments.\nWhile magnets and some properties of magnetism were known to ancient societies, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles. Noting the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points \"poles\" in analogy to Earth's poles. He also articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.\nAlmost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus' work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet. Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, \"De Magnete\", helped to establish magnetism as a science.\nMathematical development.\nIn 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an inverse square law56 Charles-Augustin de Coulomb experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that north and south poles cannot be separated.59 Building on this force between poles, Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson (1781\u20131840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.64 In this model, a magnetic H-field is produced by \"magnetic poles\" and magnetism is due to small pairs of north\u2013south magnetic poles.\nThree discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism. Hans Christian \u00d8rsted demonstrated that a current-carrying wire is surrounded by a circular magnetic field. Then Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re showed that parallel wires with currents attract one another if the currents are in the same direction and repel if they are in opposite directions.87 Finally, Jean-Baptiste Biot and F\u00e9lix Savart announced empirical results about the forces that a current-carrying long, straight wire exerted on a small magnet, determining the forces were inversely proportional to the perpendicular distance from the wire to the magnet.86 Laplace later deduced a law of force based on the differential action of a differential section of the wire, which became known as the Biot\u2013Savart law, as Laplace did not publish his findings.\nExtending these experiments, Amp\u00e8re published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets88 and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model. Further, Amp\u00e8re derived both Amp\u00e8re's force law describing the force between two currents and Amp\u00e8re's law, which, like the Biot\u2013Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp\u00e8re introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\nIn 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field, formulating what is now known as Faraday's law of induction. Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp\u00e8re's force law.222 In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.225\nIn 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted H and B. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp\u00e8re's model and induction.224 Further, he derived how H and B relate to each other and coined the term \"permeability\".245\nBetween 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published Maxwell's equations, which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled \" in 1861. These equations were valid but incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper \"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\" and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz published papers in 1887 and 1888 experimentally confirming this fact.\nModern developments.\nIn 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). Tesla received a patent for his electric motor in May 1888. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched rotating magnetic fields and subsequently published his research in a paper to the \"Royal Academy of Sciences\" in Turin, just two months before Tesla was awarded his patent, in March 1888.\nThe twentieth century showed that classical electrodynamics is already consistent with special relativity, and extended classical electrodynamics to work with quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. Finally, the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics, which first formalized the notion that electromagnetic field energy is quantized in the form of photons.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They quickly became known as \"Nansen passports\" for their promoter, the Norwegian statesman and polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen.\nHistory.\nThe end of World War I saw significant turmoil, leading to a refugee crisis. Numerous governments were toppled, and national borders were redrawn, often along generally ethnic lines. Civil war broke out in some countries. Many people left their homes because of war or persecution or fear thereof. The upheaval resulted in many people being without passports, or even nations to issue them, which prevented much international travel, often trapping refugees.\nThe precipitating event for the Nansen passport was the 1921 announcement by the new government of the Soviet Union revoking the citizenship of Russians living abroad, including some 800,000 refugees from the Russian Civil War. The first Nansen passports were issued following an international agreement reached at the Intergovernmental Conference on Identity Certificates for Russian Refugees, convened by Fridtjof Nansen in Geneva from July 3, 1922, to July 5, 1922, in his role as High Commissioner for Refugees for the League of Nations. By 1942, they were honoured by governments in 52 countries.\nIn 1924, the Nansen arrangement was broadened to also include Armenian, and in 1928 to Assyrian, Bulgarian, and Turkish refugees. Approximately 450,000 Nansen passports were provided to stateless people and refugees who needed travel documents, but could not obtain one from a national authority.\nFollowing Nansen's death in 1930, the passport was handled by the Nansen International Office for Refugees within the League of Nations. At that point the passport no longer included a reference to the 1922 conference, but were issued in the name of the League. The office was closed in 1938; passports were thereafter issued by a new agency, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees under the Protection of the League of Nations in London.\nLegacy.\nThe Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the 1938 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to establish the Nansen passports.\nWhile Nansen passports are no longer issued, existing national and supranational authorities, including the United Nations, issue travel documents for stateless people and refugees, including certificates of identity (or \"alien's passports\") and refugee travel documents.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
