These generated signals are used as a stimulus for electronic measurements, typically used in designing, testing, troubleshooting, and repairing electronic or electroacoustic devices, though it often has artistic uses as well. \nThere are many different types of signal generators with different purposes and applications and at varying levels of expense. These types include function generators, RF and microwave signal generators, pitch generators, arbitrary waveform generators, digital pattern generators, and frequency generators. In general, no device is suitable for all possible applications.\nA signal generator may be as simple as an oscillator with calibrated frequency and amplitude. More general-purpose signal generators allow control of all the characteristics of a signal. Modern general-purpose signal generators will have a microprocessor control and may also permit control from a personal computer. Signal generators may be free-standing self-contained instruments, or may be incorporated into more complex automatic test systems.\nHistory.\nIn June 1928, the General Radio 403 was the first commercial signal generator ever marketed. It supported a frequency range of 500\u00a0Hz to 1.5\u00a0MHz. Also, in April 1929, the first commercial frequency standard was marketed by General Radio with a frequency of 50\u00a0KHz.\nGeneral-purpose signal generators.\nFunction generator.\nA function generator is a device which produces simple repetitive waveforms. Such devices contain an electronic oscillator, a circuit that is capable of creating a repetitive waveform. (Modern devices may use digital signal processing to synthesize waveforms, followed by a digital-to-analog converter, or DAC, to produce an analog output.) The most common waveform is a sine wave, but sawtooth, step (pulse), square, and triangular waveform oscillators are commonly available as are arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs). If the oscillator operates above the human hearing range (&gt;20\u00a0kHz), the generator will often include some sort of modulation function such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) as well as a second oscillator that provides an audio frequency modulation waveform.\nArbitrary waveform generator.\nAn arbitrary waveform generator (AWG or ARB) is a sophisticated signal generator that generates arbitrary waveforms within published limits of frequency range, accuracy, and output level. Unlike a function generator that produces a small set of specific waveforms, an AWG allows the user to specify a source waveform in a variety of different ways. An AWG is generally more expensive than a function generator and often has less bandwidth. An AWG is used in higher-end design and test applications.\nRF and microwave signal generators.\nRF (radio frequency) and microwave signal generators are used for testing components, receivers and test systems in a wide variety of applications including cellular communications, WiFi, WiMAX, GPS, audio and video broadcasting, satellite communications, radar and electronic warfare. RF and microwave signal generators normally have similar features and capabilities, but are differentiated by frequency range. RF signal generators typically range from a few kHz to 6\u00a0GHz, while microwave signal generators cover a much wider frequency range, from less than 1\u00a0MHz to at least 20\u00a0GHz. Some models go as high as 70\u00a0GHz with a direct coaxial output, and up to hundreds of GHz when used with external waveguide multiplier modules. RF and microwave signal generators can be classified further as analog or vector signal generators.\nAnalog signal generators.\nAnalog signal generators based on a sine-wave oscillator were common before the inception of digital electronics, and are still used. There was a sharp distinction in purpose and design of radio-frequency and audio-frequency signal generators.\nRF signal generators produce continuous wave radio frequency signals of defined, adjustable, amplitude and frequency. Many models offer various types of analog modulation, either as standard equipment or as an optional capability to the base unit. This could include AM, FM, \u03a6M (phase modulation) and pulse modulation. A common feature is an attenuator to vary the signal\u2019s output power. Depending on the manufacturer and model, output powers can range from \u2212135 to +30\u00a0dBm. A wide range of output power is desirable, since different applications require different amounts of signal power. For example, if a signal has to travel through a very long cable out to an antenna, a high output signal may be needed to overcome the losses through the cable and still have sufficient power at the antenna. But when testing receiver sensitivity, a low signal level is required to see how the receiver behaves under low signal-to-noise conditions.\nRF signal generators are available as benchtop instruments, rackmount instruments, embeddable modules and in card-level formats. Mobile, field-testing and airborne applications benefit from lighter, battery-operated platforms. In automated and production testing, web-browser access, which allows multi-source control, and faster frequency switching speeds improve test times and throughput.\nRF signal generators are required for servicing and setting up radio receivers, and are used for professional RF applications.\nRF signal generators are characterized by their frequency bands, power capabilities (\u2212100 to +25\u00a0dBc), single side band phase noise at various carrier frequencies, spurs and harmonics, frequency and amplitude switching speeds and modulation capabilities.\nAudio-frequency signal generators generate signals in the audio-frequency range and above. An early example was the HP200A audio oscillator, the first product sold by the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1939. Applications include checking frequency response of audio equipment, and many uses in the electronic laboratory.\nEquipment distortion can be measured using a very-low-distortion audio generator as the signal source, with appropriate equipment to measure output distortion harmonic-by-harmonic with a wave analyser, or simply total harmonic distortion. A distortion of 0.0001% can be achieved by an audio signal generator with a relatively simple circuit.\nVector signal generator.\nWith the advent of digital communications systems, it is no longer possible to adequately test these systems with traditional analog signal generators. This has led to the development of the vector signal generator, which is also known as a digital signal generator. These signal generators are capable of generating digitally-modulated radio signals that may use any of a large number of digital modulation formats such as QAM, QPSK, FSK, BPSK, and OFDM. In addition, since modern commercial digital communication systems are almost all based on well-defined industry standards, many vector signal generators can generate signals based on these standards. Examples include GSM, W-CDMA (UMTS), CDMA2000, LTE, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16). In contrast, military communication systems such as JTRS, which place a great deal of importance on robustness and information security, typically use very proprietary methods. To test these types of communication systems, users will often create their own custom waveforms and download them into the vector signal generator to create the desired test signal.\nDigital pattern generator.\nA logic signal generator or data pattern generator or digital pattern generator produces logic signals\u2014that is, logical 1s and 0s in the form of conventional voltage levels. The usual voltage standards are LVTTL and LVCMOS.\nIt is different from a \"pulse/pattern generator\", which refers to signal generators able to generate logic pulses with different analog characteristics (such as pulse rise/fall time, high level length, ...).\nA digital pattern generator is used as stimulus source for digital integrated circuits and embedded systems - for functional validation and testing.\nSpecial purpose signal generators.\nIn addition to the above general-purpose devices, there are several classes of signal generators designed for specific applications.\nPitch generators and audio generators.\nA pitch generator is a type of signal generator optimized for use in audio and acoustics applications. Pitch generators typically include sine waves over the human hearing range (20 Hz to 20\u00a0kHz). Sophisticated pitch generators will also include sweep generators (a function which varies the output frequency over a range, in order to make frequency-domain measurements), multipitch generators (which output several pitches simultaneously, and are used to check for intermodulation distortion and other non-linear effects), and tone bursts (used to measure response to transients). Pitch generators are typically used in conjunction with sound level meters, when measuring the acoustics of a room or a sound reproduction system, and/or with oscilloscopes or specialized audio analyzers.\nMany pitch generators operate in the digital domain, producing output in various digital audio formats such as AES3, or SPDIF. Such generators may include special signals to stimulate various digital effects and problems, such as clipping, jitter, bit errors; they also often provide ways to manipulate the metadata associated with digital audio formats.\nThe term synthesizer is used for a device that generates audio signals for music, or that uses slightly more intricate methods.\nComputer programs.\nComputer programs can be used to generate arbitrary waveforms on a general-purpose computer and output the waveform via an output interface. Such programs may be provided commercially or be freeware. Simple systems use a standard computer sound card as output device, limiting the accuracy of the output waveform and limiting frequency to lie within the audio-frequency band.\nVideo signal generator.\nA video signal generator is a device which outputs predetermined video and/or television waveforms, and other signals used to stimulate faults in, or aid in parametric measurements of, television and video systems. There are several different types of video signal generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain synchronization signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and vertical sync pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of \"composite\" video signals (such as NTSC and PAL) will also include a colorburst signal as part of the output. Video signal generators are available for a wide variety of applications and for a wide variety of digital formats; many of these also include audio generation capability (as the audio track is an important part of any video or television program or motion picture)."}

It can be described as the symmetry group of a non-square rectangle (with the three non-identity elements being horizontal reflection, vertical reflection and 180-degree rotation), as the group of bitwise exclusive-or operations on two-bit binary values, or more abstractly as formula_1, the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2 by the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups. It was named Vierergruppe (, meaning four-group) by Felix Klein in 1884. It is also called the Klein group, and is often symbolized by the letter formula_2 or as formula_3.\nThe Klein four-group, with four elements, is the smallest group that is not cyclic. Up to isomorphism, there is only one other group of order four: the cyclic group of order 4. Both groups are abelian.\nPresentations.\nThe Klein group's Cayley table is given by:\nThe Klein four-group is also defined by the group presentation\n formula_4\nAll non-identity elements of the Klein group have order 2, so any two non-identity elements can serve as generators in the above presentation. The Klein four-group is the smallest non-cyclic group. It is, however, an abelian group, and isomorphic to the dihedral group of order (cardinality) 4, symbolized formula_5 (or formula_6, using the geometric convention); other than the group of order 2, it is the only dihedral group that is abelian.\nThe Klein four-group is also isomorphic to the direct sum formula_7, so that it can be represented as the pairs {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} under component-wise addition modulo 2 (or equivalently the bit strings {00, 01, 10, 11}under bitwise XOR), with (0,0) being the group's identity element. The Klein four-group is thus an example of an elementary abelian 2-group, which is also called a Boolean group. The Klein four-group is thus also the group generated by the symmetric difference as the binary operation on the subsets of a powerset of a set with two elements\u2014that is, over a field of sets with four elements, such as formula_8; the empty set is the group's identity element in this case.\nAnother numerical construction of the Klein four-group is the set {1, 3, 5, 7}, with the operation being multiplication modulo 8. Here \"a\" is 3, \"b\" is 5, and \"c\" = \"ab\" is 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 \u2261 7 (mod 8).\nThe Klein four-group also has a representation as 2 \u00d7 2 real matrices with the operation being matrix multiplication:\n formula_9\n formula_10\nOn a Rubik's Cube, the \"4 dots\" pattern can be made in three ways (for example, M2 U2 M2 U2 F2 M2 F2), depending on the pair of faces that are left blank; these three positions together with the solved position form an example of the Klein group, with the solved position serving as the identity.\nGeometry.\nIn two dimensions, the Klein four-group is the symmetry group of a rhombus and of rectangles that are not squares, the four elements being the identity, the vertical reflection, the horizontal reflection, and a 180\u00b0 rotation.\nIn three dimensions, there are three different symmetry groups that are algebraically the Klein four-group:\nPermutation representation.\nThe three elements of order two in the Klein four-group are interchangeable: the automorphism group of \"V\" is thus the group of permutations of these three elements, that is, the symmetric group formula_14.\nThe Klein four-group's permutations of its own elements can be thought of abstractly as its permutation representation on four points:\nformula_15{(), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3)}\nIn this representation, formula_2 is a normal subgroup of the alternating group formula_17 (and also the symmetric group formula_18) on four letters. It is also a transitive subgroup of formula_18that appears as a Galois group. In fact, it is the kernel of a surjective group homomorphism from formula_18 to formula_14.\nOther representations within \"S\"4 are:\n {(), (1,2), (3,4), (1,2)(3,4)}\n {(), (1,3), (2,4), (1,3)(2,4)}\n {(), (1,4), (2,3), (1,4)(2,3)}\nThey are not normal subgroups of \"S\"4.\nAlgebra.\nAccording to Galois theory, the existence of the Klein four-group (and in particular, the permutation representation of it) explains the existence of the formula for calculating the roots of quartic equations in terms of radicals, as established by Lodovico Ferrari: the map formula_22 corresponds to the resolvent cubic, in terms of Lagrange resolvents.\nIn the construction of finite rings, eight of the eleven rings with four elements have the Klein four-group as their additive substructure.\nIf formula_23 denotes the multiplicative group of non-zero reals and formula_24 the multiplicative group of positive reals, then formula_25 is the group of units of the ring formula_26, and formula_27 is a subgroup of formula_25 (in fact it is the component of the identity of formula_25). The quotient group formula_30 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. In a similar fashion, the group of units of the split-complex number ring, when divided by its identity component, also results in the Klein four-group.\nGraph theory.\nAmong the simple connected graphs, the simplest (in the sense of having the fewest entities) that admits the Klein four-group as its automorphism group is the diamond graph shown below. It is also the automorphism group of some other graphs that are simpler in the sense of having fewer entities. These include the graph with four vertices and one edge, which remains simple but loses connectivity, and the graph with two vertices connected to each other by two edges, which remains connected but loses simplicity.\nMusic.\nIn music composition, the four-group is the basic group of permutations in the twelve-tone technique. In that instance, the Cayley table is written\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "41930", "revid": "51001534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41930", "title": "Dividend", "text": "Payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits\nA dividend is the distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a portion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings). The current year's profit as well as the retained earnings of previous years are available for distribution; a corporation is usually prohibited from paying a dividend out of its capital. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually by bank transfer) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or by share repurchase. In some cases, the distribution may be of assets.\nThe dividend received by a shareholder is treated as the income of the shareholder and may be subject to income tax (see dividend tax). The tax treatment of this income varies considerably between jurisdictions. The corporation does not receive a tax deduction for the dividends it pays.\nA dividend is allocated as a fixed amount per share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. Dividends can provide at least temporarily stable income and raise morale among shareholders, but are not guaranteed to continue. For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet \u2013 the same as its issued share capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may cancel a scheduled dividend, or declare an unscheduled dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the regular dividends. More usually, a special dividend is paid at the same time as the regular dividend, but for a one-off higher amount. Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.\nThe usually fixed payments to holders of preference shares (or preferred stock in American English) are classed as dividends. The word \"dividend\" comes from the Latin word (\"thing to be divided\").\nHistory.\nThe Dutch East India Company (VOC) was the first recorded (public) company to pay regular dividends. The VOC paid annual dividends worth around 18 percent of the value of its shares for almost 200 years of its existence (1602\u20131800).\nIn common law jurisdictions, courts have typically refused to intervene in companies' dividend policies, giving directors wide discretion as to the declaration or payment of dividends. The principle of non-interference was established in the Canadian case of \"Burland v Earle\" (1902), the British case of \"Bond v Barrow Haematite Steel Co\" (1902), and the Australian case of \"Miles v Sydney Meat-Preserving Co Ltd\" (1912). However in \"Sumiseki Materials Co Ltd v Wambo Coal Pty Ltd\" (2013) the Supreme Court of New South Wales broke with this precedent and recognised the shareholder's contractual right to a dividend.\nForms of payment.\nCash dividends are the most common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income of the shareholder, usually treated as earned in the year they are paid (and not necessarily in the year a dividend was declared). For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50. Dividends paid are not classified as an expense, but rather a deduction of retained earnings. Dividends paid do not appear on an income statement, but do appear on the balance sheet.\nDifferent classes of stocks have different priorities when it comes to dividend payments. Preferred stocks have priority claims on a company's income. A company must pay dividends on its preferred shares before distributing income to common share shareholders.\nStock or scrip dividends are those paid out in the form of additional shares of the issuing corporation, or another corporation (such as its subsidiary corporation). They are usually issued in proportion to shares owned (for example, for every 100 shares of stock owned, a 5% stock dividend will yield 5 extra shares).\nNothing tangible will be gained if the stock is split because the total number of shares increases, lowering the price of each share, without changing the total value of the shares held. (See also Stock dilution.)\nStock dividend distributions do not affect the market capitalization of a company. Stock dividends are not includable in the gross income of the shareholder for US income tax purposes. Because the shares are issued for proceeds equal to the pre-existing market price of the shares, there is no negative dilution in the amount recoverable.\nProperty dividends or dividends \"in specie\" (Latin for \"in kind\") are those paid out in the form of assets from the issuing corporation or another corporation, such as a subsidiary corporation. They are relatively rare and most frequently are securities of other companies owned by the issuer, however, they can take other forms, such as products and services.\nInterim dividends are dividend payments made before a company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) and final financial statements. This declared dividend usually accompanies the company's interim financial statements.\nOther dividends can be used in structured finance. Financial assets with known market value can be distributed as dividends; warrants are sometimes distributed in this way. For large companies with subsidiaries, dividends can take the form of shares in a subsidiary company. A common technique for \"spinning off\" a company from its parent is to distribute shares in the new company to the old company's shareholders. The new shares can then be traded independently.\nPayout ratio.\nA dividend payout ratio characterizes how much of a company's earnings (or its cash flow) is paid out in the form of dividends.\nMost often, the payout ratio is calculated based on dividends per share and earnings per share:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Payout ratio = \u00d7 100\nA payout ratio greater than 100% means the company paid out more in dividends for the year than it earned.\nSince earnings are an accountancy measure, they do not necessarily closely correspond to the actual cash flow of the company. Hence another way to determine the safety of a dividend is to replace earnings in the payout ratio by free cash flow. Free cash flow is the business's operating cash flow minus its capital expenditures: this is a measure of how much incoming cash is \"free\" to pay out to stockholders and/or to grow the business.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Free cash flow payout ratio = \u00d7 100\nA free cash flow payout ratio greater than 100% means the company paid out more cash in dividends for the year than the \"free\" cash it took in.\nDividend dates.\nA dividend that is declared must be approved by a company's board of directors before it is paid. For public companies in the US, four dates are relevant regarding dividends: The position in the UK is very similar, except that the expression \"in-dividend date\" is not used.\nDeclaration date \u2013 the day the board of directors announces its intention to pay a dividend. On that day, a liability is created and the company records that liability on its books; it now owes the money to the shareholders.\nIn-dividend date \u2013 the last day, which is one trading day before the \"ex-dividend date\", where shares are said to be \"cum dividend\" ('with [including] dividend'). That is, existing shareholders and anyone who buys the shares on this day will receive the dividend, and any shareholders who have sold the shares lose their right to the dividend. After this date the shares becomes \"ex dividend\".\nEx-dividend date \u2013 the day on which shares bought and sold no longer come attached with the right to be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States and many European countries, it is typically one trading day before the \"record date\". This is an important date for any company that has many shareholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing shareholders will receive the dividend even if they sell the shares on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the shares will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a share's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend being paid, which reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the payment of the dividend.\nBook closure date \u2013 when a company announces a dividend, it will also announce the date on which the company will temporarily close its books for share transfers, which is also usually the record date.\nRecord date \u2013 shareholders registered in the company's record as of the record date will be paid the dividend, while shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the ex-dividend date.\nPayment date \u2013 the day on which dividend cheques will actually be mailed to shareholders or the dividend amount credited to their bank account.\nDividend frequency.\nThe dividend frequency is the number of dividend payments within a single business year. The most usual dividend frequencies are yearly, semi-annually, quarterly and monthly. Some common dividend frequencies are quarterly in the US, semi-annually in Japan, the UK and Australia and annually in Germany.\nDividend reinvestment.\nSome companies have dividend reinvestment plans, or DRIPs. DRIPs allow shareholders to use dividends to systematically buy small amounts of stock, usually with no commission and sometimes at a slight discount. In some cases, the shareholder might not need to pay taxes on these re-invested dividends, but in most cases they do. Utilizing a DRIP is a powerful investment tool because it takes advantage of both dollar cost averaging and compounding. Dollar cost averaging is the principle of investing a set amount of capital at recurring intervals. In this case, if the dividend is paid quarterly, then every quarter you are investing a set amount (the number of shares you own multiplied by the dividend per share). By doing this, you buy more shares when the price is low and fewer when the price is high. Additionally, the fractional shares that are purchased then begin paying dividends, compounding your investment and increasing the number of shares and total dividend earned each time a dividend distribution is made.\nLaw and government policy on dividends.\nGovernments may adopt policies on dividend distribution for the protection of shareholders and the preservation of company viability, as well as treating dividends as a potential source of revenue.\nMost countries impose a corporate tax on the profits made by a company. Many jurisdictions also impose a tax on dividends paid by a company to its shareholders (stockholders), but the tax treatment of a dividend income varies considerably between jurisdictions. The primary tax liability is that of the shareholder, although a tax obligation may also be imposed on the corporation in the form of a withholding tax. In some cases, the withholding tax may be the extent of the tax liability in relation to the dividend. A dividend tax is in addition to any tax imposed directly on the corporation on its profits.\nA dividend paid by a company is not an expense of the company.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nAustralia and New Zealand have a dividend imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax paid by the company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 \u2212 company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders who are able to use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.\nIndia.\nIn India, a company declaring or distributing dividends is required to pay a corporate dividend tax in addition to the tax levied on their income. The dividend received by the shareholders is then exempt in their hands. Dividend-paying firms in India fell from 24 percent in 2001 to almost 19 percent in 2009 before rising to 19 percent in 2010. However, dividend income over and above \u20b9 attracts 10 percent dividend tax in the hands of the shareholder starting from April 2016. Since the Budget 2020\u20132021, DDT has been abolished. Now, the Indian government taxes dividend income in the hands of the investor according to income tax slab rates.\nUnited States and Canada.\nThe United States and Canada impose a lower tax rate on dividend income than ordinary income, on the assertion that company profits have already been taxed as corporate tax. In the United States, shareholders of corporations face double taxation \u2013 taxes on both corporate profits and taxes on distribution of dividends.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe rules in Part 23 of the Companies Act 2006 (sections 829\u2013853) govern the payment of dividends to shareholders. The Act refers in this section to \"distribution\", covering any kind of distribution of a company's assets to its members (with some exceptions), \"whether in cash or otherwise\". A company is only able to make a distribution out of its accumulated, realised profits, \"so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulated, realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duly made\".\nThe United Kingdom government announced in 2018 that it was considering a review of the existing rules on dividend distribution following a consultation exercise on insolvency and corporate governance. The aim was to address concerns which had emerged where companies in financial distress were still able to distribute \"significant dividends\" to their shareholders. A requirement has been proposed under which the largest companies would be required to publish a distribution policy statement covering dividend distribution.\nThe law in England and Wales regarding dividend payment was clarified in 2018 by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in the case of \"Global Corporate Ltd v Hale\" [2018] EWCA Civ 2618. Certain payments made to a director/shareholder had been treated by the High Court as \"quantum meruit\" payments to Hale in his capacity as a company director but the Appeal Court reversed this judgment and treated the payments as dividends. At the time of payment they had been treated as \"dividends\" payable from an anticipated profit. The company subsequently went into liquidation; an attempt to recharacterise the payments as payments for services rendered was held to be unlawful.\nEffect on stock price.\nAfter a stock goes ex-dividend (when a dividend has just been paid, so there is no anticipation of another imminent dividend payment), the stock price should drop.\nTo calculate the amount of the drop, the traditional method is to view the financial effects of the dividend from the perspective of the company. Since the company has paid \u00a3\"x\" in dividends per share out of its cash account on the left hand side of the balance sheet, the equity account on the right side should decrease an equivalent amount. This means that a \u00a3\"x\" dividend should result in a \u00a3\"x\" drop in the share price.\nA more accurate method of calculating the fall in price is to look at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a shareholder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains \"T\"cg is 35%, and the tax on dividends \"T\"d is 15%, then a \u00a31 dividend is equivalent to \u00a30.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a, the after-tax capital loss value should equal \u00a30.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be = = = \u00a31.31. In this case, a dividend of \u00a31 has led to a larger drop in the share price of \u00a31.31, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate. However in many countries the stock market is dominated by institutions which pay no additional tax on dividends received (as opposed to tax on overall profits). If that is the case, then the share price should fall by the full amount of the dividend.\nAlthough theoretically the stock exchange decreases the price of the stock by the dividend to remove volatility, in fact the market has no control over the stock price on open on the ex-dividend date, and so it may often open higher than before.\nFinally, security analysis that does not take dividends into account may mute the decline in share price, for example in the case of a price\u2013earnings ratio target that does not back out cash; or amplify the decline when comparing different periods.\nThe effect of a dividend payment on share price is an important reason why it can sometimes be desirable to exercise an American option early.\nCriticism and analysis.\nSome believe company profits are best re-invested in the company with actions such as research and development, capital investment or expansion. Proponents of this view (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of good ideas for the future of the company. A counter-argument to this position came from Peter Lynch of Fidelity investments, who declared: \"One strong argument in favor of companies that pay dividends is that companies that don\u2019t pay dividends have a sorry history of blowing the money on a string of stupid diworseifications\", using his self-created term for diversification that results in worse effects, not better. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote in \"Securities Analysis\" (1934): \"The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends to its owners. A successful company is one that can pay dividends regularly and presumably increase the rate as time goes on.\"\nOther studies indicate that dividend-paying stocks tend to offer superior long-term performance relative to the overall market at least in developed economies, relative to a stock index such as the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average or relative to stocks that do not pay dividends. Several explanations have been proposed for this outperformance, such as dividends being associated with value stocks which are themselves associated with long-term outperformance; being more durable in crashes or bear markets; being associated with profitable companies exhibiting high levels of free cashflow; and being associated with mature, unfashionable companies that are overlooked by many investors and thus an effective contrarian strategy. Asset managers at Tweedy, Browne and Capital Group have suggested dividends are an effective measure of a given company's overall financial status.\nShareholders in companies that pay little or no cash dividends can potentially reap the benefit of the company's profits when they sell their shareholding, or when a company is wound down and all assets liquidated and distributed amongst shareholders. However, data from professor Jeremy Siegel found stocks that do not pay dividends tend to have worse long-term performance, as a group, than the general stock market, and also perform worse than dividend-paying stocks.\nTax implications.\nTaxation of dividends is often used as justification for retaining earnings, or for performing a stock buyback, in which the company buys back stock, thereby increasing the value of the stock left outstanding.\nWhen dividends are paid, individual shareholders in many countries suffer from double taxation of those dividends:\nIn many countries, the tax rate on dividend income is lower than for other forms of income to compensate for tax paid at the corporate level.\nA capital gain should not be confused with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.\nCertain types of specialized investment companies (such as a REIT in the U.S.) allow the shareholder to partially or fully avoid double taxation of dividends.\nOther corporate entities.\nCooperatives.\nCooperative businesses may retain their earnings, or distribute part or all of them as dividends to their members. They distribute their dividends in proportion to their members' activity, instead of the value of members' shareholding. Therefore, co-op dividends are often treated as pre-tax expenses. In other words, local tax or accounting rules may treat a dividend as a form of customer rebate or a staff bonus to be deducted from turnover before profit (tax profit or operating profit) is calculated.\nConsumers' cooperatives allocate dividends according to their members' trade with the co-op. For example, a credit union will pay a dividend to represent interest on a saver's deposit. A retail co-op store chain may return a percentage of a member's purchases from the co-op, in the form of cash, store credit, or equity. This type of dividend is sometimes known as a patronage dividend or patronage refund, or informally \"divi\" or \"divvy\".\nProducer cooperatives, such as worker cooperatives, allocate dividends according to their members' contribution, such as the hours they worked or their salary.\nTrusts.\nIn real estate investment trusts and royalty trusts, the distributions paid often will be consistently greater than the company earnings. This can be sustainable because the accounting earnings do not recognize any increasing value of real estate holdings and resource reserves. If there is no economic increase in the value of the company's assets then the excess distribution (or dividend) will be a return of capital and the book value of the company will have shrunk by an equal amount. This may result in capital gains which may be taxed differently from dividends representing distribution of earnings.\nThe distribution of profits by other forms of mutual organization also varies from that of joint-stock companies, though may not take the form of a dividend.\nIn the case of mutual insurance, for example, in the United States, a distribution of profits to holders of participating life policies is called a \"dividend\".\nThese profits are generated by the investment returns of the insurer's general account, in which premiums are invested and from which claims are paid. The participating dividend may be used to decrease premiums, or to increase the cash value of the policy.\nSome life policies pay nonparticipating dividends.\nAs a contrasting example, in the United Kingdom, the surrender value of a with-profits policy is increased by a \"bonus\", which also serves the purpose of distributing profits.\nLife insurance dividends and bonuses, while typical of mutual insurance, are also paid by some joint stock insurers.\nInsurance dividend payments are not restricted to life policies. For example, general insurer State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company can distribute dividends to its vehicle insurance policyholders.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.\nThe field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms \"bias\" and \"variability\" instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.\nA measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.\nA measurement system is considered \"valid\" if it is both \"accurate\" and \"precise\". Related terms include \"bias\" (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and \"error\" (random variability).\nThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurements\u2014that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.\nIn addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.\nIn numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.\nIn military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (\"justesse de tir\"), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;ISO definition (ISO 5725).\nA shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM), items 2.13 and 2.14.\nAccording to ISO 5725-1, the general term \"accuracy\" is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same measurand, it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case trueness is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value, that is the systematic error, and precision is the closeness of agreement among a set of results, that is the random error.\nISO 5725-1 and VIM also avoid the use of the term \"bias\", previously specified in BS 5497-1, because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering, as in medicine and law.\nQuantification and applications.\nIn industrial instrumentation, accuracy is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.\nIdeally a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value. The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard. Such standards are defined in the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from French: \"Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s\") and maintained by national standards organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.\nThis also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged. In that case, the term standard error is properly applied: the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged. Further, the central limit theorem shows that the probability distribution of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements.\nWith regard to accuracy we can distinguish:\nA common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and/or precision implicitly by means of significant figures. Where not explicitly stated, the margin of error is understood to be one-half the value of the last significant place. For instance, a recording of 843.6\u00a0m, or 843.0\u00a0m, or 800.0\u00a0m would imply a margin of 0.05\u00a0m (the last significant place is the tenths place), while a recording of 843\u00a0m would imply a margin of error of 0.5\u00a0m (the last significant digits are the units).\nA reading of 8,000\u00a0m, with trailing zeros and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeros may or may not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50\u00a0m) while 8.000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m indicates that all three zeros are significant, giving a margin of 0.5\u00a0m. Similarly, one can use a multiple of the basic measurement unit: 8.0\u00a0km is equivalent to 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0m. It indicates a margin of 0.05\u00a0km (50\u00a0m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it. For example, a source reporting a number like 153,753 with precision +/- 5,000 looks like it has precision +/- 0.5. Under the convention it would have been rounded to 150,000.\nAlternatively, in a scientific context, if it is desired to indicate the margin of error with more precision, one can use a notation such as 7.54398(23) \u00d7 10\u221210 m, meaning a range of between 7.54375 and 7.54421 \u00d7 10\u221210 m.\nPrecision includes:\nIn engineering, precision is often taken as three times Standard Deviation of measurements taken, representing the range that 99.73% of measurements can occur within. For example, an ergonomist measuring the human body can be confident that 99.73% of their extracted measurements fall within \u00b1 0.7\u00a0cm - if using the GRYPHON processing system - or \u00b1 13\u00a0cm - if using unprocessed data.\nIn classification.\nIn binary classification.\n\"Accuracy\" is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. That is, the accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. As such, it compares estimates of pre- and post-test probability. To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the \"Rand accuracy\" or \"Rand index\". It is a parameter of the test.\nThe formula for quantifying binary accuracy is:\nformula_1\nwhere TP = True positive; FP = False positive; TN = True negative; FN = False negative\nIn this context, the concepts of trueness and precision as defined by ISO 5725-1 are not applicable. One reason is that there is not a single \u201ctrue value\u201d of a quantity, but rather two possible true values for every case, while accuracy is an average across all cases and therefore takes into account both values. However, the term \"precision\" is used in this context to mean a different metric originating from the field of information retrieval (see ).\nIn multiclass classification.\nWhen computing accuracy in multiclass classification, accuracy is simply the fraction of correct classifications:\nformula_2\nThis is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if a classifier makes ten predictions and nine of them are correct, the accuracy is 90%.\nAccuracy is sometimes also viewed as a \"micro metric\", to underline that it tends to be greatly affected by the particular class prevalence in a dataset and the classifier's biases.\nFurthermore, it is also called top-1 accuracy to distinguish it from top-5 accuracy, common in convolutional neural network evaluation. To evaluate top-5 accuracy, the classifier must provide relative likelihoods for each class. When these are sorted, a classification is considered correct if the correct classification falls anywhere within the top 5 predictions made by the network. Top-5 accuracy was popularized by the ImageNet challenge. It is usually higher than top-1 accuracy, as any correct predictions in the 2nd through 5th positions will not improve the top-1 score, but do improve the top-5 score.\nIn psychometrics and psychophysics.\nIn psychometrics and psychophysics, the term \"accuracy\" is interchangeably used with validity and \"constant error\". \"Precision\" is a synonym for reliability and \"variable error\". The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior. Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques, classically through an internal consistency test like Cronbach's alpha to ensure sets of related questions have related responses, and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population.\nIn logic simulation.\nIn logic simulation, a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a logic simulation model to a transistor circuit simulation model. This is a comparison of differences in precision, not accuracy. Precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality.\nIn information systems.\nInformation retrieval systems, such as databases and web search engines, are evaluated by many different metrics, some of which are derived from the confusion matrix, which divides results into true positives (documents correctly retrieved), true negatives (documents correctly not retrieved), false positives (documents incorrectly retrieved), and false negatives (documents incorrectly not retrieved). Commonly used metrics include the notions of precision and recall. In this context, precision is defined as the fraction of documents correctly retrieved compared to the documents retrieved (true positives divided by true positives plus false positives), using a set of ground truth relevant results selected by humans. Recall is defined as the fraction of documents correctly retrieved compared to the relevant documents (true positives divided by true positives plus false negatives). Less commonly, the metric of accuracy is used, is defined as the fraction of documents correctly classified compared to the documents (true positives plus true negatives divided by true positives plus true negatives plus false positives plus false negatives).\nNone of these metrics take into account the ranking of results. Ranking is very important for web search engines because readers seldom go past the first page of results, and there are too many documents on the web to manually classify all of them as to whether they should be included or excluded from a given search. Adding a cutoff at a particular number of results takes ranking into account to some degree. The measure precision at k, for example, is a measure of precision looking only at the top ten (k=10) search results. More sophisticated metrics, such as discounted cumulative gain, take into account each individual ranking, and are more commonly used where this is important.\nIn cognitive systems.\nIn cognitive systems, accuracy and precision is used to characterize and measure results of a cognitive process performed by biological or artificial entities where a cognitive process is a transformation of data, information, knowledge, or wisdom to a higher-valued form. (DIKW Pyramid) Sometimes, a cognitive process produces exactly the intended or desired output but sometimes produces output far from the intended or desired. Furthermore, repetitions of a cognitive process do not always produce the same output. \"Cognitive accuracy\" (CA) is the propensity of a cognitive process to produce the intended or desired output. \"Cognitive precision\" (CP) is the propensity of a cognitive process to produce the same output. To measure augmented cognition in human/cog ensembles, where one or more humans work collaboratively with one or more cognitive systems (cogs), increases in cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision assist in measuring the degree of cognitive augmentation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is officially named Oldenburg (Oldb) (\"Oldenburg in Oldenburg\") to distinguish from Oldenburg in Holstein.\nDuring the French annexation (1811\u20131813) in the wake of the Napoleonic war against Britain, it was also known as \"Le Vieux-Bourg\" in French. The city is at the rivers Hunte and Haaren, in the northwestern region between the cities of Bremen in the east and Groningen (Netherlands) in the west. According to Germany's 2022 census, the city's population is 176.068 in 2024. Oldenburg is part of the Northwest Metropolitan Region, which is home to approximately 2.8 million people.\nThe city is the place of origin of the House of Oldenburg. Before the end of the German Empire (1918), it was the administrative centre and residence of the monarchs of Oldenburg.\nHistory.\nArchaeological finds point to a settlement dating back to the 8th century. The first documentary evidence, in 1108, referenced \"Aldenburg\" in connection with Elimar I (also known as Egilmar I) who is now commonly seen as the first count of Oldenburg. The town gained importance due to its location at a ford of the navigable Hunte river. Oldenburg became the capital of the County of Oldenburg (later a Duchy (1774\u20131810), Grand Duchy (1815\u20131918), and Free State (1918\u20131946)), a small state in the shadow of the much more powerful Hanseatic city of Bremen.\nIn the 17th century Oldenburg was a wealthy town in a time of war and turmoil and its population and power grew considerably. In 1667, the town was struck by a disastrous plague epidemic and, shortly after, a fire destroyed Oldenburg. The Danish kings, who were also counts of Oldenburg at the time, had little interest in the condition of the town and it lost most of its former importance. In 1773, Danish rule ended. Only then were the destroyed buildings in the city rebuilt in a neoclassicist style. (German-speakers usually call the \"neoclassicist style\" of that period ', while ' specifically refers to the classicist style of the early 20th century.)\nAfter the German government announced the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II (9 November 1918) following the exhaustion and defeat of the German Empire in World War I, monarchic rule ended in Oldenburg as well with the abdication of Grand Duke Frederick Augustus II of Oldenburg \"()\" on 11 November 1918. The Grand Duchy now became the Free State of Oldenburg \"()\", with the city remaining the capital.\nIn the 1928 city elections, the Nazi Party received 9.8% of the vote, enough for a seat on the Oldenburg city council. In the September 1930 Oldenburg state elections, the Nazi Party's share of the vote rose to 27.3%, and on May 29, 1932, the Nazi Party received 48.4% in the state election, enough to put the Nazi party in charge of forming a state government and, significantly, making Oldenburg the first state in the country to put the Nazis in power based on electoral turnout. By that autumn, a campaign of Aryanization began, forcing the sale of formerly Jewish-owned properties at steep discounts.\nIn 1945, after World War II, the State of Oldenburg became part of the British zone of occupation. The British military government of the Oldenburg region resided in the city. Several displaced-persons camps were set up in the city that had suffered only 1.4% destruction during the bombing campaigns of World War II. About 42,000 refugees migrated into Oldenburg, which raised the number of residents to over 100,000. In 1946 the Free State of Oldenburg was dissolved and the area became the 'Administrative District' of Oldenburg \"()\" within the newly formed federal German state of Lower Saxony \"()\". The city was now capital of the district. In 1978 the district was dissolved and succeeded by the newly formed Weser-Ems administrative region \"()\", again with the city as administrative capital. The state of Lower Saxony dissolved all of the by the end of 2004 in the course of administrative reforms.\nCity government.\nLocal elections take place every five years. The city council \"(Stadtrat)\" has 50 seats. The lord mayor \"(Oberb\u00fcrgermeister)\" is elected directly by the citizens.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nTransport.\nThe city centre of Oldenburg is surrounded by a ring of freeways (autobahns) consisting of A 28, A 29 and A 293. Because of this, Oldenburg is connected to the nationwide network of federal autobahns, as well as to the international E-road network (German: \"Europastra\u00dfen\").\nOldenburg Central Station, \"Oldenburg (Oldb) Hauptbahnhof\", is at the intersection of the railway lines Norddeich Mole\u2014Leer\u2014Oldenburg\u2014Bremen and Wilhelmshaven\u2014Oldenburg\u2014Osnabr\u00fcck, with Intercity services to Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden and InterCityExpress services to Frankfurt and Munich.\nOldenburg is only about half an hour drive from Bremen Airport (about 50\u00a0km | 31 miles). Other international airports nearby are Hamburg Airport (160\u00a0km | 100 miles) and Hannover-Langenhagen Airport (170\u00a0km | 106 miles).\nThe small Hatten Airfield, (Flugplatz Oldenburg-Hatten ICAO airport code: EDWH), is located about 17\u00a0km south-west of Oldenburg. It serves to small aircraft (private planes, gliders, balloons, and helicopters). A flight training school is also located there, and small planes can be chartered. Scenic flights can be booked as well.\nOldenburg is connected to shipping through the K\u00fcstenkanal, a ship canal connecting the rivers Ems and Weser. With 1.6 million tons of goods annually, it is the most important non-coastal harbour in Lower Saxony.\nBicycles play a very important part in personal transport.\nAgriculture.\nThe city is surrounded by large agricultural areas, about 80% of which is grassland. There are farms near and even a few within city limits. Predominant agricultural activities of the region are the cultivation of livestock, especially dairy cows and other grazing animals, crops such as grains for food and animal feed, as well as asparagus, corn, and kale.\nIndustry.\nSea salt production in the Oldenburg region has been used since the 15th century to supply the huge salt demand in the Baltic region. Peat extraction in the area continued for many centuries until it was replaced by coal mines.\nDemographics.\nAs of 31.12.2019 Oldenburg had 169,960 residents. 24.8% of the population were first or second generation immigrants.\nCultural life.\nLutheran community.\nOldenburg is the seat of administration and bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg, whose preaching venue is the St Lamberti Church.\nJewish community.\nThe history of the Jewish community of Oldenburg dates back to the 14th century. Towards and during the 19th century, the Jews in Oldenburg were always around 1% of the total population, and by that time had acquired their own synagogue, cemetery and school. Most of them were merchants and businessmen. On 1938 Kristallnacht, the town men were led to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, among them Leo Trepp, the community Rabbi who survived and later became an honorary citizen of Oldenburg and honored by a street named after him. Since 1981 an annual commemoration walk (Erinnerungsgang) has been held by Oldenburg citizens in memory of the deportation of the Oldenburg Jews on November 10, 1938. Those who remained after 1938 emigrated to Canada, USA, United Kingdom, Holland or Mandatory Palestine.\nAfter World War II, a group of survivors returned to the city and maintained a small community until it was dissolved during the 1970s. Nevertheless, due to Jewish emigration from the former USSR to Germany in the 1990s, a community of about 340 people is now maintaining its own synagogue, cemetery and other facilities. The old Jewish cemetery, which is no longer active after the opening of a new one, was desecrated twice in 2011 and 2013.\nEducation.\nTertiary education.\nThere are two public universities in Oldenburg:\nPrivately managed institutions of higher education:\nOther:\nSports.\nOldenburg hosted the 2007 Fistball World Championship.\nIt has two football teams, VfB Oldenburg and VfL Oldenburg, who also have a handball section of the same name.\nMoreover, Oldenburg is home to the basketball team EWE Baskets Oldenburg.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nOldenburg is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "41938", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41938", "title": "Bloomsbury Group", "text": "Influential group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists\nThe Bloomsbury Group was a group of associated British writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the early 20th century. Among the people involved in the group were Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster, Vanessa Bell, and Lytton Strachey. Their works and outlook deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, criticism, and economics, as well as modern attitudes towards feminism, pacifism, and sexuality.\nAlthough popularly thought of as a formal group, it was a loose collective of friends and relatives closely associated with the University of Cambridge for the men and King's College London for the women, who at one point lived, worked or studied together near Bloomsbury, London. According to Ian Ousby, \"although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts.\" The historian Raymond Williams disputed the existence of the group and the extent of its impact.\nOrigins.\nAll male members of the Bloomsbury Group, except Duncan Grant, were educated at Cambridge (either at Trinity or King's College). Most of them, except Clive Bell and the Stephen brothers, were members of \"the exclusive Cambridge society, the 'Apostles'\". At Trinity in 1899 Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, Saxon Sydney-Turner and Clive Bell became good friends with Thoby Stephen, and it was through Thoby and Adrian Stephen's sisters Vanessa and Virginia that the men met the women of Bloomsbury when they came down to London.\nIn 1905 Vanessa began the \"Friday Club\" and Thoby ran \"Thursday Evenings\", which became the basis for the Bloomsbury Group, which to some was really \"Cambridge in London\". Thoby's premature death in 1906 brought them more firmly together and they became what is now known as the \"Old Bloomsbury\" group who met in earnest beginning in 1912. In the 1920s and 1930s the group shifted when the original members died and the next generation had reached adulthood.\nThe Bloomsbury Group, mostly from upper middle-class professional families, formed part of \"an intellectual aristocracy which could trace itself back to the Clapham Sect\". It was an informal network of an influential group of artists, art critics, writers and an economist, many of whom lived in the West Central 1 district of London known as Bloomsbury. They were \"spiritually\" similar to the Clapham group who supported its members' careers: \"The Bloomsberries promoted one another's work and careers just as the original Claphamites did, as well as the intervening generations of their grandparents and parents.\"\nA historical feature of these friends and relations is that their close relationships all pre-dated their fame as writers, artists, and thinkers.\nMembership.\nMembers.\nThe group had ten core members:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn addition to these ten, Leonard Woolf, in the 1960s, listed as \"Old Bloomsbury\" Adrian and Karin Stephen, Saxon Sydney-Turner, and Molly MacCarthy, with Julian Bell, Quentin Bell and Angelica Bell, and David Garnett as \"later additions\". Except for Forster, who published three novels before the highly successful \"Howards End\" in 1910, the group were late developers.\nThere were stable marriages and varied and complicated affairs among the individual members. Lytton Strachey and his cousin and lover Duncan Grant became close friends of the Stephen sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf. Duncan Grant had affairs with siblings Vanessa Bell and Adrian Stephen, as well as David Garnett, Maynard Keynes, and James Strachey. Clive Bell married Vanessa in 1907, and Leonard Woolf returned from the Ceylon Civil Service to marry Virginia in 1912. Cambridge Apostle friendships brought into the group Desmond MacCarthy, his wife Molly, and E. M. Forster.\nThe group met not only in their homes in Bloomsbury, central London, but also at countryside retreats. There are two significant ones near Lewes in Sussex: Charleston Farmhouse, where Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant moved in 1916, and Monk's House (now owned by the National Trust), in Rodmell, owned by Virginia and Leonard Woolf from 1919.\nOthers.\nMuch about Bloomsbury appears to be controversial, including its membership and name: indeed, some would maintain that \"the three words 'the Bloomsbury group' have been so much used as to have become almost unusable\".\nClose friends, brothers, sisters, and even sometimes partners of the friends were not necessarily members of Bloomsbury: Keynes's wife Lydia Lopokova was only reluctantly accepted into the group, and there were certainly \"writers who were at some time close friends of Virginia Woolf, but who were distinctly not 'Bloomsbury': T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, Hugh Walpole\". Another is Vita Sackville-West, who became \"Hogarth Press's best-selling author\". Members cited in \"other lists might include Ottoline Morrell, or Dora Carrington, or James and Alix Strachey\".\nShared ideas.\nThe lives and works of the group members show an overlapping, interconnected similarity of ideas and attitudes that helped to keep the friends and relatives together, reflecting in large part the influence of G. E. Moore: \"the essence of what Bloomsbury drew from Moore is contained in his statement that 'one's prime objects in life were love, the creation and enjoyment of aesthetic experience and the pursuit of knowledge'\".\nPhilosophy and ethics.\nThrough the Apostles they also encountered the analytic philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell who were revolutionizing British philosophy at the start of the 20th century. Distinguishing between ends and means was a commonplace of ethics, but what made Moore's \"Principia Ethica\" (1903) so important for the philosophical basis of Bloomsbury thought was Moore's conception of \"intrinsic worth\" as distinct from \"instrumental value\". As with the distinction between love (an intrinsic state) and monogamy (a behavior, i.e. instrumental), Moore's differentiation between intrinsic and instrumental value allowed the Bloomsburies to maintain an ethical high-ground based on intrinsic merit, independent of, and without reference to, the consequences of their actions. For Moore, intrinsic value depended on an indeterminable intuition of good and a concept of complex states of mind whose worth as a whole was not proportionate to the sum of its parts. For both Moore and Bloomsbury, the greatest ethic goods were \"the importance of personal relationships and the private life\", as well as aesthetic appreciation: \"art for art's sake\".\nRejection of bourgeois habits.\nBloomsbury reacted against current upper class English social rituals, \"the bourgeois habits\u00a0... the conventions of Victorian life\" with their emphasis on public achievement, in favour of a more informal and private focus on personal relationships and individual pleasure. E. M. Forster for example approved of \"the decay of smartness and fashion as factors, and the growth of the idea of enjoyment\", and asserted that \"if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country\".\nThe Group \"believed in pleasure\u00a0... They tried to get the maximum of pleasure out of their personal relations. If this meant triangles or more complicated geometric figures, well then, one accepted that too\". Yet at the same time, they shared a sophisticated, civilized, and highly articulated ideal of pleasure. As Virginia Woolf put it, their \"triumph is in having worked out a view of life which was not by any means corrupt or sinister or merely intellectual; rather ascetic and austere indeed; which still holds, and keeps them dining together, and staying together, after 20 years\".\nPolitics.\nPolitically, Bloomsbury held mainly left-liberal stances (opposed to militarism, for example); but its \"clubs and meetings were not activist, like the political organisations to which many of Bloomsbury's members also belonged\", and they would be criticised for that by their 1930s successors, who by contrast were \"heavily touched by the politics which Bloomsbury had rejected\".\nThe campaign for women's suffrage added to the controversial nature of Bloomsbury, as Virginia Woolf represented the group in the fictional \"The Years\" and \"Night and Day\" works about the suffrage movement.\nArt.\nRoger Fry joined the group in 1910. His Post-Impressionist exhibitions of 1910 and 1912 involved Bloomsbury in a second revolution following on the Cambridge philosophical one. This time the Bloomsbury painters were much involved and influenced. Fry and other Bloomsbury artists rejected the traditional distinction between fine and decorative art.\nThese \"Bloomsbury assumptions\" are reflected in members' criticisms of materialistic realism in painting and fiction, influenced above all by Clive Bell's \"concept of 'Significant Form', which separated and elevated the concept of form above content in works of art\": it has been suggested that, with their \"focus on form\u00a0...Bell's ideas have come to stand in for, perhaps too much so, the aesthetic principles of the Bloomsbury Group\".\nThe establishment's hostility to post-impressionism made Bloomsbury controversial, and controversial they have remained. Clive Bell polemicized post-impressionism in his widely read book \"Art\" (1914), basing his aesthetics partly on Roger Fry's art criticism and G. E. Moore's moral philosophy; and as the war came he argued that \"in these days of storm and darkness, it seemed right that at the shrine of civilization - in Bloomsbury, I mean - the lamp should be tended assiduously\".\nWorld War I.\nOld Bloomsbury's development was affected, along with much of modernist culture, by the First World War: \"the small world of Bloomsbury was later said by some on its outskirts to have been irretrievably shattered\", though in fact its friendships \"survived the upheavals and dislocations of war, in many ways were even strengthened by them\". Most but not all of them were conscientious objectors. Politically, the members of Bloomsbury had liberal and socialist leanings.\nThough the war dispersed Old Bloomsbury, the individuals continued to develop their careers. E. M. Forster followed his successful novels with \"Maurice\" which he could not publish because it treated homosexuality untragically. In 1915, Virginia Woolf brought out her first novel, \"The Voyage Out\"; and in 1917 the Woolfs founded their Hogarth Press, which would publish T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, and many others including Virginia herself along with the standard English translations of Freud. Then in 1918 Lytton Strachey published his critique of Victorianism in the shape of four iconoclastic biographies in \"Eminent Victorians,\" which added to the arguments about Bloomsbury that continue to this day, and \"brought him the triumph he had always longed for\u00a0... The book was a sensation\".\nThe following year came J. M. Keynes's influential attack on the Versailles Peace Treaty: \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" established Maynard as a prominent economist and political economist of international eminence.\nAttire.\nBloomsbury members became known for distinctive garments; Woolf in particular was opposed to conventions surrounding formal attire, such as \"dressing for dinner\".\nLater Bloomsbury.\nThe 1920s were in a number of ways the blooming of Bloomsbury. Virginia Woolf was writing and publishing her most widely-read modernist novels and essays, and E. M. Forster completed \"A Passage to India\" (1924), a highly regarded novel on British imperialism in India. Forster wrote no more novels, but he became one of England's most influential essayists. Duncan Grant, and then Vanessa Bell, had single-artist exhibitions. Lytton Strachey wrote his biographies of two queens, \"Queen Victoria\" (1921) and \"Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History\" (1928). Desmond MacCarthy and Leonard Woolf engaged in friendly rivalry as literary editors of the \"New Statesman\" and of \"The Nation and Athenaeum\" respectively, thus fuelling animosities that saw Bloomsbury dominating the cultural scene. Roger Fry wrote and lectured widely on art; meanwhile, Clive Bell applied Bloomsbury values to his book \"Civilization\" (1928), which Leonard Woolf saw as limited and elitist, describing Bell as a \"wonderful organiser of intellectual greyhound racing tracks\".\nIn the darkening 1930s, Bloomsbury began to die: \"Bloomsbury itself was hardly any longer a focus\". Shortly after publishing a collection of brief lives, \"Portraits in Miniature\" (1931), Lytton Strachey died in January 1932; subsequently Carrington shot herself (March 1932). Roger Fry died in 1934. Vanessa and Clive's eldest son, Julian Bell, was killed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Virginia Woolf wrote , but with the coming of war again her mental instability recurred, and she drowned herself in 1941. In the previous decade she had become one of the century's most famous feminist writers with three more novels, and a series of essays including the moving late memoir \"A Sketch of the Past\" (1939). It was also in the 1930s that Desmond MacCarthy became perhaps the most widely read\u2014and heard\u2014literary critic with his columns in \"The Sunday Times\" and his broadcasts for the BBC. John Maynard Keynes's \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\" (1936) made him one of the century's most influential economists. He died in 1946 after being much involved in monetary negotiations with the United States.\nThe diversity yet collectivity of Later Bloomsbury's ideas and achievements can be summed up in a series of credos produced in 1938, the year of the Munich Agreement. Virginia Woolf published her radical feminist polemic \"Three Guineas\" that shocked some of her fellow members, including Keynes who had enjoyed the gentler \"A Room of One's Own\" (1929). Keynes read his \"My Early Beliefs\" to The Memoir Club. Clive Bell published an appeasement pamphlet (he later supported the war), and E. M. Forster wrote an early version of his famous essay \"What I Believe\" with its choice of personal relations over patriotism: his quiet assertion in the face of the increasingly totalitarian claims of both left and right that \"personal relations\u00a0... love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the State\".\nMemoir Club.\nIn March 1920 Molly MacCarthy began the Memoir Club to help Desmond and herself write their memoirs; and also \"for their friends to regroup after the war (with the proviso that they should always tell the truth)\". It met until 1956 or 1964. The club was made up of members of the Bloomsbury Group, a loose collective of artists, writers, intellectuals, and philosophers.\nCriticism.\nEarly complaints focused on a perceived cliquiness: \"on personal mannerisms\u2014the favourite phrases ('ex-quisitely civilized', and 'How \"simply too\" extraordinary!'), the incredulous, weirdly emphasised Strachey voice\". After World War I, as the members of the Group \"began to be famous, the execration increased, and the caricature of an idle, snobbish and self-congratulatory rentier class, promoting its own brand of high culture began to take shape\": as Forster self-mockingly put it, \"In came the nice fat dividends, up rose the lofty thoughts\".\nThe growing threats of the 1930s brought new criticism from younger writers of \"what the last lot had done (Bloomsbury, Modernism, Eliot) in favour of what they thought of as urgent hard-hitting realism\"; while \"Wyndham Lewis's \"The Apes of God\", which called Bloomsbury \u00e9litist, corrupt and talentless, caused a stir\" of its own. The most telling criticism, however, came perhaps from within the Group's own ranks, when on the eve of war Keynes gave a \"nostalgic and disillusioned account of the pure sweet air of G. E. Moore, that belief in undisturbed individualism, that Utopianism based on a belief in human reasonableness and decency, that refusal to accept the idea of civilisation as 'a thin and precarious crust'\u00a0... Keynes's fond, elegiac repudiation of his \"early beliefs\", in the light of current affairs (\"We completely misunderstood human nature, including our own\")\".\nIn his book on the background of the Cambridge spies, Andrew Sinclair wrote about the Bloomsbury group: \"rarely in the field of human endeavour has so much been written about so few who achieved so little\". American philosopher Martha Nussbaum was quoted in 1999 as saying \"I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or Derrida\".\nRaymond Williams saw Bloomsbury as the invention of an ageing and lonely Leonard Woolf, seeking to lift himself and his friends from obscurity. To Williams, the only two so-called \"members\" of any significance in their respective fields were Keynes and Virginia Woolf. Williams unfavourably compared the Bloomsbury Group to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Arts and Crafts movement, finding that the older groups were more radical and consequential.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBooks and articles\nMuseums and libraries"}
{"id": "41940", "revid": "49473253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41940", "title": "Gentrification", "text": "Urban socioeconomic process\nGentrification is the process whereby the character of a neighborhood changes through the influx of more affluent residents (the \"gentry\") and investment. There is no agreed-upon definition of gentrification. In public discourse, it has been used to describe a wide array of phenomena, sometimes in a pejorative connotation.\nGentrification is a common and controversial topic in urban politics and planning. Gentrification often increases the economic value of a neighborhood, but can be controversial due to changing demographic composition and potential displacement of incumbent residents. Gentrification is more likely when there is an undersupply of housing and rising home values in a metropolitan area.\nThe gentrification process is typically the result of increasing attraction to an area by people with higher incomes spilling over from neighboring cities, towns, or neighborhoods. Further steps are increased investments in a community and the related infrastructure by real estate development businesses, local government, or community activists and resulting economic development, increased attraction of business, and lower crime rates.\nOrigin and etymology.\nHistorians say that gentrification took place in ancient Rome and in Roman Britain, where large villas were replacing small shops by the 3rd century, AD. The word \"gentrification\" derives from \"gentry\"\u2014which comes from the Old French word \"genterise\", \"of gentle birth\" (14th century) and \"people of gentle birth\" (16th century). In England, \"landed gentry\" denoted the social class, consisting of gentlemen (and gentlewomen, as they were known at that time).\nA more direct derivational base of \"gentrification\" is the 19th-century neologism 'gentrify,' a verb coined by Samuel Laing (1780\u20131868). This term reflected shifting societal attitudes\u2014specifically, the idea that one could attain upper-class status through conduct rather than birth\u2014while also introducing undertones of conspicuous consumption and pretentiousness.\nBritish sociologist Ruth Glass was first to use \"gentrification\" in its current sense. She used it in 1964 to describe the influx of middle-class people displacing lower-class worker residents in urban neighborhoods; her example was London, and its working-class districts such as Islington:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been invaded by the middle-classes\u2014upper and lower. Shabby, modest mews and cottages\u2014two rooms up and two down\u2014have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences\u00a0... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed.\nDefinitions.\nIn the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report \"Health Effects of Gentrification\" defines the real estate concept of \"gentrification\" as \"the transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value.\" A real estate encyclopedia defines gentrification as \"the process by which central urban neighborhoods that have undergone disinvestments and economic decline experience a reversal, reinvestment, and the in-migration of a well-off middle- and upper-middle-class population.\"\nScholars and pundits have applied a variety of definitions to gentrification since 1964, some oriented around gentrifiers, others oriented around the displaced, and some a combination of both. The first category include the definition \"the production of space for progressively more affluent users\". The second category include Kasman's definition \"the reduction of residential and retail space affordable to low-income residents\". The final category includes Rose, who describes gentrification as a process \"in which members of the 'new middle class' move into and physically and culturally reshape working-class inner city neighbourhoods\".\n say in their Brookings Institution report that \"the term 'gentrification' is both imprecise and quite politically charged\", suggesting its redefinition as \"the process by which higher income households displace lower income residents of a neighborhood, changing the essential character and flavour of that neighborhood\", so distinguishing it from the different socio-economic process of \"neighborhood (or urban) revitalization\", although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. argues that Glass's original use of the word employs a war metaphor to emphasize the 'displacement of lower-income residents' as central\u2014a class-struggle meaning that risks being sidelined in its continued use to denote processes of 'urban change' or 'improvement.'\nGentrification has been described as a natural cycle: the well-to-do prefer to live in the newest housing stock. Each decade of a city's growth, a new ring of housing is built. When the housing at the center has reached the end of its useful life and becomes cheap, the well-to-do gentrify the neighborhood. The push outward from the city center continues as the housing in each ring reaches the end of its economic life. They observe that \"gentrification\" has three interpretations: (a) \"great, the value of my house is going up, (b) coffee is more expensive, now that we have a Starbucks, and (c) my neighbors and I can no longer afford to live here (\"community displacement\")\".\nCauses.\n compiled five explanations for gentrification since the 1970s:\nOther explanations propose that as people tire of the automobile-dependent urban sprawl style of life, they move to urban areas, in particular to homes near public transit stations. The increase in professional jobs in the central business district has increased demand for living in urban areas according to . Critical geographers have argued that capital flows and developers have been instrumental in causing gentrification.\nThe de-industrialization of cities in developed nations may have caused displacement by reducing the number of blue-collar jobs available to the urban working class and middle-class.\nSome have argued that the counterculture movement in the 1960s created disdain for the \"standardization of look-alike suburbs\", prompting people to live in urban areas. Others argue that a desire to live near cultural attractions prompts gentrification.\nEffects.\nCrime.\nAccording to a 2020 systematic review of existing research, gentrification in the United States has led to a short-term reduction in crime in gentrifying neighborhoods. However, it noted that there is little evidence for more long-term impacts and that gentrification in some cases widens crime-related disparities.\nDisplacement.\nDisplacement is often seen as a key effect of gentrification, although evidence is mixed as to whether gentrification leads to displacement (or even reduces displacement) and under which circumstances. In 2005, \"USA Today\" claimed that gentrification is a \"boost for everyone\" based on the impact of some recent studies and that displacement that arises is minimal, or caused by other factors. Some scholars have disputed these assertions, arguing that such studies distort facts and used limited datasets. In 2002, economist Jacob Vigdor wrote, \"Overall, existing literature has failed to convincingly demonstrate that rates of involuntary displacement are higher in gentrifying neighborhoods.\"\nA 2018 study found evidence that gentrification displaces renters, but not homeowners. The displacement of low-income rental residents is commonly referenced as a negative aspect of gentrification by its opponents. A 2022 study found evidence that gentrification leads to greater residential mobility.\nIn the United States, a 2023 study by Princeton University sociologists found that \"eviction rates decreased more in gentrifying neighborhoods than in comparable low-income neighborhoods.\" A 2016 study found \"that vulnerable residents, those with low credit scores and without mortgages, are generally no more likely to move from gentrifying neighborhoods compared with their counterparts in nongentrifying neighborhoods.\" A 2017 study by sociology professor Matthew Desmond, who runs Princeton University's Eviction Lab, \"found no evidence that renters residing in gentrifying or in racially- and economically-integrated neighborhoods had a higher likelihood of eviction.\" A 2020 study which followed children from low-income families in New York found no evidence that gentrification was associated with changes in mobility rates. The study also found \"that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas.\" A 2023 study by economists at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that the construction of new large apartment buildings in low-income neighborhoods lead to an influx of high-income households but also decrease rents in nearby units by increasing housing supply.\nIn the United Kingdom, recent studies suggest that gentrification leads to \"exclusionary\" displacement \u2013 i.e. preventing low-income households from moving to an area due to high rent/home prices \u2013 but less so for \"direct\" displacement \u2013 forcing low-income households to move out of an area due to high rent/home prices. Often, a lack of low-level migration data limits displacement-based research.\nIn Vancouver, Canada, Hogan's Alley was an ethnically diverse and predominantly Black area in the Downtown Eastside that was demolished in the 1960s to construct the Georgia Viaduct. As a historically working-class district and Vancouver's first and only Black community, Hogan's Alley was home to many residents who were displaced, resulting in disruption to the community. This reflects how gentrification has disproportionately impacted racialized communities in many North American cities. Since the 1970s, the Downtown Eastside has undergone ongoing urban transformation. The influx of upper-end restaurants and bars into historically marginalized communities has contributed to resident polarization, disinvestment in lower-income housing stock, and tensions between different socioeconomic groups.\nSocial changes.\nMany of the social effects of gentrification have been based on extensive theories about how socioeconomic status of an individual's neighborhood will shape one's behavior and future. These studies have prompted \"social mix policies\" to be widely adopted by governments to promote the process and its positive effects, such as lessening the strain on public resources that are associated with de-concentrating poverty. However, more specific research has shown that gentrification does not necessarily correlate with \"social mixing\", and that the effects of the new composition of a gentrified neighborhood can both weaken as well as strengthen community cohesion.\nHousing confers social status, and the changing norms that accompany gentrification translate to a changing social hierarchy. The process of gentrification mixes people of different socioeconomic strata, thereby congregating a variety of expectations and social norms. The change gentrification brings in class distinction also has been shown to contribute to residential polarization by income, education, household composition, and race. It conveys a social rise that brings new standards in consumption, particularly in the form of excess and superfluity, to the area that were not held by the pre-existing residents. These differing norms can lead to conflict, which potentially serves to divide changing communities. Often this comes at a larger social cost to the original residents of the gentrified area whose displacement is met with little concern from the gentry or the government. Clashes that result in increased police surveillance, for example, would more adversely affect young minorities who are also more likely to be the original residents of the area.\nThere is also evidence to support that gentrification can strengthen and stabilize when there is a consensus about a community's objectives. Gentrifiers with an organized presence in deteriorated neighborhoods can demand and receive better resources. A characteristic example is a combined community effort to win historic district designation for the neighborhood, a phenomenon that is often linked to gentrification activity. Gentry can exert a peer influence on neighbors to take action against crime, which can lead to even more price increases in changing neighborhoods when crime rates drop and optimism for the area's future climbs.\nSome argue that gentrification is associated with the decline of distinctive local businesses and the rise of chains and franchises.\nRehabilitation movements have been largely successful at restoring the plentiful supply of old and deteriorated housing that is readily available in inner cities. This rehabilitation can be seen as a superior alternative to expansion, for the location of the central city offers an intact infrastructure that should be taken advantage of: streets, public transportation, and other urban facilities. Furthermore, the changed perception of the central city that is encouraged by gentrification can be healthy for resource-deprived communities who have previously been largely ignored. Gentrifiers provide the political effectiveness needed to draw more government funding towards physical and social area improvements, while improving the overall quality of life by providing a larger tax base.\nCommunities have strong ties to the history and culture of their neighborhood, and causing its dispersal can have detrimental costs.\nEconomic shifts.\nThe economic changes that occur as a community goes through gentrification are often favorable for local governments. Affluent gentrifiers expand the local tax base as well as support local shops and businesses, a large part of why the process is frequently alluded to in urban policies. The decrease in vacancy rates and increase in property value that accompany the process can work to stabilize a previously struggling community, restoring interest in inner-city life as a residential option alongside the suburbs. These changes can create positive feedback as well, encouraging other forms of development of the area that promote general economic growth.\nHome ownership is a significant variable when it comes to economic impacts of gentrification. People who own their homes are much more able to gain financial benefits of gentrification than those who rent their houses and can be displaced without much compensation.\nEconomic pressure and market price changes relate to the speed of gentrification. English-speaking countries have a higher number of property owners and a higher mobility. German speaking countries provide a higher share of rented property and have a much stronger role of municipalities, cooperatives, guilds and unions offering low-price-housing. The effect is a lower speed of gentrification and a broader social mix. Gerhard Hard sees gentrification as a typical 1970s term with more visibility in public discourse than actual migration.\nA 2017 study found that gentrification leads to job gains overall, with job losses in proximate locations but job gains further away. A 2014 study found that gentrification led to job gains in the gentrifying neighborhood.\nA 2016 study found that residents who stay in gentrifying neighborhoods go on to obtain higher credit scores whereas residents who leave gentrifying neighborhoods obtain lower credit scores.\nEducation.\n\"School gentrification\" is characterized by: (i) increased numbers of middle-class families; (ii) material and physical upgrades (e.g. new programs, educational resources, and infrastructural improvements); (iii) forms of exclusion and/or the marginalization of low-income students and families (e.g. in both enrollment and social relations); and (iv) changes in school culture and climate (e.g. traditions, expectations, and social dynamics).\nA 2024 study found that adding high-density mixed-income developments to low-income neighborhoods in London, United Kingdom, led to improved educational outcomes for the children who were already living in the neighborhood. The plausible mechanism for this effect is that incumbent students were exposed to more high-ability students.\nIn Chicago, among neighborhood public schools located in areas that did undergo gentrification, one study found that schools experience no aggregate academic benefit from the socioeconomic changes occurring around them, despite improvements in other public services such street repair, sanitation, policing, and firefighting. The lack of gentrification-related benefits to schools may be related to the finding that white gentrifiers often do not enroll their children in local neighborhood public schools.\nPrograms and policies designed to attract gentrifying families to historically disinvested schools may have unintended negative consequences, including an unbalanced landscape of influence wherein the voices and priorities of more affluent parents are privileged over those of lower-income families. In addition, rising enrollment of higher-income families in neighborhood schools can result in the political and cultural displacement of long-term residents in school decision-making processes and the loss of Title I funding. Notably, the expansion of school choice (e.g., charter schools, magnet schools, open enrollment policies) have been found to significantly increase the likelihood that college-educated white households gentrify low-income communities of color.\nHealth.\nA culmination of recent research suggests that gentrification has both detrimental and beneficial effects on health.\nA 2020 review found that studies tended to show adverse health impacts for Black residents and elderly residents in areas undergoing gentrification.\nA 2019 study in New York, found that gentrification has no impact on rates of asthma or obesity among low-income children. Growing up in gentrifying neighborhoods was associated with moderate increases in being diagnosed with anxiety or depression between ages 9\u201311 relative to similar children raised in non-gentrifying areas. The effects of gentrification on mental health were most prominent for children living in market-rate (rather than subsidized) housing, which lead the authors of the study to suggest financial stress as a possible mechanism.\nPreventing or mitigating gentrification is thought to be a method to promote health equity.\nMeasurement.\nWhether gentrification has occurred in a census tract in an urban area in the United States during a particular 10-year period between censuses can be determined by a method used in a study by \"Governing\": If the census tract in a central city had 500 or more residents and at the time of the baseline census had median household income and median home value in the bottom 40th percentile and at the time of the next 10-year census the tract's educational attainment (percentage of residents over age 25 with a bachelor's degree) was in the top 33rd percentile; the median home value, adjusted for inflation, had increased; and the percentage of increase in home values in the tract was in the top 33rd percentile when compared to the increase in other census tracts in the urban area then it was considered to have been gentrified. The method measures the rate of gentrification, not the degree of gentrification; thus, San Francisco, which has a history of gentrification dating to the 1970s, show a decreasing rate between 1990 and 2010.\nScholars have also identified census indicators that can be used to reveal that gentrification is taking place in a given area, including a drop in the number of children per household, increased education among residents, the number of non-traditional types of households, and a general upwards shift in income.\nPopulations impacting and impacted by gentrification.\nJust as critical to the gentrification process as creating a favorable environment is the availability of the 'gentry,' or those who will be first-stage gentrifiers. The typical gentrifiers are affluent and have professional-level, service industry jobs, many of which involve self-employment. Therefore, they are willing and able to take the investment risk in the housing market. Often they are single people or young couples without children who lack demand for good schools. Gentrifiers are likely searching for inexpensive housing close to the workplace and often already reside in the inner city, sometimes for educational reasons, and do not want to make the move to suburbia. For this demographic, gentrification is not so much the result of a return to the inner city but is more of a positive action to remain there. Though early gentrifiers may intend to remain in the neighborhoods they move into, they too are at risk of being bought-out or pushed as the areas increase in favorability by higher-income groups of gentrifiers that become interested in the urban developments. The cycle of gentrification relies on the built attraction of certain urban areas and neighborhoods, as areas near or within major cities are often the targets. However, as corporations also take notice of changes in certain areas, they may establish sites\u2014which furthers a wave of people motivated to move in for career opportunities. Previously established communities, who are often lower-class people of color become displaced as they may not be able to compete with rising rent and developments made. Though people noted as \"gentrifiers\" may not intend to negatively impact people around them, as more people in a certain class demographic enter, the neighborhood may begin to lose previous communities.\nThe stereotypical gentrifiers also have shared consumer preferences and favor a largely consumerist culture. This fuels the rapid expansion of trendy restaurant, shopping, and entertainment spheres that often accompany the gentrification process. Holcomb and Beauregard described these groups as those who are \"attracted by low prices and toleration of an unconventional lifestyle\".\nAn interesting find from research on those who participate and initiate the gentrification process, the \"marginal gentrifiers\" as referred to by Tim Butler, is that they become marginalized by the expansion of the process.\nThe upper-class.\nResearch shows how one reason wealthy, upper-class individuals and families hold some responsibility in the causation of gentrification is due to their social mobility. Wealthier families were more likely to have more financial freedom to move into urban areas, oftentimes choosing to do so for their work. At the same time, in these urban areas the lower-income population is decreasing due to an increase in the elderly population as well as demographic change.\nJackelyn Hwang and Jeffrey Lin have supported in their research that another reason for the influx of upper-class individuals to urban areas is due to the \"increase in demand for college-educated workers\". It is because of this demand that wealthier individuals with college degrees needed to move into urban cities for work, increasing prices in housing as the demand has grown. Additionally, Darren P. Smith finds through his research that college-educated workers moving into the urban areas causes them to settle there and raise children, which eventually contributes to the cost of education in regards to the migration between urban and suburban places.\nZukin examined gentrification through the lens of urban \"authenticity\", focusing on how perceptions of authentic urban experience drive neighborhood transformation in New York City. Through case studies of neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Harlem, she documents how the very qualities that make neighborhoods appear authentic to middle-class consumers\u2014ethnic diversity, historic architecture, local businesses\u2014ultimately disappear as these areas gentrify. Zukin identifies how media, consumer culture, and government policies combine to facilitate gentrification through the promotion of \"authentic\" urban experiences. She demonstrates that seemingly spontaneous processes of neighborhood change are actually shaped by specific policy decisions, real estate investments, and cultural capital. The book explicitly critiques Jane Jacobs' vision of neighborhood preservation, arguing that Jacobs failed to recognize how market forces would commodify the authentic urban experiences she championed. Zukin concluded by advocating for policies that preserve not just the built environment but also social diversity, suggesting that truly authentic urbanism requires both economic and cultural rights to the city.\nWomen.\nWomen increasingly obtaining higher education as well as higher paying jobs has increased their participation in the labor force, translating to an expansion of women who have greater opportunities to invest. Smith suggests this group \"represents a reservoir of potential gentrifiers.\" The increasing number of highly educated women play into this theory, given that residence in the inner city can give women access to the well-paying jobs and networking, something that is becoming increasingly common.\nThere are also theories that suggest the inner-city lifestyle is important for women with children where the father does not care equally for the child, because of the proximity to professional childcare. This attracts single parents, specifically single mothers, to the inner-city as opposed to suburban areas where resources are more geographically spread out. This is often deemed as \"marginal gentrification\", for the city can offer an easier solution to combining paid and unpaid labor. Inner city concentration increases the efficiency of commodities parents need by minimizing time constraints among multiple jobs, childcare, and markets.\nArtists.\nPhillip Clay's two-stage model of gentrification places artists as prototypical stage one or \"marginal\" gentrifiers. The National Endowment for the Arts did a study that linked the proportion of employed artists to the rate of inner city gentrification across a number of U.S. cities. Artists will typically accept the risks of rehabilitating deteriorated property, as well as having the time, skill, and ability to carry out these extensive renovations. David Ley states that the artist's critique of everyday life and search for meaning and renewal are what make them early recruits for gentrification.\nThe identity that residence in the inner city provides is important for the gentrifier, and this is particularly so in the artists' case. Their cultural emancipation from the bourgeois makes the central city an appealing alternative that distances them from the conformity and mundanity attributed to suburban life. They are quintessential city people, and the city is often a functional choice as well, for city life has advantages that include connections to customers and a closer proximity to a downtown art scene, all of which are more likely to be limited in a suburban setting. Ley's research cites a quote from a Vancouver printmaker talking about the importance of inner city life to an artist, that it has, \"energy, intensity, hard to specify but hard to do without\".\nIronically, these attributes that make artists characteristic marginal gentrifiers form the same foundations for their isolation as the gentrification process matures. The later stages of the process generate an influx of more affluent, \"yuppie\" residents. As the bohemian character of the community grows, it appeals \"not only to committed participants, but also to sporadic consumers,\" and the rising property values that accompany this migration often lead to the eventual pushing out of the artists that began the movement in the first place. Sharon Zukin's study of SoHo in Manhattan, NYC was one of the most famous cases of this phenomenon. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Manhattan lofts in SoHo were converted \"en masse\" into housing for artists and hippies, and then their sub-culture's followers.\nLGBT community.\nManuel Castells has researched the role of gay communities, especially in San Francisco, as early gentrifiers. The film \"Quincea\u00f1era\" depicts a similar situation in Los Angeles. \"Flag Wars\" (Linda Goode Bryant) shows tensions as of 2003 between bourgeois White LGBT-newcomers and a Black middle-class neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. In Washington, D.C. Black and other ethnic minority mixed-income community residents accused both the affluent majority-White LGBTQ+ community and the closely linked hipster subculture of cultural displacement (or destruction of cultural heritage) under the guise of progressive inclusion and tolerance. \nEvidence from Buenos Aires, shows that predominantly LGBTQ+ areas were only able to exist when the government allowed that area to be gentrified. As certain areas that are deemed progressive evolve and implement new housing and businesses, this expands the appeal of people looking to partake. Gentrification becomes a signal for institutions and businesses to measure potential bases. In cases of the LGBTQ+ community, successful businesses may be recognized as the ones planted in urban and progressive areas that are seen as safe. However, this comfort that invites marginalized communities puts previous communities living there at risk of displacement. As gay bars are a popular way in which the LGBTQ+ community may find security, the connection to gentrification for certain locations is critical for addressing the history of their establishment.\nToday, practically all historic gayborhoods have become less LGBTQ+ centric mainly due to the modern effects of gentrification. Gay neighborhoods may reveal elements of classism and racism perpetuated by affluent white gay men who settle in spaces that drive out people of color\u2014through rent being raised in the area. Investing in inner-cities and urban areas, affluent queer people have built gay bars, bookstores, and other queer-centered establishments that then lead to the cities gaining attention and desirability\u2014which then increases the rent of properties in the surrounding area. The rising cost to live in gayborhoods and government use of eminent domain have displaced many LGBTQ+ people and closed many LGBTQ+ centric businesses.\nControl.\nTo counter the gentrification of their mixed-populace communities, there are cases where residents formally organized themselves to develop the necessary socio-political strategies required to retain local affordable housing. The gentrification of a mixed-income community raises housing affordability to the fore of the community's politics. There are cities, municipalities, and counties which have countered gentrification with inclusionary zoning (inclusionary housing) ordinances requiring the apportionment of some new housing for the community's original low- and moderate-income residents. Inclusionary zoning is a new social concept in English speaking countries; there are few reports qualifying its effective or ineffective limitation of gentrification in the English literature. The basis of inclusionary zoning is partial replacement as opposed to displacement of the embedded communities.\nGerman (speaking) municipalities have a strong legal role in zoning and on the real estate market in general and a long tradition of integrating social aspects in planning schemes and building regulations. The German approach uses en (milieu conservation municipal law), e.g. in Munich's Lehel district in use since the 1960s. The concepts of socially aware renovation and zoning of Bologna's old city in 1974 was used as role model in the Charta of Bologna, and recognized by the Council of Europe.\nMost economists do not think anti-gentrification measures by the government make cities better off.\nOther methods.\nDirect action and sabotage.\nWhen wealthy people move into low-income working-class neighborhoods, the resulting class conflict sometimes involves vandalism and arson targeting the property of the gentrifiers. During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, the gentrification of San Francisco's predominantly working class Mission District led some long-term neighborhood residents to create what they called the \"Mission Yuppie Eradication Project\". This group allegedly destroyed property and called for property destruction as part of a strategy to oppose gentrification. Their activities drew hostile responses from the San Francisco Police Department, real estate interests, and \"work-within-the-system\" housing activists.\nMeibion Glynd\u0175r (), also known as the Valley Commandos, was a Welsh nationalist movement violently opposed to the loss of Welsh culture and language. They were formed in response to the housing crisis precipitated by large numbers of second homes being bought by the English which had increased house prices beyond the means of many locals. The group were responsible for setting fire to English-owned holiday homes in Wales from 1979 to the mid-1990s. In the first wave of attacks, eight holiday homes were destroyed in a month, and in 1980, Welsh Police carried out a series of raids in Operation T\u00e2n. Within the next ten years, some 220 properties were damaged by the campaign. Since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased. In 1989 there was a movement that protested an influx of Swabians to Berlin who were deemed as gentrification drivers. Berlin saw the Schwabenhass and 2013 Sp\u00e4tzlerstreit controversies, which identified gentrification with newcomers from the German south.\nZoning ordinances.\nZoning ordinances and other urban planning tools can be used to recognize and support local business and industries. This can include requiring developers to continue with a current commercial tenant or offering development incentives for keeping existing businesses, as well as creating and maintaining industrial zones. Designing zoning to allow new housing near to a commercial corridor but not on top of it increases foot traffic to local businesses without redeveloping them. Businesses can become more stable by securing long-term commercial leases.\nAlthough developers may recognize value in responding to living patterns, extensive zoning policies often prevent affordable homes from being constructed within urban development. Due to urban density restrictions, rezoning for residential development within urban living areas is difficult, which forces the builder and the market into urban sprawl and propagates the energy inefficiencies that come with distance from urban centers. In a recent example of restrictive urban zoning requirements, Arcadia Development Co. was prevented from rezoning a parcel for residential development in an urban setting within the city of Morgan Hill, California. With limitations established in the interest of public welfare, a density restriction was applied solely to Arcadia Development Co.'s parcel of development, excluding any planned residential expansion.\nCommunity land trusts.\nBecause land speculation tends to cause volatility in property values, removing real estate (houses, buildings, land) from the open market freezes property values, and thereby prevents the economic eviction of the community's poorer residents. The most common, formal legal mechanism for such stability in English speaking countries is the community land trust; moreover, many inclusionary zoning ordinances formally place the \"inclusionary\" housing units in a land trust. German municipalities and other cooperative actors have and maintain strong roles on the real estate markets in their realm.\nRent control.\nIn jurisdictions where local or national government has these powers, there may be rent control regulations. Rent control restricts the rent that can be charged, so that incumbent tenants are not forced out by rising rents. If applicable to private landlords, it is a disincentive to speculating with property values, reduces the incidence of dwellings left empty, and limits availability of housing for new residents. If the law does not restrict the rent charged for dwellings that come onto the rental market (formerly owner-occupied or new build), rents in an area can still increase. Neighborhoods in southwestern Santa Monica and eastern West Hollywood in California, United States gentrified despite\u2014or perhaps, because of\u2014rent control.\nOccasionally, a housing black market develops, wherein landlords withdraw houses and apartments from the market, making them available only upon payment of additional key money, fees, or bribes\u2014thus undermining the rent control law. Many such laws allow \"vacancy decontrol\", releasing a dwelling from rent control upon the tenant's leaving\u2014resulting in steady losses of rent-controlled housing, ultimately rendering rent control laws ineffective in communities with a high rate of resident turnover. In other cases social housing owned by local authorities may be sold to tenants and then sold on. Vacancy decontrol encourages landlords to find ways of shortening their residents' tenure, most aggressively through landlord harassment. To strengthen the rent control laws of New York, housing advocates active in rent control in New York are attempting to repeal the vacancy decontrol clauses of rent control laws. The state of Massachusetts abolished rent control in 1994; afterwards, rents rose, accelerating the pace of Boston's gentrification; however, the laws protected few apartments, and confounding factors, such as a strong economy, had already been raising housing and rental prices.\nExamples.\nInner London.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;London is being \"made over\" by an urban centred middle class. In the post war era, upwardly mobile social classes tended to leave the city. Now, led by a new middle class, they are reconstructing much of inner London as a place both in which to work and live.\u2014\u200a\nGentrification is not a new phenomenon in Britain; in ancient Rome the shop-free forum was developed during the Roman Republican period, and in 2nd- and 3rd-century cities in Roman Britain there is evidence of small shops being replaced by large villas.\nKing's College London academic Loretta Lees reported that much of Inner London was undergoing \"super-gentrification\", where \"a new group of super-wealthy professionals, working in the City of London [i.e. the financial industry], is slowly imposing its mark on this Inner London housing market, in a way that differentiates it, and them, from traditional gentrifiers, and from the traditional urban upper classes\u00a0... Super-gentrification is quite different from the classical version of gentrification. It's of a higher economic order; you need a much higher salary and bonuses to live in Barnsbury\" (some two miles north of central London). Rising housing prices due to gentrification within London have led to a doubling of evictions done by private landlords and to a long-term decline in home ownership from the years 2003\u20132020.\nBarnsbury was built around 1820, as a middle-class neighbourhood, but after the Second World War (1939\u20131945), many people moved to the suburbs. The upper and middle classes were fleeing from the working class residents of London, made possible by the modern railway. At the war's end, the great housing demand rendered Barnsbury a place of cheap housing, where most people shared accommodation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, people moving into the area had to finance house renovations with their money, because banks rarely financed loans for Barnsbury. Moreover, the rehabilitating spark was \"The 1959 Housing Purchase and Housing Act\", investing \u00a3100\u00a0million to rehabilitating old properties and infrastructure. As a result, the principal population influx occurred between 1961 and 1975; the UK Census reports that \"between the years of 1961 and 1981, owner-occupation increased from 7 to 19 per cent, furnished rentals declined from 14 to 7 per cent, and unfurnished rentals declined from 61 to 6 per cent\"; another example of urban gentrification is the super-gentrification, in the 1990s, of the neighboring working-class London Borough of Islington, where Prime Minister Tony Blair lived until his election in 1997. The conversion of older houses into flats emerged in the 1980s as developers saw the profits to be made. By the end of the 1980s, conversions were the single largest source of new dwellings in London.\nMexico City.\nMexico City has been an iconic example of an extensive metropolitan area since the 14th century when it became the largest city in the American continent. Its continuous population growth and concentration of economic and political power boomed in the 1930s when the country's involvement with global markets benefited the national financial industry. Currently the fifth largest city in the world, with a population of 21\u00a0million inhabitants (17.47% of national population) living in 16 districts and 59 municipalities, the urban area continues to expand receiving 1,100 new residents daily. The division of the city is derived from a strong socially and economically segregated population connected by its interdependence, that manifests into spatial arrangements where luxury areas coexist alongside slums. Its development around a core called \"El Zocalo\" derives from the historic, cultural and political relevance of a central plaza, as well as its contemporary concentration of economic power, currently housing 80% of all national firms.\nIn recent years, there has been a large uptick in new development in Mexico City, funded by state and private investments. These urban developments have been catered to elite communities mainly because this group economically supports the country (38% of the total national income is produced by the top 10%) and because the government, predominantly led by PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional), has maintained a profit-oriented policy perspective. Thus, these developments have not only led to an increase of population, traffic and pollution due to inefficient urban planning, but have also pushed great amounts of low-income families to the edges of the city and have challenged the safety of the 11.5\u00a0million people that economically depend on the underground sector. This issue adds to the already critical condition of 40% of the population living in informal settlements, often without access to sewage network and clean water. The geology of the city, located in a mountain valley, further contributes to unhealthy living conditions, concentrating high levels of air pollution.\nThe reality currently faced by the city is that of a historic rapid urban growth that has been unable to be adequately controlled and planned for, because of a corrupted and economically driven government, as well as a complex society that is strongly segregated. The negative effects of gentrification in Mexico City have been overlooked by the authorities, regarded as an inevitable process and argued to be in some cases nonexistent. In recent years, however, an array of proposals have been developed as a way to continue the gentrification of the city in a way that integrates and respects the rights of all citizens.\nCanada.\nBy the 1970s, investors in Toronto started buying up city houses\u2014turning them into temporary rooming houses to make rental income until the desired price in the housing market for selling off the properties was reached (so that the rooming houses could be replaced with high income-oriented new housing)\u2014a gentrification process called \"blockbusting\".\nAs of 2011[ [update]], gentrification in Canada has proceeded quickly in older and denser cities such as Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton and Vancouver, but has barely begun in places such as Calgary, Edmonton, or Winnipeg, where suburban expansion is still the primary type of growth.\nCanada's unique history and official multiculturalism policy has resulted in a different strain of gentrification than that of the United States. Some gentrification in Toronto has been sparked by the efforts of business improvement associations to market the ethnic communities in which they operate, such as in Corso Italia and Greektown.\nIn Quebec City, the Saint Roch neighbourhood in the city's lower town was previously predominantly working class and had gone through a period of decline. However, since the early to mid 2000s, the area has seen the transformation of the derelict buildings into condos and the opening of bars, restaurants and cafes, attracting young professionals into the area, but kicking out the residents from many generations back. Several software developers and gaming companies, such as Ubisoft and Beenox, have also opened offices there.\nFrance.\nIn Paris, most poor neighborhoods in the east have seen rising prices and the arrival of many wealthy residents. However, the process is mitigated by social housing and most cities tend to favor a \"social mix\"; that is, having both low and high-income residents in the same neighborhoods. But in practice, social housing does not cater to the poorest segment of the population; most residents of social dwellings are from the low-end of the middle class. As a result, a lot of poor people have been forced to go first to the close suburbs (1970 to 2000) and then more and more to remote \"periurban areas\" where public transport is almost nonexistent. The close suburbs (Saint-Ouen, Saint Denis, Aubervilliers, ...) are now in the early stages of gentrification although still poor. A lot of high-profile companies offering well-paid jobs have moved near Saint-Denis and new real-estate programs are underway to provide living areas close to the new jobs.\nOn the other side, the eviction of the poorest people to periurban areas since 2000 has been analyzed as the main cause for the rising political far-right National Front. When the poor lived in the close suburbs, their problems were very visible to the wealthy population. But the periurban population and its problem is mainly \"invisible\" from recent presidential campaign promises. These people have labelled themselves \"les invisibles\". Many of them fled both rising costs in Paris and nearby suburbs with an insecure and ugly environment to live in small houses in the countryside but close to the city. But they did not factor in the huge financial and human cost of having up to four hours of transportation every day. Since then, a lot has been invested in the close suburbs (with new public transports set to open and urban renewal programs) they fled, but almost nobody cares of these \"invisible\" plots of land. Since the close suburbs are now mostly inhabited by immigrants, these people have a strong resentment against immigration: They feel everything is done for new immigrants but nothing for the native French population.\nThis has been first documented in the book \"Plaidoyer pour une gauche populaire\" by think-tank Terra-Nova which had a major influence on all contestants in the presidential election (and at least, Sarkozy, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Marine Le Pen). This electorate voted overwhelmingly in favor of Marine Le Pen and Sarkozy while the city centers and close suburbs voted overwhelmingly for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\nMost major metropolises in France follow the same pattern with a belt of periurban development about 30 to 80\u00a0kilometers of the center where a lot of poor people moved in and are now trapped by rising fuel costs. These communities have been disrupted by the arrival of new people and already suffered of high unemployment due to the dwindling numbers of industrial jobs.\nIn smaller cities, the suburbs are still the principal place where people live and the center is more and more akin to a commercial estate where a lot of commercial activities take place but where few people live.\nHonduras.\nGenerally in Honduras the phenomenon of gentrification had not been so widespread because it had been a nation with a less developed economy than other countries in the Latin American region, however this phenomenon has begun to grow exponentially in the last decade. The main areas where the increase has been seen are the urban centers of its two most important cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. In the last years Honduras has become an emerging destination for digital nomads, these travelers are often attracted by the tropical climate, natural beauty, low cost of living compared to their home countries, and the ability to work remotely from attractive locations.\nSome of the places that have suffered this phenomenon are the Bay islands, Valle de Angeles, Santa Lucia, and Copan Ruinas. The main reasons for this phenomenon in Honduras are real estate companies, foreign investors, real estate agencies, expatriates, and retirees. The case of the Bay Islands has been special due to the purchase of land mainly by high-income residents, hotel companies, and foreigners. Making the cost of housing for islanders more expensive and the cost of living has increased extensively, several fishing communities have denounced the increase in the cost of living in historically inhabited communities inhabited by them for generations. This phenomenon has even been seen in how more foreign currencies are used in the area, such as the dollar, which is the most used on the islands.\nAs for the urban centers of the country, Teguciglapa has seen the rehabilitation of old wealthy buildings in the historic center for the so-called Digital Nomads. The construction of new condominiums has also accelerated this phenomenon in the city as they are centers with an expensive level of rental. As for San Pedro Sula, this phenomenon is seen more in the Los Andes neighborhood has been accommodated for this kind of travelers.\nSouth Africa.\nGentrification in South Africa has been categorized into two waves for two different periods of time. Visser and Kotze find that the first wave occurred in the 1980s to the Post-Apartheid period, the second wave occurred during and after the 2000s. Both of these trends of gentrification has been analyzed and reviewed by scholars in different lenses. One view which Atkinson uses is that gentrification is purely the reflection of middle-class values on to a working-class neighborhood. The second view is the wider view is suggested by Visser and Kotze which views gentrification with inclusions of rural locations, infill housing, and luxury residency development. While Kotze and Visser find that gentrification has been under a provocative lens by media all over the world, South Africa's gentrification process was harder to identify because of the need to differentiate between gentrification and the change of conditions from the end of Apartheid.\nFurthermore, the authors note that the pre-conditions for gentrification where events like tertiary decentralization (suburbanization of the service industry) and capital flight (disinvestment) were occurring, which caused scholars to ignore the subject of gentrification due to the normality of the process. Additionally, Kotze and Visser found that as state-run programs and private redevelopment programs began to focus on the pursuit of \"global competitiveness\" and well-rounded prosperity, it hid the underlying foundations of gentrification under the guise of redevelopment. As a result, the effect is similar to what Teppo and Millstein coins as the pursuit to moralize the narrative to legitimize the benefit to all people. This concurrently created an effect where Visser and Kotze conclude that the perceived gentrification was only the fact that the target market was people commonly associated with gentrification. As Visser and Kotze states, \"It appears as if apartheid red-lining on racial grounds has been replaced by a financially exclusive property market that entrenches prosperity and privilege.\"\nGenerally, Atkinson observes that when looking at scholarly discourse for the gentrification and rapid urbanization of South Africa, the main focus is not on the smaller towns of South Africa. This is a large issue because small towns are magnets for poorer people and repellants for skilled people. In one study, Atkinson dives into research in a small town, Aberdeen in the East Cape. Also as previously mentioned, Atkinson finds that this area has shown signs of gentrification. This is due to redevelopment which indicates clearly the reflection of middle-class values. In this urbanization of the area, Atkinson finds that there is clear dependence on state-programs which leads to further development and growth of the area, this multiplier of the economy would present a benefit of gentrification. The author then attributes the positive growth with the benefits in gentrification by examining the increase in housing opportunities.\nThen, by surveying the recent newcomers to the area, Atkinson's research found that there is confidence for local economic growth which further indicated shifts to middle-class values, therefore, gentrification. This research also demonstrated growth in \"modernizers\" which demonstrate the general belief of gentrification where there is value for architectural heritage as well as urban development. Lastly, Atkinson's study found that the gentrification effects of growth can be accredited to the increase in unique or scarce skills to the municipality which revived interest in the growth of the local area. This gentrification of the area would then negative impact the poorer demographics where the increase in housing would displace and exclude them from receiving benefits. In conclusion, after studying the small town of Aberdeen, Atkinson finds that \"Paradoxically, it is possible that gentrification could promote economic growth and employment while simultaneously increasing class inequality.\"\nHistorically, Garside notes that due to the Apartheid, the inner cities of Cape Town was cleared of non-white communities. But because of the Group Areas Act, some certain locations were controlled for such communities. Specifically, Woodstock has been a racially mixed community with a compilation of European settlers (such as the Afrikaners and the 1820 Settlers), Eastern European Jews, immigrants from Angola and Mozambique, and the coloured Capetonians. For generations, these groups lived in this area characterizing it be a working-class neighborhood. But as the times changed and restrictions were relaxed, Teppo and Millstein observes that the community became more and more \"gray\" as in a combination between white and mixed communities.\nThen this progression continues to which Garside finds that an exaggeration as more middle-income groups moved into the area. This emigration resulted in a distinct split between Upper Woodstock and Lower Woodstock. Coupled with the emergence of a strong middle-class in South Africa, Woodstock became a destination for convenience and growth. While Upper Woodstock was a predominantly white area, Lower Woodstock then received the attention of the mixed middle-income community. This increase in demand for housing gave landlords incentives to raise prices to profit off of the growing wealth in the area. The 400\u2013500% surge in the housing market for Woodstock thus displaced and excluded the working-class and retired who previously resided in the community. Furthermore, Garside states that the progression of gentrification was accentuated by the fact that most of the previous residents would only be renting their living space. Both Teppo and Millstein would find that this displacement of large swaths of communities would increase demand in other areas of Woodstock or inner city slums.\nThe \"Bo-Kaap\" pocket of Cape Town nestles against the slopes of Signal Hill. It has traditionally been occupied by members of South Africa's minority, mainly Muslim, Cape Malay community. These descendants of artisans and political captives, brought to the Cape as early as the 18th century as slaves and indentured workers, were housed in small barrack-like abodes on what used to be the outskirts of town. As the city limits increased, property in the Bo-Kaap became very sought after, not only for its location but also for its picturesque cobble-streets and narrow avenues. Increasingly, this close-knit community is \"facing a slow dissolution of its distinctive character as wealthy outsiders move into the suburb to snap up homes in the City Bowl at cut-rate prices\". Inter-community conflict has also arisen as some residents object to the sale of buildings and the resultant eviction of long-term residents.\nIn another specific case, Millstein and Teppo discovered that working-class residents would become embattled with their landlords. On Gympie Street, which has been labeled as the most dangerous street in Cape Town, it was home to many of the working-class. But as gentrification occurred, landlords brought along tactics to evict low-paying tenants through non-payment clauses. One landlord who bought a building cheaply from an auction, immediately raised the rental price which would then proceed to court for evictions. But, the tenants were able to group together to make a strong case to win. Regardless of the outcome, the landlord resorted to turning off both power and water in the building. The tenants then were exhausted out of motivation to fight. One tenant described it as similar to living in a shack which would be the future living space one displaced. Closing, the Teppo and Millstein's research established that gentrification's progress for urban development would coincide with a large displacement of the poorer communities which also excluded them from any benefits to gentrification. The authors state, \"The end results are the same in both cases: in the aftermath of the South African negotiated revolution, the elite colonize the urban areas from those who are less privileged, claiming the city for themselves.\"\nItaly.\nIn Italy, similarly to other countries around the world, the phenomenon of gentrification is proceeding in the largest cities, such as Milan, Turin, Genoa and Rome.\nIn Milan, gentrification is changing the look of some semi-central neighborhoods, just outside the inner ring road (called \"Cerchia dei Bastioni\"), particularly of former working class and industrial areas.\nOne of the most well known cases is the neighborhood of Isola. Despite its position, this area has been for a long time considered as a suburb since it has been an isolated part of the city, due to the physical barriers such as the railways and the Naviglio Martesana. In the 1950s, a new business district was built not far from this area, but Isola remained a distant and low-class area. In the 2000s vigorous efforts to make Isola as a symbolic place of the Milan of the future were carried out and, with this aim, the Porta Garibaldi-Isola districts became attractors for stylists and artists. Moreover, in the second half of the same decade, a massive urban rebranding project, known as Progetto Porta Nuova, started and the neighbourhood of Isola, despite the compliances residents have had, has been one of the regenerated areas, with the Bosco Verticale and the new Giardini di Porta Nuova.\nAnother semi-central district that has undergone this phenomenon in Milan is Zona Tortona. Former industrial area situated behind Porta Genova station, Zona Tortona is nowadays the Mecca of Italian design and annually hosts some of the most important events of the Milan Design Week during which more than 150 expositors, such as Superstudio, take part. In Zona Tortona, some of important landmarks, related to culture, design and arts, are located such as Fondazione Pomodoro, the Armani/Silos, Spazio A and MUDEC.\nGoing towards the outskirts of the city, other gentrified areas of Milan are Lambrate-Ventura (where others events of the Milan Design Week are hosted), Bicocca and Bovisa (in which universities have contributed to the gentrification of the areas), Sesto San Giovanni, Via Sammartini, and the so-called NoLo district (which means \"Nord di Loreto\").\nPoland.\nIn Poland, gentrification is proceeding mostly in the big cities like Warsaw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Krak\u00f3w, Metropolis GZM, Pozna\u0144, and Wroc\u0142aw. The reason of this is both de-industrialisation and poor condition of some residential areas.\nThe biggest European ongoing gentrification process has been occurring in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a from the beginning of the 2010s. Huge unemployment (24% in the 1990s) caused by the downfall of the garment industry created both economic and social problems. Moreover, vast majority of industrial and housing facilities had been constructed in the late 19th century and the renovation was neglected after World War II. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a authorities rebuilt the industrial district into the New City Center. This included re-purposing buildings including the former electrical power and heating station into the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna railway station and the EC1 Science Museum.\nThere are other significant gentrifications in Poland, such as:\nNowadays the Polish government has started National Revitalization Plan which ensures financial support to municipal gentrification programs.\nRussia.\nCentral Moscow rapidly gentrified following the change from the communist central-planning policies of the Soviet era to the market economy of the post-Soviet Russian government.\nUnited States.\nFrom a market standpoint, there are two main requirements that are met by the U.S. cities that undergo substantial effects of gentrification. These are: an excess supply of deteriorated housing in central areas, as well as a considerable growth in the availability of professional jobs located in central business districts. These conditions have been met in the U.S. largely as a result of suburbanization and other postindustrial phenomena. There have been three chronological waves of gentrification in the U.S. starting from the 1960s.\nThe first wave came in the 1960s and early 1970s, led by governments trying to reduce the disinvestment that was taking place in inner-city urban areas. Additionally, starting in the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. industry has created a surplus of housing units as construction of new homes has far surpassed the rate of national household growth. However, the market forces that are dictated by an excess supply cannot fully explain the geographical specificity of gentrification in the U.S., for there are many large cities that meet this requirement and have not exhibited gentrification.\nThe missing link is another factor that can be explained by particular, necessary demand forces. In U.S. cities in the time period from 1970 to 1978, growth of the central business district at around 20% did not dictate conditions for gentrification, while growth at or above 33% yielded appreciably larger gentrification activity. Central business district growth will activate gentrification in the presence of a surplus in the inner city housing market. The 1970s brought the more \"widespread\" second wave of gentrification, and was sometimes linked to the development of artist communities like SoHo in New York.\nIn the U.S., the conditions for gentrification were generated by the economic transition from manufacturing to post-industrial service economies. The post-World War II economy experienced a service revolution, which created white-collar jobs and larger opportunities for women in the work force, as well as an expansion in the importance of centralized administrative and cooperate activities. This increased the demand for inner city residences, which were readily available cheaply after much of the movement towards central city abandonment of the 1950s. The coupling of these movements is what became the trigger for the expansive gentrification of U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.\nThe third wave of gentrification occurred in most major cities in the late 1990s and was driven by large-scale developments, public-private partnerships, and government policies. Measurement of the rate of gentrification during the period from 1990 to 2010 in 50 U.S. cities showed an increase in the rate of gentrification from 9% in the decade of the 1990s to 20% in the decade from 2000 to 2010 with 8% of the urban neighborhoods in the 50 cities being affected.\nCities with a rate of gentrification of \u224840% or more in the decade from 2000 to 2010 included:\nCities with a rate of less than 10% in the decade from 2000 to 2010 included:\nAnti-gentrification protests.\nBenezet Court, Inc. (Philadelphia, PA).\nSociety Hill, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Philadelphia, PA, was designated for urban renewal in the late 1950s. This urban renewal called for renovations of buildings that were home to families of color. While it was initially promised that the families would not have to leave by the OHA (Octavia Hill Association), they were later evicted and it was determined that it would not be possible to renovate these buildings while keeping the price of rent low. An African American woman named Dorothy Miller (n\u00e9e Stroud) became the face of the Octavia Hill Seven, a moniker given to the seven households who resisted the relocation. Philip Price Jr. was a lawyer who joined Miller in the fight for affordable housing. With his leadership, several residents formed an SHCA committee and subsequently a nonprofit organization to consider options for rehabilitation or new construction for Miller and her neighbors. They named their organization Benezet Court, Inc., after an early abolitionist in Philadelphia. Eventually, the organization was able to achieve affordable housing options in the neighborhood.\nMovement for Justice in El Barrio.\nThe Movement for Justice in El Barrio is an immigrant-led, organized group of tenants who resist against gentrification in East Harlem, New York. This movement has 954 members and 95 building communities. On 8 April 2006, the MJB gathered people to protest in the New York City Hall against an investment bank in the United Kingdom that purchased 47 buildings and 1,137 homes in East Harlem. News of these protests reached England, Scotland, France and Spain. MJB made a call to action that everyone, internationally, should fight against gentrification. This movement gained international traction and also became known as the International Campaign Against Gentrification in El Barrio.\nCereal Killer Cafe protest.\nOn 26 September 2015, a cereal cafe in East London called Cereal Killer Cafe was attacked by a large group of anti-gentrification protestors. These protestors carried with them a pig's head and torches, stating that they were tired of unaffordable luxury flats going into their neighborhoods. These protestors were alleged to be primarily \"middle-class academics\", who were upset by the lack of community and culture that they once saw in East London. People targeted Cereal Killer Cafe during their protest because of an alleged article in which one of the brothers with ownership of the cafe had said marking up prices was necessary as a business in the area. After the attack on the cafe, users on Twitter were upset that protestors had targeted a small business as the focus of their demonstration, as opposed to a larger one.\nSan Francisco tech bus protests.\nThe San Francisco tech bus protests occurred in late 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States, protesting against tech shuttle buses that take employees to and from their homes in the Bay Area to workplaces in Silicon Valley. Protestors said the buses were symbolic of the gentrification occurring in the city, rising rent prices, and the displacement of small businesses. This protest gained global attention and also inspired anti-gentrification movements in East London.\nink! Coffee Protest (Denver, Colorado).\nOn 22 November 2017, ink! Coffee, a small coffee shop, placed a manufactured metal Sandwich board sign on the sidewalk outside one of their Denver locations in the historic Five Points, Denver neighborhood. The sign said \"Happily gentrifying the neighborhood since 2014\" on one side and \"Nothing says gentrification like being able to order a cortado\" on the other side.\nInk's ad ignited outrage and garnered national attention when a picture of the sign was shared on social media by a prominent Denver writer, Ru Johnson. The picture of the sign quickly went viral accumulating critical comments and negative reviews. Ink! responded to the social media outrage with a public apology followed by a lengthier apology from its founder, Keith Herbert. Ink's public apology deemed the sign a bad joke causing even more outrage on social media. The ad design was created by a Five Points, Denver firm named Cultivator Advertising &amp; Design. The advertising firm responded to the public's dismay by issuing an ill-received social media apology, \"An Open Letter to Our Neighbors\".\nThe night following the debut of ink's controversial ad campaign their Five Points, Denver location was vandalized. A window was broken and the words \"WHITE COFFEE\" among others were spray-painted onto the front of the building. Protest organizers gathered at the coffee shop daily following the controversy. The coffee shop was closed for business the entire holiday weekend following the scandal.\nAt least 200 people attended a protest and boycott event on 25 November 2017 outside of ink!'s Five Points location. News of the controversy was covered by media outlets worldwide.\nHamilton Locke Street Vandalism.\nOn 3 March 2018, an anarchist group vandalized coffee shops, luxury automobiles, and restaurants on Locke Street in Hamilton, Ontario. The attack was linked to an anarchist group in the city known as The Tower, that aimed to highlight issues of gentrification in Hamilton through vandalizing new businesses. On 7 March, The Tower's free community library was vandalized by what the group referred to as \"far-right goons\". Investigation followed, with arrests related to the Locke Street vandalism being made by Hamilton police in April and June 2018.\nCondesa and Roma violent clashes (Mexico City, 4\u20135 July, 2025).\nOn 4 and 5 July 2025 Protests break out in Mexico City denouncing gentrification and rent increases. Many Mexican locals accuse American residents of increasing rent value to that about three times than what a local Mexican could afford. Violent protests and clashes between protesters and tourists took place in Condesa and Roma districts.\nLitigation against gentrification.\nHwang discovers factors that can cause neighborhood changes: Households might be more attracted to a neighborhood because of (1) increases in access value, (2) increases in amenity value, or (3) decline in housing prices relative to other neighborhoods. These factors attract investors and eventually leads to gentrification.\nGentrification can promote neighborhood revitalization and desegregation. Because of this, a gentrification-as-integration model has been supported to stop population loss, and to rebuild low-income neighborhoods.\nGentrification has been called the savior of cities from urban crisis because it has led to urban revitalization, which promotes the economy of struggling cities.\nThe Fair Housing Act can be used as litigation against gentrification because the urban development process of higher-income individuals into lower-income neighborhoods leads to displacement.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is usually used to hold up a roof, creating a largely open space beneath, for whatever use the building is designed. The horizontal elements are called by a variety of names including lintel, header, architrave or beam, and the supporting vertical elements may be called posts, columns, or pillars. The use of wider elements at the top of the post, called capitals, to help spread the load, is common to many architectural traditions.\nLintels.\nIn architecture, a post-and-lintel or trabeated system refers to the use of horizontal stone beams or lintels which are borne by columns or posts. The name is from the Latin \"trabs\", \"beam\"; influenced by \"trabeatus\", clothed in the \"trabea\", a ritual garment.\nPost-and-lintel construction is one of four ancient structural methods of building, the others being the corbel, arch-and-vault, and truss.\nA noteworthy example of a trabeated system is in Volubilis, from the Roman era, where one side of the Decumanus Maximus is lined with trabeated elements, while the opposite side of the roadway is designed in arched style.\nHistory of lintel systems.\nThe trabeated system is a fundamental principle of Neolithic architecture, ancient Indian architecture, ancient Greek architecture and ancient Egyptian architecture. Other trabeated styles are the Persian, Lycian, Japanese, traditional Chinese, and ancient Chinese architecture, especially in northern China, and nearly all the Indian styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by Mayan architecture, and in South America by Inca architecture. In all or most of these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings. Timber framing, also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day.\nSpan limitations.\nThere are two main forces acting upon the post and lintel system: weight carrying compression at the joint between lintel and post, and tension induced by deformation of self-weight and the load above between the posts. The two posts are under compression from the weight of the lintel (or beam) above. The lintel will deform by sagging in the middle because the underside is under tension and the upper is under compression.\nThe biggest disadvantage to lintel construction is the limited weight that can be held up, and the resulting small distances required between the posts. Ancient Roman architecture's development of the arch allowed for much larger structures to be constructed. The arcuated system spreads larger loads more effectively, and replaced the post-and-lintel system in most larger buildings and structures, until the introduction of steel girder beams and steel-reinforced concrete in the industrial era.\nAs with the Roman temple portico front and its descendants in later classical architecture, trabeated features were often retained in parts of buildings as an aesthetic choice. The classical orders of Greek origin were in particular retained in buildings designed to impress, even though they usually had little or no structural role.\nLintel reinforcement.\nThe flexural strength of a stone lintel can be dramatically increased with the use of Post-tensioned stone.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "41953", "revid": "46030233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41953", "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody", "text": "1975 single by Queen\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, \"A Night at the Opera\" (1975). Written by Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury, the song is a six-minute suite, notable for its lack of a refraining chorus and consisting of several sections: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part, and a reflective coda. It is one of the few progressive rock songs of the 1970s to have proved accessible to a mainstream audience.\nMercury referred to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as a \"mock opera\" that resulted from the combination of three songs he had written. It was recorded by Queen and co-producer Roy Thomas Baker at five studios between August and September 1975. Due to recording logistics of the era, the band had to bounce the tracks across eight generations of 24-track tape, meaning that they required nearly 200 tracks for overdubs. The song parodies elements of opera with bombastic choruses, sarcastic recitative, and distorted Italian operatic phrases. Lyrical references include Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, and Beelzebub, with cries of \"\"Bismillah\"!\".\nAlthough critical reaction was initially mixed, retrospective reviews have acclaimed \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as one of the greatest songs of all time, and it is often regarded as the band's signature song. The promotional video is credited with furthering the development of the music video medium. It has appeared in numerous polls of the greatest songs in popular music, including a ranking at number 17 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2021 list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". A \"Rolling Stone\" readers' poll also ranked Mercury's vocal performance in the song as the greatest in rock history.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks (plus another five weeks following Mercury's death in 1991) and is the UK's third best-selling single of all time. It also topped the charts in countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and has sold over six million copies worldwide. In the United States, the song peaked at number nine in 1976, but reached a new peak of number two after appearing in the 1992 film \"Wayne's World\". In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Following the release of the 2018 biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", it became the most streamed song from the 20th century. In 2021, it was certified diamond in the US for combined digital sales/streams equal to 10 million units, and is one of the best selling songs of all time. In 2022, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nHistory and recording.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt was basically three songs that I wanted to put out, and I just put the three together.\n\u2014 Freddie Mercury\nAccording to Mercury's friend Chris Smith (a keyboard player in Smile), Mercury first started developing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in the late 1960s; Mercury used to play parts of songs he was writing at the time on the piano, and one of his pieces, known simply as \"The Cowboy Song\", contained lyrics that ended up in the completed version produced years later, in 1975, specifically, \"Mama ... just killed a man.\" Producer Roy Thomas Baker, who began working with Queen in 1972, related how Mercury once played the opening ballad section on the piano for him in Mercury's flat:\nHe played the beginning on the piano, then stopped and said, \"And this is where the opera section comes in!\" Then we went out to eat dinner.\nGuitarist Brian May said the band thought that Mercury's blueprint for the song was \"intriguing and original, and worthy of work\". According to May, much of Queen's material was written in the studio, but this song \"was all in Freddie's mind\" before they started.\nQueen spent a month rehearsing at Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey in mid-1975, and drummer Roger Taylor recalled that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was one of the songs the band worked on while they were there. Recording began on 24\u00a0August 1975 at Rockfield Studio 1 near Monmouth, South Wales, after a three-week rehearsal at Penrhos Court, near Kington, Herefordshire. During the making of the track, four additional studios \u2013 Roundhouse, Sarm Studios, Scorpio Sound, and Wessex Sound Studios \u2013 were used. According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.\nMercury used a C. Bechstein concert grand piano, which he played in the promotional video and the UK tour. Due to the elaborate nature of the song, it was recorded in various sections. The piano was allegedly the same one Paul McCartney had used to record the Beatles' song \"Hey Jude\", as well as the same one Rick Wakeman used on David Bowie's 1971 album \"Hunky Dory\".\nBaker recalled in 1999:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was totally insane, but we enjoyed every minute of it. It was basically a joke, but a successful joke. [laughs] We had to record it in three separate units. We did the whole beginning bit, then the whole middle bit and then the whole end. It was complete madness. The middle part started off being just a couple of seconds, but Freddie kept coming in with more \"Galileos\" and we kept on adding to the opera section, and it just got bigger and bigger. We never stopped laughing ... It started off as a ballad, but the end was heavy.\nMay, Mercury, and Taylor reportedly sang their vocal parts continually for 10 to 12\u00a0hours a day. The entire piece took three weeks to record, and in some sections featured 180 overdubs. In multiple interviews, May recalled how Mercury's vocal overdubs were so exquisitely precise that he would create a natural phasing effect.\nSince the studios of the time only offered 24-track analogue tape, it was necessary for the three to overdub themselves many times and \"bounce\" these down to successive sub-mixes. In the end, eighth-generation tapes were used. The various sections of tape containing the desired sub-mixes had to be spliced (cut and assembled in the correct sequence). May recalled placing a tape in front of the light and being able to see through it, as the tape had been used so many times.\nA similar story was told in 1977 by Taylor regarding the elaborate overdubs and sub-mixes for \"The March of The Black Queen\" for the album \"Queen II\". At that time, the band was using 16-track equipment.\nProducer Baker recalls that May's solo was done on only one track rather than recording multiple tracks. May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\". The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working, in which he thought of the tune before playing it: \"The fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.\" According to Baker,\n... the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with automation ... If you really listen to it, the ballad starts off clean, and as the opera section gets louder and louder, the vocals get more and more distorted. You can still hear this on the CD. They are clearly distorted.\nIn May 2023, an early handwritten draft unearthed from an auction of items that belonged to Mercury, courtesy of his friend Mary Austin, revealed that Mercury originally considered the song to be titled \"Mongolian Rhapsody\". It was explained that he wrote the title along with the lyrics in 1974 on a page of stationery from defunct airline British Midland Airways, but crossed out the word \"Mongolian\" and replaced it with \"Bohemian\". There is a 1962 Decca album of the same name, with music by Bohemian composers Bed\u0159ich Smetana and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.\nComposition and analysis.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" has been affiliated to the genres of progressive rock (sometimes called symphonic rock), hard rock,&lt;ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; art rock, and progressive pop. The song is highly unusual for a popular single in featuring no chorus, combining disparate musical styles, and containing lyrics which eschew conventional love-based narratives, and instead make allusions to murder and nihilism.\nMusic scholar Sheila Whiteley suggests that \"the title draws strongly on contemporary rock ideology, the individualism of the \"bohemian\" artists' world, with \"rhapsody\" affirming the romantic ideals of art rock\". Commenting on bohemianism, Judith Peraino said,\nMercury intended ... [this song] to be a 'mock opera', something outside the norm of rock songs, and it does follow a certain operatic logic: Choruses of multi-tracked voices alternate with aria-like solos, the emotions are excessive, the plot confusing.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" begins with an introduction, then goes into a piano ballad, before a guitar solo leads to an operatic interlude. A hard rock part follows this and it concludes with a coda. The song is in the keys of B\u266d major, E\u266d major, A major and F major, and is predominantly in meter. This musical format of writing a song as a suite with changes in style, tone, and tempo throughout was uncommon in most mainstream pop and rock music, but common in progressive rock, a genre which had reached its artistic and commercial zenith between 1970 and 1975 in the music of British bands such as Jethro Tull, Yes, Genesis, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Gentle Giant, Van der Graaf Generator, and Curved Air. The music of progressive rock was characterised by dramatic contrasts, frequent shifts in tempo and in rhythmic character from one section of a composition to the next. Bands from the genre blended rock with classical music, including its structural features, compositional practices, and instrumentation. Queen had embraced progressive rock as one of their many diverse influences.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" parodies many different elements of opera by using bombastic choruses, sarcastic recitative, and distorted Italian operatic phrases. An embryonic version of this style had already been used in Mercury's earlier compositions for the band's \"My Fairy King\" (1973) and \"The March of the Black Queen\" (1974).\nIntro (0:00\u20130:49).\nThe song begins with a close five-part harmony a cappella introduction in B\u266d\u00a0major\u2014as evidenced by the presence of a V\u2013I cadence (F7\u2013B\u266d) multi-track recordings of Mercury although the video has all four members lip-syncing this part. The lyrics question whether life is \"real\" or \"just fantasy caught in a landslide\" before concluding that there can be \"no escape from reality\". The section is nearly entirely in 4/4 time, with the exception of measure 3 (\"Caught in a landslide, no es\u2014\") switching to 5/4 time, then returning to 4/4 after.\nAfter 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, the song modulates briefly to E\u266d\u00a0major via another perfect cadence (B\u266d7\u2013E\u266d) and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in stereo, the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker and \"little low\" comes from the right, the other respective speaker plays the piano at the same time); chromatic side-slipping on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere. The end of this section is marked by the bass entrance and the cross-handed piano vamp in B\u266d.\nBallad (0:49\u20132:37).\nThe piano begins in B\u266d\u00a0major along with the entrance of John Deacon's bass guitar, marking the onset of this section. After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Throughout the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man\", with \"a gun against [the man's] head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\". In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E\u266d major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a bell tree during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\". This is where the guitar solo enters.\nGuitar solo (2:37\u20133:05).\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E\u266d\u00a0major) played and composed by Brian May. The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato A major quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\nOpera (3:05\u20134:07).\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and timpani. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury, and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a wall of sound, that starts down and goes all the way up\". The band used the bell effect for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"let me go\". Also, on \"let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\nLyrical references in this passage include Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, and Beelzebub, with cries of \"\"Bismillah\"! [Arabic: \"In the name of God!\"] We will not let you go!\", as rival factions fight over his soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", with others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning \u2013 very, very frightening [to him]\". In \"Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography\", Lesley-Ann Jones theorises that it is also a figurative representation of the four members: Mercury, May, Taylor, and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!\", on a block B\u266d major chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a falsetto B\u266d in the fifth octave (B\u266d5).\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish. Baker said, \"Every time Freddie came up with another \"Galileo\", I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\" Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.\nHard rock (4:07\u20134:54).\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a guitar riff written by Mercury. At 4:15, a quadruple-tracked Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B\u266d run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a \"ritardando\".\nOutro (4:54\u20135:55).\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B\u266d mixolydian mode (composed of the notes from the E\u266d scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E\u266d\u00a0major, before quickly modulating to C\u00a0minor, only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to C\u00a0minor again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah\". A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"Deacy Amp\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters\u00a0...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\". After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E\u266d\u00a0major, but then changes again to F\u00a0major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large tam-tam that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\nLyrics.\n\"The New York Times\" commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret. Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\" May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer. In a BBC Three documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it. I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them ... \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" didn't just come out of thin air. I did a bit of research although it was tongue-in-cheek and mock opera. Why not?\n\u2014 Freddie Mercury\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to Albert Camus's novel \"The Stranger\", in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. When the band released a \"Greatest Hits\" cassette in Iran, a leaflet in Persian was included with translation and explanations. In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like Faust, sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"Bismillah\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from Shaitan (the devil in Arabic).\nOther critics interpreted the lyrics as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues. Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in Mother Mary) and wanting to break away ('Mamma mia let me go')\". Others suggest it as a veiled reference to coming out, and dealing with the repercussions of the sodomy laws of the time. In addition, the song can be interpreted as coming from the perspective of a person on death row, reflecting on their life and preparing for their last moments.\nStill others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and had no intended meaning; the D.J., television entertainer, and comedian Kenny Everett, who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on Capital Radio, quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".\nRelease.\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that due to its length of 5\u00a0minutes and 55\u00a0seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit. Mercury commenting on the length of the song:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It had a very big risk factor. The radios didn't really like it initially because it was too long and the record companies said you can't market it that way, and after me having virtually put the three songs together, they wanted me to sort of slice it up again, so I said no way. They said nobody would play it, it's too long and I just said it either goes out in its entirety or not at all. So it was a big risk, it was either going to be a big flop because nobody would play it or something would happen and luckily it became a major hit.\nThe song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio. According to Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate assessment by playing the song for Everett:\n \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking\u00a0...\"\nThe plan worked \u2014 Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14\u00a0times in 2\u00a0days. Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released. The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the RKO General stations in the U.S., heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the U.S., which forced the hand of Queen's U.S. label, Elektra Records. In an interview with \"Sound on Sound\", Baker observed that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"\nEventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the B-side. Following Everett's escapade in October\u00a01975, Eric Hall, a record plugger, gave a copy to David \"Diddy\" Hamilton to play on his weekday Radio One show. Hall stated \"Monster, Monster! This could be a hit!\"\nThe song became the 1975 UK Christmas number one, holding the top position for nine weeks. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was the first song ever to get to number one in the UK twice with the same version, and is also the only single to have been Christmas number one twice with the same version. The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\") in 1991, following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks. The re-released version sold 673,000 copies in 1991 in the UK.\nIn the US, the single was also a success, although initially to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December\u00a01975, reached number nine on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of one million copies.\nIn a retrospective article, Anthony DeCurtis of \"Rolling Stone\" explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\". Its chart run of 24\u00a0weeks, however, placed it at number\u00a018 on \"Billboard\"'s year-end chart, higher than some number\u00a01s of the year. With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the \"RPM\" national singles chart for the week ending 1\u00a0May 1976.\nIn the US, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"The Show Must Go On\" in January\u00a01992, two months after the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the Magic Johnson Foundation for AIDS research. The song re-entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart after 16\u00a0years, reaching number two (behind Kris Kross's \"Jump\"), and spending 17\u00a0weeks on the chart. After the release of the Queen biopic named after the song, it re-entered the charts for a third time at number\u00a033, marking\u00a026 years since it last charted.\nIn March 2021 it was certified Diamond (10\u00d7 platinum) in the US for combined digital sales and streams equal to 10 million units. It had sold 4.4\u00a0million digital copies in the US as of \u00a02017[ [update]]. As of September 2025, it is the most-streamed song from the 20th century, with more than 2.8 billion plays on Spotify alone.\nPromotional video.\nThough some artists had made video clips to accompany songs (including Queen themselves; for example, their earlier singles \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"Liar\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" and \"Killer Queen\" already had \"pop promos\", as they were known at the time), it was only after the success of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" that it became a regular practice for record companies to produce promotional videos for artists' single releases. \"The Guardian\" stated it \"ensured videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music\". These videos could then be shown on television shows around the world, such as the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\", without the need for the artist to appear in person. A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals rather than dancers such as Pan's People. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on \"Top of the Pops\", since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song. He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at Dundee's Caird Hall on tour, a date which clashed with the programme, thus a promo would solve the issue. The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of Trident Studios, their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by Bruce Gowers, who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and assistant director/floor manager Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500. Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt became the first record to be pushed into the forefront by virtue of a video. Queen were certainly the first band to create a 'concept' video. The video captured the musical imagery perfectly. You cannot hear that music without seeing the visuals in your mind's eye.\n \u2014 Rock DJ Tommy Vance.\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members standing in diamond formation with their heads tilted back in near darkness as they sing the \"a cappella\" part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Mercury. The composition of the shot is the same as Mick Rock's cover photograph for their second album \"Queen II\". The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress Marlene Dietrich, was the band's favourite image of themselves. The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the \"Queen II\" standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the tam-tam in the manner of the trademark of the Rank Organisation's Gongman, familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed lines \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving visual feedback, a glare analogous to audio feedback. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on \"Top of the Pops\" in November 1975.\nCritical reception.\nAlthough the song has become one of the most revered in popular music history, the initial critical reaction was mixed. The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of \"NME\" observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does. They sound extremely self-important.\"\nAllan Jones of \"Melody Maker\" was unimpressed, describing the song as \"a superficially impressive pastiche of incongruous musical styles\" and that Queen \"contrived to approximate the demented fury of the Balham Amateur Operatic Society performing \"The Pirates of Penzance\"... 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that Pete Townshend used to tack on to the end of Who albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating. It's likely to be a hit of enormous proportions despite its length.\" Ray Fox-Cumming of \"Record Mirror\" was also left unmoved, saying, \"It has no immediate selling point whatsoever: among its many parts. there's scarcely a shred of a tune and certainly no one line to latch onto. There's no denying that it's devilishly clever, encompassing everything from bits of operatic harmonies to snatches that sound like Sparks and David Cassidy, but, in the end the whole adds up to less than the sum of its parts.\" He did, however, say that it was \"unthinkable\" that it wouldn't be a hit. The most positive review came from \"Sounds\", which called it \"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\". \"Cash Box\" called it \"a softly sung ode to the prospect of moving on from staid ways\" with \"good singing\" and \"good production.\" \"Record World\" called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"\nLegacy.\nMusical impact.\nIn 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\". Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately, Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975). Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".\nAddressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\". He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\". Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\". \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\" described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\". Writing for the BBC in 2015, the \"Chicago Tribune\"'s music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".\nIn 2009, \"The Guardian\"'s music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975. That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense. It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart. And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.\nA comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist. They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".\nIn 2015, \"The Economist\" described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\". It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"\n\"Wayne's World\".\nIn 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film \"Wayne's World\", in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the hard rock part near the end of the song. The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal. Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene. According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song. Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative ... forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\". Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.\nIn connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band. Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from \"Wayne's World\" with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band. He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\" He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them. The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\" This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"\nThe \"Wayne's World\" video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\". When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\" In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"One Vision\" video.\nIn the 2018 Queen biopic feature film \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in \"Wayne's World\".\nAchievements and accolades.\nThe song has won numerous awards and has been covered and parodied by many artists. At the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1977, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices. In October 1977, only two years after its release, the British Phonographic Industry named \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as the best British single of the period 1952\u201377. It is a regular entry in greatest-songs polls, and it was named by the Guinness Book of Records in 2002 as the top British single of all time. The song is also listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\nIn 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. As of 2004[ [update]], \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is the second most-played song on British radio, in clubs and on jukeboxes collectively, after Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\". On 30 September 2007 for BBC Radio 1's 40th birthday, it was revealed on \"The Radio 1 Chart Show\" that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" had been the most played song since Radio 1's launch.\nIn December 2018, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" officially became the most-streamed song from the 20th century, surpassing Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and Guns N' Roses' \"Sweet Child o' Mine\". \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" also became the most-streamed classic rock song of all time. The number of downloads of the song and original video exceeded 1.6 billion downloads across global on-demand streaming services. The video surpassed one billion views on YouTube in July 2019, making it the oldest music video to reach one billion on the platform, and the first pre-1990s song to reach that figure.\nIn 2022, the single was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPolls.\nIn a 2001 poll of more than 50,000 readers of \"The Observer\" newspaper and viewers of British TV's Channel 4 for the 100 best number-one singles of all time, the song came second to John Lennon's \"Imagine\". In a 2002 poll of more than 31,000 people conducted for Guinness World Records' \"British Hit Singles\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was voted Britain's favourite single, beating Lennon's \"Imagine\" to the top spot. In 2002, it came in 10th in a BBC World Service poll to find the world's favourite song.\nIn the Netherlands, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" has been in the top five of the annual year's end \"Top 100 Aller Tijden\" (\"All-Time Top 100 [Singles]\") since 1977, topping the list eight times, more than any other artists. Since 1999, the Dutch \"Top 2000\" pop music poll supplanted the Top-100, to list and play the 2,000 all-time greatest songs annually in December, and the song has been ranked first in all but five years (2005, 2010, 2014, 2015 and 2020, when it was runner up).\nIn a 2012 readers poll conducted by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was voted the best vocal performance in rock history. In 2010, the song ranked at 166 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list, and was re-ranked at number 17 in 2021.\nIn 2012, the song topped an ITV poll in the UK to find \"The Nation's Favourite Number One\" over 60 years of music, ahead of Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" (number two), Adele's \"Someone like You\" (number three), Oasis' \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (number four) and The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" (number five). The song was also ranked number five in RadioMafia's list of \"Top 500 Songs\".\nCover versions.\nOver two dozen artists have recorded or performed cover versions of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", including charted single releases by:\nA video cover featuring The Muppets also went viral and was subsequently released as a single in late 2009, peaking at number 32 in the UK.\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's 1993 album \"Alapalooza\" includes a version of the song entitled \"Bohemian Polka\", which is a rearrangement of the entire song as a polka.\n40th anniversary.\nTo mark the 40th anniversary of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the song was released on a limited edition 12\" vinyl with the original B-side \"I'm In Love With My Car\" on 27 November 2015 for Record Store Day 2015. Queen also released \"A Night At The Odeon, Live At Hammersmith 75\", on CD, DVD-Video and Blu-ray. This includes the first live \"professionally\" recorded performance of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". However, the first recording and live performance of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was the performance on 14 November 1975 in Liverpool.\nAuction.\nFrom 4 August to 5 September 2023, the Freddie Mercury: A World of His Own exhibition was held at Sotheby's in New Bond Street, London where almost 1,500 items of Mercury's went on display before being sold across six auctions. His Yamaha baby grand piano, which he used to compose \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", sold for \u00a31.7 million, while his handwritten lyrics for the song went for \u00a31.38 million. A silver snake bangle worn by Mercury in the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" music video was sold for \u00a3698,500.\nZulu translation.\nIn 2025, a translation of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" into Zulu language was authorized by surviving members of Queen and the Mercury Phoenix Trust. The Zulu version is performed by the Ndlovu Youth Choir under artistic director Ralf Schmitt, and combines \"isicathamiya\" (an \"a capella\" style) with \"kwassa kwassa\" (a type of music and dance from the Democratic Republic of Congo).\n50th Anniversary.\nOn 13 September 2025 Brian May and Roger Taylor performed at the Last Night of the Proms, joining the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, BBC Singers and National Youth Choir for a new orchestral arrangement of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", by Stuart Morley, marking the 50th anniversary of the song.\nLive performances.\nThe \"a cappella\" opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's \"a cappella\" opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice\u2014this combination features in their 1979 live album \"Live Killers\". During their 1982 Hot Space Tour, and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word, and start playing the ballad section. At Live Aid where \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was their opening song, Mercury commenced with the ballad section.\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"Killer Queen\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\". As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke-filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\nStarting with the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of pyrotechnics after Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with Elton John singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, Axl Rose singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by Queen + Paul Rodgers throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury. Footage from the \"Live at Wembley '86\" was used for the 2005\u201306 tour, and the 1981 Montreal performance used for the Rock the Cosmos Tour. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience. Commenting upon this staging, Brian May says that they \"had to rise to the challenge of getting Freddie in there in a way which gave him his rightful place, but without demeaning Paul in any way. It also kept us live and 'present', although conscious and proud of our past, as we logically should be.\"\nSince 2012, May and Taylor have toured with former \"American Idol\" contestant Adam Lambert under the name Queen + Adam Lambert (following two one-off performances together in 2009 and 2011), with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" regularly included at the end of their set.\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nQueen comments on the song.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I always wanted to do something operatic. I wanted something with a mood setter at the start, going into a rock type of thing which completely breaks off into an opera section, a vicious twist and then returns to the theme. I don't really know anything about opera myself. Just certain pieces. I wanted to create what I thought Queen could do. It's not authentic... certainly not. It's no sort of pinch out of Magic Flute. It was as far as my limited capacity could take me.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'm going to shatter some illusions, it was just one of those pieces I wrote for the album: just writing my batch of songs. In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"The Prophet's Song\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When we finished the album, the \"Night at the Opera\" album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done.

In general, it depends upon the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage. \nImpedance extends the concept of resistance to alternating current (AC) circuits, and possesses both magnitude and phase, unlike resistance, which has only magnitude. \nImpedance can be represented as a complex number, with the same units as resistance, for which the SI unit is the ohm (\u03a9).\nIts symbol is usually \"Z\", and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the polar form |\"Z\"|\"\u2220\u03b8\". However, Cartesian complex number representation is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes.\nThe notion of impedance is useful for performing AC analysis of electrical networks, because it allows relating sinusoidal voltages and currents by a simple linear law. \nIn multiple port networks, the two-terminal definition of impedance is inadequate, but the complex voltages at the ports and the currents flowing through them are still linearly related by the impedance matrix. \nThe reciprocal of impedance is admittance, whose SI unit is the siemens.\nInstruments used to measure the electrical impedance are called impedance analyzers.\nHistory.\nPerhaps the earliest use of complex numbers in circuit analysis was by Johann Victor Wietlisbach in 1879 in analysing the Maxwell bridge. Wietlisbach avoided using differential equations by expressing AC currents and voltages as exponential functions with imaginary exponents (see ). Wietlisbach found the required voltage was given by multiplying the current by a complex number (impedance), although he did not identify this as a general parameter in its own right.\nThe term \"impedance\" was coined by Oliver Heaviside in July 1886. Heaviside recognised that the \"resistance operator\" (impedance) in his operational calculus was a complex number. In 1887 he showed that there was an AC equivalent to Ohm's law.\nArthur Kennelly published an influential paper on impedance in 1893. Kennelly arrived at a complex number representation in a rather more direct way than using imaginary exponential functions. Kennelly followed the graphical representation of impedance (showing resistance, reactance, and impedance as the lengths of the sides of a right angle triangle) developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1889. Impedances could thus be added vectorially. Kennelly realised that this graphical representation of impedance was directly analogous to graphical representation of complex numbers (Argand diagram). Problems in impedance calculation could thus be approached algebraically with a complex number representation. Later that same year, Kennelly's work was generalised to all AC circuits by Charles Proteus Steinmetz. Steinmetz not only represented impedances by complex numbers but also voltages and currents. Unlike Kennelly, Steinmetz was thus able to express AC equivalents of DC laws such as Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. Steinmetz's work was highly influential in spreading the technique amongst engineers.\nIntroduction.\nIn addition to resistance as seen in DC circuits, impedance in AC circuits includes the effects of the induction of voltages in conductors by the magnetic fields (inductance), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors (capacitance). The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as reactance and forms the imaginary part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the real part.\nComplex impedance.\nThe impedance of a two-terminal circuit element is represented as a complex quantity formula_1. The polar form conveniently captures both magnitude and phase characteristics as\nformula_2\nwhere the magnitude formula_3 represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, while the argument formula_4 (commonly given the symbol formula_5) gives the phase difference between voltage and current. In electrical engineering, the letter formula_6 is used for electric current, so the imaginary unit is instead represented by the letter formula_7.21\nIn Cartesian form, impedance is defined as\nformula_8\nwhere the real part of impedance is the resistance R and the imaginary part is the reactance X.\nWhere it is needed to add or subtract impedances, the cartesian form is more convenient; but when quantities are multiplied or divided, the calculation becomes simpler if the polar form is used. A circuit calculation, such as finding the total impedance of two impedances in parallel, may require conversion between forms several times during the calculation. Conversion between the forms follows the normal conversion rules of complex numbers.\nComplex voltage and current.\nTo simplify calculations, sinusoidal voltage and current waves are commonly represented as complex-valued functions of time denoted as formula_9 and formula_10.\nformula_11\nThe impedance of a bipolar circuit is defined as the ratio of these quantities:\nformula_12\nHence, denoting formula_13, we have\nformula_14\nThe magnitude equation is the familiar Ohm's law applied to the voltage and current amplitudes, while the second equation defines the phase relationship.\nValidity of complex representation.\nThis representation using complex exponentials may be justified by noting that (by Euler's formula):\nformula_15\nThe real-valued sinusoidal function representing either voltage or current may be broken into two complex-valued functions. By the principle of superposition, we may analyse the behaviour of the sinusoid on the left-hand side by analysing the behaviour of the two complex terms on the right-hand side. Given the symmetry, we only need to perform the analysis for one right-hand term. The results are identical for the other. At the end of any calculation, we may return to real-valued sinusoids by further noting that\nformula_16\nOhm's law.\nThe meaning of electrical impedance can be understood by substituting it into Ohm's law. Assuming a two-terminal circuit element with impedance formula_1 is driven by a sinusoidal voltage or current as above, there holds \nformula_18\nThe magnitude of the impedance formula_3 acts just like resistance, giving the drop in voltage amplitude across an impedance formula_1 for a given current formula_10. The phase factor tells us that the current lags the voltage by a phase formula_22 (i.e., in the time domain, the current signal is shifted formula_23 later with respect to the voltage signal).\nJust as impedance extends Ohm's law to cover AC circuits, other results from DC circuit analysis, such as voltage division, current division, Th\u00e9venin's theorem and Norton's theorem, can also be extended to AC circuits by replacing resistance with impedance.\nPhasors.\nA phasor is represented by a constant complex number, usually expressed in exponential form, representing the complex amplitude (magnitude and phase) of a sinusoidal function of time. Phasors are used by electrical engineers to simplify computations involving sinusoids (such as in AC circuits53), where they can often reduce a differential equation problem to an algebraic one.\nThe impedance of a circuit element can be defined as the ratio of the phasor voltage across the element to the phasor current through the element, as determined by the relative amplitudes and phases of the voltage and current. This is identical to the definition from Ohm's law given above, recognising that the factors of formula_24 cancel.\nDevice examples.\nResistor.\nThe impedance of an ideal resistor is purely real and is called \"resistive impedance\":\nformula_25\nIn this case, the voltage and current waveforms are proportional and in phase.\nInductor and capacitor (in the steady state).\nIdeal inductors and capacitors have a purely imaginary \"reactive impedance\":\nthe impedance of inductors increases as frequency increases;\nformula_26\nthe impedance of capacitors decreases as frequency increases;\nformula_27\nIn both cases, for an applied sinusoidal voltage, the resulting current is also sinusoidal, but in quadrature, 90 degrees out of phase with the voltage. However, the phases have opposite signs: in an inductor, the current is \"lagging\"; in a capacitor the current is \"leading\".\nNote the following identities for the imaginary unit and its reciprocal:\nformula_28\nThus the inductor and capacitor impedance equations can be rewritten in polar form:\nformula_29\nThe magnitude gives the change in voltage amplitude for a given current amplitude through the impedance, while the exponential factors give the phase relationship.\nDeriving the device-specific impedances.\nWhat follows below is a derivation of impedance for each of the three basic circuit elements: the resistor, the capacitor, and the inductor. Although the idea can be extended to define the relationship between the voltage and current of any arbitrary signal, these derivations assume sinusoidal signals. In fact, this applies to any arbitrary periodic signals, because these can be approximated as a sum of sinusoids through Fourier analysis.\nResistor.\nFor a resistor, there is the relation\nformula_30\nwhich is Ohm's law.\nConsidering the voltage signal to be\nformula_31\nit follows that\nformula_32\nThis says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to alternating current (AC) amplitude across a resistor is formula_33, and that the AC voltage leads the current across a resistor by 0 degrees.\nThis result is commonly expressed as\nformula_34\nCapacitor (in the steady state).\nFor a capacitor, there is the relation:\nformula_35\nConsidering the voltage signal to be\nformula_36\nit follows that\nformula_37\nand thus, as previously,\nformula_38\nConversely, if the current through the circuit is assumed to be sinusoidal, its complex representation being \nformula_39\nthen integrating the differential equation \nformula_35\nleads to \nformula_41\nThe \"Const\" term represents a fixed potential bias superimposed to the AC sinusoidal potential, that plays no role in AC analysis. For this purpose, this term can be assumed to be 0, hence again the impedance \nformula_42\nInductor (in the steady state).\nFor the inductor, we have the relation (from Faraday's law):\nformula_43\nThis time, considering the current signal to be:\nformula_44\nit follows that:\nformula_45\nThis result is commonly expressed in polar form as\nformula_46\nor, using Euler's formula, as\nformula_47\nAs in the case of capacitors, it is also possible to derive this formula directly from the complex representations of the voltages and currents, or by assuming a sinusoidal voltage between the two poles of the inductor. In the latter case, integrating the differential equation above leads to a constant term for the current, that represents a fixed DC bias flowing through the inductor. This is set to zero because AC analysis using frequency domain impedance considers one frequency at a time and DC represents a separate frequency of zero hertz in this context.\nGeneralised s-plane impedance.\nThe impedance of capacitors and inductors were defined above in terms of \"formula_48\", but this simplification can strictly be applied only to circuits that are driven with steady state AC and DC signals, a condition called the \"steady state\". The mere act of turning a signal source ON or OFF violates this steady state condition. To allow evaluation of the transient response in addition to the steady state of a circuit, the concept of impedance can be extended to a circuit energised with any arbitrary signal by using complex frequency formula_49 instead of just formula_48. Signals are expressed in terms of complex frequency by taking the Laplace transform of the time domain expression of the signal. The impedance of the basic circuit elements in this more general notation is as follows:\nFor a steady state signal, formula_51 simplifies to formula_48. This further simplifies to formula_53 for a DC-only circuit, in which case every inductor will behave as a short circuit and every capacitor will behave as an open circuit.\nFormal derivation.\nThe impedance formula_1 of an electrical component is defined as the ratio between the Laplace transforms of the voltage over it and the current through it, i.e.\nformula_55\nwhere formula_56 is the complex Laplace parameter.\nInductor.\nUsing the current\u2013voltage relationship of an inductor formula_57, the Laplace transform of its voltage is:\nformula_58\nRearranging so that formula_59 is divided by formula_60 provides the inductor's impedance: formula_61.\nCapacitor.\nUsing the current\u2013voltage relationship of a capacitor formula_62, the Laplace transform of its current is:\nformula_63\nRearranging so that formula_59 is divided by formula_60 provides the capacitor's impedance: formula_66.\nRelation to phasors.\nIn the phasor regime (steady state, meaning all signals are represented mathematically as simple complex exponentials formula_67 and formula_68 oscillating at a common frequency formula_69), impedance can simply be calculated as the voltage-to-current ratio, in which the common time-dependent factor cancels out:\nformula_70\nThe phasor domain is sometimes dubbed the frequency domain, although it lacks one of the dimensions of the Laplace parameter. For steady-state, the polar form of the complex impedance relates the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current. In particular:\nThese two relationships hold even after taking the real part of the complex exponentials (see phasors), which is the part of the signal one actually measures in real-life circuits.\nResistance vs reactance.\nResistance and reactance together determine the magnitude and phase of the impedance through the following relations:\nformula_71\nIn many applications, the relative phase of the voltage and current is not critical so only the magnitude of the impedance is significant.\nResistance.\nResistance formula_33 is the real part of impedance; a device with a purely resistive impedance exhibits no phase shift between the voltage and current.\nformula_73\nReactance.\nReactance formula_74 is the imaginary part of the impedance; a component with a finite reactance induces a phase shift formula_75 between the voltage across it and the current through it.\nformula_76\nA purely reactive component is distinguished by the sinusoidal voltage across the component being in quadrature with the sinusoidal current through the component. This implies that the component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure reactance does not dissipate any power.\nCapacitive reactance.\nA capacitor has a purely reactive impedance that is inversely proportional to the signal frequency. A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator, also known as a dielectric.\nformula_77\nThe minus sign indicates that the imaginary part of the impedance is negative.\nAt low frequencies, a capacitor approaches an open circuit so no current flows through it.\nA DC voltage applied across a capacitor causes charge to accumulate on one side; the electric field due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the potential associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.\nDriven by an AC supply, a capacitor accumulates only a limited charge before the potential difference changes sign and the charge dissipates. The higher the frequency, the less charge accumulates and the smaller the opposition to the current.\nInductive reactance.\nInductive reactance formula_78 is proportional to the signal frequency formula_79 and the inductance formula_80.\nformula_81\nAn inductor consists of a coiled conductor. Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction gives the back emf formula_82 (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of magnetic flux density formula_83 through a current loop.\nformula_84\nOr explicitly in real and imaginary terms:\nformula_85\nParallel combination.\nFor components connected in parallel, the voltage across each circuit element is the same; the ratio of currents through any two elements is the inverse ratio of their impedances.\nHence the inverse total impedance is the sum of the inverses of the component impedances:\nformula_86\nor, when n = 2:\nformula_87\nformula_88\nThe equivalent impedance formula_89 can be calculated in terms of the equivalent series resistance formula_90 and reactance formula_91.\nformula_92\nMeasurement.\nThe measurement of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in radio technology and other fields. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a radio antenna, the standing wave ratio or reflection coefficient may be more useful than the impedance alone. The measurement of impedance requires the measurement of the magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by \"bridge\" methods, similar to the direct-current Wheatstone bridge; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test. Impedance measurement in power electronic devices may require simultaneous measurement and provision of power to the operating device.\nThe impedance of a device can be calculated by complex division of the voltage and current. The impedance of the device can be calculated by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the device in series with a resistor, and measuring the voltage across the resistor and across the device. Performing this measurement by sweeping the frequencies of the applied signal provides the impedance phase and magnitude.\nThe use of an impulse response may be used in combination with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to rapidly measure the electrical impedance of various electrical devices.\nThe LCR meter measures a component's inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R); from these values, the impedance at any frequency can be calculated.\nExample.\nConsider a parallel LC tank circuit. \nThe complex impedance of the circuit is\nformula_93\nIt is immediately seen that the value of formula_94 is minimal (actually equal to 0 in this case) whenever \nformula_95\nTherefore, the fundamental resonance angular frequency is \nformula_96\nVariable impedance.\nIn general, neither impedance nor admittance can vary with time, since they are defined for complex exponentials in which \u2212\u221e &lt; \"t\" &lt; +\u221e. If the complex exponential voltage to current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many components and systems (e.g., varicaps that are used in radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage to current ratios that seem to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals and over small observation windows, so they can be roughly described as if they had a time-varying impedance. This description is an approximation: Over large signal swings or wide observation windows, the voltage to current relationship will not be LTI and cannot be described by impedance.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lidar may operate in a fixed direction (e.g., vertical) or it may scan directions, in a special combination of 3D scanning and laser scanning.\nLidar has terrestrial, airborne, and mobile uses. It is commonly used to make high-resolution maps, with applications in surveying, geodesy, geomatics, archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, atmospheric physics, laser guidance, airborne laser swathe mapping (ALSM), and laser altimetry. It is used to make digital 3-D representations of areas on the Earth's surface and ocean bottom of the intertidal and near coastal zone by varying the wavelength of light. It has also been increasingly used in control and navigation for autonomous cars and for the helicopter \"Ingenuity\" on its record-setting flights over the terrain of Mars. Lidar has since been used extensively for atmospheric research and meteorology. Lidar instruments fitted to aircraft and satellites carry out surveying and mapping\u00a0\u2013 a recent example being the U.S. Geological Survey Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar. NASA has identified lidar as a key technology for enabling autonomous precision safe landing of future robotic and crewed lunar-landing vehicles.\nThe evolution of quantum technology has given rise to the emergence of Quantum Lidar, demonstrating higher efficiency and sensitivity when compared to conventional lidar systems.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe essential concept of lidar was originated by E. H. Synge in 1930, who envisaged the use of powerful searchlights to probe the atmosphere.\nUnder the direction of Malcolm Stitch, the Hughes Aircraft Company introduced the first lidar-like system in 1961, shortly after the invention of the laser. Intended for satellite tracking, this system combined laser-focused imaging with the ability to calculate distances by measuring the time for a signal to return using appropriate sensors and data acquisition electronics. It was originally called \"Colidar\" an acronym for \"coherent light detecting and ranging\", derived from the term \"radar\", itself an acronym for \"radio detection and ranging\". All laser rangefinders, laser altimeters and lidar units are derived from the early colidar systems.\nThe first practical terrestrial application of a colidar system was the \"Colidar Mark II\", a large rifle-like laser rangefinder produced in 1963, which had a range of 11\u00a0km and an accuracy of 4.5 m, to be used for military targeting. The first mention of lidar as a stand-alone word in 1963 suggests that it originated as a portmanteau of \"light\" and \"radar\": \"Eventually the laser may provide an extremely sensitive detector of particular wavelengths from distant objects. Meanwhile, it is being used to study the Moon by 'lidar' (light radar)\u00a0...\"\nThe name \"photonic radar\" is sometimes used to mean visible-spectrum range finding like lidar.\nLidar's first applications were in meteorology, for which the National Center for Atmospheric Research used it to measure clouds and pollution. The general public became aware of the accuracy and usefulness of lidar systems in 1971 during the Apollo\u00a015 mission, when astronauts used a laser altimeter to map the surface of the Moon.\nAlthough the English language no longer treats \"radar\" as an acronym, (i.e., uncapitalized), the word \"lidar\" was capitalized as \"LIDAR\" or \"LiDAR\" in some publications beginning in the 1980s. No consensus exists on capitalization. Various publications refer to lidar as \"LIDAR\", \"LiDAR\", \"LIDaR\", or \"Lidar\". The USGS uses both \"LIDAR\" and \"lidar\", sometimes in the same document; the \"New York Times\" predominantly uses \"lidar\" for staff-written articles, although contributing news feeds such as Reuters may use Lidar.\nTheory.\nLidar uses ultraviolet, visible, or near infrared light to image objects. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols, clouds and even single molecules. A narrow laser beam can map physical features with very high resolutions; for example, an aircraft can map terrain at resolution or better.\nWavelengths vary to suit the target: from about 10\u00a0micrometers (infrared) to approximately 250\u00a0nanometers (ultraviolet). Typically, light is reflected via backscattering, as opposed to pure reflection one might find with a mirror. Different types of scattering are used for different lidar applications: most commonly Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, Raman scattering, and fluorescence. Suitable combinations of wavelengths can allow remote mapping of atmospheric contents by identifying wavelength-dependent changes in the intensity of the returned signal.\nThe name \"photonic radar\" is sometimes used to mean visible-spectrum range finding like lidar, although photonic radar more strictly refers to radio-frequency range finding using photonics components.\nA lidar determines the distance of an object or a surface with the formula:\nformula_1\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light, \"d\" is the distance between the detector and the object or surface being detected, and \"t\" is the time spent for the laser light to travel to the object or surface being detected, then travel back to the detector.\nThe two kinds of lidar detection schemes are \"incoherent\" or direct energy detection (which principally measures amplitude changes of the reflected light) and coherent detection (best for measuring Doppler shifts, or changes in the phase of the reflected light). Coherent systems generally use optical heterodyne detection. This is more sensitive than direct detection and allows them to operate at much lower power, but requires more complex transceivers.\nBoth types employ pulse models: either \"micropulse\" or \"high energy\". Micropulse systems utilize intermittent bursts of energy. They developed as a result of ever-increasing computer power, combined with advances in laser technology. They use considerably less energy in the laser, typically on the order of one microjoule, and are often \"eye-safe\", meaning they can be used without safety precautions. High-power systems are common in atmospheric research, where they are widely used for measuring atmospheric parameters: the height, layering and densities of clouds, cloud particle properties (extinction coefficient, backscatter coefficient, depolarization), temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, and trace gas concentration (ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, etc.).\nComponents.\nLaser.\n600\u20131,000\u00a0nm lasers are most common for non-scientific applications. The maximum power of the laser is limited, or an automatic shut-off system which turns the laser off at specific altitudes is used in order to make it eye-safe for the people on the ground.\nOne common alternative, 1,550\u00a0nm lasers, are eye-safe at relatively high power levels since this wavelength is strongly absorbed by water and barely reaches the retina, though camera sensors can still get damaged. A trade-off though is that current detector technology is less advanced, so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges with lower accuracies. They are also used for military applications because 1,550\u00a0nm is not visible in night vision goggles, unlike the shorter 1,000\u00a0nm infrared laser.\nAirborne topographic mapping lidars generally use 1,064\u00a0nm diode-pumped YAG lasers, while bathymetric (underwater depth research) systems generally use 532\u00a0nm frequency-doubled diode pumped YAG lasers because 532\u00a0nm penetrates water with much less attenuation than 1,064\u00a0nm. Laser settings include the laser repetition rate (which controls the data collection speed). Pulse length is generally an attribute of the laser cavity length, the number of passes required through the gain material (YAG, YLF, etc.), and Q-switch (pulsing) speed. Better target resolution is achieved with shorter pulses, provided the lidar receiver detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth.\nA phased array can illuminate any direction by using a microscopic array of individual antennas. Controlling the timing (phase) of each antenna steers a cohesive signal in a specific direction. Phased arrays have been used in radar since the 1940s. On the order of a million optical antennas are used to see a radiation pattern of a certain size in a certain direction. To achieve this the phase of each individual antenna (emitter) are precisely controlled. It is very difficult, if possible at all, to use the same technique in a lidar. The main problems are that all individual emitters must be coherent (technically coming from the same \"master\" oscillator or laser source), have dimensions about the wavelength of the emitted light (1 micron range) to act as a point source with their phases being controlled with high accuracy.\nMicroelectromechanical mirrors (MEMS) are not entirely solid-state. However, their tiny form factor provides many of the same cost benefits. A single laser is directed to a single mirror that can be reoriented to view any part of the target field. The mirror spins at a rapid rate. However, MEMS systems generally operate in a single plane (left to right). To add a second dimension generally requires a second mirror that moves up and down. Alternatively, another laser can hit the same mirror from another angle. MEMS systems can be disrupted by shock/vibration and may require repeated calibration.\nScanner and optics.\nImage development speed is affected by the speed at which they are scanned. Options to scan the azimuth and elevation include dual oscillating plane mirrors, a combination with a polygon mirror, and a dual axis scanner. Optic choices affect the angular resolution and range that can be detected. A hole mirror or a beam splitter are options to collect a return signal.\nPhotodetector and receiver electronics.\nTwo main photodetector technologies are used in lidar: solid-state photodetectors, such as silicon avalanche photodiodes, or photomultipliers. The sensitivity of the receiver is another parameter that has to be balanced in a lidar design.\nPosition and navigation systems.\nLidar sensors mounted on mobile platforms such as airplanes or satellites require instrumentation to determine the absolute position and orientation of the sensor. Such devices generally include a Global Positioning System receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).\nSensor.\nLidar uses active sensors that supply their own illumination source. The energy source hits objects and the reflected energy is detected and measured by sensors. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between transmitted and backscattered pulses and by using the speed of light to calculate the distance traveled. Flash lidar allows for 3-D imaging because of the camera's ability to emit a larger flash and sense the spatial relationships and dimensions of area of interest with the returned energy. This allows for more accurate imaging because the captured frames do not need to be stitched together, and the system is not sensitive to platform motion. This results in less distortion.\n3-D imaging can be achieved using both scanning and non-scanning systems. \"3-D gated viewing laser radar\" is a non-scanning laser ranging system that applies a pulsed laser and a fast gated camera. Research has begun for virtual beam steering using Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology.\nImaging lidar can also be performed using arrays of high speed detectors and modulation sensitive detector arrays typically built on single chips using complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) and hybrid CMOS/charge-coupled device (CCD) fabrication techniques. In these devices each pixel performs some local processing such as demodulation or gating at high speed, downconverting the signals to video rate so that the array can be read like a camera. Using this technique many thousands of pixels / channels may be acquired simultaneously. High resolution 3-D lidar cameras use homodyne detection with an electronic CCD or CMOS shutter.&lt;ref name=\"Medina A, Gay\u00e1 F, and Pozo F 800\u2013805 http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?URI=josaa-23-4-800\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nA coherent imaging lidar uses synthetic array heterodyne detection to enable a staring single element receiver to act as though it were an imaging array.\nIn 2014, Lincoln Laboratory announced a new imaging chip with more than 16,384 pixels, each able to image a single photon, enabling them to capture a wide area in a single image. An earlier generation of the technology with one fourth as many pixels was dispatched by the U.S. military after the January 2010 Haiti earthquake. A single pass by a business jet at over Port-au-Prince was able to capture instantaneous snapshots of squares of the city at a resolution of , displaying the precise height of rubble strewn in city streets. The new system is ten times better, and could produce much larger maps more quickly. The chip uses indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), which operates in the infrared spectrum at a relatively long wavelength that allows for higher power and longer ranges. In many applications, such as self-driving cars, the new system will lower costs by not requiring a mechanical component to aim the chip. InGaAs uses less hazardous wavelengths than conventional silicon detectors, which operate at visual wavelengths. New technologies for infrared single-photon counting lidar are advancing rapidly, including arrays and cameras in a variety of semiconductor and superconducting platforms.\nClassification.\nLidar can be oriented to nadir, zenith, or laterally. For example, lidar altimeters look down, an atmospheric lidar looks up, and lidar-based collision avoidance systems are side-looking.\nLaser projections of lidars can be manipulated using various methods and mechanisms to produce a scanning effect: the standard spindle-type, which spins to give a 360-degree view; solid-state lidar, which has a fixed field of view, but no moving parts, and can use either MEMS or optical phased arrays to steer the beams; and flash lidar, which spreads a flash of light over a large field of view before the signal bounces back to a detector.\nLidar applications can be divided into airborne and terrestrial types. The two types require scanners with varying specifications based on the data's purpose, the size of the area to be captured, the range of measurement desired, the cost of equipment, and more. Spaceborne platforms are also possible, see satellite laser altimetry.\nAirborne lidar (also \"airborne laser scanning\") is when a laser scanner, while attached to an aircraft during flight, creates a 3-D point cloud model of the landscape. This is currently the most detailed and accurate method of creating digital elevation models, replacing photogrammetry. One major advantage in comparison with photogrammetry is the ability to filter out reflections from vegetation from the point cloud model to create a digital terrain model which represents ground surfaces such as rivers, paths, cultural heritage sites, etc., which are concealed by trees. Within the category of airborne lidar, there is sometimes a distinction made between high-altitude and low-altitude applications, but the main difference is a reduction in both accuracy and point density of data acquired at higher altitudes. Airborne lidar can also be used to create bathymetric models in shallow water.\nThe main constituents of airborne lidar include digital elevation models (DEM) and digital surface models (DSM). The points and ground points are the vectors of discrete points while DEM and DSM are interpolated raster grids of discrete points. The process also involves capturing of digital aerial photographs. To interpret deep-seated landslides for example, under the cover of vegetation, scarps, tension cracks or tipped trees airborne lidar is used. Airborne lidar digital elevation models can see through the canopy of forest cover, perform detailed measurements of scarps, erosion and tilting of electric poles.\nAirborne lidar data is processed using a toolbox called Toolbox for Lidar Data Filtering and Forest Studies (TIFFS) for lidar data filtering and terrain study software. The data is interpolated to digital terrain models using the software. The laser is directed at the region to be mapped and each point's height above the ground is calculated by subtracting the original z-coordinate from the corresponding digital terrain model elevation. Based on this height above the ground the non-vegetation data is obtained which may include objects such as buildings, electric power lines, flying birds, insects, etc. The rest of the points are treated as vegetation and used for modeling and mapping. Within each of these plots, lidar metrics are calculated by calculating statistics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, percentiles, quadratic mean, etc.\nMultiple commercial lidar systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are currently on the market. These platforms can systematically scan large areas, or provide a cheaper alternative to manned aircraft for smaller scanning operations.\nThe airborne lidar bathymetric technological system involves the measurement of time of flight of a signal from a source to its return to the sensor. The data acquisition technique involves a sea floor mapping component and a ground truth component that includes video transects and sampling. It works using a green spectrum (532\u00a0nm) laser beam. Two beams are projected onto a fast rotating mirror, which creates an array of points. One of the beams penetrates the water and also detects the bottom surface of the water under favorable conditions.\nWater depth measurable by lidar depends on the clarity of the water and the absorption of the wavelength used. Water is most transparent to green and blue light, so these will penetrate deepest in clean water. Blue-green light of 532\u00a0nm produced by frequency doubled solid-state IR laser output is the standard for airborne bathymetry. This light can penetrate water but pulse strength attenuates exponentially with distance traveled through the water. Lidar can measure depths from about , with vertical accuracy in the order of . The surface reflection makes water shallower than about difficult to resolve, and absorption limits the maximum depth. Turbidity causes scattering and has a significant role in determining the maximum depth that can be resolved in most situations, and dissolved pigments can increase absorption depending on wavelength. Other reports indicate that water penetration tends to be between two and three times Secchi depth. Bathymetric lidar is most useful in the depth range in coastal mapping.\nOn average in fairly clear coastal seawater lidar can penetrate to about , and in turbid water up to about . An average value found by Saputra et al, 2021, is for the green laser light to penetrate water about one and a half to two times Secchi depth in Indonesian waters. Water temperature and salinity have an effect on the refractive index which has a small effect on the depth calculation.\nThe data obtained shows the full extent of the land surface exposed above the sea floor. This technique is extremely useful as it will play an important role in the major sea floor mapping program. The mapping yields onshore topography as well as underwater elevations. Sea floor reflectance imaging is another solution product from this system which can benefit mapping of underwater habitats. This technique has been used for three-dimensional image mapping of California's waters using a hydrographic lidar.\nAirborne lidar systems were traditionally able to acquire only a few peak returns, while more recent systems acquire and digitize the entire reflected signal. Scientists analysed the waveform signal for extracting peak returns using Gaussian decomposition. Zhuang et al, 2017 used this approach for estimating aboveground biomass. Handling the huge amounts of full-waveform data is difficult. Therefore, Gaussian decomposition of the waveforms is effective, since it reduces the data and is supported by existing workflows that support interpretation of 3-D point clouds. Recent studies investigated voxelisation. The intensities of the waveform samples are inserted into a voxelised space (3-D grayscale image) building up a 3-D representation of the scanned area. Related metrics and information can then be extracted from that voxelised space. Structural information can be extracted using 3-D metrics from local areas and there is a case study that used the voxelisation approach for detecting dead standing Eucalypt trees in Australia.\nTerrestrial applications of lidar (also \"terrestrial laser scanning\") happen on the Earth's surface and can be either stationary or mobile. Stationary terrestrial scanning is most common as a survey method, for example in conventional topography, monitoring, cultural heritage documentation and forensics. The 3-D point clouds acquired from these types of scanners can be matched with digital images taken of the scanned area from the scanner's location to create realistic looking 3-D models in a relatively short time when compared to other technologies. Each point in the point cloud is given the colour of the pixel from the image taken at the same location and direction as the laser beam that created the point.\nTerrestrial lidar mapping involves a process of occupancy grid map generation. The process involves an array of cells divided into grids which employ a process to store the height values when lidar data falls into the respective grid cell. A binary map is then created by applying a particular threshold to the cell values for further processing. The next step is to process the radial distance and z-coordinates from each scan to identify which 3-D points correspond to each of the specified grid cell leading to the process of data formation.\nMobile lidar (also \"mobile laser scanning\") is when two or more scanners are attached to a moving vehicle to collect data along a path. These scanners are almost always paired with other kinds of equipment, including GNSS receivers and IMUs. One example application is surveying streets, where power lines, exact bridge heights, bordering trees, etc. all need to be taken into account. Instead of collecting each of these measurements individually in the field with a tachymeter, a 3-D model from a point cloud can be created where all of the measurements needed can be made, depending on the quality of the data collected. This eliminates the problem of forgetting to take a measurement, so long as the model is available, reliable and has an appropriate level of accuracy.\nApplications.\nThere are a wide variety of lidar applications, in addition to the applications listed below, as it is often mentioned in national lidar dataset programs. These applications are largely determined by the range of effective object detection; resolution, which is how accurately the lidar identifies and classifies objects; and reflectance confusion, meaning how well the lidar can see something in the presence of bright objects, like reflective signs or bright sun.\nCompanies are working to cut the cost of lidar sensors, currently anywhere from about US$1,200 to more than $12,000. Lower prices will make lidar more attractive for new markets.\nAgriculture.\nAgricultural robots have been used for a variety of purposes ranging from seed and fertilizer dispersions, sensing techniques as well as crop scouting for the task of weed control.\nLidar can help determine where to apply costly fertilizer. It can create a topographical map of the fields and reveal slopes and sun exposure of the farmland. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service used this topographical data with the farmland yield results from previous years, to categorize land into zones of high, medium, or low yield. This indicates where to apply fertilizer to maximize yield.\nLidar is now used to monitor insects in the field. The use of lidar can detect the movement and behavior of individual flying insects, with identification down to sex and species. In 2017 a patent application was published on this technology in the United States, Europe, and China.\nAnother application is crop mapping in orchards and vineyards, to detect foliage growth and the need for pruning or other maintenance, detect variations in fruit production, or count plants.\nLidar is useful in GNSS-denied situations, such as nut and fruit orchards, where foliage causes interference for agriculture equipment that would otherwise utilize a precise GNSS fix. Lidar sensors can detect and track the relative position of rows, plants, and other markers so that farming equipment can continue operating until a GNSS fix is reestablished.\nControlling weeds requires identifying plant species. This can be done by using 3-D lidar and machine learning. Lidar produces plant contours as a \"point cloud\" with range and reflectance values. This data is transformed, and features are extracted from it. If the species is known, the features are added as new data. The species is labelled and its features are initially stored as an example to identify the species in the real environment. This method is efficient because it uses a low-resolution lidar and supervised learning. It includes an easy-to-compute feature set with common statistical features which are independent of the plant size.\nAirport Operations.\nIn April 2025, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport announced the deployment of a LiDAR-based platform for real-time monitoring of passenger and vehicle flows.\nArchaeology.\nLidar has many uses in archaeology, including planning of field campaigns, mapping features under forest canopy, and overview of broad, continuous features indistinguishable from the ground. Lidar can produce high-resolution datasets quickly and cheaply. Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.\nLidar can also help to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that is otherwise hidden by vegetation. The intensity of the returned lidar signal can be used to detect features buried under flat vegetated surfaces such as fields, especially when mapping using the infrared spectrum. The presence of these features affects plant growth and thus the amount of infrared light reflected back. For example, at Fort Beaus\u00e9jour \u2013 Fort Cumberland National Historic Site, Canada, lidar discovered archaeological features related to the siege of the Fort in 1755. Features that could not be distinguished on the ground or through aerial photography were identified by overlaying hill shades of the DEM created with artificial illumination from various angles. Another example is work at Caracol by Arlen Chase and his wife Diane Zaino Chase. In 2012, lidar was used to search for the legendary city of La Ciudad Blanca or \"City of the Monkey God\" in the La Mosquitia region of the Honduran jungle. During a seven-day mapping period, evidence was found of man-made structures. In June 2013, the rediscovery of the city of Mahendraparvata was announced. In southern New England, lidar was used to reveal stone walls, building foundations, abandoned roads, and other landscape features obscured in aerial photography by the region's dense forest canopy. In Cambodia, lidar data was used by Damian Evans and Roland Fletcher to reveal anthropogenic changes to Angkor landscape.\nIn 2012, lidar revealed that the Pur\u00e9pecha settlement of Angamuco in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico had about as many buildings as today's Manhattan; while in 2016, its use in mapping ancient Maya causeways in northern Guatemala, revealed 17 elevated roads linking the ancient city of El Mirador to other sites. In 2018, archaeologists using lidar discovered more than 60,000 man-made structures in the Maya Biosphere Reserve, a \"major breakthrough\" that showed the Maya civilization was much larger than previously thought. In 2024, archaeologists using lidar discovered the Upano Valley sites.\nAutonomous vehicles.\nAutonomous vehicles may use lidar for obstacle detection and avoidance to navigate safely through environments. The introduction of lidar was a pivotal occurrence that was the key enabler behind Stanley, the first autonomous vehicle to successfully complete the DARPA Grand Challenge. Point cloud output from the lidar sensor provides the necessary data for robot software to determine where potential obstacles exist in the environment and where the robot is in relation to those potential obstacles. Singapore's \"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)\" is actively developing technologies for autonomous lidar vehicles.\nThe very first generations of automotive adaptive cruise control systems used only lidar sensors.\nIn transportation systems, to ensure vehicle and passenger safety and to develop electronic systems that deliver driver assistance, understanding the vehicle and its surrounding environment is essential. Lidar systems play an important role in the safety of transportation systems. Many electronic systems which enhance driver assistance and vehicle safety such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Emergency Brake Assist, and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) depend on the detection of a vehicle's environment to act autonomously or semi-autonomously. Lidar mapping and estimation achieve this.\nCurrent lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors which split the laser beam. The upper three beams are used for vehicle and obstacles ahead, and the lower beams are used to detect lane markings and road features. The major advantage of using lidar is that the spatial structure is obtained and this data can be fused with other sensors such as radar, etc. to get a better picture of the vehicle environment in terms of static and dynamic properties of the objects present in the environment. Conversely, a significant issue with lidar is the difficulty in reconstructing point cloud data in poor weather conditions. In heavy rain, for example, the light pulses emitted from the lidar system are partially reflected off of rain droplets which adds noise to the data, called 'echoes'.\nObstacle detection and road environment recognition using lidar, proposed by Kun Zhou et al. not only focuses on object detection and tracking but also recognizes lane marking and road features. As mentioned earlier, the lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors that split the laser beam into six beams. The upper three layers are used to detect the forward objects such as vehicles and roadside objects. The sensor is made of weather-resistant material. The data detected by lidar are clustered to several segments and tracked by Kalman filter. Data clustering here is done based on characteristics of each segment based on object model, which distinguish different objects such as vehicles, signboards, etc. These characteristics include the dimensions of the object, etc. The reflectors on the rear edges of vehicles are used to differentiate vehicles from other objects. Object tracking is done using a two-stage Kalman filter considering the stability of tracking and the accelerated motion of objects Lidar reflective intensity data is also used for curb detection by making use of robust regression to deal with occlusions. Road marking is detected using a modified Otsu method by distinguishing rough and shiny surfaces.\nRoadside reflectors that indicate lane border are sometimes hidden due to various reasons. Therefore, other information is needed to recognize the road border. The lidar used in this method can measure the reflectivity from the object. Hence, with this data the road border can also be recognized. Also, the usage of a sensor with a weather-robust head helps to detect the objects even in bad weather conditions. Canopy Height Model before and after a flood is a good example. Lidar can detect highly detailed canopy height data as well as its road border. Lidar measurements help identify the spatial structure of the obstacle. This helps distinguish objects based on size and estimate the impact of driving over it. Lidar systems provide better range and a large field of view, which helps in detecting obstacles on the curves. This is one of its major advantages over RADAR systems, which have a narrower field of view. The fusion of lidar measurement with different sensors makes the system robust and useful in real-time applications, since lidar-dependent systems cannot estimate the dynamic information about the detected object. It has been shown that lidar can be manipulated, such that self-driving cars are tricked into taking evasive action.\nEcology and conservation.\nLidar has also found many applications for mapping natural and managed landscapes such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands. Canopy heights, biomass measurements, and leaf area can all be studied using airborne lidar systems. Similarly, lidar is also used by many industries, including Energy and Railroad, and the Department of Transportation as a faster way of surveying. Topographic maps can also be generated readily from lidar, including for recreational use such as in the production of orienteering maps. Lidar has also been applied to estimate and assess the biodiversity of plants, fungi, and animals. Using southern bull kelp in New Zealand, coastal lidar mapping data has been compared with population genomic evidence to form hypotheses regarding the occurrence and timing of prehistoric earthquake uplift events.\nForestry.\nLidar systems have also been applied to improve forestry management. Measurements are used to take inventory in forest plots as well as calculate individual tree heights, crown width and crown diameter. Other statistical analysis use lidar data to estimate total plot information such as canopy volume, mean, minimum and maximum heights, vegetation cover, biomass, and carbon density. Aerial lidar was used to map the bush fires in Australia in early 2020. The data was manipulated to view bare earth, and identify healthy and burned vegetation.\nGeology and soil science.\nHigh-resolution digital elevation maps generated by airborne and stationary lidar have led to significant advances in geomorphology (the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography). The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks, glacial landforms, to measure the land-surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy, to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation, to rockfall detection, to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes.\nIn 2005 the Tour Ronde in the Mont Blanc massif became the first high alpine mountain on which lidar was employed to monitor the increasing occurrence of severe rock-fall over large rock faces allegedly caused by climate change and degradation of permafrost at high altitude.\nLidar is also used in structural geology and geophysics as a combination between airborne lidar and GNSS for the detection and study of faults, for measuring uplift. The output of the two technologies can produce extremely accurate elevation models for terrain \u2013 models that can even measure ground elevation through trees. This combination was used most famously to find the location of the Seattle Fault in Washington, United States. This combination also measures uplift at Mount St. Helens by using data from before and after the 2004 uplift. Airborne lidar systems monitor glaciers and have the ability to detect subtle amounts of growth or decline. A satellite-based system, the NASA ICESat, includes a lidar sub-system for this purpose. The NASA Airborne Topographic Mapper is also used extensively to monitor glaciers and perform coastal change analysis.\nThe combination is also used by soil scientists while creating a soil survey. The detailed terrain modeling allows soil scientists to see slope changes and landform breaks which indicate patterns in soil spatial relationships.\nAtmosphere.\nInitially, based on ruby lasers, lidar for meteorological applications was constructed shortly after the invention of the laser and represents one of the first applications of laser technology. Lidar technology has since expanded vastly in capability and lidar systems are used to perform a range of measurements that include profiling clouds, measuring winds, studying aerosols, and quantifying various atmospheric components. Atmospheric components can in turn provide useful information including surface pressure (by measuring the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen), greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane), photosynthesis (carbon dioxide), fires (carbon monoxide), and humidity (water vapor). Atmospheric lidars can be either ground-based, airborne or satellite-based depending on the type of measurement.\nAtmospheric lidar remote sensing works in two ways:\nBackscatter from the atmosphere directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols. Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and/or polarization detected. \"Doppler lidar\" and \"Rayleigh Doppler lidar\" are used to measure temperature and wind speed along the beam by measuring the frequency of the backscattered light. The Doppler broadening of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift. Scanning lidars, such as NASA's conical-scanning HARLIE, have been used to measure atmospheric wind velocity. The ESA wind mission \"ADM-Aeolus\" will be equipped with a Doppler lidar system in order to provide global measurements of vertical wind profiles. A doppler lidar system was used in the 2008 Summer Olympics to measure wind fields during the yacht competition.\nDoppler lidar systems are also now beginning to be successfully applied in the renewable energy sector to acquire wind speed, turbulence, wind veer, and wind shear data. Both pulsed and continuous wave systems are being used. Pulsed systems use signal timing to obtain vertical distance resolution, whereas continuous wave systems rely on detector focusing.\nThe term \"eolics\" has been proposed to describe the collaborative and interdisciplinary study of wind using computational fluid mechanics simulations and Doppler lidar measurements.\nThe ground reflection of an airborne lidar gives a measure of surface reflectivity (assuming the atmospheric transmittance is well known) at the lidar wavelength, however, the ground reflection is typically used for making absorption measurements of the atmosphere. \"Differential absorption lidar\" (DIAL) measurements utilize two or more closely spaced (less than 1\u00a0nm) wavelengths to factor out surface reflectivity as well as other transmission losses, since these factors are relatively insensitive to wavelength. When tuned to the appropriate absorption lines of a particular gas, DIAL measurements can be used to determine the concentration (mixing ratio) of that particular gas in the atmosphere. This is referred to as an \"Integrated Path Differential Absorption\" (IPDA) approach, since it is a measure of the integrated absorption along the entire lidar path. IPDA lidars can be either pulsed or CW and typically use two or more wavelengths. IPDA lidars have been used for remote sensing of carbon dioxide and methane.\n\"Synthetic array lidar\" allows imaging lidar without the need for an array detector. It can be used for imaging Doppler velocimetry, ultra-fast frame rate imaging (millions of frames per second), as well as for speckle reduction in coherent lidar. An extensive lidar bibliography for atmospheric and hydrospheric applications is given by Grant.\nFlood forecasting.\nIn Japan, differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and Raman lidar technologies are being developed to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting and rainfall prediction, in response to increasingly frequent and severe weather events driven by climate change.\nAs part of the Cabinet Office's Bridging Research and Development and Society 5.0 (BRIDGE) Program, a multi-institutional research consortium led by Kyushu University\u2014and including EKO Instruments Co. Ltd. Kyoto University, and several national universities and institutes\u2014was selected by the Kyushu Regional Development Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism conduct advanced research on meteorological sensing and flood risk modelling.\nThe project focuses on:\nIn May 2025, EKO Instruments began a field study on Goto Fukue Island, Nagasaki Prefecture, using a Micropulse DIAL lidar system provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR). The study compares DIAL performance with existing Raman lidar systems.\nIn addition, EKO Instruments. Co. Ltd. signed a technology license agreement in February 2025 with Montana State University, NSF NCAR, and NASA, covering key DIAL-related patents. The company is working toward commercializing a compact and efficient lidar system by 2026.\nWhile till June 2025 much of the work is focused on Japan's flood-prone regions such as Kyushu, EKO Instruments Co. Ltd. has stated its intent to contribute to global flood resilience, targeting other vulnerable regions including the United States and Europe, where extreme weather and flooding events are increasingly common. The goal is to expand the application of advanced atmospheric lidar and AI forecasting systems to support international disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.\nThe initiative has received national attention, with coverage by NHK Fukuoka and the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, and is expected to play a key role in developing next-generation weather forecasting infrastructure.\nLaw enforcement.\nLidar speed guns are used by the police to measure the speed of vehicles for speed limit enforcement purposes. Additionally, it is used in forensics to aid in crime scene investigations. Scans of a scene are taken to record exact details of object placement, blood, and other important information for later review. These scans can also be used to determine bullet trajectory in cases of shootings.\nMilitary.\nFew military applications are known to be in place and are classified (such as the lidar-based speed measurement of the AGM-129 ACM stealth nuclear cruise missile), but a considerable amount of research is underway in their use for imaging. Higher resolution systems collect enough detail to identify targets, such as tanks. Examples of military applications of lidar include the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for counter-mine warfare by Aret\u00e9 Associates.\nA NATO report (RTO-TR-SET-098) evaluated the potential technologies to do stand-off detection for the discrimination of biological warfare agents. The potential technologies evaluated were Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Differential Scattering (DISC), and Ultraviolet Laser Induced Fluorescence (UV-LIF). The report concluded that : \"Based upon the results of the lidar systems tested and discussed above, the Task Group recommends that the best option for the near-term (2008\u20132010) application of stand-off detection systems is UV-LIF \", however, in the long-term, other techniques such as stand-off Raman spectroscopy may prove to be useful for identification of biological warfare agents.\nShort-range compact spectrometric lidar based on Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) would address the presence of bio-threats in aerosol form over critical indoor, semi-enclosed and outdoor venues such as stadiums, subways, and airports. This near real-time capability would enable rapid detection of a bioaerosol release and allow for timely implementation of measures to protect occupants and minimize the extent of contamination.\nThe Long-Range Biological Standoff Detection System (LR-BSDS) was developed for the U.S. Army to provide the earliest possible standoff warning of a biological attack. It is an airborne system carried by helicopter to detect synthetic aerosol clouds containing biological and chemical agents at long range. The LR-BSDS, with a detection range of 30\u00a0km or more, was fielded in June 1997. Five lidar units produced by the German company Sick AG were used for short range detection on Stanley, the autonomous car that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.\nA robotic Boeing AH-6 performed a fully autonomous flight in June 2010, including avoiding obstacles using lidar.\nMining.\nThe calculation of ore volumes is accomplished by periodic (monthly) scanning in areas of ore removal, then comparing surface data to the previous scan.\nLidar sensors may also be used for obstacle detection and avoidance for robotic mining vehicles such as in the Komatsu Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) used in Rio Tinto's Mine of the Future.\nPhysics and astronomy.\nA worldwide network of observatories uses lidars to measure the distance to reflectors placed on the Moon, allowing the position of the Moon to be measured with millimeter precision and tests of general relativity to be done. MOLA, the Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter, used a lidar instrument in a Mars-orbiting satellite (the NASA Mars Global Surveyor) to produce a spectacularly precise global topographic survey of the red planet. Laser altimeters produced global elevation models of Mars, the Moon (Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)), and Mercury (Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA), NEAR\u2013Shoemaker Laser Rangefinder (NLR)). Future missions will also include laser altimeter experiments such as the Ganymede Laser Altimeter (GALA) as part of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission.\nIn September, 2008, the NASA \"Phoenix\" lander used lidar to detect snow in the atmosphere of Mars.\nIn atmospheric physics, lidar is used as a remote detection instrument to measure densities of certain constituents of the middle and upper atmosphere, such as potassium, sodium, or molecular nitrogen and oxygen. These measurements can be used to calculate temperatures. Lidar can also be used to measure wind speed and to provide information about vertical distribution of the aerosol particles.\nAt the JET nuclear fusion research facility in the UK near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, lidar Thomson scattering is used to determine electron density and temperature profiles of the plasma.\nRock mechanics.\nLidar has been widely used in rock mechanics for rock mass characterization and slope change detection. Some important geomechanical properties from the rock mass can be extracted from the 3-D point clouds obtained by means of the lidar. Some of these properties are:\nSome of these properties have been used to assess the geomechanical quality of the rock mass through the RMR index. Moreover, as the orientations of discontinuities can be extracted using the existing methodologies, it is possible to assess the geomechanical quality of a rock slope through the SMR index. In addition to this, the comparison of different 3-D point clouds from a slope acquired at different times allows researchers to study the changes produced on the scene during this time interval as a result of rockfalls or any other landsliding processes.\nTHOR.\nTHOR is a laser designed toward measuring Earth's atmospheric conditions. The laser enters a cloud cover and measures the thickness of the return halo. The sensor has a fiber optic aperture with a width of that is used to measure the return light.\nRobotics.\nLidar technology is being used in robotics for the perception of the environment as well as object classification. The ability of lidar technology to provide three-dimensional elevation maps of the terrain, high precision distance to the ground, and approach velocity can enable safe landing of robotic and crewed vehicles with a high degree of precision. Lidar is also widely used in robotics for simultaneous localization and mapping and is well-integrated into robot simulators. Refer to the Military section above for further examples.\nSpaceflight.\nLidar is increasingly being utilized for rangefinding and orbital element calculation of relative velocity in proximity operations and stationkeeping of spacecraft. Lidar has also been used for atmospheric studies from space. Short pulses of laser light beamed from a spacecraft can reflect off tiny particles in the atmosphere and back to a telescope aligned with the spacecraft laser. By precisely timing the lidar echo, and by measuring how much laser light is received by the telescope, scientists can accurately determine the location, distribution and nature of the particles. The result is a revolutionary new tool for studying constituents in the atmosphere, from cloud droplets to industrial pollutants, which are difficult to detect by other means.\nLaser altimetry is used to make digital elevation maps of planets, including the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) mapping of Mars, the Lunar Orbital Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and Lunar Altimeter (LALT) mapping of the Moon, and the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) mapping of Mercury. It is also used to help navigate the helicopter \"Ingenuity\" in its record-setting flights over the terrain of Mars.\nSurveying.\nAirborne lidar sensors are used by companies in the remote sensing field. They can be used to create a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) or DEM (Digital Elevation Model); this is quite a common practice for larger areas as a plane can acquire wide swaths in a single flyover. Greater vertical accuracy of below can be achieved with a lower flyover, even in forests, where it is able to give the height of the canopy as well as the ground elevation. Typically, a GNSS receiver configured over a georeferenced control point is needed to link the data in with the WGS (World Geodetic System).\nLidar is also in use in hydrographic surveying. Depending upon the clarity of the water lidar can measure depths from with a vertical accuracy of and horizontal accuracy of .\nTransport.\nLidar has been used in the railroad industry to generate asset health reports for asset management and by departments of transportation to assess their road conditions. CivilMaps.com is a leading company in the field. Lidar has been used in adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems for automobiles. Systems such as those by Siemens, Hella, Ouster and Cepton use a lidar device mounted on the front of the vehicle, such as the bumper, to monitor the distance between the vehicle and any vehicle in front of it. In the event where the vehicle in front slows down or is too close, the ACC applies the brakes to slow the vehicle. When the road ahead is clear, the ACC allows the vehicle to accelerate to a speed preset by the driver. Refer to the Military section above for further examples. A lidar-based device, the Ceilometer, is used at airports worldwide to measure the height of clouds on runway approach paths.\nWind farm optimization.\nLidar can be used to increase the energy output from wind farms by accurately measuring wind speeds and wind turbulence. Experimental lidar systems can be mounted on the nacelle of a wind turbine or integrated into the rotating spinner to measure oncoming horizontal winds, winds in the wake of the wind turbine, and proactively adjust blades to protect components and increase power. Lidar is also used to characterise the incident wind resource for comparison with wind turbine power production to verify the performance of the wind turbine by measuring the wind turbine's power curve. Wind farm optimization can be considered a topic in \"applied eolics\". Another aspect of lidar in wind related industry is to use computational fluid dynamics over lidar-scanned surfaces in order to assess the wind potential, which can be used for optimal wind farm placement.\nSolar photovoltaic deployment optimization.\nLidar can also be used to assist planners and developers in optimizing solar photovoltaic systems at the city level by determining appropriate roof tops and for determining shading losses. Recent airborne laser scanning efforts have focused on ways to estimate the amount of solar light hitting vertical building facades, or by incorporating more detailed shading losses by considering the influence from vegetation and larger surrounding terrain.\nVideo games.\nRecent simulation racing games such as \"rFactor Pro\", \"iRacing\", \"Assetto Corsa\" and \"Project CARS\" increasingly feature race tracks reproduced from 3-D point clouds acquired through lidar surveys, resulting in surfaces replicated with centimeter or millimeter precision in the in-game 3-D environment.\nThe 2017 exploration game \"Scanner Sombre\", by Introversion Software, uses lidar as a fundamental game mechanic.\nIn \"Build the Earth\", lidar is used to create accurate renders of terrain in \"Minecraft\" to account for any errors (mainly regarding elevation) in the default generation. The process of rendering terrain into Build the Earth is limited by the amount of data available in region as well as the speed it takes to convert the file into block data.\nOther uses.\nThe video for the 2007 song \"House of Cards\" by Radiohead was believed to be the first use of real-time 3-D laser scanning to record a music video. The range data in the video is not completely from a lidar, as structured light scanning is also used.\nIn 2020, Apple introduced the fourth generation of iPad Pro with a lidar sensor integrated into the rear camera module, especially developed for augmented reality (AR) experiences. The feature was later included in the iPhone 12 Pro lineup and subsequent Pro models. On Apple devices, lidar empowers portrait mode pictures with night mode, quickens auto focus and improves accuracy in the Measure app.\nIn 2022, \"Wheel of Fortune\" started using lidar technology to track when Vanna White moves her hand over the puzzle board to reveal letters. The first episode to have this technology was in the season 40 premiere.\nVariants.\nIn flash lidar, the entire field of view is illuminated with a wide diverging laser beam in a single pulse. This is in contrast to conventional scanning lidar, which uses a collimated laser beam that illuminates a single point at a time, and the beam is raster scanned to illuminate the field of view point-by-point. This illumination method requires a different detection scheme as well. In both scanning and flash lidar, a time-of-flight camera is used to collect information about both the 3-D location and intensity of the light incident on it in every frame. However, in scanning lidar, this camera contains only a point sensor, while in flash lidar, the camera contains either a 1-D or a 2-D sensor array, each pixel of which collects 3-D location and intensity information. In both cases, the depth information is collected using the time of flight of the laser pulse (i.e., the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor), which requires the pulsing of the laser and acquisition by the camera to be synchronized. The result is a camera that takes pictures of distance, instead of colors. Flash lidar is especially advantageous when compared to scanning lidar, when the camera, scene, or both are moving, since the entire scene is illuminated at the same time. With scanning lidar, motion can cause \"jitter\" from the lapse in time as the laser rasters over the scene.\nAs with all forms of lidar, the onboard source of illumination makes flash lidar an active sensor. The signal that is returned is processed by embedded algorithms to produce a nearly instantaneous 3-D rendering of objects and terrain features within the field of view of the sensor. The laser pulse repetition frequency is sufficient for generating 3-D videos with high resolution and accuracy. The high frame rate of the sensor makes it a useful tool for a variety of applications that benefit from real-time visualization, such as highly precise remote landing operations. By immediately returning a 3-D elevation mesh of target landscapes, a flash sensor can be used to identify optimal landing zones in autonomous spacecraft landing scenarios.\nSeeing at a distance requires a powerful burst of light. The power is limited to levels that do not damage human retinas. Wavelengths must not affect human eyes. However, low-cost silicon imagers do not read light in the eye-safe spectrum. Instead, gallium-arsenide imagers are required, which can boost costs to $200,000. Gallium-arsenide is the same compound used to produce high-cost, high-efficiency solar panels usually used in space applications.\nAlternative technologies.\nComputer stereo vision has shown promise as an alternative to lidar for close-range applications. It is significantly more cost effective when appropriate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The centerpiece of the Fair, held in Jackson Park, was a large water pool representing the voyage that Columbus took to the New World. Chicago won the right to host the fair over several competing cities, including New York City, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis. The exposition was an influential social and cultural event and had a profound effect on American architecture, the arts, American industrial optimism, and Chicago's image.\nThe layout of the Chicago Columbian Exposition was predominantly designed by John Wellborn Root, Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted, and Charles B. Atwood. It was the prototype of what Burnham and his colleagues thought a city should be. It was designed to follow Beaux-Arts principles of design, namely neoclassical architecture principles based on symmetry, balance, and splendor. The color of the material generally used to cover the buildings' fa\u00e7ades, white staff, gave the fairgrounds its nickname, the White City. Many prominent architects designed its 14 \"great buildings\". Artists and musicians were featured in exhibits and many also made depictions and works of art inspired by the exposition. One particularly notable attraction was the world's first ferris wheel, standing at a height of 264 feet, which was designed to rival the Eiffel Tower built for the 1889 World's Fair four years earlier.\nThe exposition covered , featuring nearly 200 new but temporary buildings of predominantly neoclassical architecture, canals and lagoons, and people and cultures from 46 countries. More than 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month run. Its scale and grandeur far exceeded the other world's fairs, and it became a symbol of supposed American exceptionalism, much in the same way that the Great Exhibition became a symbol of the Victorian era United Kingdom.\nDedication ceremonies for the fair were held on October 21, 1892, but the fairgrounds were not opened to the public until May 1, 1893. The fair continued until October 30, 1893. In addition to recognizing the 400th anniversary of the Europeans' discovery of the New World, the fair served to show the world that Chicago had risen from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire, which had destroyed much of the city in 1871.\nOn October 9, 1893, the day designated as Chicago Day, the fair set a world record for outdoor event attendance, drawing 751,026 people. The debt for the fair was soon paid off with a check for $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in 2024). Chicago has commemorated the fair with one of the stars on its municipal flag.\nHistory.\nPlanning and organization.\nMany prominent civic, professional, and commercial leaders from around the United States helped finance, coordinate, and manage the Fair, including Chicago shoe company owner Charles H. Schwab, Chicago railroad and manufacturing magnate John Whitfield Bunn, and Connecticut banking, insurance, and iron products magnate Milo Barnum Richardson, among many others.\nThe fair was planned in the early 1890s during the Gilded Age of rapid industrial growth, immigration, and class tension. World's fairs, such as London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition, had been successful in Europe as a way to bring together societies fragmented along class lines.\nThe first American attempt at a world's fair in Philadelphia in 1876 drew crowds, but was a financial failure. Nonetheless, ideas about distinguishing the 400th anniversary of Columbus' landing started in the late 1880s. Civic leaders in St. Louis, New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago expressed interest in hosting a fair to generate profits, boost real estate values, and promote their cities. Congress was called on to decide the location. New York financiers J. P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and William Waldorf Astor, among others, pledged $15 million to finance the fair if Congress awarded it to New York, while Chicagoans Charles T. Yerkes, Marshall Field, Philip Armour, Gustavus Swift, and Cyrus McCormick, Jr., offered to finance a Chicago fair. What finally persuaded Congress was Chicago banker Lyman Gage, who raised several million additional dollars in a 24-hour period, over and above New York's final offer.\nChicago representatives not only fought for the world's fair for monetary reasons, but also for reasons of practicality. In a Senate hearing held in January 1890, representative Thomas Barbour Bryan argued that the most important qualities for a world's fair were \"abundant supplies of good air and pure water\", \"ample space, accommodations and transportation for all exhibits and visitors\". He argued that New York had too many obstructions, and Chicago would be able to use large amounts of land around the city where there was \"not a house to buy and not a rock to blast\" and that it would be located so that \"the artisan and the farmer and the shopkeeper and the man of humble means\" would be able to easily access the fair. Bryan continued to say that the fair was of \"vital interest\" to the West, and that the West wanted the location to be Chicago. The city spokesmen would continue to stress the essentials of a successful exposition and that only Chicago was fit to fill these exposition requirements.\nThe location of the fair was decided through several rounds of voting by the United States House of Representatives. The first ballot showed Chicago with a large lead over New York, St. Louis and Washington, D.C., but short of a majority. Chicago broke the 154-vote majority threshold on the eighth ballot, receiving 157 votes to New York's 107.\nThe exposition corporation and national exposition commission settled on Jackson Park and an area around it as the fair site. Daniel H. Burnham was selected as director of works, and George R. Davis as director-general. Burnham emphasized architecture and sculpture as central to the fair and assembled the period's top talent to design the buildings and grounds including Frederick Law Olmsted for the grounds. The temporary buildings were designed in an ornate neoclassical style and painted white, resulting in the fair site being referred to as the \"White City\".\nThe Exposition's offices set up shop in the upper floors of the Rand McNally Building on Adams Street, the world's first all-steel-framed skyscraper. Davis' team organized the exhibits with the help of G. Brown Goode of the Smithsonian. The Midway was inspired by the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition, which included ethnological \"villages\".\nCivil rights leaders protested the refusal to include an African American exhibit. Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Irvine Garland Penn, and Ferdinand Lee Barnet co-authored a pamphlet entitled \"The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the World's Columbian Exposition \u2013 The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature\" addressing the issue. Wells and Douglass argued, \"when it is asked why we are excluded from the World's Columbian Exposition, the answer is Slavery.\" Ten thousand copies of the pamphlet were circulated in the White City from the Haitian Embassy (where Douglass had been selected as its national representative), and the activists received responses from the delegations of England, Germany, France, Russia, and India.\nThe exhibition did include a limited number of exhibits put on by African Americans, including exhibits by the sculptor Edmonia Lewis, a painting exhibit by scientist George Washington Carver, and a statistical exhibit by Joan Imogen Howard. Black individuals were also featured in white exhibits, such as Nancy Green's portrayal of the character Aunt Jemima for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.\nOperation.\nThe fair opened in May and ran through October 30, 1893. Forty-six nations participated in the fair, which was the first world's fair to have national pavilions. They constructed exhibits and pavilions and named national \"delegates\"; for example, Haiti selected Frederick Douglass to be its delegate. The Exposition drew over 27 million visitors. The fair was originally meant to be closed on Sundays, but the Chicago Woman's Club petitioned that it stay open. The club felt that if the exposition was closed on Sunday, it would restrict those who could not take off work during the work-week from seeing it.\nThe exposition was located in Jackson Park and on the Midway Plaisance on in the neighborhoods of South Shore, Jackson Park Highlands, Hyde Park, and Woodlawn. Charles H. Wacker was the director of the fair. The layout of the fairgrounds was created by Frederick Law Olmsted, and the Beaux-Arts architecture of the buildings was under the direction of Daniel Burnham, Director of Works for the fair. Renowned local architect Henry Ives Cobb designed several buildings for the exposition. The director of the American Academy in Rome, Francis Davis Millet, directed the painted mural decorations. Indeed, it was a coming-of-age for the arts and architecture of the \"American Renaissance\", and it showcased the burgeoning neoclassical and Beaux-Arts styles.\nAssassination of mayor and end of fair.\nThe fair ended with the city in shock, as popular mayor Carter Harrison III was assassinated by Patrick Eugene Prendergast two days before the fair's closing. Closing ceremonies were canceled in favor of a public memorial service.\nJackson Park was returned to its status as a public park, in much better shape than its original swampy form. The lagoon was reshaped to give it a more natural appearance, except for the straight-line northern end where it still laps up against the steps on the south side of the Palace of Fine Arts/Museum of Science &amp; Industry building. The Midway Plaisance, a park-like boulevard which extends west from Jackson Park, once formed the southern boundary of the University of Chicago, which was being built as the fair was closing (the university has since developed south of the Midway). The university's football team, the Maroons, were the original \"Monsters of the Midway.\" The exposition is mentioned in the university's alma mater: \"The City White hath fled the earth, / But where the azure waters lie, / A nobler city hath its birth, / The City Gray that ne'er shall die.\"\nAttractions.\nThe World's Columbian Exposition was the first world's fair with an area for amusements that was strictly separated from the exhibition halls. This area, developed by a young music promoter, Sol Bloom, concentrated on Midway Plaisance and introduced the term \"midway\" to American English to describe the area of a carnival or fair where sideshows are located. It included carnival rides, among them the original Ferris Wheel, built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. This wheel was high and had 36 cars, each of which could accommodate 40 people. The importance of the Columbian Exposition is highlighted by the use of \"\" (\"Chicago wheel\") in many Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Chile in reference to the Ferris wheel. One attendee, George C. Tilyou, later credited the sights he saw on the Chicago midway for inspiring him to create America's first major amusement park, Steeplechase Park in Coney Island, New York.\nThe fair included life-size reproductions of Christopher Columbus' three ships, the \"Ni\u00f1a\" (real name \"Santa Clara\"), the \"Pinta\", and the \"Santa Mar\u00eda\". These were intended to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas. The ships were constructed in Spain and then sailed to America for the exposition. The celebration of Columbus was an intergovernmental project, coordinated by American special envoy William Eleroy Curtis, the Queen Regent of Spain, and Pope Leo XIII. The ships were a very popular exhibit.\nEadweard Muybridge gave a series of lectures on the Science of Animal Locomotion in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose on Midway Plaisance. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his moving pictures to a paying public. The hall was the first commercial movie theater. Also demonstrated was Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz's electrotachyscope, which used a Geissler tube to project the illusion of moving images.\nThe \"Street in Cairo\" included the popular dancer known as Little Egypt. She introduced America to the suggestive version of the belly dance known as the \"hootchy-kootchy\", to a tune said to have been improvised by Sol Bloom (and now more commonly associated with snake charmers) which he had composed when his dancers had no music to dance to. Bloom did not copyright the song, putting it immediately in the public domain. This led to Bloom becoming one of the earliest people in U.S. history to make large sums of money from shows which were reminiscent of stripteases.\nAlthough denied a spot at the fair, Buffalo Bill Cody decided to come to Chicago anyway, setting up his \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show\" just outside the edge of the exposition. Nearby, historian Frederick Jackson Turner gave academic lectures reflecting on the end of the frontier which Buffalo Bill represented.\nLouis Comfort Tiffany made his reputation with a stunning chapel designed and built for the Exposition. After the Exposition the Tiffany Chapel was sold several times, even going back to Tiffany's estate. It was eventually reconstructed and restored and in 1999 it was installed at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art.\nArchitect Kirtland Cutter's Idaho Building, a rustic log construction, was a popular favorite, visited by an estimated 18 million people. The building's design and interior furnishings were a major precursor of the Arts and Crafts movement.\nAnthropology.\nThere was an Anthropology Building at the World's Fair. Nearby, \"The Cliff Dwellers\" featured a rock and timber structure that was painted to recreate Battle Rock Mountain in Colorado, a stylized recreation of an American Indian cliff dwelling with pottery, weapons, and other relics on display. There was also an Eskimo display. There were also birch bark wigwams of the Penobscot tribe. Nearby was a working model Indian school, organized by the Office of Indian Affairs, that housed delegations of Native American students and their teachers from schools around the country for weeks at a time.\nRail.\nThe \"John Bull\" locomotive was displayed. It was only 62 years old, having been built in 1831. It was the first locomotive acquisition by the Smithsonian Institution. The locomotive ran under its own power from Washington, DC, to Chicago to participate, and returned to Washington under its own power again when the exposition closed. In 1981 it was the oldest surviving operable steam locomotive in the world when it ran under its own power again.\nA Baldwin 2-4-2 locomotive was showcased at the exposition, and subsequently the 2-4-2 type was known as the \"Columbia\".\nAn original frog switch and portion of the superstructure of the famous 1826 Granite Railway in Massachusetts could be viewed. This was the first commercial railroad in the United States to evolve into a common carrier without an intervening closure. The railway brought granite stones from a rock quarry in Quincy, Massachusetts, so that the Bunker Hill Monument could be erected in Boston. The frog switch is now on public view in East Milton Square, Massachusetts, on the original right-of-way of the Granite Railway.\nTransportation by rail was the major mode of transportation. A 26-track train station was built at the southwest corner of the fair. While trains from around the country would unload there, there was a local train to shuttle tourists from the Chicago Grand Central Station to the fair. The newly built Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad also served passengers from Congress Terminal to the fairgrounds at Jackson Park. The line exists today as part of the CTA Green Line.\nCountry and state exhibition buildings.\nForty-six countries had pavilions at the exposition. Norway participated by sending the \"Viking\", a replica of the Gokstad ship. It was built in Norway and sailed across the Atlantic Ocean by 12 men, led by Captain Magnus Andersen. In 1919, this ship was moved to Lincoln Park. It was relocated in 1996 to Good Templar Park in Geneva, Illinois, where it awaits renovation.\nThirty-four U.S. states also had their own pavilions. The work of noted feminist author Kate McPhelim Cleary was featured during the opening of the Nebraska Day ceremonies at the fair, which included a reading of her poem \"Nebraska\". Among the state buildings present at the fair were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas; each was meant to be architecturally representative of the corresponding states.\nFour United States territories also had pavilions located in one building: Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah.\nVisitors to the Louisiana Pavilion were each given a seedling of a cypress tree. This resulted in the spread of cypress trees to areas where they were not native. Cypress trees from those seedlings can be found in many areas of West Virginia, where they flourish in the climate.\nThe \"Illinois\" was a detailed, full-scale mockup of an \"Indiana\"-class battleship, constructed as a naval exhibit.\nGuns and artillery.\nThe German firm Krupp had a pavilion of artillery, which apparently had cost one million dollars to stage, including a coastal gun of 42\u00a0cm in bore (16.54\u00a0inches) and a length of 33 calibres (45.93 feet, 14 meters). A breech-loaded gun, it weighed 120.46 long tons (122.4 metric tons). According to the company's marketing: \"It carried a charge projectile weighing from 2,200 to 2,500 pounds which, when driven by 900 pounds of brown powder, was claimed to be able to penetrate at 2,200 yards a wrought-iron plate three feet thick if placed at right angles.\"\nNicknamed \"The Thunderer\", the gun had an advertised range of 15 miles. On this occasion John Schofield declared Krupps' guns \"the greatest peacemakers in the world\". This gun was later seen as a precursor of the company's World War I Dicke Berta howitzers.\nReligions.\nThe 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions, which ran from September 11 to September 27, marked the first formal gathering of representatives of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions from around the world. According to Eric J. Sharpe, Tomoko Masuzawa, and others, the event was considered radical at the time, since it allowed non-Christian faiths to speak on their own behalf. For example, it is recognized as the first public mention of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in North America; it was not taken seriously by European scholars until the 1960s.\nMoving walkway.\nAlong the banks of the lake ran a moving walkway designed by architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee, the first of its kind open to the public. Called \"The Great Wharf, Moving Sidewalk\", it carried patrons to the casino and allowed people to walk along or ride in seats.\nHorticulture.\nHorticultural exhibits at the Horticultural Hall included cacti and orchids as well as other plants in a greenhouse.\nArchitecture.\nWhite City.\nMost of the buildings of the fair were designed in the neoclassical architecture style. The area at the Court of Honor was known as The White City. Fa\u00e7ades were made not of stone, but of a mixture of plaster, cement, and jute fiber called staff, which was painted white, giving the buildings their \"gleam\". Architecture critics derided the structures as \"decorated sheds.\" The buildings were clad in white stucco, which, in comparison to the tenements of Chicago, seemed illuminated. It was also called the White City because of the extensive use of street lights, which made the boulevards and buildings usable at night.\nIn 1892, working under extremely tight deadlines to complete construction, director of works Daniel Burnham appointed Francis Davis Millet to replace the fair's official director of color-design, William Pretyman. Pretyman had resigned following a dispute with Burnham. After experimenting, Millet settled on a mix of oil and white lead whitewash that could be applied using compressed air spray painting to the buildings, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting. Joseph Binks, maintenance supervisor at Chicago's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store, who had been using this method to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store, got the job to paint the Exposition buildings. Claims this was the first use of spray painting may be apocryphal since journals from that time note this form of painting had already been in use in the railroad industry from the early 1880s.\nMany of the buildings included sculptural details and, to meet the Exposition's opening deadline, chief architect Burnham sought the help of Chicago Art Institute instructor Lorado Taft to help complete them. Taft's efforts included employing a group of talented women sculptors from the Institute known as \"the White Rabbits\" to finish some of the buildings, getting their name from Burnham's comment \"Hire anyone, even white rabbits if they'll do the work.\"\nThe words \"Thine alabaster cities gleam\" from the song \"America the Beautiful\" were inspired by the White City.\nRole in the City Beautiful movement.\nThe White City is largely credited for ushering in the City Beautiful movement and planting the seeds of modern city planning. The highly integrated design of the landscapes, promenades, and structures provided a vision of what is possible when planners, landscape architects, and architects work together on a comprehensive design scheme.\nThe White City inspired cities to focus on the beautification of the components of the city in which municipal government had control; streets, municipal art, public buildings, and public spaces. The designs of the City Beautiful Movement (closely tied with the municipal art movement) are identifiable by their classical architecture, plan symmetry, picturesque views, and axial plans, as well as their magnificent scale. Where the municipal art movement focused on beautifying one feature in a city, the City Beautiful movement began to make improvements on the scale of the district. The White City of the World's Columbian Exposition inspired the Merchants Club of Chicago to commission Daniel Burnham to create the Plan of Chicago in 1909.\nGreat buildings.\nThere were fourteen main \"great buildings\" centered around a giant reflective pool called the Grand Basin. Buildings included:\nTransportation Building.\nLouis Sullivan's polychrome proto-Modern Transportation Building was an outstanding exception to the prevailing style, as he tried to develop an organic American form. Years later, in 1922, he wrote that the classical style of the White City had set back modern American architecture by forty years.\nAs detailed in Erik Larson's popular history \"The Devil in the White City\", extraordinary effort was required to accomplish the exposition, and much of it was unfinished on opening day. The famous Ferris Wheel, which proved to be a major attendance draw and helped save the fair from bankruptcy, was not finished until June, because of waffling by the board of directors the previous year on whether to build it. Frequent debates and disagreements among the developers of the fair added many delays. The spurning of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show proved a serious financial mistake. Buffalo Bill set up his highly popular show next door to the fair and brought in a great deal of revenue that he did not have to share with the developers. Nonetheless, construction and operation of the fair proved to be a windfall for Chicago workers during the serious economic recession that was sweeping the country.\nSurviving structures.\nAlmost all of the fair's structures were designed to be temporary; of the more than 200 buildings erected for the fair, the only two which still stand in place are the Palace of Fine Arts and the World's Congress Auxiliary Building. From the time the fair closed until 1920, the Palace of Fine Arts housed the Field Columbian Museum (now the Field Museum of Natural History, since relocated); in 1933 (having been completely rebuilt in permanent materials), the Palace building re-opened as the Museum of Science and Industry. The second building, the World's Congress Building, was one of the few buildings not built in Jackson Park, instead it was built downtown in Grant Park. The cost of construction of the World's Congress Building was shared with the Art Institute of Chicago, which, as planned, moved into the building (the museum's current home) after the close of the fair.\nThe three other significant buildings that survived the fair represented Norway, the Netherlands, and the State of Maine. The Norway Building was a recreation of a traditional wooden stave church. After the Fair it was relocated to Lake Geneva, and in 1935 was moved to a museum called Little Norway in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. In 2015 it was dismantled and shipped back to Norway, where it was restored and reassembled. The second is the Maine State Building, designed by Charles Sumner Frost, which was purchased by the Ricker family of Poland Spring, Maine. They moved the building to their resort to serve as a library and art gallery. The Poland Spring Preservation Society now owns the building, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The third is The Dutch House, which was moved to Brookline, Massachusetts.\nThe 1893 Viking ship that was sailed to the Exposition from Norway by Captain Magnus Andersen is located in Geneva, Illinois. The ship is open to visitors on scheduled days April through October.\nThe main altar at St. John Cantius in Chicago, as well as its matching two side altars, are reputed to be from the Columbian Exposition.\nSince many of the other buildings at the fair were intended to be temporary, they were removed after the fair. The White City so impressed visitors (at least before air pollution began to darken the fa\u00e7ades) that plans were considered to refinish the exteriors in marble or some other material. These plans were abandoned in July 1894, when much of the fair grounds was destroyed in a fire.\nLater criticisms.\nFrank Lloyd Wright later wrote that \"By this overwhelming rise of grandomania I was confirmed in my fear that a native architecture would be set back at least fifty years.\"\nAccording to University of Notre Dame history professor Gail Bederman, the event symbolized a male-dominated and Eurocentrist society. In her 1995 text \"Manliness and Civilization\", she writes, \"The White City, with its vision of future perfection and of the advanced racial power of manly commerce and technology, constructed civilization as an ideal of white male power,\" though this critique largely overlooked the contributions within The Woman's Building.\nAccording to Bederman, people of color were barred entirely from participating in the organization of the White City and were instead given access only to the Midway exhibit, \"which specialized in spectacles of barbarous races \u2013 'authentic' villages of Samoans, Egyptians, Dahomans, Turks, and other exotic peoples, populated by actual imported 'natives.'\" Again, this sociopolitical commentary ignored the contributions of Japanese culture.\nTwo small exhibits were included in the White City's \"Woman's Building\" which addressed women of color. One, entitled \"Afro-American\" was installed in a distant corner of the building. The other, called \"Woman's Work in Savagery,\" included baskets, weavings, and African, Polynesian, and Native American arts. Though they were produced by living women of color, the materials were represented as relics from the distant past, embodying \"the work of white women's own distant evolutionary foremothers.\"\nVisitors.\nHelen Keller, along with her mentor Anne Sullivan and Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, visited the fair in summer 1893. Keller described the fair in her autobiography \"The Story of My Life\". Early in July, a Wellesley College English teacher named Katharine Lee Bates visited the fair. The White City later inspired the reference to \"alabaster cities\" in her poem and lyrics \"America the Beautiful\". The exposition was extensively reported by Chicago publisher William D. Boyce's reporters and artists. There is a very detailed and vivid description of all facets of this fair by the Persian traveler Mirza Mohammad Ali Mo'in ol-Saltaneh written in Persian. He departed from Persia on April 20, 1892, especially for the purpose of visiting the World's Columbian Exposition.\nPierre de Coubertin visited the fair with his friends Paul Bourget and Samuel Jean de Pozzi. He devotes the first chapter of his book \"Souvenirs d'Am\u00e9rique et de Gr\u00e8ce\" (1897) to the visit. Swami Vivekananda visited the fair to attend the Parliament of the World's Religions and delivered his famous speech \"Sisters and Brothers of America!\". Kubota Beisen was an official delegate of Japan. As an artist, he sketched hundreds of scenes, some of which were later used to make woodblock print books about the Exhibition. Serial killer H. H. Holmes attended the fair with two of his eventual victims, Annie and Minnie Williams.\nBulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov visited the fair and wrote his nonfiction book \"To Chicago and Back\".\nSouvenirs.\nExamples of exposition souvenirs can be found in various American museum collections. One example, copyrighted in 1892 by John W. Green, is a folding hand fan with detailed illustrations of landscapes and architecture. Charles W Goldsmith produced a set of ten postcard designs, each in full colour, showing the buildings constructed for the exhibition. Columbian Exposition coins were also minted for the event.\nElectricity.\nThe effort to power the Fair with electricity, which became a demonstration piece for Westinghouse Electric and the alternating current system they had been developing for many years, took place at the end of what has been called the War of the currents between DC and AC. Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid to power the Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current-based system.\nEdison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US$1.72 million bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current. After the Fair committee went over both proposals, Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse underbid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract. Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs. Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground-glass stopper in one end, based on a Sawyer-Man \"stopper\" lamp patent they already had. The lamps worked well but were short-lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them.\nWestinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified, including twelve 1,000-horsepower single-phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required. They also had to fend off a last-minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer-Man-based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.\nThe International Exposition was held in an Electricity Building which was devoted to electrical exhibits. A statue of Benjamin Franklin was displayed at the entrance. The exposition featured interior and exterior light and displays as well as displays of Thomas Edison's kinetoscope, search lights, a seismograph, electric incubators for chicken eggs, and Morse code telegraph.\nAll the exhibits were from commercial enterprises. Participants included General Electric, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse. The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems. The exhibits included a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor). The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current. Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.\nPart of the space occupied by the Westinghouse Company was devoted to demonstrations of electrical devices developed by Nikola Tesla including induction motors and the generators used to power the system. The rotating magnetic field that drove these motors was explained through a series of demonstrations including an \"Egg of Columbus\" that used the two-phase coil in the induction motors to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.\nTesla himself showed up for a week in August to attend the International Electrical Congress, being held at the fair's Agriculture Hall, and put on a series of demonstrations of his wireless lighting system in a specially set up darkened room at the Westinghouse exhibit. These included demonstrations he had previously performed throughout America and Europe including using a nearby coil to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp held in his hand.\nAlso at the Fair, the Chicago Athletic Association Football team played one of the first night football games against West Point (the earliest being on September 28, 1892, between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary). Chicago won the game, 14\u20130. The game lasted only 40 minutes, compared to the normal 90 minutes.\nMusic.\nMusicians.\nThere were many other black artists at the fair, ranging from minstrel and early ragtime groups to more formal classical ensembles to street buskers.\nArt.\nAmerican artists exhibiting.\nPainters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nJapanese art.\nJapan's artistic contribution was mainly in porcelain, cloisonn\u00e9 enamel, metalwork and embroidery. While 55 paintings and 24 sculptures came from Japan, 271 of the 290 exhibits in the Palace of Fine Arts were Japanese. Artists represented included Miyagawa Kozan, Yabu Meizan, Namikawa S\u014dsuke, and Suzuki Chokichi.\nWomen artists exhibiting.\nThe women artists at the Woman's Building included Anna Lownes, Viennese painter Rosa Schweninger, and many others. American composer Amy Cheney Beach was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers of the fair to compose a choral work (Festival Jubilate, op. 17) for the opening of the Woman's Building. The Mrs Potts sad-iron system was on display. Ami Mali Hicks' stencil design was selected to adorn the frieze in the assembly room of the Women's Building. Musicologist Anna Morsch and composer Charlotte Sporleder presented a program of German music.\nThe Woman's Building included a Woman's Building Library Exhibit, which had 7,000 books \u2013 all by women. The Woman's Building Library was meant to show the cumulative contribution of the world's women to literature.\n\"Greatest Refrigerator on Earth\" fire tragedy.\nA large Romanesque structure called \"Greatest Refrigerator on Earth\" stored thousands of pounds of the Exposition's food and held an ice-skating rink for patrons. The large structure demonstrated artificial freezing, a recent development, and was planned by architect Franklin P. Burnham. The structure's floor space was and its height reached almost . On the evening of July 10, 1893, the \"Greatest Refrigerator on Earth\" caught fire. Two firemen entered, one sliding down a rope and another on a line of hose, and both were trapped in the burning refrigerator. A total of fifteen people died, twelve firefighters and three civilians, in front of a crowd of more than a thousand fairgoers. The only artifact that survived the fire was a twelve-foot copper statue of Christopher Columbus, which was kept as a monument to the men who lost their lives and is kept by the fire museum of Chicago.\nLater years.\nThe exposition was one influence leading to the rise of the City Beautiful movement. Results included grand buildings and fountains built around Olmstedian parks, shallow pools of water on axis to central buildings, larger park systems, broad boulevards and parkways and, after the start of the 20th century, zoning laws and planned suburbs. Examples of the City Beautiful movement's works include the City of Chicago, the Columbia University campus, and the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\nAfter the fair closed, J.C. Rogers, a banker from Wamego, Kansas, purchased several pieces of art that had hung in the rotunda of the U.S. Government Building. He also purchased architectural elements, artifacts and buildings from the fair. He shipped his purchases to Wamego. Many of the items, including the artwork, were used to decorate his theater, now known as the Columbian Theatre.\nMemorabilia such as books, tokens, published photographs, and well-printed admission tickets saved by guests are popular among collectors.\nThe George Washington University maintains a small collection of exposition tickets for viewing and research purposes. The collection is currently cared for by GWU's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.\nWhen the exposition ended the Ferris Wheel was moved to Chicago's north side, next to an exclusive neighborhood. An unsuccessful Circuit Court action was filed against the owners of the wheel to have it moved. The wheel stayed there until it was moved to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair.\nThe Columbian Exposition has celebrated many anniversaries since the fair in 1893. The Chicago Historical Society held an exhibition to commemorate the fair. The Grand Illusions exhibition was centered around the idea that the Columbian Exposition was made up of a series of illusions. The commemorative exhibition contained partial reconstructions, a video detailing the fair, and a catalogue similar to the one sold at the World's Fair of 1893.\nAcademic views.\nHenry Adams wrote in his 1907 \"Education\": \"The Exposition denied philosophy ... [S]ince Noah\u2019s Ark, no such Babel of loose and ill-jointed, such vague and ill-defined and unrelated thoughts and half-thoughts and experimental out-cries... had ruffled the surface of the Lakes.\"128\nMichel-Rolph Trouillot wrote that the academic aspect of the event was not very important, even though the Harvard Peabody Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and Franz Boas made contributions.128\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Data processing is a form of \"information processing\", which is the modification (processing) of information in any manner detectable by an observer.\nFunctions.\nData processing may involve various processes, including:\nHistory.\nThe United States Census Bureau history illustrates the evolution of data processing from manual through electronic procedures.\nManual data processing.\nAlthough widespread use of the term \"data processing\" dates only from the 1950s, data processing functions have been performed manually for millennia. For example, bookkeeping involves functions such as posting transactions and producing reports like the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. Completely manual methods were augmented by the application of mechanical or electronic calculators. A person whose job was to perform calculations manually or using a calculator was called a \"computer.\"\nThe 1890 United States census schedule was the first to gather data by individual rather than household. A number of questions could be answered by making a check in the appropriate box on the form. From 1850 to 1880 the Census Bureau employed \"a system of tallying, which, by reason of the increasing number of combinations of classifications required, became increasingly complex. Only a limited number of combinations could be recorded in one tally, so it was necessary to handle the schedules 5 or 6 times, for as many independent tallies.\" \"It took over 7 years to publish the results of the 1880 census\" using manual processing methods.\nAutomatic data processing.\nThe term \"automatic data processing\" was applied to operations performed by means of unit record equipment, such as Herman Hollerith's application of punched card equipment for the 1890 United States census. \"Using Hollerith's punchcard equipment, the Census Office was able to complete tabulating most of the 1890 census data in 2 to 3 years, compared with 7 to 8 years for the 1880 census. It is estimated that using Hollerith's system saved some $5 million in processing costs\" in 1890 dollars even though there were twice as many questions as in 1880.\nComputerized data processing.\nComputerized data processing, or electronic data processing represents a later development, with a computer used instead of several independent pieces of equipment. The Census Bureau first made limited use of electronic computers for the 1950 United States census, using a UNIVAC I system, delivered in 1952.\nOther developments.\nThe term \"data processing\" has mostly been subsumed by the more general term \"information technology\" (IT). The older term \"data processing\" is suggestive of older technologies. For example, in 1996 the \"Data Processing Management Association\" (DPMA) changed its name to the \"Association of Information Technology Professionals\". Nevertheless, the terms are approximately synonymous.\nApplications.\nCommercial data processing.\nCommercial data processing involves a large volume of input data, relatively few computational operations, and a large volume of output. For example, an insurance company needs to keep records on tens or hundreds of thousands of policies, print and mail bills, and receive and post payments.\nData analysis.\nIn science and engineering, the terms \"data processing\" and \"information systems\" are considered too broad, and the term \"data processing\" is typically used for the initial stage followed by a data analysis in the second stage of the overall data handling.\nData analysis uses specialized algorithms and statistical calculations that are less often observed in a typical general business environment. For data analysis, software suites like SPSS or SAS, or their free counterparts such as DAP, gretl, or PSPP are often used. These tools are usually helpful for processing various huge data sets, as they are able to handle enormous amount of statistical analysis.\nSystems.\nA data processing system is a combination of machines, people, and processes that for a set of inputs produces a defined set of outputs. The inputs and outputs are interpreted as data, facts, information etc. depending on the interpreter's relation to the system.\nA term commonly used synonymously with \"data or storage (codes) processing system\" is \"information system\". With regard particularly to electronic data processing, the corresponding concept is referred to as electronic data processing system.\nExamples.\nSimple example.\nA very simple example of a data processing system is the process of maintaining a check register. Transactions\u2014 checks and deposits\u2014 are recorded as they occur and the transactions are summarized to determine a current balance. Monthly the data recorded in the register is reconciled with a hopefully identical list of transactions processed by the bank.\nA more sophisticated record keeping system might further identify the transactions\u2014 for example deposits by source or checks by type, such as charitable contributions. This information might be used to obtain information like the total of all contributions for the year.\nThe important thing about this example is that it is a \"system\", in which, all transactions are recorded consistently, and the same method of bank reconciliation is used each time.\nReal-world example.\nThis is a flowchart of a data processing system combining manual and computerized processing to handle accounts receivable, billing, and general ledger\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "41962", "revid": "50993363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41962", "title": "Chicago River", "text": "System of rivers and canals in Chicago\nThe Chicago River is a system of rivers and canals with a combined length of that runs through the city of Chicago, including its center (the Chicago Loop). The river is one of the reasons for Chicago's geographic importance: the related Chicago Portage is a link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Basin, and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn 1887, the Illinois General Assembly decided to reverse the flow of the Chicago River through civil engineering by taking water from Lake Michigan and discharging it into the Mississippi River watershed, partly in response to concerns created by an extreme weather event in 1885 that threatened the city's water supply. In 1889, the state created the Chicago Sanitary District (now the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District) to replace the Illinois and Michigan Canal with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, a much larger waterway, because the former had become inadequate to serve the city's increasing sewage and commercial navigation needs. Completed by 1900, the project reversed the flow of the main stem and South Branch and altered the flow of the North Branch by using a series of canal locks and pumping stations, increasing the flow from Lake Michigan into the river, causing the river to empty into the new canal instead. In 1999, the system was named a \"Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium\" by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).\nThe river is represented on the municipal flag of Chicago by two horizontal blue stripes. Its three branches serve as the inspiration for the municipal device, a three-branched, Y-shaped symbol that is found on many buildings and other structures throughout Chicago.\nCourse.\nWhen it followed its natural course, the North and South Branches of the Chicago River converged at Wolf Point to form the main stem, which jogged southward from the present course of the river to avoid a baymouth bar, entering Lake Michigan at about the level of present-day Madison Street. Today, the main stem of the Chicago River flows west from Lake Michigan to Wolf Point, where it converges with the North Branch to flow into the South Branch, where the river's course goes south and west to empty in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.\nNorth Branch.\nEarly settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River, or Gary's River, after a trader who may have settled the west bank of the river a short distance north of Wolf Point, at what is now Fulton Street. The source of the North Branch is in the northern suburbs of Chicago where its three principal tributaries converge. The Skokie River\u2014or East Fork\u2014rises from a flat plain, historically a wetland, near Park City, Illinois to the west of the city of Waukegan. It then flows southward, paralleling the shore of Lake Michigan, through wetlands, the Greenbelt Forest Preserve and a number of golf courses towards Highland Park, Illinois. South of Highland Park the river passes the Chicago Botanic Gardens and through an area of former marshlands known as the Skokie Lagoons. From the west, the Middle Fork arises near Rondout, Illinois and flows southwards through Lake Forest and Highland Park. The two tributaries of the North and Middle forks merge at the Watersmeet Woods forest preserve west of Wilmette. From there the North Branch flows south towards Morton Grove. The third tributary, the West Fork, rises near Mettawa and flows south through Lincolnshire, Bannockburn, Deerfield, and Northbrook, meeting the North Branch at Morton Grove. In recognition of the work of Ralph Frese in promoting canoeing on and conservation of Chicago-area rivers, the forest preserve district of Cook County, Illinois has designated a section of the East Fork and North Branch from Willow Road in Northfield to Dempster Street in Morton Grove the \"Ralph Frese River Trail\".\nThe North Branch continues southwards through Niles, entering the city of Chicago near the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue and Devon Avenue, from where it serves as the boundary of the Forest Glen community area with Norwood Park and Jefferson Park. This stretch of the river meanders in a south-easterly direction, passing through golf courses and forest preserves until it reaches Foster Avenue, where it passes through residential neighborhoods on the north side of the Albany Park community area. In River Park the river meets the North Shore Channel, a canal with water pumped from Lake Michigan (at Wilmette), built between 1907 and 1910 to increase the flow of the North Branch and help flush it into the South Branch and from there to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. From the confluence with the North Shore Channel south to Belmont Avenue the North Branch flows through mostly residential neighborhoods in a man-made channel that was dug to straighten and deepen the river, helping it to carry the additional flow from the North Shore Channel.\nSouth of Belmont the North Branch is lined with a mixture of residential developments, retail parks, and industry until it reaches the industrial area known as the Clybourn Corridor. Here it passes beneath the Cortland Street Drawbridge, which was the first \"Chicago-style\" fixed-trunnion bascule bridge built in the United States, and is designated as an ASCE Civil Engineering Landmark and a Chicago Landmark.\nAt North Avenue, south of the North Avenue Bridge, the North Branch divides: the original course of the river makes a curve along the west side of Goose Island, whilst the North Branch Canal cuts off the bend, forming the island. The North Branch Canal\u2014or Ogden's Canal\u2014was completed in 1857, and was originally wide and deep, allowing craft navigating the river to avoid the bend. The 1902 Cherry Avenue Bridge, just south of North Avenue, was constructed to carry the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway onto Goose Island. It is a rare example of an asymmetric bob-tail swing bridge and was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007. From Goose Island the North Branch continues to flow south east to Wolf Point where it joins the main stem.\nMain stem.\nSince the late 19th century, the source of the main stem of the Chicago River is Lake Michigan. Water enters the river through sluice gates at the Chicago River Controlling Works with a small additional flow provided for the passage of boats between the river and Lake Michigan through the Chicago Harbor Lock. The surface level of the river is maintained at below the Chicago City Datum ( above mean sea level) except for when there is excessive storm run-off into the river or when the level of the lake is more than 2 feet below the Chicago City Datum. Acoustic velocity meters at the Columbus Drive Bridge and the T. J. O'Brien lock on the Calumet River monitor the diversion of water from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River basin, which is limited to an average of per second per year over the 40-year period from 1980 to 2020.\nThe main stem flows west from the controlling works at Lake Michigan; passing beneath the Outer Drive, Columbus Drive, Michigan Avenue, Wabash Avenue, State Street, Dearborn Street, Clark Street, La Salle Street, Wells Street, and Franklin Street bridges \"en route\" to its confluence with the North Branch at Wolf Point. At McClurg Court it passes the Centennial Fountain, which was built in 1989 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago; between May and October the fountain sends an arc of water over the river for ten minutes every hour. On the north bank of the river, near the Chicago Landmark Michigan Avenue Bridge, is Pioneer Court, which marks the site of the homestead of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable who is recognized as the founder of Chicago. On the south bank of the river is the site of Fort Dearborn, an army fort, first established in 1803. Notable buildings surrounding this area include the NBC Tower, the Tribune Tower, and the Wrigley Building. The river turns slightly to the south west between Michigan Avenue and State Street, passing the Trump International Hotel and Tower, 35 East Wacker, and 330 North Wabash. Turning west again the river passes Marina City, the Reid, Murdoch &amp; Co. Building, and Merchandise Mart, and 333 Wacker Drive.\nSince the early 2000s, the south shore of the main stem has been developed as the Chicago Riverwalk. It provides a linear, lushly landscaped park intended to offer a peaceful escape from the busy Loop and a tourist attraction. Different sections are named Market, Civic, Arcade, and Confluence. The plans reflect ideas first proposed by the Burnham Plan as early as 1909.\nSouth Branch.\nBefore reversal, the South Branch generally arose with joining forks in the marshy area called Mud Lake to flow to where it met the North Branch at Wolf Point forming the main branch. Since reversal, the source of the South Branch of the Chicago River is the confluence of the North Branch and main stem at Wolf Point. From here the river flows south passing the Lake Street, Randolph Street, Washington Street, Madison Street, Monroe Street, Adams Street, Jackson Boulevard, Van Buren Street, Ida B. Wells Drive, and Harrison Street bridges before leaving the downtown Loop community area. Notable buildings that line this stretch of the river include the Boeing Company World Headquarters, the Civic Opera House, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Union Station and Willis Tower.\nThe river continues southwards past railroad yards and the St. Charles Air Line Bridge. Between Polk and 18th Streets the river originally made a meander to the east; between 1927 and 1929 the river was straightened and moved west at this point to make room for a railroad terminal. The river turns to the southwest at Ping Tom Memorial Park where it passes under the Chicago Landmark Canal Street railroad bridge. The river turns westward where it is crossed by the Dan Ryan Expressway; these immovable bridges have a clearance of requiring large ships that pass underneath to have folding masts.\nAt Ashland Avenue the river widens to form the U.S. Turning Basin, the west bank of which was the starting point of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Prior to 1983, this was where the US Coast Guard Rules of the Road, Great Lakes ended &amp; Rules of the Road, Western Rivers began. Since 1983, there is just a single Inland Navigational Rules passed by Congressional Act in 1980 (Public Law 96-591). At the basin the river is joined by a tributary, the South Fork of the river, which is commonly given the nickname Bubbly Creek. A bridge used to span the South Fork at this point that was too low for boats to pass meaning that their cargo needed to be unloaded at the bridge, and the neighborhood at its east end became known as Bridgeport. The river continues to the south west, entering the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal at Damen Avenue. The original West Fork of the South Branch, which before 1935 led towards Mud Lake and the Chicago Portage, has been filled in; a triangular intrusion into the north bank at Damen Avenue marks the place where it diverged from the course of the canal. From there, the water flows down the canal through the southwest side of Chicago and southwestern suburbs and, in time, into the Des Plaines River between Crest Hill on the west and Lockport on the east, just north of the border between Crest Hill and Joliet, Illinois, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico.\nDischarge.\nThe United States Geological Survey monitors water flow at a number of sites in the Chicago River system. Discharge from the North Branch is measured at Grand Avenue; between 2004 and 2010 this averaged per second. During the winter months as much as 75% of the flow in the North Branch is due to the discharge of treated sewage from the North Side Water Reclamation Plant into the North Shore Channel. Flow on the main stem is measured at Columbus Drive; between 2000 and 2006 this averaged per second.\nHistory.\nName.\nThe name Chicago derives from the 17th century French rendering of \"shikaakwa\" or \"chicagou\", the Native American name for ramps (\"Allium tricoccum\"), a type of edible wild leek, which grew abundantly near the river. The river, and its region, were named after the plant.\nExploration and settlement.\nLouis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, though probably not the first Europeans to visit the area, are the first recorded to have visited the Chicago River in 1673, when they wrote of their discovery of the geographically vital Chicago Portage. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days near the mouth of the river, then moved on to the Chicago River\u2013Des Plaines River portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674\u201375. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans in the first part of the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. In 1823 a government expedition used the name Gary River (phonetic spelling of \"Guillory\") to refer to the north branch of the Chicago River.\nJean Baptiste Point du Sable is widely regarded as the first permanent resident of Chicago; he built a farm on the northern bank at the mouth of the river in the 1780s. The earliest known record of Pointe du Sable living in Chicago is the diary of Hugh Heward, who made a journey through Illinois in the spring of 1790. Antoine Ouilmette claimed to have arrived in Chicago shortly after this in July 1790.\nIn 1795, in a then minor part of the Treaty of Greenville, an Indian confederation granted treaty rights to the United States, to a parcel of land at the mouth of the \"Chicago River\". This was followed by the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis and Treaty of Chicago, which ceded additional land in the Chicago area. In 1803, Fort Dearborn was constructed on the bank opposite what had been Point du Sable's settlement, on the site of the present-day Michigan Avenue Bridge. Lieutenant James Strode Swearingen, who led the troops from Detroit to Chicago to establish the fort, described the river as being about wide and upwards of deep at the place where the fort was intended to be built; the riverbanks were high on the south side and on the north.\nEarly modifications.\nBetween 1816 and 1828 soldiers from Fort Dearborn cut channels through the sandbar at the mouth of the river to allow yawls to bring supplies to the fort. These channels rapidly clogged with sand requiring a new one to be cut. On March 2, 1833, $25,000 was appropriated by Congress for harbor works, and work began in June of that year under the supervision of Major George Bender, the commandant at Fort Dearborn. In January 1834 James Allen took over the supervision of this work and, aided by a February storm that breached the sandbar, on July 12, 1834, the harbor works had progressed enough to allow a schooner, the \"Illinois\" to sail up the river to Wolf Point and dock at the wharf of Newberry &amp; Dole. The initial entrance through the sandbar was wide and deep, flanked by piers long on the south wall and long to the north. Allen's work continued, and by October 1837 the still unfinished piers had been extended to respectively.\nIn 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal linked the river to the Illinois River and the Mississippi Valley across the Chicago Portage. This canal was the farthest west, and the last, of a series of United States' government land grant canals. It provided the only water route from New York City to New Orleans through the country's interior and Chicago.\nReversing the flow.\nDuring the last ice age, the area that became Chicago was covered by Lake Chicago, which drained south into the Mississippi Valley. As the ice and water retreated, a short ridge was exposed about a mile inland, which generally separated the Great Lakes' watershed from the Mississippi Valley, except in times of heavy precipitation or when winter ice flows prevented drainage. By the time Europeans arrived, the Chicago River flowed sluggishly into Lake Michigan from Chicago's flat plain. As Chicago grew, this allowed sewage and other pollution into the clean-water source for the city, contributing to several public health problems, like typhoid fever. Starting in 1848, much of the Chicago River's flow was also diverted across the Chicago Portage into the Illinois and Michigan Canal. In 1871, the old canal was deepened in an attempt to completely reverse the river's flow but the reversal of the river only lasted one season.\nFinally, in 1900, the Sanitary District of Chicago, then headed by William Boldenweck, completely reversed the flow of the main stem and South Branch of the river using a series of canal locks, increasing the river's flow from Lake Michigan and causing it to empty into the newly completed Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. In 1999, this system was named a \"Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium\" by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Before this time, the Chicago River was known by many local residents of Chicago as \"the stinking river\" because of the massive amounts of sewage and pollution that poured into the river from Chicago's booming industrial economy.\nThrough the 1980s, the river was quite dirty and often filled with garbage; however, during the 1990s, it underwent extensive cleaning as part of an effort at beautification by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.\nIn 2005, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign created a three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulation of the Chicago River, which suggested that density currents are the cause of an observed bi-directional wintertime flow in the river. At the surface, the river flows east to west, away from Lake Michigan, as expected. But deep below, near the riverbed, water seasonally travels west to east, toward the lake.\nAll outflows from the Great Lakes Basin are regulated by the joint U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes Commission, and the outflow through the Chicago River is set under a U.S. Supreme Court decision (1967, modified 1980 and 1997). The city of Chicago is allowed to remove of water from the Great Lakes system; about half of this, , is sent down the Chicago River, while the rest is used for drinking water. In late 2005, the Chicago-based Alliance for the Great Lakes proposed re-separating the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins to address such ecological concerns as the spread of invasive species.\n\"Eastland\" disaster.\nIn 1915, the SS \"Eastland\", an excursion steam-liner preparing to leave the dock on the south gangway between the Clark Street Bridge and La Salle Street Bridge, rolled over, killing 844 of the more than 2500 passengers. The roll of the heavy steamer happened very quickly and many of the passengers were trapped under water by the hull, moving objects such as pianos and tables, the crush of bodies, or their heavy clothes. Frantic if disordered rescue attempts ensued and early versions of what may be regarded as trauma teams formed to address the shocking scene. The site on the south bank at the southeast end of the La Salle Street Bridge is now the location of a memorial first dedicated in 1989.\nChicago flood of 1992.\nOn April 13, 1992, a flood occurred when a pile driven into the riverbed caused stress fractures in the wall of a long-abandoned tunnel of the Chicago Tunnel Company near the Kinzie Street railroad bridge (not to be confused with the Kinzie Street Bridge). Most of the network of underground freight railway, which encompasses much of downtown, was eventually flooded, along with the lower levels of buildings it once serviced and attached underground shops and pedestrian ways.\nBridges.\nThe first bridge across the Chicago River was constructed over the North Branch near the present day Kinzie Street in 1832. A second bridge, over the South Branch near Randolph Street, was added in 1833. The first moveable bridge was constructed across the main stem at Dearborn Street in 1834. Today, the Chicago River has 38 movable bridges spanning it, down from a peak of 52 bridges. These bridges are of several different types, including trunnion bascule, Scherzer rolling lift, swing bridges, and vertical-lift bridges.\nPollution.\nThe Chicago River has been highly affected by industrial and residential development with attendant changes to the quality of the water and riverbanks. Several species of freshwater fish are known to inhabit the river, including largemouth and smallmouth bass, rock bass, crappie, bluegill, catfish, and carp. The river also has a large population of crayfish. The South Fork of the Main (South) Branch, which was the primary sewer for the Union Stock Yards and the meat packing industry, was once so polluted that it became known as Bubbly Creek. Illinois has issued advisories regarding eating fish from the river due to PCB and mercury contamination, including a \"do not eat\" advisory for carp more than 12\u00a0inches long. There are concerns that silver carp and bighead carp, now invasive species in the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, may reach the Great Lakes through the Chicago River. A program on the north channel next to Goose Island seeks to increase wildlife habitat through the use of floating plant islands. The program is managed by the non-profit conservation group Urban Rivers with assistance from the Shedd Aquarium. As with some other bodies of water in the United States, the river has seen several successful efforts to improve water quality since the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972 and related state and local efforts.\nRecreation.\nDespite the pollution concerns, the Chicago River remains a very popular target for freshwater recreational fishing. In 2006, the Chicago Park District started the annual \"Mayor Daley's Chicago River Fishing Festival\", which has increased in popularity with each year. Between 2013 and 2016, the Chicago Park District opened four boat houses, two on the south branch and two on the north, for river recreation.\nDyeing the river.\nSaint Patrick's Day.\nAs part of a more than sixty-year-old Chicago tradition, the Chicago River is dyed green in observance of Saint Patrick's Day. Cook County, of which Chicago is the county seat, had the highest number of Irish Americans by county in the United States according to 2023 census data. The event occurs on the Saturday on or before March 17, when large celebratory crowds gather to watch the dyeing of the river, and then many go downtown to attend one of the holiday parades.\nThe tradition of dyeing the river green arose by accident in 1961 when plumbers were using fluorescein dye to trace sources of illegal pollution discharge into the river. The plumbers then proposed a continuing celebration to the administration of the city's Irish-American mayor Richard J. Daley. The dyeing of the river is still sponsored by the local plumbers union. Environmental concerns disallowed the use of fluorescein for this purpose, since it was shown to be harmful to the river. The parade committee switched to a mix involving forty pounds of powdered vegetable dye. Though the committee closely guards the exact formula, they insist that it has been tested and verified safe for the environment.\nThe environmental organization Friends of the Chicago River disapproves of dyeing the river, saying the practice \"gives the impression that it is lifeless and artificial\", adding \"Friends doesn't think that the river should be treated as a decoration for an annual holiday, but treasured and cared for as the wonderful natural and recreational resource it deserves to be\".\nIn 2009, First Lady Michelle Obama, a Chicago native, inspired by the river tradition, requested that the water in the White House fountains be dyed green to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day.\nChicago Cubs rally.\nFor the Chicago Cubs rally and parade for their 2016 World Series Championship celebrations, the river was dyed Cubs blue. Friends of the Chicago River executive director Margaret Frisbie told the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", \"We do not want to set a precedent where, every time we want to celebrate, we dye the river a different color and potentially hurt the aquatic life that lives in it. While it may seem festive, it's actually potentially harming a natural resource.\"\nMcCormick Bridgehouse and Chicago River Museum.\nThe southwest bridgehouse of the DuSable Bridge (Michigan Avenue) serves as a museum on the river, its history, its challenges, and its renaissance. The McCormick Bridgehouse &amp; Chicago River Museum is a 5-floor, 1,613-square-foot (149.9 m2) museum that opened on June 10, 2006; it is named for Robert R. McCormick, formerly owner of the \"Chicago Tribune\" and president of the Chicago Sanitary District. The Robert R. McCormick Foundation was the major donor that helped meet the $950,000 cost to open the museum. It is run by the Friends of the Chicago River, a non-profit environmental organization. Visitors are also allowed to access the bridge's gear room; during the spring and fall bridge lifting visitors can see the bridge gears in operation as the leaves are raised and lowered. Due to its small size and tight access stairway only 79 people are allowed inside the museum at any one time. In October 2019, Chicago Tribune cultural arts writer Steve Johnson profiled the museum, calling its gear room where the DuSable Bridge mechanics can be viewed \"a little chamber of heaven for infrastructure nerds\".\nMonitoring the impact of extreme weather events on the Chicago District.\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers have monitored the development of harbors and channels for navigation on the Great Lakes since the early 1800s. They began monitoring hydrological conditions and lake levels in 1918. A December 26, 2012 report revealed that Chicago District navigation infrastructure did receive significant impacts from Hurricane Sandy with some areas experiencing severe shoaling. Chicago Shoreline Project mitigated the damage of the storm event.\nThe same report noted that the low Great Lakes levels were drought-induced, caused by a very hot, dry summer and a lack of a solid snowpack in the winter of 2012. At the time of the report, December 2012, Lake Michigan-Huron was 28 inches below its long-term average which is near the record lows of 1964. Historic lake levels for Lake Michigan reported from 1918 to 1998 show that the low levels observed in 1964 were the lowest since 1918. In 2012 Lake Michigan-Huron's seasonal rise was about 4 inches where it usually is about 12 inches. Normally the Chicago River water level is two feet lower than the lake and therefore does not flow into the lake. If the lake level falls too low threatening to reverse the river flow, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago would be forced to close locks between the lake and river for longer periods of time, limiting navigation. A reversal flow of the Chicago River into Lake Michigan would have a negative impact on navigation and on the quality of Lake Michigan water, which is the source of drinking water. Chicago's raw sewage in the river is normally carried upstream toward the Mississippi River which flows south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On January 9, 2013, Chicago meteorologists announced 320 days without at least one inch of snowfall. Water levels in the lake started to level off with the river and sewage was visible at the cusp of the locks, just a few hundred feet from Lake Michigan. David St. Pierre, executive director of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago warned the low lake levels were nearing a point of real concern. However, the District maintains that it is not possible for the river to reverse due to low lake level alone.\nMeasurements taken by the US Army Corps of Engineers in January 2013 revealed that both Lake Michigan and Lake Huron had reached their \"lowest ebb since record keeping began in 1918, and the lakes could set additional records over the next few months, the corps said. The lakes were 74 centimetres (29 inches) below their long-term average and had declined 43 centimetres (17 inches) since January 2012\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "41963", "revid": "4904587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41963", "title": "Grant Park (Chicago)", "text": "Urban park in Illinois, US\nGrant Park is a large urban park in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. Located within the city's central business district, the park's features include Millennium Park, Buckingham Fountain, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum Campus.\nOriginally known as Lake Park, and dating from the city's founding, it was renamed in 1901 to honor U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant. The park's area has been expanded several times through land reclamation, and was the focus of several disputes in the late 19th century and early 20th century over open space use. It is bordered on the north by Randolph Street, on the south by Roosevelt Road and McFetridge Drive, on the west by Michigan Avenue and on the east by Lake Michigan. The park contains performance venues, gardens, art work, sporting, and harbor facilities. It hosts public gatherings and several large annual events.\nGrant Park is popularly referred to as \"Chicago's front yard\". It is governed by the Chicago Park District.\nHistory.\nThe original plans for the town of Chicago left the area east of Michigan Avenue unsubdivided and vacant, and purchasers of Michigan Avenue lots were promised that it would remain unoccupied. When the former Fort Dearborn Reserve became part of the townsite in 1839, the plan of the area east of Michigan Avenue south of Randolph was marked \"Public ground. Forever to remain vacant of buildings.\"\nThe city officially designated the land as a park on April 29, 1844, naming it Lake Park. When the Illinois Central Railroad was built into Chicago in 1852, it was permitted to lay track along the lakefront on a causeway built offshore from the park. The resulting lagoon became stagnant, and was largely filled in 1871 with debris from the Great Chicago Fire, increasing the parkland. In 1896, the city began extending the park into the lake with landfill, beyond the rail lines. On October 9, 1901, the park was renamed Grant Park in honor of American Civil War commanding General and United States President Ulysses S. Grant. At the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Grant had been nominated for his first presidential term.\nThe legal restrictions prohibiting any buildings in the park were ignored in the 19th century, as various civic buildings were sited there. At various times, a post office, exposition center, armory, and even an early home field of the baseball club now known as the Chicago Cubs were built in the park. A 1904 plan prepared by the Olmsted Brothers recommended locating the Field Museum as the park's centerpiece, an idea integrated into Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett's 1909 \"Plan of Chicago\". Chicago businessman Aaron Montgomery Ward ultimately fought four court battles, opposed by nearly every civic leader, to keep the park free of buildings. The one exception to which Ward consented was for the Art Institute of Chicago, constructed in 1892.\nIn the early 20th century, Grant Park was expanded with further landfill\u2014much of it from the excavations of the Chicago Tunnel Company\u2014and developed with a very formal landscape design by Edward Bennett. More land fill in the 1910s and 1920s provided sites for the Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, and Shedd Aquarium, which were linked together as the Museum Campus in 1998. In 2004, a section of northern Grant Park, previously occupied by Illinois Central railyards and parking lots, was covered and redeveloped as Millennium Park.\nEvents.\nThe park has been the site of many large civic events. It served as the staging ground for the city's funeral procession for President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. In 1911, the park hosted the major Chicago International Aviation Meet. In 1913 the AAU held the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. In 1959, to celebrate the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway and a related International Trade Fair, Queen Elizabeth II, disembarked here from the Royal Yacht \"Britannia\", giving the park's \"Queen's Landing\" its name. The park was the scene of clashes between Chicago Police and demonstrators during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Pope John Paul II celebrated an outdoor mass to a large crowd here in 1979. Championship celebrations were staged here for the Chicago Bulls during the 1990s, and the Chicago Blackhawks after winning the Stanley Cup in 2013. The park was the location for President Barack Obama's Election Day victory speech on the night of November 4, 2008. In 2015, Grant Park hosted the first outdoor National Football League (NFL) draft and a related festival. The Chicago Cubs held their rally for their World Series Championship win on November 4, 2016 with an estimated 5 million people attending the parade and event.\nThe park annually hosts some of Chicago's biggest festivals, including The Taste of Chicago\u2014a large food and music festival held each summer; the Grant Park Music Festival; the Chicago Jazz Festival; the Chicago Blues Festival; and Lollapalooza, a festival of rock concerts. The park is also the site of the start and finish lines of the Chicago Marathon. The annual NASCAR Chicago street race is held every year at Grant Park.\nFeatures.\nWith between the downtown Chicago Loop and Lake Michigan, Grant Park offers many different attractions in its large open space. The park is generally flat. It is also crossed by large boulevards and even a bed of sunken railroad tracks. While bridges are used to span the tracks, and to connect with Millennium Park, the rest of the park must be reached by pedestrians at traffic crossings, except for a spacious underpass connection to the Museum Campus. There are also several parking garages under the park, along Michigan Avenue and east of Columbus Drive.\nWhen the park was landscaped in the early 20th century in a formal beaux arts style, tall American Elms were planted in all\u00e9es and rectangular patterns. While hundreds of these trees still exist, reaching tall, they were devastated in the late 1970s by Dutch elm disease. Hybrid elms have since been used to replace those lost.\nMillennium Park.\nThe northwestern corner of the park was renovated from 1998 to 2004 to become Millennium Park, a contiguous area with a variety of artistic features by architects and artists. Millennium Park features the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, the \"Cloud Gate\" (aka \"The Bean\"), the \"Crown Fountain\", the Lurie Garden, and other attractions. The park is connected by the BP Pedestrian Bridge and the Nichols Bridgeway to other portions of Grant Park.\nMaggie Daley Park.\nAcross the BP Pedestrian Bridge from Millennium Park, the northeast corner of Grant Park hosts outdoor and indoor activities at what is now Maggie Daley Park, previously called Daley Bicentennial Plaza. Designed by landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh, attractions here include summer and winter skating rinks, an extensive playground, climbing walls, tennis and pickleball courts, and an activities building, which were redeveloped from 2012 to 2015.\nArt Institute of Chicago.\nBuilt in 1893 on the western edge of Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago is one of the premier art museums and art schools in the US, known especially for the extensive collection of Impressionist and American art, such as \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\", and Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\". The School of the Art Institute of Chicago has facilities in the southeast corner of the museum's Grant Park complex.\nBuckingham Fountain.\nThe center piece of Grant Park is Buckingham Fountain, one of the world's largest fountains. In a rococo wedding cake style, the fountain was dedicated in 1927 as a gift to the city from Kate Sturges Buckingham in memory of her brother Clarence. The fountain operates from April to October with water displays every 20 minutes and a light and water display from 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.\nMuseum Campus.\nChicago's Museum Campus is a addition to Grant Park's southeastern end. The Museum Campus is the site of three of the city's most notable museums, all dedicated to the natural sciences: Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, and Shedd Aquarium. A narrow isthmus along Solidarity Drive dominated by neoclassical sculptures of Ko\u015bciuszko, Havli\u010dek and Nicolaus Copernicus connects to Northerly Island where the planetarium is located to the east of the Museum Campus situated on the mainland.\nPetrillo Music Shell.\nLocated at Jackson and Columbus Drives, the Petrillo Music Shell hosts music performances during the Chicago Jazz Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, Taste of Chicago, and Lollapalooza. The music shell's seating area includes an area called Butler Field, the block bounded by Lake Shore Drive, Columbus Drive, Monroe Drive, and Jackson Drive. The previous Petrillo Bandshell structure faced Hutchinson Field at the south end of the park, near 1100 South Columbus Drive.\nCongress Plaza.\nCongress Plaza is a ceremonial entrance located on the park's western edge, at the Ida B. Wells Drive and Michigan Avenue intersection. Two semicircular plazas flanking Ida B. Wells Drive contain gardens, fountains, and artwork, including a pair of large bronze warrior statues, The Bowman and The Spearman that are positioned like gatekeepers to the park.\nGardens.\nThere are several gardens and flower displays throughout the park. Millennium Park houses the Lurie Garden, known for its display of tall grass flowers, particularly lavender, and a decorative post-modern water stream. To the east, across the BP Pedestrian Bridge, Daley Park holds tall grass plantings. To the northeast in Daley Park, at 375 East Randolph Drive, is the Richard &amp; Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Garden, marked by two huge doric columns from the demolished Chicago Federal Building and a wrought-iron pergola. The garden contains numerous walkways lined with planters and is one of several similar spaces created nationwide by R. A. Bloch Cancer Foundation.\nFlanking the original Art Institute of Chicago Building are gardens in the north and south McCormick Courtyards; in the south courtyard is the bronze sculpture Fountain of the Great Lakes. To the south of the art museum, along Michigan Avenue, are a succession of gardens. Two of these are not far from to Orchestra Hall and honor former conductors of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (Sir Georg Solti and Theodore Thomas).\nTo the southeast of the Art Institute, near the \"Court of Presidents\", are demonstration gardens that flank Ida B. Wells Drive and surrounding Buckingham Fountain are a series of formal gardens, including the Tiffany Celebration Garden to the south.\nThe Court of the Presidents.\nThe Court of the Presidents is located directly on the north and south side of E. Ida B. Wells Drive, west of S. Columbus Drive and east of S. Michigan Ave.\u00a0 Manicured gardens and art work help define the Court of Presidents. South President's Court, until recently, has primarily been gardens. However, within the past decade the city has decided to use the area to showcase art work by Chicagoans. While unique artwork has long been a tradition of Chicago's parks, South President's Court had the added benefit of showcasing \"in house\" art as its first newsworthy collection, entitled \"Artist and Automobiles.\" The collection, organized by the Public Art Program and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, consisted of sculptures composed entirely of parts found on old automobiles.\nHutchinson Field.\nMuch of the southern end of Grant Park is given over to Hutchinson Field, an open space for large events, with a dozen baseball or softball diamonds named for financier and long-time Art Institute President, Charles L. Hutchinson.\nChicago Lakefront Trail.\nA section of the Chicago Lakefront Trail, an 18-mile multi-use path along the city's Lake Michigan shoreline, runs through the park's eastern edge. The trail runs adjacent to Lake Shore Drive from Randolph Drive to Balbo Drive, then along the very edge of the seawall around the Shedd Aquarium. An underpass carries the trail under Solidarity Drive into Burnham Park.\nMarinas and harbors.\nTwo Lake Michigan marinas are accessed from Grant Park. Monroe Harbor provides 1000 mooring cans (served by tender service) and facilities in the expansive harbor east of the park. It is home to both the Chicago Yacht Club and the Columbia Yacht Club. \"Queen's Landing,\" at the center of the harbor and park's shoreline, is named for a 1959 visit there by Queen Elizabeth II aboard the Royal Yacht \"Britannia,\" in conjunction with the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Du Sable Harbor, created in 1999 north of Randolph Drive, offers 420 boat docks and a harbor store.\nSkate Plaza.\nThe Grant Park Skate Plaza, designed by Chicago Landscape Architects Altamanu, was opened on December 6, 2014. The Plaza was initiated by Grant Park Conservancy President, Robert O'Neill. The new park occupies and has replaced the former skate area near the tennis courts. The Conservancy sought planning support from local skateboarders and BMX bikers who formed the Grant Park Conservancy &amp; Advisory Council Skate Committee. The Plaza is located in the southwest corner of the park near the former site of the 1893 Central Station and includes limestone pieces from the former railroad terminal. The plaza cost $2.65 Million to build. In 2014, the park hosted both the Mountain Dew Skate Tour for its first return to Chicago since 2010 and the Volcom Wild in the Parks Tour for its first appearance in Chicago.\nDog park.\nGrant Bark Park, located on the corner of Columbus Drive and 11th Street, is a place for dogs to get their exercise. It's an off-leash park of . The park is made of asphalt and pea gravel. Members pay a monthly fee to attend the park that helps with the upkeep and maintains the cleanliness. A water fountain for both dogs and humans is provided. Membership fees and any donations go toward maintenance. The park hosts benefits and events related to dogs to raise money as well. Leashed dogs are permitted in most areas of the park, but not in Millennium Park.\nOther facilities.\nThe shaded walking paths in Grant Park cover several miles. A circuit of the park's walking paths is estimated to take .\nFor other sporting activities, the park has 16 softball/baseball fields and 12 tennis courts, open to the general public.\nPublic art.\nThe park holds a great deal of public art, much of it sculpture, in many areas including in Millennium Park, near Buckingham Fountain, the several gardens, and Congress Plaza. Four individual large installations, in other areas of the park, include:\n\"Abraham Lincoln Monument\".\n' is a statue by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens set in a 150-foot wide exedra by architect Stanford White, honoring the Illinois resident and 16th President of the United States. The statue was cast in 1908 and was displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the 1915 San Francisco World's Fair, prior to being installed in the park in 1926. It is located in the \"Court of Presidents,\" north of Ida B. Wells Drive and west of Columbus Drive and is frequently called \"Seated Lincoln\" to avoid confusion with Saint-Gaudens' 1887 sculpture ' in Lincoln Park.\n\"Agora\".\n\"Agora\" (from Greek, for urban meeting place) is an installation of 106 headless, armless sculptures designed by the Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz in southwestern Grant Park near Roosevelt Road. The piece was brought to the park in 2006. The figures are tall and weigh approximately . Each is made from a hollow, seamless piece of weathering or COR-TEN\u00ae steel, giving the pieces a reddish appearance and rough bark-like texture. The figures appear to be milling about in a crowd; some face each other, while others look away.\n\"Columbus Monument\".\nA bronze statue by Carlo (\"Charles\", \"Carl\") Brioschi was displayed on a monumental pedestal at the southern end of Grant Park. In 1933, Chicago celebrated its 100th anniversary with the Century of Progress World's Fair. In conjunction with the fair, Chicago's Italian-American community raised funds and donated the statue of the Genoese navigator and explorer, Christopher Columbus. It was removed on July 24, 2020 by order of Mayor Lori Lightfoot amid the George Floyd protests in Chicago and the deployment of federal forces to Chicago over Lightfoot's objections.\n\"Logan Monument\".\nAt Michigan Avenue and Ninth Street is the General John Logan Memorial, a large equestrian statue of John A. Logan, dedicated in 1897. Logan was a United States major general, who had resigned his congressional seat to serve in the U.S. Army during the Civil War. He led troops in many battles throughout the West and South. After the war, he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Illinois. The monument mound, with a statue by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Alexander Phimister Proctor, was initially intended as a burial site for Logan, but his family declined to relocate the general's grave.\nAdditions.\nChildren's Museum.\nThe Chicago Children's Museum announced plans in 2006 for a $100 million structure to replace its facilities at Navy Pier. The museum hoped to construct an underground building on the site of Daley Bicentennial Plaza, a plan that Mayor Richard M. Daley and council members approved in 2008. Some council members and area residents opposed the project and vowed to fight the proposal. After fundraising lagged, in January 2012, the Children's Museum announced that it no longer would seek a Grant Park location.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) since the association's founding in 1991 and is also accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board.\nIts downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the AIC building. SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and shares many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources. The campus, located in the Loop, comprises chiefly five main buildings: the McLean Center (112 S Michigan Ave), the Michigan building (116 S Michigan Ave), the Sharp (36 S Wabash Ave), Sullivan Center (37 S Wabash Ave), and the Columbus (280 S Columbus Dr). SAIC also holds classes in the Spertus building at 610 S Michigan Ave. SAIC owns additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used as student galleries or investments. There are three dormitory facilities: The Buckingham, Jones Hall, and 162 N State Street residencies.\nHistory.\nThe institute has its roots in the 1866 founding of the Chicago Academy of Design, which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street. It was financed by member dues and patron donations. Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed the following year in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\nBecause of the school's financial and managerial problems after this loss, business leaders in 1878 formed a board of trustees and founded the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. They expanded its mission beyond education and exhibitions to include collecting. In 1882, the academy was renamed the Art Institute of Chicago. The banker Charles L. Hutchinson served as its elected president until his death in 1924. The school grew to become among the \"most influential\" art schools in the United States.\nWalter E. Massey served as president, from 2010 until July 2016. He was succeeded by Elissa Tenny, who formerly served as the school's provost. In 2024, Tenny was succeeded by Jiseon Lee Isbara, a fiber artist and academic administrator.\nAcademics.\nSAIC offers classes in art and technology; arts administration; art history, theory, and criticism; art education and art therapy; ceramics; fashion design; filmmaking; historic preservation; architecture; interior architecture; designed objects; journalism; painting and drawing; performance; photography; printmaking; sculpture; sound; new media; video; visual communication; visual and critical studies; animation; illustration; fiber; and writing.\nSAIC also offers an interdisciplinary Low-Residency MFA for students wishing to study the fine arts and/or writing.\nIn 2025, the school reported a six-year graduation rate of 67%.\nChicago Architects Oral History Project.\nIn 1983, the Department of Architecture began the \"Chicago Architects Oral History Project.\" More than 78 architects have contributed.&lt;ref name=\"artic.edu/caohp\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nVideo Data Bank.\nThe Video Data Bank was started at SAIC In 1976, \"committed to fostering awareness and scholarship of the history and contemporary practice of video and media art.\" The Video Data Bank collection includes over 6,000 works of video art by over 600 artists. \nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of fall 2025, the school enrolled 3,323 students, 2,737 of which were undergraduate and 586 graduate students. 76% of them were female and 25% were from outside of the United States. 7.8% of students were from Chicago.\nActivities.\nVisiting Artists Program.\nFounded in 1868, the Visiting Artists Program (VAP) is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Formalized in 1951 by Flora Mayer Witkowsky's endowment of a supporting fund, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings. It showcases work in all media, including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film; in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.\nRecent visiting artists have included composer and artist Raven Chacon, artist working with artificial intelligence Stephanie Dinkins, and sculptor and choreographer Guadalupe Maravilla (2023\u201324 school year). Visiting artists for the 2022\u201323 school year included Torkwase Dyson and Wu Tsang, 2021-22 included Shirin Neshat, Hito Steyerl and Katie Paterson, and 2020-21 included Meg Onli and Fred Wilson.\nOther visiting artists have included Catherine Opie, Andi Zeisler, Aaron Koblin, Jean Shin, Sam Lipsyte, Ben Marcus, Marilyn Minter, Pearl Fryar, Tehching Hsieh, Homi K. Bhabha, Bill Fontana, Wolfgang Laib, Suzanne Lee, and Amar Kanwar among others.\nAdditionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped them. Alumni speakers have included Tania Bruguera, Jenni Sorkin, Kori Newkirk, Saya Woolfalk, Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba, Trevor Paglen, and Sanford Biggers.\nStudent organizations.\nExTV.\nExTV is a student-run time-arts platform that broadcasts online and on campus. Its broadcasts are available via monitors located throughout the 112 S. Michigan building, the 37 S Wabash building, and the 280 S. Columbus building.\n\"F Newsmagazine\".\n\"F Newsmagazine\" is SAIC's student-run newspaper. The magazine is a monthly publication with a run of 12,000 copies. Copies are distributed throughout the city, mainly at locations frequented by students such as popular diners and movie theaters.\nFree Radio SAIC.\nFree Radio SAIC is the student-run Internet radio station of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Free Radio uses an open programming format and encourage its DJs to explore and experiment with the medium of live radio. Program content and style vary but generally include music from all genres, sound art, narratives, live performances, current events and interviews.\nFeatured bands and guests on Free Radio SAIC include N\u00fc Sensae, The Black Belles, Thomas Comerford, Kevin Michael Richardson, Jeff Bennett, Carolyn Lawrence, and much more.\nStudent government.\nThe student government of SAIC, as required by its constitution, has four officers holding equal power and responsibility. Elections are held every year. There are no campaign requirements. Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.\nThe student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month. At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature. The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations. Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not. The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.\nRankings.\nAs of 2025, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranks SAIC as the second best overall graduate program for fine arts in the U.S. tied with the Yale School of Art and behind the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture. In their previous rankings done in 2016, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s college rankings ranked SAIC the fourth best overall graduate program for fine arts in the U.S. tying with the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and behind Yale, UCLA, and Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts.\nIn 2021, the university was ranked the seventh globally according to the QS World University Rankings by the subject Art and Design.\nIn January 2013, the Global Language Monitor ranked SAIC as the #5 college in the U.S., the highest ever for an art or design school in a general college ranking.\nIn a 2002 survey conducted by the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, SAIC was named the \"most influential art school\" by art critics at general interest news publications from across the United States.\nNotable people.\nNotable professors at SAIC include Nick Cave, James Elkins, Lisa Wainwright, Stephanie Brooks, Mary Jane Jacob, Frank Piatek, Edra Soto, Michelle Grabner, Jefferson Pinder, Adrian Wong, and Candida Alvarez.\nNotable alumni include Ivan Albright, Thomas Hart Benton, Sanford Biggers, Sonya Clark, Amanda Crowe, Megan Elizabeth Euker, Richard Hunt, Rashid Johnson, Jeff Koons, Joan Mitchell, Georgia O'Keefe, Trevor Paglen, Sterling Ruby, Dread Scott, Belle Silveira, Charles W. White, and Grant Wood.\nControversy.\n\"Mirth &amp; Girth\".\nOn May 11,\u00a01988, a student painting depicting Harold Washington, the first black mayor of Chicago, was taken down by three of the city's African-American aldermen based on its content. The painting by David Nelson, \"Mirth &amp; Girth\", was of Washington clad only in women's underwear.\"\"\nPolice Superintendent LeRoy Martin ordered the removal of the painting, which was returned the following day. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen on the grounds that they had violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In 1992, a federal court affirmed his constitutional rights had been violated. In 1994, the city agreed to a settlement: the money would go toward attorneys' fees for the ACLU. The three aldermen agreed not to appeal the 1992 ruling, and the police department established procedures over seizure of materials protected by the First Amendment.\n\"What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?\".\nIn February\u00a01989, as part of a piece entitled \"What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?\", student \"Dread\" Scott Tyler spread a Flag of the United States on the floor of the institute. The piece consisted of a podium, set upon the flag, and containing a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag, which is a violation of customary practice and code. While the exhibit faced protests from veterans and bomb threats, the school stood by the student's art. That year, the school's state funding was cut from $70,000 to $1, and the piece was publicly condemned by President George H. W. Bush. Scott would go on to be one of the defendants in \"United States v. Eichman\", a Supreme Court case in which it was eventually decided that federal laws banning flag desecration were unconstitutional.\nRacial slur and art studies.\nIn 2018, then Dean of Faculty Martin Berger, an art historian, gave an academic lecture on the civil rights movement in which he read a quote that employed the n-word. This part of his presentation caused controversy among faculty and staff, some thought it appropriate in the academic setting in which it was used, while others did not.\nTitle IX.\nIn 2017, a controversy arose after Michael Bonesteel, an adjunct professor specializing in outsider art, and comics, resigned after actions taken by the institute following two Title IX complaints by transgender students being filed against him in which each criticized his comments and class discussion. The institute initiated an investigation and took certain actions. Bonesteel described the SAIC investigation as a \"Kafkaesque trial\", in which he was never shown copies of the complaints. He claimed he was assumed to be \"guilty until proven innocent\" and that SAIC \"feels more like a police state than a place where academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas is valued\".\nLaura Kipnis, author of on Title IX cases in which she argues that universities follow reckless and capricious approaches, argued that SAIC was displaying \"jawdropping cowardice\". She said, \"The idea that students are trying to censor or curb a professor's opinions or thinking is appalling\". The school said the claims made against it were \"problematic\" and \"misleading\", and that it supports academic freedom.\nProperty.\nThis is a list of property in order of acquisition:\nSAIC also owns these properties outside of the immediate vicinity of the Chicago Loop:\nSAIC leases:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is usually defined as the mean ratio of the signal amplitude or power at the output port to the amplitude or power at the input port. It is often expressed using the logarithmic decibel (dB) units (\"dB gain\"). A gain greater than one (greater than zero dB), that is, amplification, is the defining property of an active device or circuit, while a passive circuit will have a gain of less than one.\nThe term \"gain\" alone is ambiguous, and can refer to the ratio of output to input voltage (\"voltage gain\"), current (\"current gain\") or electric power (\"power gain\"). In the field of audio and general purpose amplifiers, especially operational amplifiers, the term usually refers to voltage gain, but in radio frequency amplifiers it usually refers to power gain. Furthermore, the term gain is also applied in systems such as sensors where the input and output have different units; in such cases the gain units must be specified, as in \"5 microvolts per photon\" for the responsivity of a photosensor. The \"gain\" of a bipolar transistor normally refers to forward current transfer ratio, either \"h\"FE (\"beta\", the static ratio of \"I\"\"c\" divided by \"I\"b at some operating point), or sometimes \"h\"fe (the small-signal current gain, the slope of the graph of \"I\"\"c\" against \"I\"\"b\" at a point).\nThe gain of an electronic device or circuit generally varies with the frequency of the applied signal. Unless otherwise stated, the term refers to the gain for frequencies in the passband, the intended operating frequency range of the equipment. \nThe term \"gain\" has a different meaning in antenna design; antenna gain is the ratio of radiation intensity from a directional antenna to formula_1 (mean radiation intensity from a lossless antenna).\nLogarithmic units and decibels.\nPower gain.\nPower gain, in decibels (dB), is defined as follows:\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the power applied to the input, formula_4 is the power from the output.\nA similar calculation can be done using a natural logarithm instead of a decimal logarithm, resulting in nepers instead of decibels:\nformula_5\nVoltage gain.\nThe power gain can be calculated using voltage instead of power using Joule's first law formula_6; the formula is:\nformula_7\nIn many cases, the input impedance formula_8 and output impedance formula_9 are equal, so the above equation can be simplified to:\nformula_10\nformula_11\nThis simplified formula, the 20 log rule, is used to calculate a voltage gain in decibels and is equivalent to a power gain if and only if the impedances at input and output are equal.\nCurrent gain.\nIn the same way, when power gain is calculated using current instead of power, making the substitution formula_12, the formula is:\nformula_13\nIn many cases, the input and output impedances are equal, so the above equation can be simplified to:\nformula_14\nformula_15\nThis simplified formula is used to calculate a current gain in decibels and is equivalent to the power gain if and only if the impedances at input and output are equal.\nThe \"current gain\" of a bipolar transistor, formula_16 or formula_17, is normally given as a dimensionless number, the ratio of formula_18 to formula_19 (or slope of the formula_18-versus-formula_19 graph, for formula_17).\nIn the cases above, gain will be a dimensionless quantity, as it is the ratio of like units (decibels are not used as units, but rather as a method of indicating a logarithmic relationship). In the bipolar transistor example, it is the ratio of the output current to the input current, both measured in amperes. In the case of other devices, the gain will have a value in SI units. Such is the case with the operational transconductance amplifier, which has an open-loop gain (transconductance) in siemens (mhos), because the gain is a ratio of the output current to the input voltage.\nExample.\nQ. An amplifier has an input impedance of 50 ohms and drives a load of 50 ohms. When its input (formula_23) is 1 volt, its output (formula_24) is 10 volts. What is its voltage and power gain?\nA. Voltage gain is simply:\nformula_25\nThe units V/V are optional but make it clear that this figure is a voltage gain and not a power gain.\nUsing the expression for power, \"P\" = \"V\"2/\"R\", the power gain is:\nformula_26\nAgain, the units W/W are optional. Power gain is more usually expressed in decibels, thus:\nformula_27\nUnity gain.\nA gain of factor 1 (equivalent to 0\u00a0dB) where both input and output are at the same voltage level and impedance is also known as \"unity gain\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The brothers are among the best-known storytellers of folktales, popularizing stories such as \"Cinderella\" (\"\"), \"The Frog Prince\" (\"\"), \"Hansel and Gretel\" (\"\"), \"Town Musicians of Bremen\" (\"\"), \"Little Red Riding Hood\" (\"\"), \"Rapunzel\", \"Rumpelstiltskin\" (\"\"), \"Sleeping Beauty\" (\"\"), and \"Snow White\" (\"\"). Their first collection of folktales, \"Children's and Household Tales\" (), was first published in 1812.\nThe Brothers Grimm spent their formative years in the town of Hanau in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. Their father's death in 1796 (when Jacob was 11 and Wilhelm 10) caused great poverty for the family and greatly affected the brothers throughout their lives. Both brothers attended Marburg University, where they developed a curiosity about German folklore, which grew into a lifelong dedication to collecting German folktales.\nThe rise of Romanticism in 19th-century Europe revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Brothers Grimm represented a pure form of national literature and culture. With the goal of researching a scholarly treatise on folktales, they established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between 1812 and 1857 their first collection was revised and republished many times, growing from 86 stories to more than 200. In addition to writing and modifying folktales, the brothers wrote collections of well-respected Germanic and Scandinavian mythologies, and in 1838 they began writing a definitive German dictionary (), which they were unable to finish.\nThe popularity of the Grimms' collected folktales has endured. They are available in more than 100 translations and have been adapted by renowned filmmakers, including Lotte Reiniger and Walt Disney, in films such as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". In the mid-20th century, Nazi Germany weaponized the tales for propaganda; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as Bruno Bettelheim reaffirmed the work's value despite the sexuality, cruelty, and violence in some of the tales' original versions, which were eventually censored by the Grimms themselves.\nBiography.\nEarly lives.\nJacob Ludwig Karl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm were born on 4\u00a0January 1785 and 24\u00a0February 1786, respectively, in Hanau in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, within the Holy Roman Empire (present-day Germany), to Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, a jurist, and Dorothea Grimm (n\u00e9e Zimmer), daughter of a Kassel city councilman. They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy. In 1791 the family moved to the countryside town of Steinau during Philipp's employment there as a district magistrate (). The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer Jack Zipes writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and \"clearly fond of country life\". The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as Lutherans, which instilled in both a lifelong religious faith. Later, they attended local schools.\nIn 1796 Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, causing great poverty for the large family. Dorothea was forced to relinquish the brothers' servants and large house, depending on financial support from her father and sister, who was then the first lady-in-waiting at the court of William I, Elector of Hesse. Jacob was the eldest living son, forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two brothers then followed the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.\nThe brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the in Kassel, which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other and become exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament\u2014Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill health)\u2014but shared a strong work ethic and excelled in their studies. In Kassel they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to \"high-born\" students who received more attention. Each brother graduated at the head of his class, Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804 (he missed a year of school due to scarlet fever).\nMarburg.\nAfter graduation from the , the brothers attended Marburg University. The university was small with about 200 students, and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request a dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life, but their outsider status worked in their favor and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.\nInspired by their law professor, Friedrich von Savigny, who awakened in them an interest in history and philology, the brothers studied medieval German literature. They shared Savigny's desire to see the unification of the 200 German principalities into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends\u2014German romantics such as Clemens Brentano and Ludwig Achim von Arnim\u2014the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of Johann Gottfried Herder, who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as (natural poetry)\u2014as opposed to (artistic poetry). The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, of which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, \"the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.\"\nJacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as Savigny's research assistant. On his return to Marburg he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce, and take a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter to his aunt from this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances: \"We five people eat only three portions and only once a day\".\nKassel.\nJacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the King of Westphalia and went on to become a librarian in Kassel. After their mother's death that year, he became fully responsible for his younger siblings. He arranged and paid for his brother Ludwig's studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to Halle to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, after which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel At Brentano's request, the brothers had begun collecting folk tales in a cursory manner in 1807. According to Zipes, at this point \"the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.\"\nDuring their employment as librarians\u2014which paid little but afforded them ample time for research\u2014the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing books between 1812 and 1830. In 1812 they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, , followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history. They went on to publish works about Danish and Irish folk tales (and also Norse mythology), while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in Marburg, Berlin, and Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw).\nG\u00f6ttingen.\nOn 15\u00a0May 1825 Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea \"Dortchen\" Wild, a pharmacist's daughter and childhood friend who had given the brothers several tales. Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen. In 1830 both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly. They moved the household to G\u00f6ttingen in the Kingdom of Hanover, where they took employment at the University of G\u00f6ttingen\u2014Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as a professor.\nFor the next seven years the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835 Jacob published the well-regarded \"German Mythology\" (); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of for publication. The two brothers taught German studies at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.\nIn 1837 the brothers lost their university posts after joining the rest of the G\u00f6ttingen Seven in protest. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as Young Germany. The brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but they and five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, who in 1837 dissolved the parliament of Hanover and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants\u2014including professors at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover\u2014including Jacob, who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.\nThe brothers were without income and again in extreme financial difficulty in 1838, so they began what would become a lifelong project\u2014the writing of a definitive dictionary, the \"German Dictionary\" ()\u2014whose first volume was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.\nBerlin and later years.\nIn 1840, Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to Frederick William IV of Prussia on behalf of the brothers, who were offered posts at the University of Berlin. In addition to teaching posts, the Academy of Sciences offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; Wilhelm began researching medieval literature while editing new editions of .\nAfter the revolutions of 1848 in the German states the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at Mainz. But their political activities were short-lived, as their hope for a unified Germany dwindled and their disenchantment grew. In the late 1840s Jacob resigned his university position and published \"The History of the German Language\" (). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the \"German Dictionary\" for the rest of their lives. Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin on 16\u00a0December 1859, and Jacob, deeply upset by his death, became increasingly reclusive. He continued working on the dictionary until his own death on 20\u00a0September 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimms' dictionary, and of their very large body of work: \"Symbolically the last word was (fruit).\"\n\"Children's and Household Tales\".\nBackground.\nThe rise of romanticism, romantic nationalism, and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late 17th-century peak. Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us published a popular collection of tales called between 1782 and 1787; the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included Charles Perrault's tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the literary salons of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them\u2014even though many of them were original.\nThe brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of (\"The Boy's Magic Horn\" or cornucopia). They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories, and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation\u2014a practice threatened by increased industrialization. Maria Tatar, professor of German studies at Harvard University, argues that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the oral tradition that gives folk tales important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, \"picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story, and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.\"\nBut Tatar argues that the Grimms appropriated as uniquely German stories, such as \"Little Red Riding Hood\", that had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories reflected Germanic culture. Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.\nMethodology.\nWhen Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion. By 1810 they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription; many had roots in previously written sources. At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of . Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in Alsace where they were found in 1920 and became known as the \u00d6lenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception. The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975.\nThe brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances. Wilhelm's wife, Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\". Wilhelm collected some tales after befriending August von Haxthausen, whom he visited in 1811 in Westphalia where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends. Several of the storytellers were of Huguenot ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by Marie Hassenpflug, an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry, and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's (\"Stories from Past Times\"). Other tales were collected from Dorothea Viehmann, the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent. Despite her middle-class background, in the first English translation she was characterized as a peasant and given the name . At least one tale, (\"Grim Reaper\"), was provided by composer Wilhelmine Schwertzell, with whom Wilhelm had a long correspondence.\nAccording to scholars such as Tatar and Ruth Bottigheimer, some of the tales probably originated in written form during the medieval period with writers such as Straparola and Boccaccio, but were modified in the 17th century and again rewritten by the Grimms. Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of French occupation was a form of \"intellectual resistance\", and in so doing they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.\nWriting.\nFrom 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces \"that might detract from a rustic tone\", improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs. Ronald Murphy writes in \"The Owl, the Raven, and the Dove\" that the brothers, particularly Wilhelm, also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm \"gleaned\" bits from old Germanic faiths, Norse mythology, Roman and Greek mythology, and biblical stories that he reshaped.\nOver the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose; he expanded and added detail to the stories to the point that many of them grew to twice the length they had in the earliest published editions. In the later editions Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819 he began writing original tales for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience) and adding didactic elements to existing tales.\nSome changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality. He worked to modify plots for many of the stories; for example, \"Rapunzel\" in the first edition of clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions. Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: \"every fairy (), prince () and princess ()\u2014all words of French origin\u2014was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress () or wise woman (), king's son (), king's daughter ().\"\nThemes and analysis.\nThe Grimms' legacy contains legends, novellas, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Arnim was concerned about the content of some of the tales\u2014such as those that showed children being eaten\u2014and suggested adding a subtitle to warn parents of the content. Instead the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Arnim's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection; the brothers believed that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar Linda D\u00e9gh, who explains that tales such as \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\" were written as \"warning tales\" for children.\nThe stories in include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of \"Snow White\", the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, but still orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them; the story ends with the Queen dancing at Snow White's wedding, wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her. Another story, \"The Goose Girl\", has a servant stripped naked and pushed into a barrel \"studded with sharp nails\" pointing inward and then rolled down the street. The Grimms' version of \"The Frog Prince\" describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent the cruelty and violence may reflected the medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in \"The Six Swans\".\nTales with a spinning motif are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay \"Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales\", Bottigheimer argues that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, particularly of flax, was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of their main character, as in \"There once was a miller\", yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation; this appears to be because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work. In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer writes that the spindle was the symbol of a \"diligent, well-ordered womanhood\". In some stories, such as \"Rumpelstiltskin\", spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.\nThe Grimms' work have been subjected to feminist critique. For example, Emma Tennant writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But the worst of it was that two men\u2014the Brothers Grimm\u2014listened to these old tales told by mothers to their daughters; and they decided to record them for posterity. ... But the Brothers Grimm could understand only the tales of courage and manliness and chivalry on the part of the boys. The girls were relegated to virtues\u2014Patient Griselda; or sheer physical beauty\u2014Sleeping Beauty; Beauty and the Beast. Always we must read that our heroine is a Beauty.\nThe tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included and their use of language. But scholars such as Heinz R\u00f6lleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing \"rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty\". German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees, and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.\nSome critics, such as Alistair Hauke, use Jungian analysis to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the wicked stepmother and stepsisters in \"Cinderella\". However, this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales. Another possible influence is found in stories such as \"The Twelve Brothers\", which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition. Some of the tales have autobiographical elements, and according to Zipes the work may have been a \"quest\" to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task, and in the end find a new home.\nEditions.\nBetween 1812 and 1864, was published 17 times: seven of the \"Large edition\" () and ten of the \"Small edition\" (). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Emil Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother, illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.\nThe first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales, and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the (annotated) Large editions. A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations. Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857. The seventh and final edition of 1857 contained 211 tales\u2014200 numbered folk tales and 11 legends.\nIn Germany , commonly \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\" in English, was also released in a \"popular poster-sized (broadsides)\" format and in single-story formats for the more popular tales such as \"Hansel and Gretel\". The stories were often added to collections by other authors without respect to copyright as the tales became a focus of interest for children's book illustrators, with well-known artists such as Arthur Rackham, Walter Crane, and Edmund Dulac illustrating. Another popular edition released in the mid-19th century included elaborate etchings by George Cruikshank. Upon the brothers' deaths, the copyright went to Wilhelm's son Hermann Grimm, who continued the practice of printing the volumes in expensive and complete editions, but after 1893, when copyright lapsed, various publishers began to print the stories in many formats and editions. In the 21st century, is a universally recognized text. Jacob's and Wilhelm's collection of stories has been translated to more than 160 languages; 120 different editions of the text are available for sale in the US alone.\nPhilology.\nWhile at Marburg University, the brothers came to see culture as tied to language and regarded the purest cultural expression in the grammar of a language. They moved away from Brentano's practice\u2014and that of the other romanticists\u2014who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial. They thought that the style of the people (the ) reflected a natural and divinely inspired poetry ()\u2014as opposed to art poetry (), which they saw as artificially constructed. As literary historians and scholars they delved into the origins of stories and attempted to retrieve them from the oral tradition without loss of the original traits of oral language.\nThe brothers strongly believed that the dream of national unity and independence relied on a full knowledge of the cultural past that was reflected in folklore. They worked to discover and crystallize a kind of Germanness in the stories they collected in the belief that folklore contained kernels of mythologies and legends crucial to understanding the essence of German culture. In examining culture from a philological point of view they sought to establish connections between German law, culture, and local beliefs.\nThe Grimms considered the tales to have origins in traditional Germanic folklore, which they thought had been \"contaminated\" by later literary tradition. In the shift from the oral tradition to the printed book, tales were translated from regional dialects to Standard German ( or High German). But over the course of the many modifications and revisions, the Grimms sought to reintroduce regionalisms, dialects, and Low German to the tales\u2014to reintroduce the language of the original form of the oral tale.\nAs early as 1812 they published (\"The Two Oldest German Poems of the Eighth Century: The Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand and the Wessobrunn Prayer\"); the \"Wessobrunn Prayer\" is a ninth-century German prayer, while the \"Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand\" is the earliest-known German heroic song.\nBetween 1816 and 1818 the brothers published a two-volume work, (\"German Legends\"), consisting of 585 German legends. Jacob undertook most of the work of collecting and editing the legends, which he organized according to region and historical (ancient) legends and were about real people or events. The brothers meant it as a scholarly work, but the historical legends were often taken from secondary sources, interpreted, modified, and rewritten\u2014resulting in works \"that were regarded as trademarks\". Some scholars criticized the Grimms' methodology in collecting and rewriting the legends, yet conceptually they set an example for legend collections that was followed by others throughout Europe. Unlike the collection of folk tales, sold poorly, but Zipes says that the collection, translated to French and Danish in the 19th century but not to English until 1981, is a \"vital source for folklorists and critics alike\".\nLess well known in the English-speaking world is the Grimms' pioneering scholarly work on a German dictionary, the , which they began in 1838. Not until 1852 did they begin publishing the dictionary in installments. The work on the dictionary was not finished in their lifetimes, because in it they gave a history and analysis of each word.\nReception and legacy.\n was not an immediate bestseller, but its popularity grew with each edition. The early editions received lukewarm critical reviews, generally on the basis that the stories did not appeal to children. The brothers responded with modifications and rewrites to increase the book's market appeal to that demographic. By the 1870s the tales had increased greatly in popularity to the point that they were added to the teaching curriculum in Prussia. In the 20th century the work was second only to the Bible as the most popular book in Germany. Its sales generated a mini-industry of critiques, which analyzed the tales' folkloric content in the context of literary history, socialism, and psychological elements often along Freudian and Jungian lines.\nIn their research, the brothers made a science of the study of folklore (see folkloristics), generating a model of research that \"launched general fieldwork in most European countries\", and setting standards for research and analysis of stories and legends that made them pioneers in the field of folklore in the 19th century.\nIn Nazi Germany the Grimms' stories were used to foster nationalism as well as to promote antisemitic sentiments in an increasingly hostile time for Jewish people. Some examples of notable antisemitic works in the Grimms' bibliography are \"The Girl Who Was Killed by Jews\", \"The Jews' Stone\", \"The Jew Among Thorns\" and \"The Good Bargain\". \"The Girl Who Was Killed by Jews\" and \"The Jews' Stone\" tell stories of blood libel by Jews against innocent children. In both stories the children are violently killed and mutilated. The myth of blood libel was widely propagated during the Middle Ages and is still used to vilify Jews today. The children in these two stories are acquired in exchange for large sums of money; Jewish wealth and greed are also common antisemitic tropes. These tropes appear in \"The Jew Among Thorns\" and \"The Good Bargain\". In both stories a Jewish man is depicted as deceitful for the sake of money. In the former the man admits to stealing money and is executed instead of the protagonist. In the latter, the Jewish man is found to be deceitful in order to be rewarded with a sum of money. The specific deceit is irrelevant and here too the protagonist triumphs over the Jew. All these stories paint Jews as antagonists whether through murderous rites, deceit, or greed. Antisemitism in folklore has contributed to the popularization of antisemitic tropes and misconceptions about the Jewish faith, but the Nazi Party was particularly devoted to the Grimms' collected stories. According to author Elizabeth Dalton, \"Nazi ideologues enshrined the \"Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen\" as virtually a sacred text\". The Nazi Party decreed that every household should own a copy of ; later, officials of Allied-occupied Germany banned the book for a period.\nBlood libel tales accused Jews of stealing Christian children to perform religious rituals on them, and most notably, turn their blood into matzah. According to Robert Weinberg, Professor of Jewish History at Swarthmore College, \"the accusation that Jews murder Christians, particularly young boys and girls, for ritual purposes has a long and lurid lineage that dates back to the Middle Ages. The accusation of ritual murder emerged in England in the mid-twelfth century with the charge that Jews had killed a Christian youth in order to mock the Passion of Christ. By the middle of the thirteenth century the belief that Jews killed Christians had spread to the European continent, where gentiles now accused Jews of desecrating the Host and using gentile blood for religious purposes, including consuming it in matzo.\"[] The concept of cruentation was also extremely prevalent in the Middle Ages. Cruentation described the phenomenon of a corpse spontaneously bleeding in the presence of its murderer. At this time, European Jews were often hunted down and murdered when a Christian child went missing and stories abounded that the victims, when found, would bleed in the presence of their Jewish killers.\nIn the United States the 1937 release of Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" shows the triumph of good over evil, innocence over oppression, according to Zipes. The Grimms' tales have provided much of the early foundation on which Disney built an empire. In film, the Cinderella motif, the story of a poor girl finding love and success, has been repeated in movies such as \"Pretty Woman\", \"Ever After\", \"Maid in Manhattan\", and \"Ella Enchanted\". Not only have the Grimms' tales provided an empire for Disney to build, but oftentimes, in stories written by the Brothers Grimm, Disney's villains are depicted as Jewish caricatures. The stepmother in Cinderella is the antagonist of the story and appears stereotypically Jewish, with a big nose and dark features. Even more blatantly, Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty has devil horns, just as Christians would paint Jews as devils or demons in the Middle Ages. \"Images began to portray Jews as hooknosed caricatures of evil\" at this time. \n20th-century educators debated the value and influence of teaching stories that include brutality and violence, and some of the more gruesome details were sanitized. D\u00e9gh writes that some educators, in the belief that children should be shielded from cruelty of any form, believe that stories with a happy ending are fine to teach, whereas those that are darker, particularly the legends, might pose more harm. On the other hand, some educators and psychologists believe that children easily discern the difference between what is a story and what is not and that the tales continue to have value for children. The publication of Bruno Bettelheim's 1976 \"The Uses of Enchantment\" brought a new wave of interest in the stories as children's literature, with an emphasis on the \"therapeutic value for children\". More popular stories, such as \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"Little Red Riding Hood\", have become staples of modern childhood, presented in coloring books, puppet shows, and cartoons. Other stories have been considered too gruesome and have not made a popular transition.\nRegardless, the Grimms' stories continue to be popular around the world, although a recent study in England appears to suggest that parents consider the stories overly violent and inappropriate for young children.\nNevertheless, children remain enamored of the Grimms' fairy tales with the brothers themselves embraced as the creators of the stories and even as part of the stories themselves. The film \"The Brothers Grimm\" imagines them as con artists exploiting superstitious German peasants until they are asked to confront a genuine fairy-tale curse that calls them to finally be heroes. The movie \"Ever After\" shows the Grimms in their role as collectors of fairy tales, though they learn to their surprise that at least one of their stories (Cinderella) is true. \"Grimm\" follows a detective who discovers that he is a Grimm, the latest in a line of guardians who are sworn to keep the balance between humanity and mythological creatures. \"Ever After High\" imagines Grimm Brothers (here called Milton and Giles) as the headmasters of the Ever After High boarding school, where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. In the \"10th Kingdom\" miniseries, the brothers are trapped for years in the fairy-tale world on the 9 Kingdoms, where they witnessed the events that they would record as stories upon finally making it back to the real world. The \"Sisters Grimm\" book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne Grimm, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy-tale people. Separate from the previous series is the \"Land of Stories\" book series which also features the idea of \"Sisters Grimm\". In \"The Land of Stories\", the Grimm Brothers' female descendants are a self-described coven determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy-tale world that cross over to the real world. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were, in this story, chosen by Mother Goose and others to tell fairy tales so that they might give hope to the human race.\nThe university library at the Humboldt University of Berlin is housed in the Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Center (); among its collections is a large portion of the Grimms' private library.\nPopular adaptations.\nThe below includes adaptations from the work of the Brothers Grimm:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the younger brother of Jacob Grimm, of the literary duo the Brothers Grimm.\nLife and work.\nWilhelm was born in February 1786 in Hanau, in Hesse-Kassel. In 1803, he started studying law at the University of Marburg, one year after his brother Jacob started there. The two brothers spent their entire lives close together. In their school days, they had one bed and one table in common; as students, they had two beds and two tables in the same room. They always lived under one roof and had their books and property in common.\nIn 1825, 39-year-old Wilhelm married pharmacist's daughter Henriette Dorothea Wild, also known as Dortchen. Wilhelm's marriage did not change the harmony of the brothers. Richard Cleasby visited the brothers and observed, \"they both live in the same house, and in such harmony and community that one might almost imagine the children were common property.\"\nWilhelm's character was a complete contrast to that of his brother. As a boy, he was strong and healthy, but while growing up he suffered a long and severe illness which left him weak the rest of his life. He had a less comprehensive and energetic mind than his brother, and he had less of the spirit of investigation, preferring to confine himself to some limited and definitely bounded field of work. He utilized everything that bore directly on his own studies and ignored the rest. These studies were almost always of a literary nature.\nWilhelm took great delight in music, for which his brother had but a moderate liking, and he had a remarkable gift of storytelling. Cleasby relates that \"Wilhelm read a sort of farce written in the Frankfort dialect, depicting the 'malheurs' of a rich Frankfort tradesman on a holiday jaunt on Sunday. It was very droll, and he read it admirably.\" Cleasby describes him as \"an uncommonly animated, jovial fellow.\" He was, accordingly, much sought in society, which he frequented much more than his brother.\nA collection of fairy tales was first published in 1812 by the Grimm brothers, known in English as Grimms' Fairy Tales.\nFrom 1837 to 1841, the Grimm brothers joined five of their colleague professors at the University of G\u00f6ttingen to form a group known as the \"G\u00f6ttinger Sieben\" (\"The G\u00f6ttingen Seven\"). They protested against Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, whom they accused of violating the constitution. All seven were fired by the king.\nWilhelm Grimm died in Berlin of an infection at the age of 73 on 16 December 1859.\nChildren.\nWilhelm and Henriette had four children together:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together with Enrico Fermi, he discovered key processes leading to nuclear fission. Rasetti refused to work on the Manhattan Project on moral grounds.\nLife and career.\nRasetti was born in Castiglione del Lago, Italy. He earned a \"Laurea\" in physics at the University of Pisa in 1923, and Fermi invited him to join his research group at the University of Rome.\nIn 1928-1929 during a stay at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), he carried out experiments on the Raman effect. He measured a spectrum of dinitrogen in 1929 which provided the first experimental evidence that the atomic nucleus is not composed of protons and electrons, as was incorrectly believed at the time.\nIn 1930, he was appointed to the chair in spectroscopy at the Physics Institute of the University of Rome, at that time still located in Via Panisperna. His colleagues included Oscar D'Agostino, Emilio Segr\u00e8, Edoardo Amaldi, Ettore Majorana and Enrico Fermi, as well as the institute's director Orso Mario Corbino. Rasetti remained in this position until 1938.\nRasetti was one of Fermi's main collaborators in the study of neutrons and neutron-induced radioactivity. In 1934, he participated in the discovery of the artificial radioactivity of fluorine and aluminium which would be critical in the development of the atomic bomb.\nIn 1939 the advance of fascism and the deteriorating Italian political situation led him to leave Italy, following the example of his colleagues Fermi, Segr\u00e9 and Bruno Pontecorvo. With Fermi he had discovered the key to nuclear fission, but unlike many of his colleagues, he refused for moral reasons to work on the Manhattan Project.\nFrom 1939 to 1947, he taught at Laval University in Quebec City (Canada), where he was founding chairman of the physics department.\nIn 1947, he moved to the United States where he became a naturalized citizen in 1952. Until 1967, he held a chair in physics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\nFrom the 1950s onward, he gradually shifted his commitment to naturalistic studies, which had been his great interest outside of physics already as a child. He devoted himself to geology, paleontology, entomology, and botany, becoming one of the most authoritative scholars of the Cambrian geological era.\nHe died in Waremme, Belgium at the age of 100. The \"Nature\" obituary noted that Rasetti was one of the \"most prolific generalists\" whose \"work and writing are noted for the elegance, simplicity and beauty\".\nRaman spectroscopy and the model of the atomic nucleus.\nAfter the discovery of Raman scattering by organic liquids, Rasetti decided to study the same phenomenon in gases at high pressure during his stay at Caltech in 1928\u201329. The spectra showed vibrational transitions with rotational fine structure. In the homonuclear diatomic molecules H2, N2 and O2, Rasetti found an alternation of strong and weak lines. This alternation was explained by Gerhard Herzberg and Walter Heitler as a consequence of nuclear spin isomerism.\nFor dihydrogen, each nucleus is a proton of spin 1/2, so that it can be shown using quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle that the odd rotational levels are more populated than the even levels. The transitions originating from odd levels are therefore more intense as observed by Rasetti. In dinitrogen, however, Rasetti observed that the lines originating from even levels are more intense. This implies by a similar analysis that the nuclear spin of nitrogen is an integer.\nThis result was difficult to understand at the time, however, because the neutron had not yet been discovered, and it was thought that the 14N nucleus contains 14 protons and 7 electrons, or an odd number (21) of particles in total which would correspond to a half-integral spin. The Raman spectrum observed by Rasetti provided the first experimental evidence that this proton-electron model of the nucleus is inadequate, because the predicted half-integral spin has as a consequence that transitions from odd rotational levels would be more intense than those from even levels, due to nuclear spin isomerism as shown by Herzberg and Heitler for dihydrogen. After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Werner Heisenberg proposed that the nucleus contains protons and neutrons, and the 14N nucleus contains 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The even total number (14) of particles corresponds to an integral spin in agreement with Rasetti's spectrum.\nHe is also credited with the first example of electronic (as opposed to vibronic) Raman scattering in nitric oxide.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "41977", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41977", "title": "The Buggles", "text": "English pop band\nThe Buggles are an English new wave band formed in London in 1977. Their best known line-up was as a duo of singer and bassist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes, with Bruce Woolley briefly contributing as a member from 1977 to 1979. They are best known for their 1979 debut single, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which topped the UK singles chart and reached number one in 15 other countries, and was also chosen as the song to launch the popular American music-themed television channel MTV in 1981. \nThey released their debut studio album, \"The Age of Plastic\", on the 10th of January, 1980. On the 7th of September, 1979, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" was released, serving as both the lead single of the album and the band's debut single. The modestly successful singles \"Living in the Plastic Age\", \"Clean, Clean\", and Elstree\" followed. Around this time, the group also produced The Jags' most successful single, \"Back of My Hand\", and helped with the production of Dan-I's sole hit, \"Monkey Chop\". \nSoon after the album's release, Horn and Downes joined the progressive rock band Yes, recording and releasing \"Drama\" (1980) in the process. Following a tour to promote the album, the group disbanded in 1981. That same year, on the 1st of August, the music video for \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" became the first ever shown on MTV in the United States. They also released their second and final studio album that year, \"Adventures in Modern Recording\". The lack of commercial success with both the album and its singles led to the breakup of the group in 1982. \nSince 1998, Horn and Downes have occasionally performed the Buggles' songs. The band had its debut tour in 2023 in a lineup with Horn, but without Downes. Their most recent reunion occurred in 2023, and is currently ongoing as of 2025. In 2017, they planned a musical entitled \"The Robot Sings\", although its fate is unknown. Their work has influenced popular acts such as Justice, Phoenix, and Daft Punk, and has been covered by artists such as Erasure, Robbie Williams, and Ben Folds Five.\nHistory.\n1977\u20131979: Formation.\nDownes claimed the group's name derived as a pun on the rock band The Beatles, saying: \"It was originally called the Bugs ... studio insects\u2014imaginary creatures who lived in recording studios creating havoc. Then somebody said as a joke that the Bugs would never be as big as the Beatles. So we changed it to The Buggles.\" Horn later spoke of its name: \"I know the name's awful, but at the time it was the era of the great punk thing. I'd got fed up of producing people who were generally idiots but called themselves all sorts of clever names like the Unwanted, the Unwashed, the Unheard ... when it came to choosing our name I thought I'd pick the most disgusting name possible. In retrospect I have frequently regretted calling myself Buggles, but in those days I never really thought much about packaging or selling myself, all that really concerned me was the record.\"\nHorn began his career producing jingles and punk rock groups. Downes was a keyboardist in She's French and graduated from Leeds College of Music in 1975, after which he moved to London looking for keyboard work. The two first met in 1976 at auditions for Tina Charles' backing band and worked with her producer, Biddu, whose backing tracks had an influence on their early work as the Buggles. Horn met musician Bruce Woolley while playing the bass guitar in the house band at the Hammersmith Odeon. Both expressed an interest in Kraftwerk and Daniel Miller, leading them to read \"Crash\" by J. G. Ballard. Said Horn, \"We had this idea that at some future point there'd be a record label that didn't really have any artists\u2014just a computer in the basement and some mad Vincent Price-like figure making the records ... One of the groups this computer would make would be the Buggles, which was obviously a corruption of the Beatles, who would just be this inconsequential bunch of people with a hit song that the computer had written ... and would never be seen.\"\nIn 1977, Horn, Downes and Woolley got together and began recording a selection of demos in a small room above a stonemason shop in Wimbledon, southwest London, including \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", \"Clean, Clean\" and \"On TV\". Though unsure about what they wished to do with the demos, Downes remembered that \"we knew even then ... there was some distant goal that had to be reached\", and proceeded to re-record the songs at a 16-track recording studio in north London. Initial searches for the right record label to record and release an album failed, but Horn, having begun a relationship with Jill Sinclair, a co-founder of Sarm East Studios, managed to secure plans for a potential deal. However, the demo version of \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" caught the attention of producer Chris Blackwell of Island Records and, on the day on which Horn and Downes were due to sign with Sarm East, Blackwell offered them a more lucrative deal, which they accepted. Downes claimed Island rejected them three times before a final deal was agreed upon.\n1979\u20131980: \"The Age of Plastic\".\nWith the Island recording contract having been secured, The Buggles recorded their debut studio album, \"The Age of Plastic\", through 1979. Initially, the demo of \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" featured vocals by Tina Charles, who also helped fund the project. Although the song was primarily a Woolley composition, he ended his association with Horn and Downes to form before the song's release as a single. Making \"The Age of Plastic\" involved several months of tiresome and intense experimentation with studio equipment and techniques, struggling to capture the \"magic\" of the original demos. Debi Doss and Linda Jardim-Allan, the female voices on \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", contributed their vocals to other songs on the album as well.\n\"Video Killed the Radio Star\", the album's lead single, was released first in September 1979 to considerable commercial success, topping the chart in 16 countries. Its music video, directed by Russell Mulcahy, was the first video aired on MTV in the United States on 1 August 1981. Film composer Hans Zimmer makes a brief appearance in the video. \"The Age of Plastic\" was released in January 1980 and reached No. 27 on the UK Albums Chart. Three subsequent singles were released: \"Living in the Plastic Age\", \"Clean, Clean\" and \"Elstree\", all of which charted in the United Kingdom.\n1980\u20131981: Collaboration with Yes.\nIn early 1980, Horn and Downes began work on a second Buggles album in London, working in a studio next door to that of the progressive rock band Yes, who had lost vocalist Jon Anderson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman following failed recording sessions for a potential new album. In particular, Horn had been a long-standing fan of Yes. The Buggles offered a song to Yes, \"We Can Fly from Here\", but at the suggestion of Brian Lane, manager of both bands, Yes' bassist Chris Squire invited them to actually replace Anderson and Wakeman as members of Yes. Horn and Downes accepted the offer and joined Squire, Steve Howe and Alan White to record \"Drama\".\nThe absorption of The Buggles into Yes met with mixed reactions; the band was sometimes booed in the United Kingdom despite its chart position, but not in the United States. Horn admitted that he did not have Anderson's vocal range or style, which many fans missed, but most were still willing to give the new incarnation of Yes a chance. However, some press critics and fans were far less forgiving, especially in the United Kingdom. The US tour was much less financially successful than expected, and Yes disbanded in December 1980 after the \"Drama\" tour ended.\n1981\u20131982: \"Adventures in Modern Recording\".\nIn early 1981, following the disbanding of Yes, Downes and Horn reconvened at Sarm East Studios to record The Buggles' second studio album, \"Adventures in Modern Recording\". However, Downes left the group on the day that the recording was to begin to help form Asia with Howe, citing musical differences. Horn was angry that Island Records renegotiated publishing terms for Downes to join Asia, but never did for Horn since, in his words, he was \"washed up, career-wise.\" To fix this problem, Jill Sinclair made a deal with the French label Carrere, whose leader Claude Carrere, whom Horn described as a \"very nice man\", helped fund the album. Horn was now left to complete much of the album with several additional personnel.\nReleased in November 1981, \"Adventures in Modern Recording\" involved Horn's experimentation with numerous production techniques, especially with the heavy use of sampling with the Fairlight CMI, with instruments from the computer such as the drums on \"Inner City\" and the big band jazz sounds on \"Vermillion Sands\". These same sampling techniques would later be used in records that he produced, such as \"Slave to the Rhythm\" by Grace Jones, \"90125\" by Yes, \"The Seduction of Claude Debussy\" by Art of Noise, and \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. While the album garnered little attention in the United Kingdom, Horn recalled in 2010 that it was a commercial success in France, and in the United States the album peaked at number 161 on the American \"Billboard\" 200. By the time of the album's release, when Horn was also producing the album \"The Lexicon of Love\" by ABC, he decided to take Sinclair's advice that he was always meant to be a producer rather than a performer or songwriter; thus the performance of \"Lenny\" on a Dutch television show, with ABC as the backing band, marked the end of The Buggles. As Horn recalled when he was interviewed after the show:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I'll never forget it because the guy said to me, 'well, things are not looking so good for you', and I said 'how do you mean?' And he said 'well, you know, your first record was a big hit now this record is number eleven, so your career is going downhill'. And I said 'well you know what? You see these guys, this is a band called ABC and I'm a producer now I don't really care about this stuff, I'm just doing it to promote the record. And I may be on the skids as an artist but things are looking up in other areas. End of interview. Fuck off.'\"\n1998\u2013present: Reunion performances.\nBeing largely a studio creation, The Buggles never toured. There were some \"Top of the Pops\" playback appearances, and later some performances for promotional purposes in support of the second album, but the first live outing by the original duo came in a low-key appearance on 3 December 1998 at a showcase for new bands on Horn's ZTT Records label at Mean Fiddler in northwest London. During this appearance, The Buggles played only \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", backed by singer Tessa Niles and one of the other groups on the bill, the Marbles.\nOn 11 November 2004, The Buggles reunited with Doss, Jardim-Allan and Woolley at Wembley Arena to perform \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" and \"The Plastic Age\" as part of a The Prince's Trust charity concert celebrating Horn's career as a producer.\nOn 28 September 2010, The Buggles performed their first actual concert, billed as \"The Lost Gig\", at Supperclub in Notting Hill, west London, as a fundraiser for the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability. Following an opening performance by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, The Buggles' set included \"The Age of Plastic\" performed in its entirety, including Woolley singing with Horn on \"Clean, Clean\". Also featured were Lol Creme, Chris Braide, Alison Moyet, Gary Barlow, Richard O'Brien and Claudia Br\u00fccken.\nOn 25 October 2011, The Buggles reunited to play at the British Music Experience at the O2 Arena. The gig included the first live performance of \"I Am a Camera\" and covers of \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie and \"Check It Out\" by Nicki Minaj and will.i.am, which utilised samples from \"Video Killed the Radio Star\". Kirsten Joy, Holly Petrie and Kate Westall provided backing vocals.\nIn 2013, Downes spoke of the chance of another reunion: \"It's always a challenge working on new stuff, and I'd love to collaborate with Trevor again ... it's not impossibility, just a matter of making the planets align so that one day we can hopefully make it happen.\" In March 2015, Downes joined the Trevor Horn Band on stage at the Shepherd's Bush Empire to play \"The Plastic Age\" and \"Video Killed the Radio Star\". Horn and Downes reunited in the studio in early 2016 for more Buggles activity.\nDuring April\u2013June 2023, The Buggles were the support act for Seal during his 30th anniversary tour, on which Horn was the musical director and bassist. This marked the group's first tour. The line up was the same as Seal's backing band, led by Horn. Geoff Downes was not involved. The set list included songs from both the band's albums and material by Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Yes.\nArtistry and reception.\nMany of the lyrics Trevor Horn wrote were inspired by sci-fi works by writers such as J. G. Ballard. According to Geoff Downes;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDownes claims to have used George Shearing's \"technique of doubling melody lines in block chords (using the 5th note)... quite extensively on some of the Buggles' recordings\".\nBoth of the Buggles' albums have received positive reception from music critics. The Trouser Press called both albums \"technically stunning, reasonably catchy and crashingly hollow,\" while AllMusic's Jeri Montesano said that, compared to 1990s pop music, they \"still sound fresh\".\nLegacy.\nAfter leaving the Buggles, Downes joined his former Yes bandmate Steve Howe in forming the aforementioned supergroup Asia, together with John Wetton (formerly of King Crimson) and Carl Palmer (formerly of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer), which made its name with the 1982 hit single \"Heat of the Moment\". Downes remains a member of Asia today. Parallel to Asia, he also worked on other projects, including several solo albums and production of acts such as GTR. In 2011, Downes rejoined Yes as their keyboardist, working once again alongside Horn on the album \"Fly from Here\" and accompanying tour.\nHorn embarked on a highly successful career as a record producer, achieving success with the bands ABC, Dollar, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Art of Noise, and even the albums \"90125\" and \"Big Generator\" from a re-formed Yes, with Jon Anderson back on vocals. In 1985, Horn won the Best Producer BRIT Award. More than twenty years on, he is still active, producing with Seal, Tina Turner, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Cher, Simple Minds, Belle and Sebastian, t.A.T.u., Charlotte Church, Captain, Pet Shop Boys and Robbie Williams among his many credits. He is currently working with his new band, the Producers, who released the album \"Made in Basing Street\" (2012). Both Asia and the Producers have played \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" as part of their live set in tribute to their members' origins in the Buggles.\nIn 2009, Horn produced the album \"Reality Killed the Video Star\" for British singer Robbie Williams. The album title pays homage to the trademark Buggles song, and Horn performed the song with Williams (Horn on bass and Williams on vocals) at the BBC Electric Proms on 20 October 2009.\nFollowing 2010 discussions with Chris Squire, Horn produced the Yes album \"Fly from Here\" (2011), the bulk of whose forty-seven-minute duration comprises unused or incomplete Buggles material from the early 1980s (particularly \"We Can Fly from Here\"), reminiscent of the use of the Buggles' \"I am a Camera\" for \"Into the Lens\" on \"Drama\" during their first stint in 1980. Horn brought in Downes to play keyboards on the album (replacing Oliver Wakeman, son of Rick Wakeman) and Horn himself also performed some parts and sang backing vocals on the album. The album's group photograph prominently features Horn standing centre, signifying that to all intents he was considered the sixth band member for the recording. \"The Fly From Here\" tour did not feature Horn. At the suggestion of Yes drummer Alan White, the band subsequently released a new version of the album entitled \"Fly from Here \u2013 Return Trip\", with Horn recording new lead vocals (replacing Benoit David).\nIn February 2017, Bruce Woolley and his band the Radio Science Orchestra, released a new, dark ambient version of \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" with singer Polly Scattergood on vocals. The single was released on Gramophone Records, along with a music video featuring musician and producer Thomas Dolby and Wolfgang Wild of \"Retronaut\" fame.\n\"The Robot Sings\".\nOn 8 March 2017, Horn posted an announcement on his official Facebook page, linking to an article on theatre website \"Broadway World\" that Horn, Downes and Woolley were working together on a musical provisionally entitled \"The Robot Sings\". Based on \"The Tempest\" by William Shakespeare, and taking influence from sci-fi authors such as J. G. Ballard, Brian Aldiss and Isaac Asimov, the stage show was to tell the story of a boy called Jay trying to save his robot companion. The musical was to feature \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" as well as new compositions by Downes, and the script was to be written by Jack Woolley.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the field of real analysis, he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the Riemann integral, and his work on Fourier series. His contributions to complex analysis include most notably the introduction of Riemann surfaces, breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis. His 1859 paper on the prime-counting function, containing the original statement of the Riemann hypothesis, is regarded as a foundational paper of analytic number theory. Through his pioneering contributions to differential geometry, Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of general relativity. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.\nEarly years.\nRiemann was born on 17 September 1826 in Breselenz, a village near Dannenberg in the Kingdom of Hanover. His father, Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, was a poor Lutheran pastor in Breselenz who fought in the Napoleonic Wars. His mother, Charlotte Ebell, died in 1846. Riemann was the second of six children. Riemann exhibited exceptional mathematical talent, such as calculation abilities, from an early age but suffered from timidity and a fear of speaking in public, and had frail health.\nEducation.\nDuring 1840, Riemann went to Hanover to live with his grandmother and attend lyceum (middle school years), because such a type of school was not accessible from his home village. After the death of his grandmother in 1842, he transferred to the , a high school in L\u00fcneburg. There, Riemann studied the Bible intensively, but he was often distracted by mathematics. His teachers were amazed by his ability to perform complicated mathematical operations, in which he often outstripped his instructor's knowledge. In 1846, at the age of 19, he started studying philology and Christian theology in order to become a pastor and help with his family's finances.\nDuring the spring of 1846, his father, after gathering enough money, sent Riemann to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he planned to study towards a degree in theology. However, once there, he began studying mathematics under Carl Friedrich Gauss (specifically his lectures on the method of least squares). Gauss recommended that Riemann give up his theological work and enter the mathematical field; after getting his father's approval, Riemann transferred to the University of Berlin in 1847. During his time of study, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Jakob Steiner, and Gotthold Eisenstein were teaching. He stayed in Berlin for two years and returned to G\u00f6ttingen in 1849.\nAcademia.\nRiemann held his first lectures in 1854, which founded the field of Riemannian geometry and thereby set the stage for Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. In 1857, there was an attempt to promote Riemann to extraordinary professor status at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Although this attempt failed, it did result in Riemann finally being granted a regular salary. In 1859, following the death of Dirichlet (who held Gauss's chair at the University of G\u00f6ttingen), he was promoted to head the mathematics department at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He was also the first to suggest using dimensions higher than merely three or four in order to describe physical reality.\nIn 1862 he married Elise Koch; they had a daughter.\nProtestant family and death in Italy.\nRiemann fled G\u00f6ttingen when the armies of Hanover and Prussia clashed there in 1866. He died of tuberculosis during his third journey to Italy in Selasca (now a hamlet of Verbania on Lake Maggiore), where he was buried in the cemetery in Biganzolo (Verbania).\nRiemann was a dedicated Christian, the son of a Protestant minister, and saw his life as a mathematician as another way to serve God. During his life, he held closely to his Christian faith and considered it to be the most important aspect of his life. At the time of his death, he was reciting the Lord's Prayer with his wife and died before they finished saying the prayer. Meanwhile, in G\u00f6ttingen his housekeeper discarded some of the papers in his office, including much unpublished work. Riemann refused to publish incomplete work, and some deep insights may have been lost.\nRiemannian geometry.\nRiemann's published works opened up research areas combining analysis with geometry. These would subsequently become major parts of the theories of Riemannian geometry, algebraic geometry, and complex manifold theory. The theory of Riemann surfaces was elaborated by Felix Klein and particularly Adolf Hurwitz. This area of mathematics is part of the foundation of topology and is still being applied in novel ways to mathematical physics.\nIn 1853, Gauss asked Riemann, his student, to prepare a \"Habilitationsschrift\" on the foundations of geometry. Over many months, Riemann developed his theory of higher dimensions and delivered his lecture at G\u00f6ttingen on 10 June 1854, entitled \"Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen\". It was not published until twelve years later in 1868 by Dedekind, two years after his death. Its early reception appears to have been slow, but it is now recognized as one of the most important works in geometry.\nThe subject founded by this work is Riemannian geometry. Riemann found the correct way to extend into \"n\" dimensions the differential geometry of surfaces, which Gauss himself proved in his \"theorema egregium\". The fundamental objects are called the Riemannian metric and the Riemann curvature tensor. For the surface (two-dimensional) case, the curvature at each point can be reduced to a number (scalar), with the surfaces of constant positive or negative curvature being models of the non-Euclidean geometries.\nThe Riemann metric is a collection of numbers at every point in space (i.e., a tensor) which allows measurements of speed in any trajectory, whose integral gives the distance between the trajectory's endpoints. For example, Riemann found that in four spatial dimensions, one needs ten numbers at each point to describe distances and curvatures on a manifold, no matter how distorted it is.\nComplex analysis.\nIn his dissertation, he established a geometric foundation for complex analysis through Riemann surfaces, through which multi-valued functions like the logarithm (with infinitely many sheets) or the square root (with two sheets) could become one-to-one functions. Complex functions are harmonic functions (that is, they satisfy Laplace's equation and thus the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations) on these surfaces and are described by the location of their singularities and the topology of the surfaces. The topological \"genus\" of the Riemann surfaces is given by formula_1, where the surface has formula_2 leaves coming together at formula_3 branch points. For formula_4 the Riemann surface has formula_5 parameters (the \"moduli\").\nHis contributions to this area are numerous. The famous Riemann mapping theorem says that a simply connected domain in the complex plane is \"biholomorphically equivalent\" (i.e. there is a bijection between them that is holomorphic with a holomorphic inverse) to either formula_6 or to the interior of the unit circle. The generalization of the theorem to Riemann surfaces is the famous uniformization theorem, which was proved in the 19th century by Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Felix Klein. Here, too, rigorous proofs were first given after the development of richer mathematical tools (in this case, topology). For the proof of the existence of functions on Riemann surfaces, he used a minimality condition, which he called the Dirichlet principle. Karl Weierstrass found a gap in the proof: Riemann had not noticed that his working assumption (that the minimum existed) might not work; the function space might not be complete, and therefore the existence of a minimum was not guaranteed. Through the work of David Hilbert in the Calculus of Variations, the Dirichlet principle was finally established. Otherwise, Weierstrass was very impressed with Riemann, especially with his theory of abelian functions. When Riemann's work appeared, Weierstrass withdrew his paper from \"Crelle's Journal\" and did not publish it. They had a good understanding when Riemann visited him in Berlin in 1859. Weierstrass encouraged his student Hermann Amandus Schwarz to find alternatives to the Dirichlet principle in complex analysis, in which he was successful. An anecdote from Arnold Sommerfeld shows the difficulties which contemporary mathematicians had with Riemann's new ideas. In 1870, Weierstrass had taken Riemann's dissertation with him on a holiday to Rigi and complained that it was hard to understand. The physicist Hermann von Helmholtz assisted him in the work overnight and returned with the comment that it was \"natural\" and \"very understandable\".\nOther highlights include his work on abelian functions and theta functions on Riemann surfaces. Riemann had been in a competition with Weierstrass since 1857 to solve the Jacobian inverse problems for abelian integrals, a generalization of elliptic integrals. Riemann used theta functions in several variables and reduced the problem to the determination of the zeros of these theta functions. Riemann also investigated period matrices and characterized them through the \"Riemannian period relations\" (symmetric, real part negative). By Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and Solomon Lefschetz the validity of this relation is equivalent with the embedding of formula_7 (where formula_8 is the lattice of the period matrix) in a projective space by means of theta functions. For certain values of formula_2, this is the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, an example of an abelian manifold.\nMany mathematicians such as Alfred Clebsch furthered Riemann's work on algebraic curves. These theories depended on the properties of a function defined on Riemann surfaces. For example, the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem (Roch was a student of Riemann) says something about the number of linearly independent differentials (with known conditions on the zeros and poles) of a Riemann surface.\nAccording to Detlef Laugwitz, automorphic functions appeared for the first time in an essay about the Laplace equation on electrically charged cylinders. Riemann however used such functions for conformal maps (such as mapping topological triangles to the circle) in his 1859 lecture on hypergeometric functions or in his treatise on minimal surfaces.\nReal analysis.\nIn the field of real analysis, he discovered the Riemann integral in his habilitation. Among other things, he showed that every piecewise continuous function is integrable. Similarly, the Stieltjes integral goes back to the G\u00f6ttinger mathematician, and so they are named together in the Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral.\nIn his habilitation work on Fourier series, where he followed the work of his teacher Dirichlet, he showed that Riemann-integrable functions are \"representable\" by Fourier series. Dirichlet had shown this for continuous, piecewise-differentiable functions (thus with countably many non-differentiable points). Riemann gave an example of a Fourier series representing a continuous, almost nowhere-differentiable function, a case not covered by Dirichlet. He also proved the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma: if a function is representable by a Fourier series, then the Fourier coefficients go to zero for large\u00a0\"n\".\nRiemann's essay was also the starting point for Georg Cantor's work with Fourier series, which was the impetus for set theory.\nHe also worked with hypergeometric differential equations in 1857 using complex analytical methods and presented the solutions through the behaviour of closed paths about singularities (described by the monodromy matrix). The proof of the existence of such differential equations by previously known monodromy matrices is one of the Hilbert problems.\nNumber theory.\nRiemann made some famous contributions to modern analytic number theory. In a single short paper, the only one he published on the subject of number theory, he investigated the zeta function that now bears his name, establishing its importance for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. The Riemann hypothesis was one of a series of conjectures he made about the function's properties.\nIn Riemann's work, there are many more interesting developments. He proved the functional equation for the zeta function (already known to Leonhard Euler), behind which a theta function lies. Through the summation of this approximation function over the non-trivial zeros on the line with real portion 1/2, he gave an exact, \"explicit formula\" for formula_10.\nRiemann knew of Pafnuty Chebyshev's work on the Prime Number Theorem. He had visited Dirichlet in 1852.\nWritings.\nRiemann's works include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The definition for undirected graphs states that every edge can be traversed in either direction. Directed graphs require that consecutive vertices be connected by an appropriate directed edge.\nTwo vertices are adjacent when they are both incident to a common edge. A path in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices formula_1 such that formula_2 is adjacent to formula_3 for formula_4. Such a path formula_5 is called a path of length formula_6 from formula_7 to formula_8. (The formula_2 are variables; their numbering relates to their position in the sequence and need not relate to a canonical labeling.)\nLet formula_10 where formula_11 is the edge incident to both formula_2 and formula_13. Given a real-valued weight function formula_14, and an undirected (simple) graph formula_15, the shortest path from formula_16 to formula_17 is the path formula_18 (where formula_19 and formula_20) that over all possible formula_21 minimizes the sum formula_22 When each edge in the graph has unit weight or formula_23, this is equivalent to finding the path with fewest edges.\nThe problem is also sometimes called the single-pair shortest path problem, to distinguish it from the following variations:\nThese generalizations have significantly more efficient algorithms than the simplistic approach of running a single-pair shortest path algorithm on all relevant pairs of vertices.\nAlgorithms.\nSeveral well-known algorithms exist for solving this problem and its variants.\nAdditional algorithms and associated evaluations may be found in .\nSingle-source shortest paths.\nDirected acyclic graphs.\nAn algorithm using topological sorting can solve the single-source shortest path problem in time \u0398(\"E\" + \"V\") in arbitrarily-weighted directed acyclic graphs.\nDirected graphs with nonnegative weights.\nThe following table is taken from , with some corrections and additions.\nA green background indicates an asymptotically best bound in the table; \"L\" is the maximum length (or weight) among all edges, assuming integer edge weights.\nDirected graphs with arbitrary weights with negative cycles.\nFinds a negative cycle or calculates distances to all vertices.\nApplications.\nNetwork flows are a fundamental concept in graph theory and operations research, often used to model problems involving the transportation of goods, liquids, or information through a network. A network flow problem typically involves a directed graph where each edge represents a pipe, wire, or road, and each edge has a capacity, which is the maximum amount that can flow through it. The goal is to find a feasible flow that maximizes the flow from a source node to a sink node.\nShortest Path Problems can be used to solve certain network flow problems, particularly when dealing with single-source, single-sink networks. In these scenarios, we can transform the network flow problem into a series of shortest path problems.\nAll-pairs shortest paths.\nThe all-pairs shortest path problem finds the shortest paths between every pair of vertices v, v' in the graph. The all-pairs shortest paths problem for unweighted directed graphs was introduced by , who observed that it could be solved by a linear number of matrix multiplications that takes a total time of \"O\"(\"V\"4).\nApplications.\nShortest path algorithms are applied to automatically find directions between physical locations, such as driving directions on web mapping websites like MapQuest or Google Maps. For this application fast specialized algorithms are available.\nIf one represents a nondeterministic abstract machine as a graph where vertices describe states and edges describe possible transitions, shortest path algorithms can be used to find an optimal sequence of choices to reach a certain goal state, or to establish lower bounds on the time needed to reach a given state. For example, if vertices represent the states of a puzzle like a Rubik's Cube and each directed edge corresponds to a single move or turn, shortest path algorithms can be used to find a solution that uses the minimum possible number of moves.\nIn a networking or telecommunications mindset, this shortest path problem is sometimes called the min-delay path problem and usually tied with a widest path problem. For example, the algorithm may seek the shortest (min-delay) widest path, or widest shortest (min-delay) path.\nA more lighthearted application is the games of \"six degrees of separation\" that try to find the shortest path in graphs like movie stars appearing in the same film.\nOther applications, often studied in operations research, include plant and facility layout, robotics, transportation, and VLSI design.\nRoad networks.\nA road network can be considered as a graph with positive weights. The nodes represent road junctions and each edge of the graph is associated with a road segment between two junctions. The weight of an edge may correspond to the length of the associated road segment, the time needed to traverse the segment, or the cost of traversing the segment. Using directed edges it is also possible to model one-way streets. Such graphs are special in the sense that some edges are more important than others for long-distance travel (e.g. highways). This property has been formalized using the notion of highway dimension. There are a great number of algorithms that exploit this property and are therefore able to compute the shortest path a lot quicker than would be possible on general graphs.\nAll of these algorithms work in two phases. In the first phase, the graph is preprocessed without knowing the source or target node. The second phase is the query phase. In this phase, source and target node are known. The idea is that the road network is static, so the preprocessing phase can be done once and used for a large number of queries on the same road network.\nThe algorithm with the fastest known query time is called hub labeling and is able to compute shortest path on the road networks of Europe or the US in a fraction of a microsecond. Other techniques that have been used are:\nRelated problems.\nFor shortest path problems in computational geometry, see Euclidean shortest path.\nThe shortest multiple disconnected path is a representation of the primitive path network within the framework of Reptation theory. The widest path problem seeks a path so that the minimum label of any edge is as large as possible.\nOther related problems may be classified into the following categories.\nPaths with constraints.\nUnlike the shortest path problem, which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative cycles, shortest path problems which include additional constraints on the desired solution path are called Constrained Shortest Path First, and are harder to solve. One example is the constrained shortest path problem, which attempts to minimize the total cost of the path while at the same time maintaining another metric below a given threshold. This makes the problem NP-complete (such problems are not believed to be efficiently solvable for large sets of data, see P = NP problem). Another NP-complete example requires a specific set of vertices to be included in the path, which makes the problem similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is the problem of finding the shortest path that goes through every vertex exactly once, and returns to the start. The problem of finding the longest path in a graph is also NP-complete.\nPartial observability.\nThe Canadian traveller problem and the stochastic shortest path problem are generalizations where either the graph is not completely known to the mover, changes over time, or where actions (traversals) are probabilistic.\nStrategic shortest paths.\nSometimes, the edges in a graph have personalities: each edge has its own selfish interest. An example is a communication network, in which each edge is a computer that possibly belongs to a different person. Different computers have different transmission speeds, so every edge in the network has a numeric weight equal to the number of milliseconds it takes to transmit a message. Our goal is to send a message between two points in the network in the shortest time possible. If we know the transmission-time of each computer (the weight of each edge), then we can use a standard shortest-paths algorithm. If we do not know the transmission times, then we have to ask each computer to tell us its transmission-time. But, the computers may be selfish: a computer might tell us that its transmission time is very long, so that we will not bother it with our messages. A possible solution to this problem is to use a variant of the VCG mechanism, which gives the computers an incentive to reveal their true weights.\nNegative cycle detection.\nIn some cases, the main goal is not to find the shortest path, but only to detect if the graph contains a negative cycle. Some shortest-paths algorithms can be used for this purpose:\nGeneral algebraic framework on semirings: the algebraic path problem.\nMany problems can be framed as a form of the shortest path for some suitably substituted notions of addition along a path and taking the minimum. The general approach to these is to consider the two operations to be those of a semiring. Semiring multiplication is done along the path, and the addition is between paths. This general framework is known as the algebraic path problem.\nMost of the classic shortest-path algorithms (and new ones) can be formulated as solving linear systems over such algebraic structures.\nMore recently, an even more general framework for solving these (and much less obviously related problems) has been developed under the banner of valuation algebras.\nShortest path in stochastic time-dependent networks.\nIn real-life, a transportation network is usually stochastic and time-dependent. The travel duration on a road segment depends on many factors such as the amount of traffic (origin-destination matrix), road work, weather, accidents and vehicle breakdowns. A more realistic model of such a road network is a stochastic time-dependent (STD) network.\nThere is no accepted definition of optimal path under uncertainty (that is, in stochastic road networks). It is a controversial subject, despite considerable progress during the past decade. One common definition is a path with the minimum expected travel time. The main advantage of this approach is that it can make use of efficient shortest path algorithms for deterministic networks. However, the resulting optimal path may not be reliable, because this approach fails to address travel time variability.\nTo tackle this issue, some researchers use travel duration distribution instead of its expected value. So, they find the probability distribution of total travel duration using different optimization methods such as dynamic programming and Dijkstra's algorithm . These methods use stochastic optimization, specifically stochastic dynamic programming to find the shortest path in networks with probabilistic arc length. The terms \"travel time reliability\" and \"travel time variability\" are used as opposites in the transportation research literature: the higher the variability, the lower the reliability of predictions.\nTo account for variability, researchers have suggested two alternative definitions for an optimal path under uncertainty. The \"most reliable path\" is one that maximizes the probability of arriving on time given a travel time budget. An \"\u03b1-reliable path\" is one that minimizes the travel time budget required to arrive on time with a given probability.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for her distinctive husky voice, Tyler came to prominence with the release of her 1977 album \"The World Starts Tonight\" and its singles \"Lost in France\" and \"More Than a Lover\". Her 1977 single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, and number three on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nIn the 1980s, Tyler ventured into rock music with songwriter and producer Jim Steinman. He wrote Tyler's biggest hit \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\", the lead single from her 1983 UK chart-topping album \"Faster Than the Speed of Night\". Steinman also wrote Tyler's other major 1980s hit \"Holding Out for a Hero\". She had success in mainland Europe during the 1990s with Dieter Bohlen, who wrote and produced her hit \"Bitterblue\". In 2003, Tyler re-recorded \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" with singer Kareen Antonn. Their bilingual duet, titled \"Si demain... (Turn Around)\", topped the French charts.\n\"Rocks and Honey\" was released in 2013 and features the single \"Believe in Me\", which she performed representing the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. After reuniting with the producer David Mackay, she released \"Between the Earth and the Stars\" (2019) and \"The Best Is Yet to Come\" (2021).\nHer work has earned her three Grammy Award nominations and three Brit Award nominations (including twice for British Female Solo Artist), among other accolades. In 2022, she was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to music.\nEarly life.\nTyler was born Gaynor Hopkins on 8 June 1951 in Skewen, Neath, Wales. Her father, Glynd\u0175r Hopkins, was a coal miner and serviceman in the Second World War, and her mother, Elsie Hopkins (n\u00e9e Lewis), was a former homemaker. She grew up in a four-bedroom council house with three sisters and two brothers. Her siblings had varied music tastes, exposing her to artists such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and the Beatles. Hopkins attended Rhydhir Comprehensive School in Neath, Wales. She left school, age 16, with no qualifications and began working in a grocery shop. Hopkins and her family were deeply religious Protestants. Her first public performance took place in a chapel as a child, singing the Anglican hymn \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\". \nIn April 1969, Hopkins was entered into a local talent competition by her aunt, and she came second to an accordionist. Inspired to pursue a career in singing, Hopkins found work as a backing singer for Bobby Wayne &amp; the Dixies before forming her own band, Imagination. It was around this time that she changed her name to Sherene Davis, to avoid being confused with Welsh folk singer Mary Hopkin.\nCareer.\n1975\u20131978: \"The World Starts Tonight\" and \"Natural Force\".\nIn 1975, Davis was spotted singing with her band in the Townsman Club, Swansea, by talent scout Roger Bell, who invited her to London to record a demo track. After many months had passed, she received a phone call from RCA Records, offering her a recording contract. They also recommended that she change her name again. After compiling a list of surnames and first names from a newspaper, Davis found a new name in \"Bonnie Tyler\".\nRonnie Scott and Steve Wolfe became her managers, songwriters and producers. \"My! My! Honeycomb\" was released as her debut single in April 1976, and failed to impact any charts worldwide. In September 1976, as part of a promotional campaign for Tyler's subsequent single release, \"Lost in France\", RCA Records allocated \u00a34,000 for a strategic promotional initiative, which involved sending a group of 30 music journalists and radio DJs to Le Touquet, France, where they met Tyler over a four-course meal. \"Lost in France\" peaked at no. 9 in the UK and led to Tyler's first appearance on \"Top of the Pops\". \"More Than a Lover\" followed in January 1977. Due to perceived sexual nature of the song's lyrics, it was banned from a new British children's TV series, \"Get It Together\". Though surprised by the decision, Tyler stated she was grateful for the \"extra publicity\". It peaked at no. 27 in the UK.\nTyler's debut album, \"The World Starts Tonight\", was released in February 1977. To promote the album, Tyler embarked on her first UK tour as a guest artist with Gene Pitney. The album failed to chart in the UK, but reached no. 2 in Sweden. In the spring of 1977, Tyler underwent an operation to remove vocal cord nodules and was advised by her doctor to rest her voice for six weeks. Tyler screamed in frustration one day, resulting in a permanent raspy tone.\nIn July 1977, Tyler released her fourth single, \"Heaven\". It peaked at no. 24 in Germany. Tyler ascribed the underwhelming performance of the single in other regions to the passing of Elvis Presley in August 1977. This event resulted in RCA redirecting its focus towards reissuing Presley's extensive back catalogue. \"It's a Heartache\" followed in November 1977 and became one of Tyler's most-successful singles, peaking at no. 4 in the UK and no. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Here Am I\" was released in April 1978, and it peaked at no. 4 in Norway. David Mackay parted ways with Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe in 1978, and Gordon Mills briefly took over as Tyler's manager. Mills organised Tyler's first tour of the United States in July 1978, including several nights at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, supporting Tom Jones.\nTyler's second studio album, \"Natural Force\", was released in May 1978. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with sales of over half a million copies.\n1979\u20131981: \"Diamond Cut\" and \"Goodbye to the Island\".\nRonnie Scott and Steve Wolfe produced Tyler's third album, \"Diamond Cut\", with Robin Geoffrey Cable. Released in February 1979, it was a Top 20 record in Finland, Norway and Sweden, but only reached 145 in the US. Tyler felt that RCA was pushing her to record more country-oriented music, which frustrated her. The album yielded one major hit, \"My Guns Are Loaded\", which peaked at no. 10 on the Canadian AC chart.\nIn the summer of 1979, Tyler had another UK Top 40 hit with \"(The World Is Full of) Married Men\". She recorded it for a film adaptation of Jackie Collins' novel of the same name. Tyler performs the song during the film's closing titles.\nIn November 1979, Tyler represented the United Kingdom at the Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Japan. She won the Grand Prix International award for her performance of \"Sitting on the Edge of the Ocean\", written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe. They co-produced Tyler's fourth album, \"Goodbye to the Island\", with Hugh Murphy. Released in 1981, it only charted in Norway. RCA invited Tyler to extend her contract for another five years, but she declined, expressing disillusionment with her artistic image and noting a scarcity of performance opportunities in the aftermath of several unsuccessful singles.\n1982\u20131989: The CBS Years.\nAfter her contract with RCA expired, Tyler signed with CBS/Columbia. A&amp;R man Muff Winwood asked Tyler to scout a new producer. She considered Phil Collins, Jeff Lynne and Alan Tarney, but Jim Steinman was her first choice. \"I'm a huge fan of his records, especially his solo album, and when my manager and I were discussing my comeback we both agreed that I had to sound the best or nobody would take me seriously.\" Steinman initially declined, but reconsidered after Tyler sent him demos of the rock material she was hoping to record.\nAfter their initial meeting, Tyler returned to Steinman's apartment in New York a few weeks later where she performed \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" with Rory Dodd. Steinman described the song as \"a Wagnerian-like onslaught of sound and emotion\", and a \"showpiece\" for Tyler's voice. Her fifth album was recorded at the Power Station in New York, with members of the E Street Band, Rick Derringer on guitar, Rory Dodd and Eric Troyer on backing vocals, and Steinman as producer.\n\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" was released in the UK on 11 February 1983. It became one of the best-selling singles of all time with over six million units sold. Her fifth studio album, \"Faster Than the Speed of Night\", debuted at no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and reached no. 3 on the US \"Cashbox\" chart and no. 4 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling over one million copies in the United States. Tyler's commercial success led to several award nominations, including two Grammys, two AMAs and a BRIT Award. Tyler was named Best Recording Artist at the Variety Club of Great Britain Awards, and she received a Goldene Europa.\nTyler also found success through some of her soundtrack recordings in the mid-80s.

Tyler also declined an offer to record the theme for the James Bond spin-off \"Never Say Never Again\".\nIn 1986, Tyler released her sixth studio album, \"Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire\". In another collaboration with Jim Steinman, the album also featured songs written by Desmond Child and Bryan Adams and a cover of \"Band of Gold\" by Freda Payne. \"If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man)\" became the album's most successful single, selling over 250,000 units in France. The music video, directed by Steinman and Stuart Orme, received six nominations at the \"Billboard\" Video Music Conference.\nIn 1987, Tyler collaborated with Mike Oldfield on the title track to his album \"Islands\". In the following year, Tyler played Polly Garter in George Martin's album \"Under Milk Wood\", a radio drama by Dylan Thomas. The music was composed by Elton John, and features vocal contributions from Tom Jones, Anthony Hopkins and Mary Hopkin.\nTyler asked Desmond Child to produce her seventh album, \"Hide Your Heart\", which came out on 9 May 1988. The album featured collaborations with Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Diane Warren. The album's singles, \"Hide Your Heart\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\" and \"The Best\" became major hits for other artists.\n1990\u20132000: Success in continental Europe.\nIn 1990, Tyler signed to Hansa/BMG Ariola and began working with various producers for her eighth studio album. She collaborated with Dieter Bohlen, Giorgio Moroder, Nik Kershaw and Roy Bittan. \"We used so many producers in efforts to capture many different moods for many different territories, because we believed in the international crossover potential of Tyler,\" stated David Brunner, A&amp;R manager for Hansa.\n\"Bitterblue\" was released on 11 November 1991. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Tomas Mureika noted that the album marked a \"much more mainstream and less bombastic\" direction in Tyler's career. The title track was released a month ahead of the album and became a top 40 hit in several European countries. It was named 'Catchy Song of the Year' at the RSH-Gold Awards. In the following year, \"Bitterblue\" was released as a promotional single in the United States where it was met with criticism. \"Billboard\" wrote that \"bombastic production, with a rush of bagpipes and a choir of chirping children at the forefront, overpower Tyler's distinctive raspy voice.\"\nWhile \"Bitterblue\" was never released in the UK or US, the album was a commercial success in mainland Europe. It topped the charts in Austria and Norway, achieving 4\u00d7 Platinum status in the latter country with eleven weeks at no. 1.\nTyler's subsequent albums, \"Angel Heart\" (1992) and \"Silhouette in Red\" (1993), were also successful in mainland Europe. Both albums featured a greater share of songs written and produced by Dieter Bohlen. Tyler was named Best International Singer at the Goldene Europa Awards in 1993, and Best Pop/Rock Singer at the ECHO Awards in 1994.\nIn 1995, Tyler moved to EastWest Records and released \"Free Spirit\".

EMI approached her with the idea of recording a cover album with an orchestra and Tyler's band. She selected thirteen songs by artists such as U2, The Beatles and Bruce Springsteen. The songs were arranged by composers Nick Ingman and Karl Jenkins, and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\"Heart Strings\" was released on 18 March 2003, and was followed by a tour in Germany. The album charted in three European countries.\n2004\u20132005: Success in France.\nIn 2003, vocalist Kareen Antonn invited Tyler to re-record \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" as a bilingual duet in French and English. The new version was re-titled \"Si demain... (Turn Around)\" and released in December 2003. It went to no. 1 in Belgium and France, where it held the top position for ten weeks, selling over 500,000 units. The success of the single was considered to be Tyler's comeback in France, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews from music critics.\nTyler's fourteenth studio album \"Simply Believe\" was released in April 2004. It featured seven new songs and various re-recordings and covers. Tyler and Antonn recorded \"Si tout s'arr\u00eate (It's a Heartache)\" as a second bilingual duet. It peaked at number 12 in France.

One of Tyler's earliest musical memories was listening to her mother singing opera music in the family home. Tyler attended church until she was sixteen years old. Her first ever performance was singing \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\" in church. She was also exposed to the music of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles and other 1960s bands due to her siblings' musical tastes. Frankie Miller was the first live act that Tyler saw, and she later recorded duets with him.\nTyler's two biggest influences from a young age were Janis Joplin and Tina Turner. She cites \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" as being her all-time favourite song. Other artists that influenced Tyler in her youth include Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Meat Loaf, Joe Cocker, Dusty Springfield and Tommy Steele. She has also expressed admiration for contemporary artists such as Guns N' Roses, Anastacia, Toni Braxton, Duffy, and Eminem. She has also expressed interest in collaborating with Adele, whom she describes as \"a great song writer, singer and performer.\"\nVocal style.\nTyler's music contains elements of country, rock, pop, blues and Celtic. Her voice has been likened to Rod Stewart and Kim Carnes as a result of her vocal cord nodule operation in the 1970s, sometimes even being referred to as \"the female Rod Stewart\", and, after her collaborations with Jim Steinman, \"the female Meat Loaf\". Soon after her operation, when recording her second album, \"Natural Force\", the studio band complimented Tyler's changed voice. Reviewers from AllMusic have described Tyler's voice as \"inimitable\", \"wonderfully gritty\", and an \"effective instrument\" for drawing notice to her first managers, Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe.\nIn a review of \"Rocks and Honey\", \"OMH Media\" described Tyler's vocals as being \"good for only one thing and that's belting out gravelly vocals,\" suggesting that she sounds like Johnny Cash in his later years when she \"tries to restrain [her voice].\" With reference to her modern voice, \"The Yorkshire Times\" wrote that Tyler's vocals have \"still got what it takes to make you tingle.\" Jim Steinman told \"People\" magazine that he wrote \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" as a \"showpiece for [Tyler's] voice.\" AllMusic said that Tyler's voice \"produced the perfect type of 'desperate lovelorn' effect to suit the romantic lyrics.\"\nSongwriting.\nThough songwriting has never been a significant part of Tyler's career, she has co-written a handful of B-Sides and other tracks. \"Gonna Get Better\", a B-Side to the 1980 Japanese single \"Sayonara Tokyo\", was written with her brother, Paul Hopkins.\nIn 2001, Tyler co-wrote four songs with Gary Pickford-Hopkins on his \"GPH\" album, and duetted with him on the track \"Loving You Means Leaving You\". Tyler was also involved in writing several tracks for her 2005 album \"Wings\", including its singles \"Louise\" and \"Celebrate\".\nPhilanthropy.\nTyler has featured in three charity supergroups. In 1986, she joined the Anti-Heroin Project to record \"It's a Live-In World\". The proceeds were donated to the Phoenix House Charities who funded heroin recovery centres in the UK.\nIn the following year, Tyler featured as a chorus vocalist in the British-American charity group Ferry Aid, who released a cover of \"Let It Be\" by the Beatles. Proceeds were donated to a charity supporting the victims of the Zeebrugge Disaster. The single sold over 500,000 copies in the UK where it topped the charts for three weeks. In 1990, Tyler joined Rock Against Repatriation to record a cover of \"Sailing\". It was a protest song in response to the repatriation of Vietnamese boat people who fled to Hong Kong. The single peaked at no. 89 on the UK Singles Chart.\nSince the 1990s, Tyler has been a patron of the Bobath Children's Therapy Centre in Cardiff, Wales, who provide care for children with cerebral palsy. In 2013, she campaigned for Bobath to be recognised at the Pride of Britain Awards. Tyler is also an ambassador for the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales. In January 2005, Tyler performed at the Rock for Asia benefit concert in Ingolstadt, Germany, raising funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The event was recorded and released on DVD. In 2007, Tyler recorded \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" for \"Over the Rainbow\", a charity album conceptualised by Anneka Rice on the television show \"Challenge Anneka\". The album reached no. 1 on the UK Compilation Chart, with proceeds going to the Association of Children's Hospices.\nOn 1 November 2009, Tyler performed as the headline act at the Pinktober Women in Rock concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In the following year, she co-headlined at a benefit concert alongside Leo Sayer raising funds for Variety, the Children's Charity, in New Zealand. In 2012, Tyler was named patron of the AAG animal charity association in Guia, Portugal. Tyler re-recorded \"Holding Out for a Hero\" for the 2013 \"Children in Need\" appeal. In 2014, she endorsed the BUAV's campaign to make it mandatory for animals in testing laboratories to be re-homed. In 2020, Tyler contributed to a cover of \"Don't Answer Me\" by the Alan Parsons Project to raise funds for Bergamo, an Italian city that was deeply impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPersonal life.\nIn July 1973, Tyler married Robert Sullivan. He is a property developer and 1972 Olympic judo competitor. They have no children; Tyler miscarried when she was aged 39. Tyler and her family are Protestant.\nSince 1988, Tyler and her husband have owned a five-bedroom home in Albufeira in the Algarve in southern Portugal. Tyler had recorded one of her albums there in the late 1970s, and the couple spend much of the year there. In 2005, Tyler was filmed in the Algarve for the Polish entertainment TV show \"Zacisze gwiazd\", which explores the houses of actors and musicians.\nTyler and Sullivan have invested in property. As of a 1999 interview, they owned farmland in Portugal and New Zealand, 22 houses in Berkshire and London, and 65 stables offering horse boarding services. In a 2013 interview, Tyler stated that the farm in New Zealand had been converted to a dairy farm twelve years after they purchased the land. In the same interview, she stated that she and Sullivan also own a quarry.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHonours, awards and recognition.\n\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" and \"It's a Heartache\" have estimated sales of over 6 million units each, and are among the best-selling singles of all time.\nTyler's 1976 breakthrough with \"Lost in France\" led to her nomination for Best British Female Newcomer at the 1977 Brit Awards.

{"id": "41990", "revid": "50809688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41990", "title": "Mass noun", "text": "Noun whose quantity is treated as an undifferentiated unit\nIn linguistics, a mass noun, uncountable noun, non-count noun, uncount noun, or just uncountable, is a noun with the syntactic property that any part and quantity of it is treated as an undifferentiated unit, rather than as something with discrete elements. Uncountable nouns are distinguished from count nouns.\nGiven that different languages have different grammatical features, the actual test for which nouns are mass nouns may vary between languages. In English, mass nouns are characterized by the impossibility of being directly modified by a numeral without specifying a unit of measurement and by the impossibility of being combined with an indefinite article (\"a\" or \"an\"). Thus, the mass noun \"water\" is quantified as \"20 litres of water\" while the count noun \"chair\" is quantified as \"20 chairs\". However, both mass and count nouns can be quantified in relative terms without unit specification (e.g., \"so much water\", \"so many chairs\", though note the different quantifiers \"much\" and \"many\"). \nMass nouns have no concept of singular and plural, although in English they take singular verb forms. However, many mass nouns in English can be converted to count nouns, which can then be used in the plural to denote (for instance) more than one instance or variety of a certain sort of entity \u2013 for example, \"\"Many cleaning agents today are technically not soaps [i.e. types of soap], but detergents,\" or \"I drank about three beers [i.e. bottles or glasses of beer]\"\".\nSome nouns can be used indifferently as mass or count nouns, \"e.g.\", \"three cabbages\" or \"three heads of cabbage\"; \"three ropes\" or \"three lengths of rope\". Some have different senses as mass and count nouns: \"paper\" is a mass noun as a material (\"three reams of paper\", \"one sheet of paper\"), but a count noun as a unit of writing (\"the students passed in their papers\").\nGrammatical number and physical discreteness.\nIn English (and in many other languages), there is a tendency for nouns referring to liquids (\"water\", \"juice\"), powders (\"sugar\", \"sand\"), or substances (\"metal\", \"wood\") to be used in mass syntax, and for nouns referring to objects or people to be count nouns. But there are many exceptions: the mass/count distinction is a property of the \"terms\", not their referents. For example, the same set of chairs can be referred to as \"seven chairs\" (count) and as \"furniture\" (mass); the Middle English mass noun \"pease\" has become the count noun \"pea\" by morphological reanalysis; \"vegetables\" are a plural count form, while the British English slang synonym \"veg\" is a mass noun.\nIn languages that have a partitive case, the distinction is explicit and mandatory. For example, in Finnish, \"join vett\u00e4\", \"I drank (some) water\", the word \"vesi\", \"water\", is in the partitive case. The related sentence \"join veden\", \"I drank (the) water\", using the accusative case instead, assumes that there was a specific countable portion of water that was completely drunk.\nThe work of logicians like Godehard Link and Manfred Krifka established that the mass/count distinction can be given a precise, mathematical definition in terms of quantization and cumulativity.\nCumulativity and mass nouns.\nAn expression \"P\" has cumulative reference if and only if for any \"X\" and \"Y\":\nIn more formal terms (Krifka 1998):\nformula_1\nwhich may be read as: \"X\" is cumulative if there exists at least one pair\" x,y\", where \"x\" and \"y\" are distinct, and both have the property \"X\", and if for all possible pairs \"x\" and \"y\" fitting that description, \"X\" is a property of the sum of \"x\" and \"y\".\nConsider, for example \"cutlery\": If one collection of cutlery is combined with another, we still have \"cutlery.\" Similarly, if water is added to water, we still have \"water.\" But if a chair is added to another, we do not have \"a chair\", but rather two chairs. Thus the nouns \"cutlery\" and \"water\" have cumulative reference, while the expression \"a chair\" does not. The expression \"chairs\", however, does, suggesting that the generalization is not actually specific to the mass-count distinction. As many have noted, it is possible to provide an alternative analysis, by which mass nouns and plural count nouns are assigned a similar semantics, as distinct from that of singular count nouns.\nAn expression \"P\" has quantized reference if and only if, for any X:\nThis can be seen to hold in the case of the noun \"house\": no proper part of \"a house\", for example the bathroom, or the entrance door, is itself a house. Similarly, no proper part of \"a man\", say his index finger, or his knee, can be described as \"a man\". Hence, \"house\" and \"man\" have quantized reference. However, collections of \"cutlery\" do have proper parts that can themselves be described as \"cutlery\". Hence \"cutlery\" does not have quantized reference. Notice again that this is probably not a fact about mass-count syntax, but about prototypical examples, since many singular count nouns have referents whose proper parts can be described by the same term. Examples include divisible count nouns like \"rope\", \"string\", \"stone\", \"tile\", etc.\nSome expressions are neither quantized nor cumulative. Examples of this include collective nouns like \"committee\". A committee may well contain a proper part which is itself a committee. Hence this expression is not quantized. It is not cumulative, either: the sum of two separate committees is not necessarily a \"committee\". In terms of the mass/count distinction, \"committee\" behaves like a count noun. By some accounts, these examples are taken to indicate that the best characterization of mass nouns is that they are \"cumulative nouns\". On such accounts, count nouns should then be characterized as \"non-cumulative\" nouns: this characterization correctly groups \"committee\" together with the count nouns. If, instead, we had chosen to characterize count nouns as \"quantized nouns\", and mass nouns as \"non-quantized\" ones, then we would (incorrectly) be led to expect \"committee\" to be a mass noun. However, as noted above, such a characterization fails to explain many central phenomena of the mass-count distinction.\nMultiple senses for one noun.\nMany English nouns can be used in either mass or count syntax, and in these cases, they take on cumulative reference when used as mass nouns. For example, one may say that \"there's \"apple\" in this sauce\", and then \"apple\" has cumulative reference, and, hence, is used as a mass noun. The names of animals, such as \"chicken\", \"fox\" or \"lamb\" are count when referring to the animals themselves, but are mass when referring to their meat, fur, or other substances produced by them. (e.g., \"I'm cooking chicken tonight\" or \"This coat is made of fox.\") Conversely, \"fire\" is frequently used as a mass noun, but \"a fire\" refers to a discrete entity. Substance terms like \"water\" which are frequently used as mass nouns, can be used as count nouns to denote arbitrary units of a substance (\"Two \"waters\", please\") or of several types/varieties (\"\"waters\" of the world\").\n*\"I'll have a \"cup\" of \"coffee\".\" (count noun with classifier)\n*\"I'll have two \"coffees\".\" (count noun without classifier)\n*\"I'll have \"coffee\".\" (plain mass noun)\n*\"I'll have \"some coffee\".\" (mass noun with determiner)\n*\"I'll have \"too much coffee\".\" (mass noun with modified determiner)\nOne may say that mass nouns that are used as count nouns are \"countified\" and that count ones that are used as mass nouns are \"massified\". However, this may confuse syntax and semantics, by presupposing that words which denote substances are mass nouns by default. It has been suggested nouns do not have a lexical specification for mass-count status, and instead are specified as such only when used in a sentence.\nNouns differ in the extent to which they can be used flexibly, depending largely on their meanings and the context of use. For example, the count noun \"house\" is difficult to use as mass (though clearly possible), and the mass noun \"cutlery\" is most frequently used as mass, despite the fact that it denotes objects, and has count equivalents in other languages:\nIn some languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, it has been claimed by some that all nouns are effectively mass nouns, requiring a measure word to be quantified.\nQuantification.\nSome quantifiers can be used with both mass nouns and count nouns, including \"all\", \"no\", and \"some\". Others cannot: \"few\", \"many\", \"those\", and numbers (\"one\") are used with count nouns; \"little\" and \"much\" with mass nouns. This also applies to phrasal quantifiers. For example, \"an amount of\" is for mass nouns, \"a number of\" is for count nouns, and \"a lot of\" can be used with both types.\nWhereas \"more\" and \"most\" are uncontroversially the comparative and superlative of both \"much\" and \"many\", a controversial prescription is for \"few\" and \"little\" to have differing comparative and superlative forms (\"fewer\", \"fewest\" and \"less\", \"least\"), but use of \"less\" and \"least\" with count nouns has always been common (see Fewer versus less). This criticism only dates back to 1770, but the criticized usage dates back to Old English.\nConflation of collective noun and mass noun.\nThere is often confusion about the two different concepts of \"collective noun\" and \"mass noun\". Generally, collective nouns such as \"group, family\", and \"committee\" are not mass nouns but are rather a special subset of count nouns. However, the term \"collective noun\" is often used to mean \"mass noun\" (even in some dictionaries) because users conflate two different kinds of verb number invariability: (a) that seen with mass nouns such as \"water\" or \"furniture\", with which only singular verb forms are used because the constituent matter is \"grammatically\" indivisible (although it may [\"water\"] or may not [\"furniture\"] be \"etically\" indivisible); and (b) that seen with collective nouns, which is the result of the metonymical shift between the group and its (both grammatically and etically) discrete constituents.\nSome words, including \"mathematics\" and \"physics\", have developed true mass-noun senses despite having grown from count-noun roots.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The site of Vermont's state government, it is the least populous state capital in the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,074, with a daytime population growth of about 21,000 due to the large number of jobs within city limits. The Vermont College of Fine Arts is located in the municipality. It was named after Montpellier, a city in the south of France.\nMontpelier was chartered as a town by proprietors from Massachusetts and western Vermont on August 14, 1781, and the Town of Montpelier was granted municipal powers by the \"Governor, Council and General Assembly of the Freemen of the State of Vermont\". The first permanent settlement began in May 1787, and a town meeting was established in 1791. The city received a French name because the Franco-American alliance during the Revolutionary War had inspired widespread Francophilia. Montpelier was selected as state capital in 1805, and citizens of the town donated funds to build the first state house. The legislature chartered the City of Montpelier in 1894, and it was organized at a town meeting the next year.\nMontpelier is in the north-central area of the state. The Winooski River flows by the south side of the city, passing near the state house and continuing northwest into Chittenden County. The North Branch River, a tributary of the Winooski, also flows through the city. Montpelier's geography leaves it vulnerable to flooding, with three serious floods occurring in 1927, 1992, and 2023. In 1875, fires destroyed 38 buildings in the city, and the commercial area was rebuilt with brick to avoid a repeat of the disaster. The state government contributes to the city's economy, which also relies on insurance and tourism. The insurance industry in Montpelier dates back to the early 19th century. Historically, tradesmen shops and mills along the North Branch also fueled the economy, and sheds for finishing granite from Barre operated along the Winooski. Ski areas are also located near the city.\nTravelers can reach the city via the Amtrak Montpelier station, which is located 2 miles west of the downtown area and offers regular service on the Vermonter train. Private planes can also use the nearby Edward F. Knapp State Airport in Berlin, Vermont, but the closest commercial air service is via the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to the northwest.\nHistory.\nThe meadows and flats of the Winooski River were well known among natives for their corn-raising capacities. The natural site of Montpelier made it a favorite residence for the natives who first inhabited the land. The level plain of nearly two hundred acres of the rich farmland, sheltered from winds by the surrounding valley made the area comparatively warm and comfortable. Its position near the confluence of many streams allowed for favorable hunting, fishing, and trading. Native mounds, tombstones, and other memorials of aboriginal life and death were found in Montpelier, or in the vicinity, by the first settlers, and traces of some of them still remain.\nBetween 1600 and 1800, European settlers began to arrive in the region. Soon after, war, disease, and dispersal virtually destroyed the Native American settlements. However, evidence suggests some Native Americans remained in the area as late as the mid-1800s.\nOriginally chartered on August 14, 1781, the Town of Montpelier was granted municipal powers by the \"Governor, Council and General Assembly of the Freemen of the State of Vermont\". The first permanent settlement began in May 1787, when Colonel Jacob Davis and General Parley Davis arrived from Charlton, Massachusetts. General Davis surveyed the land, while Colonel Davis cleared forest and erected a large log house on the west side of the North Branch of the Winooski River. His family moved in the following winter.\nColonel Davis selected the name \"Montpelier\" after the French city of Montpellier, capital of the department of H\u00e9rault. There was a general enthusiasm for things French as a result of the country's aid to the American colonies during the Revolutionary War. The settlement grew quickly, and by 1791 the population reached 117.\nThe configuration of the early village was strongly influenced by geography. As early as 1799 a bridge was constructed across the Winooski River to Berlin.\nThe Town's Charter was reissued on February 6, 1804, to include a boundary description of the lands granted to the Town's inhabitants and proprietors. The confluence of the Winooski, North Branch and Dog Rivers provided a central point for the local population and commerce.\nBy 1805, the town had a population of 1,200. In that year, the state legislature sought a permanent home. Montpelier was selected because of its central location and accessibility, and because local residents provided land and money. A humble State House was soon constructed on State Street.\nIn 1825, the Marquis de Lafayette visited Montpelier on a triumphal tour of the United States, 50 years after the Revolutionary War.\nThe town developed into a center for manufacturing, especially after the Central Vermont Railway opened in Montpelier on June 20, 1849. In response to Montpelier's growth and changing demographics, on November 9, 1848, the General Assembly divided the original Town into two district municipal corporations. The towns of East Montpelier and Montpelier were created. Later, in an attempt to modernize its form of government, the town was reconstituted as the Village of Montpelier.\nBy 1858, the layout of the main streets paralleling the rivers was in place. The downtown street pattern has changed little since that time.\nTen thousand people turned out to greet Major General Philip Sheridan in 1867 when he visited to address the fourth annual meeting of Vermont former Union officers. He particularly thanked Vermont veterans of the Civil War for their performance at the Battle of Cedar Creek.\nIn 1875, a large fire destroyed many downtown buildings.\nThe village had the first municipal water driven hydro system in Vermont in 1884. Water pressure generated sufficient electricity for streetlights.\nThe first charter of Montpelier was granted in 1894 and was amended shortly thereafter in 1898, and again in 1900 and 1912. The first amendment permitted the city to annex a part of the Town of Berlin; the latter enactments amended the 1898 charter to deal with such matters as water works, the relationship between the city and the Washington County Grammar School, and composition of the City Council.\nThe state proclaimed October 12, 1899, as \"Dewey Day\" to honor native son George Dewey, the hero of Battle of Manila Bay in the Spanish\u2013American War. Thousands turned out from the state to his hometown of Montpelier for the celebration. In 1899, Hubbard Park was established with a donation of land, known as \"Hubbard Hill\", bequeathed to the City of Montpelier by John Erastus Hubbard (1847\u20131899) with the intent to \"preserve wilderness\" for future generations. In 1911, additional land was donated and from 1915 to 1930 an observation tower was constructed on this donated land.\nIn 1927, after a particularly wet summer and fall, heavy rains began on the evening of November 2 that continued until the morning of November 4. The heaviest rain fell on November 3, when more than seven inches fell in a six-hour period. The prolonged heavy rains on top of the already saturated soil from the summer and fall proved to be more than the watercourses could handle. Brooks and rivers overflowed, carrying trees and logs in their wake. Dams, bridges and embankments were destroyed. Buildings were submerged, farm animals drowned, and homes and barns were swept away. Rivers reached 13 feet or more above their normal depths. Flood waters gradually receded, leaving behind silt, gravel and debris. At least a foot of mud was left on the floors of downtown stores.\nAt the time, only two stores in Montpelier carried flood insurance. The staggering loss represented an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child in town\u2014equivalent to roughly $5,760 in 2018 dollars. In the days following the flood, Vermont was widely praised for its recovery efforts. President Calvin Coolidge, in particular, hailed the \u201cindomitable spirit\u201d of Vermonters, of whom he was one.\nIn response to the damage suffered by Montpelier and surrounding communities in the Great Flood of 1927, the Civilian Conservation Corps built the Wrightsville Dam during a period from 1933 to 1935. The resulting reservoir, Wrightsville Reservoir, required the disbandment and flooding of the village of Wrightsville, which contained at least 30 built structures at the time.\nThe City of Montpelier grew slowly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during the period of intensive out-migration from the state to new lands in the West, or to industrial centers elsewhere in New England. Montpelier was already established as a government, market, service and industrial center in the region. When the automobile arrived, new state highways were routed to the city limits, and traffic then circulated through the original streets of the city. In 1954, a new bridge was constructed at Bailey Avenue which linked to an extension of Winooski Avenue, now Memorial Drive, and diverted some of the traffic from the downtown area.\nAn early spring thaw in March 1992 caused an ice jam to form in the Winooski River downstream of the Bailey Avenue bridge in Montpelier. In less than an hour, water levels in the Winooski and North Branch rivers rose upstream of the ice jam and flooded downtown Montpelier. The damage shut down 120 businesses, left 50 residents without homes, disrupted the operations of state government, and caused upwards of $5 million in damage.\nHeavy rains on July 10\u201311, 2023, resulted in catastrophic flooding in Montpelier and many other parts of Vermont. In addition to many residences, the waters severely affected multiple downtown businesses as well as the city's fire department, police department, and City Hall.\nGeography.\nMontpelier is located in the north-central area of Vermont. The city center is a flat clay zone (elevation ), surrounded by hills and granite ledges. Towne Hill runs in a ridge (~) along the northern edge of the city.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.10% is water. The Winooski River flows west along the south edge of downtown village and is fed by several smaller tributaries that cut through residential districts. Montpelier has been subject to periodic flooding in the flat city center, with two major floods occurring in 1927 and in 1992.\nOn its borders are the towns of Middlesex to the west, Berlin to the south, and East Montpelier to the north and east. Montpelier lies near the geographic center of the state. Though it does not share a border, Montpelier is frequently associated with the nearby city of Barre, and the two are often referred to together as \"Barre-Montpelier\".\nClimate.\nMontpelier features a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\"), with long, cold, and snowy winters, short springs and autumns, and warm, humid summers. From January to July, daily means range from . In winter, lows fall below on 24 mornings and daytime highs stay below freezing for the majority of afternoons from December to February. Snow is also frequent and remains on the ground for long stretches throughout the winter, though thaws are by no means infrequent. Average annual snowfall is . Summers are warm and often humid, with 2 or 3 days above , but rarely reaching .\nExtremes have ranged from in January 1981 to , most recently recorded in July 1977.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAlong with Barre, the city forms a small micropolitan area in the center of the state; together they are known as \"the twin cities\".\nAs of the 2020 U.S. census, there are 8,074 people and 3,929 households.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $37,513, and the median income for a family was $51,818. Males had a median income of $35,957 versus $29,442 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,599. About 7.2% of families and 9.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.9% of those under age 18 and 5.7% of those age 65 or over.\nIn 2019, there were 3,668 households with an average of 2.03 persons per household.

By the mid-19th century, Montpelier was also the home of life and fire insurance companies including National Life Group.\nThe majority of businesses in the downtown area, mostly retail, are locally owned. These include antiques, books, handmade toys, crafts, kitchenware, jewelry, and Vermont-themed gifts.\nMontpelier is the only state capital that neither has at least one Starbucks location nor one McDonald's store.\nThe Savoy Theater, which was opened in 1905, is an eclectic art house with a main theater that holds 120 and a smaller room that holds 35. It specializes in documentaries, independent features, and international films.

Hubbard Park rises behind the state capitol building and extends along the ridge line towards the north past the pool to the stump dump. Accessible from Cummings Street off State Route 12, the North Branch River Park is the second-largest park in the city. The Mill Pond Park is located along State Route 12 approximately from the cemetery and features boat access to the North Branch river, as well as benches and short-term parking. The North Branch Nature Center is located at the northern end of town and includes of protected land as well as a community nature center. A bridge from the North Branch Nature Center connects the land to the North Branch River Park on the opposite side of the North Branch River. In recent years, North Branch River Park has significantly expanding its mountain biking trails, making it a hub for area mountain bikers of all ages. The first mountain bike trail in North Branch River Park was constructed and opened in 2005 as part of a partnership between the Montpelier Area Mountain Bike Association and the Montpelier Parks Department. Since that time, 4 additional miles of trails have been added. A pump track is also currently under construction.\nGovernment.\nMontpelier's government maintains a city council, city manager, and mayor. The city council consists of a mayor and six members. Council members are elected on a nonpartisan ballot from three districts, with councilors serving staggered two-year terms. The mayor is elected to a two-year term in each even-numbered year on a nonpartisan ballot in a citywide election. The council appoints the city manager who is the chief administrative officer of the city.\nThe city provides municipal services for its residents and businesses. These include local law enforcement, firefighting, planning and zoning regulation, and provision for potable drinking water and wastewater.\nPolitically, Montpelier is a Democratic stronghold.

In the SI system, it has units watts per square metre (W/m2), or kg\u22c5s\u22123 in base units. Intensity is used most frequently with waves such as acoustic waves (sound), matter waves such as electrons in electron microscopes, and electromagnetic waves such as light or radio waves, in which case the \"average\" power transfer over one period of the wave is used. \"Intensity\" can be applied to other circumstances where energy is transferred. For example, one could calculate the intensity of the kinetic energy carried by drops of water from a garden sprinkler.\nThe word \"intensity\" as used here is not synonymous with \"strength\", \"amplitude\", \"magnitude\", or \"level\", as it sometimes is in colloquial speech.\nIntensity can be found by taking the energy density (energy per unit volume) at a point in space and multiplying it by the velocity at which the energy is moving. The resulting vector has the units of power divided by area (i.e., surface power density). The intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. For example, the intensity of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the square of the wave's electric field amplitude.\nMathematical description.\nThe intensity or flux of electromagnetic radiation is equal to the time average of the Poynting vector over the wave's period. For radiation propagating through a typical medium the energy density of the radiation, formula_1, is related to the Poynting vector formula_2 by\nformula_3\nwhich is derived from Poynting's theorem. \nIntegrating over a volume of space gives \nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the energy of the electromagnetic radiation.\nApplying the divergence theorem, the rate of flow of energy out of the volume is seen to be related to the surface integral of the Poynting vector over the surface of the volume of space:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPoint sources.\nA common example is the intensity or flux of a point source of given power output formula_6. Considering a spherical volume centered on the source, the formula above becomes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nwhere the angle brackets denote a time average over the period of the waves. Since the surface area of a sphere of radius formula_7 is formula_8 this gives\nformula_9\ntherefore the intensity from the point source at distance formula_7 is\nformula_11\nThis is known as the inverse-square law.\nElectromagnetic waves.\nFor a monochromatic propagating electromagnetic wave such as a plane wave or a Gaussian beam travelling in a non-magnetic medium, the time-averaged Poynting vector is related to the amplitude of the electric field, E, by\nformula_12\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum, n is the refractive index of the medium, and formula_13 is the vacuum permittivity.\nThe relationship to intensity can also be seen by considering the time-averaged energy density of the wave:\nformula_14\nThe local intensity is just the energy density times the wave velocity &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;:\nformula_15\nFor non-monochromatic waves, the intensity contributions of different spectral components can simply be added. \nThe treatment above does not hold for arbitrary electromagnetic fields, but it is still often true that the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector is proportional to the time-averaged energy density by a factor formula_16:\nformula_17\nAn evanescent wave may have a finite electrical amplitude while not transferring any power. The intensity of an evanescent wave can be defined as the magnitude of the Poynting vector.\nElectron beams.\nFor electron beams, \"intensity\" is the probability of electrons reaching some particular position on a detector (e.g. a charge-coupled device) which is used to produce images that are interpreted in terms of both microstructure of inorganic or biological materials, as well as atomic scale structure. The map of the intensity of scattered electrons or x-rays as a function of direction is also extensively used in crystallography.\nAlternative definitions.\nIn photometry and radiometry \"intensity\" has a different meaning: it is the luminous or radiant power \"per unit solid angle\". This can cause confusion in optics, where \"intensity\" can mean any of radiant intensity, luminous intensity or irradiance, depending on the background of the person using the term. Radiance is also sometimes called \"intensity\", especially by astronomers and astrophysicists, and in heat transfer.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sometimes the term \"twin prime\" is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair.\nTwin primes become increasingly rare as one examines larger ranges, in keeping with the general tendency of gaps between adjacent primes to become larger as the numbers themselves get larger. However, it is unknown whether there are infinitely many twin primes (the so-called twin prime conjecture) or if there is a largest pair. The breakthrough\nwork of Yitang Zhang in 2013, as well as work by James Maynard, Terence Tao and others, has made substantial progress towards proving that there are infinitely many twin primes, but at present this remains unsolved.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in mathematics\nAre there infinitely many twin primes?\nMore unsolved problems in mathematics\nProperties.\nUsually the pair (2, 3) is not considered to be a pair of twin primes.\nSince 2 is the only even prime, this pair is the only pair of prime numbers that differ by one; thus twin primes are as closely spaced as possible for any other two primes.\nThe first several twin prime pairs are\n(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73), (101, 103), (107, 109), (137, 139), ... OEIS:\u00a0.\nFive is the only prime that belongs to two pairs, as every twin prime pair greater than (3, 5) is of the form formula_1 for some natural number n; that is, the number between the two primes is a multiple of 6.\nAs a result, the sum of any pair of twin primes (other than 3 and 5) is divisible by 12.\nBrun's theorem.\nIn 1915, Viggo Brun showed that the sum of reciprocals of the twin primes was convergent.\nThis famous result, called Brun's theorem, was the first use of the Brun sieve and helped initiate the development of modern sieve theory. The modern version of Brun's argument can be used to show that the number of twin primes less than N does not exceed\nformula_2\nfor some absolute constant \nIn fact, it is bounded above by \nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the \"twin prime constant\" (slightly less than 2/3), given below.\nTwin prime conjecture.\nThe question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. This is the content of the \"twin prime conjecture\", which states that there are infinitely many primes p such that is also prime. In 1849, de Polignac made the more general conjecture that for every natural number k, there are infinitely many primes p such that is also prime.\nThe of de Polignac's conjecture is the twin prime conjecture.\nA stronger form of the twin prime conjecture, the Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture, postulates a distribution law for twin primes akin to the prime number theorem.\nOn 17\u00a0April 2013, Yitang Zhang announced a proof that there exists an integer N that is less than 70\u00a0million, where there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by\u00a0N. Zhang's paper was accepted in early May\u00a02013. Terence Tao subsequently proposed a Polymath Project collaborative effort to improve Zhang's bound.\nOne year after Zhang's announcement, the bound had been reduced to 246, where it remains.\nThese improved bounds were discovered independently by James Maynard and Terence Tao, using a different approach that was simpler than Zhang's. This second approach also gave bounds for the smallest needed to guarantee that infinitely many intervals of width \"f\" (\"m\") contain at least m primes. Moreover (see also the next section) assuming the Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture and its generalized form, the Polymath Project wiki states that the bound is 12 and 6, respectively.\nA strengthening of Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, if proved, would also prove there is an infinite number of twin primes, as would the existence of Siegel zeroes.\nOther theorems weaker than the twin prime conjecture.\nIn 1940, Paul Erd\u0151s showed that there is a constant \"c\" &lt; 1 and infinitely many primes p such that \"p\"\u2032 \u2212 \"p\" &lt; \"c\" ln \"p\" where p\u2032 denotes the next prime after p. What this means is that we can find infinitely many intervals that contain two primes (\"p\", \"p\"\u2032) as long as we let these intervals grow slowly in size as we move to bigger and bigger primes. Here, \"grow slowly\" means that the length of these intervals can grow logarithmically. This result was successively improved; in 1986 Helmut Maier showed that a constant \"c\" &lt; 0.25 can be used. In 2004 Daniel Goldston and Cem Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m showed that the constant could be improved further to In 2005, Goldston, Pintz, and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m established that c can be chosen to be arbitrarily small,\ni.e.\nformula_5\nOn the other hand, this result does not rule out that there may not be infinitely many intervals that contain two primes if we only allow the intervals to grow in size as, for example, \nBy assuming the Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture or a slightly weaker version, they were able to show that there are infinitely many n such that at least two of n, \"n\" + 2, \"n\" + 6, \"n\" + 8, \"n\" + 12, \"n\" + 18, or \"n\" + 20 are prime. Under a stronger hypothesis they showed that for infinitely many n, at least two of n, \"n\" + 2, \"n\" + 4, and \"n\" + 6 are prime.\nThe result of Yitang Zhang,\nformula_6\nis a major improvement on the Goldston\u2013Graham\u2013Pintz\u2013Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m result. The Polymath Project improvement of Zhang's bound and the work of Maynard have reduced the bound: the limit inferior is at most 246.\nConjectures.\nFirst Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture.\nThe first Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture (named after G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood) is a generalization of the twin prime conjecture. It is concerned with the distribution of prime constellations, including twin primes, in analogy to the prime number theorem. Let &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; denote the number of primes \"p\" \u2264 \"x\" such that \"p\" + 2 is also prime. Define the \"twin prime constant\" \"C\"2 as\nformula_7\n(Here the product extends over all prime numbers \"p\" \u2265 3.) Then a special case of the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture is that\nformula_8\nin the sense that the quotient of the two expressions tends to 1 as x approaches infinity. (The second ~ is not part of the conjecture and is proven by integration by parts.)\nThe conjecture can be justified (but not proven) by assuming that &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; describes the density function of the prime distribution. This assumption, which is suggested by the prime number theorem, implies the twin prime conjecture, as shown in the formula for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; above.\nThe fully general first Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture on prime k-tuples (not given here) implies that the \"second\" Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture is false.\nThis conjecture has been extended by Dickson's conjecture.\nPolignac's conjecture.\nPolignac's conjecture from 1849 states that for every positive even integer k, there are infinitely many consecutive prime pairs p and p\u2032 such that \"p\"\u2032 \u2212 \"p\" \n \"k\" (i.e. there are infinitely many prime gaps of size k). The case \"k\" \n 2 is the twin prime conjecture. The conjecture has not yet been proven or disproven for any specific value of k, but Zhang's result proves that it is true for at least one (currently unknown) value of k. Indeed, if such a k did not exist, then for any positive even natural number N there are at most finitely many n such that formula_9 for all \"m\" &lt; \"N\" and so for n large enough we have formula_10 which would contradict Zhang's result.\nLarge twin primes.\nBeginning in 2007, two distributed computing projects, Twin Prime Search and PrimeGrid, have produced several record-largest twin primes. As of \u00a02025[ [update]], the current largest twin prime pair known is 2996863034895 \u00d7 21290000 \u00b1 1 , with 388,342\u00a0decimal digits. It was discovered in September\u00a02016.\nThere are 808,675,888,577,436\u00a0twin prime pairs below 1018.\nAn empirical analysis of all prime pairs up to 4.35 \u00d7 1015 shows that if the number of such pairs less than x is \"f\"&amp;hairsp;(\"x\")&amp;hairsp;\u00b7\"x\"&amp;hairsp;/(log \"x\")2 then \"f\"&amp;hairsp;(\"x\") is about 1.7 for small x and decreases towards about 1.3 as x tends to infinity. The limiting value of \"f\"&amp;hairsp;(\"x\") is conjectured to equal twice the twin prime constant (OEIS:\u00a0) (not to be confused with Brun's constant), according to the Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture.\nOther elementary properties.\nEvery third odd number is divisible by 3, and therefore no three successive odd numbers can be prime unless one of them is 3. Therefore, 5 is the only prime that is part of two twin prime pairs. The lower member of a pair is by definition a Chen prime.\nIf \"m\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a04 or \"m\"\u00a0+\u00a06 is also prime then the three primes are called a prime triplet.\nIt has been proven that the pair (\"m\",\u00a0\"m\"\u00a0+\u00a02) is a twin prime if and only if\nformula_11\nFor a twin prime pair of the form (6\"n\" \u2212 1, 6\"n\" + 1) for some natural number \"n\" &gt; 1, \"n\" must end in the digit 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 8 (OEIS:\u00a0). If \"n\" were to end in 1 or 6, 6\"n\" would end in 6, and 6\"n\"\u2009\u22121 would be a multiple of 5. This is not prime unless \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01. Likewise, if \"n\" were to end in 4 or 9, 6\"n\" would end in 4, and 6\"n\"\u2009+1 would be a multiple of 5. The same rule applies modulo any prime \"p\" \u2265 5: If \"n\" \u2261 \u00b16\u22121 (mod \"p\"), then one of the pair will be divisible by \"p\" and will not be a twin prime pair unless 6\"n\" = \"p\"\u2009\u00b11. \"p\" = 5 just happens to produce particularly simple patterns in base 10.\nIsolated prime.\nAn isolated prime (also known as a single prime or non-twin prime) is a prime number \"p\" such that neither \"p\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02 nor \"p\"\u00a0+\u00a02 is prime. In other words, \"p\" is not part of a twin prime pair. For example, 23 is an isolated prime, since 21 and 25 are both composite.\nThe first few isolated primes are\n2, 23, 37, 47, 53, 67, 79, 83, 89, 97, ... OEIS:\u00a0.\nIt follows from Brun's theorem that almost all primes are isolated in the sense that the ratio of the number of isolated primes less than a given threshold \"n\" and the number of all primes less than \"n\" tends to 1 as \"n\" tends to infinity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42001", "revid": "1461430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42001", "title": "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek", "text": "Dutch microbiologist (1632\u20131723)\nAntonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek ( ; ; 24 October 1632 \u2013 26 August 1723) was a Dutch microbiologist and microscopist in the Golden Age of Dutch art, science and technology. A largely self-taught man in science, he is commonly known as \"the Father of Microbiology\", and one of the first microscopists and microbiologists. Van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his pioneering work in microscopy and for his contributions toward the establishment of microbiology as a scientific discipline.\nRaised in Delft, Dutch Republic, Van Leeuwenhoek worked as a draper in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654. He became well-recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking. In the 1670s, he started to explore microbial life with his microscope.\nUsing single-lensed microscopes of his own design and make, Van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and to experiment with microbes, which he originally referred to as , or . He was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the \"animalcules\" are now referred to as unicellular organisms, although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document microscopic observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa, red blood cells, and crystals in gouty tophi, and was among the first to see blood flow in capillaries. Although Van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books, he described his discoveries in chaotic letters to the Royal Society, which published many of his letters in their \"Philosophical Transactions\".\nEarly life and career.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek was born in Delft, Dutch Republic, on 24 October 1632. On 4 November, he was baptized as \"Thonis\". His father, Philips Antonisz van Leeuwenhoek, was a basket maker who died when Antonie was five years old. His mother, Margaretha (Bel van den Berch), came from a well-to-do brewer's family. She remarried Jacob Jansz Molijn, a painter and the family moved to Warmond around 1640. Antonie had four older sisters: Margriet, Geertruyt, Neeltje, and Catharina. When he was around ten years old his step-father died. He was sent to live in Benthuizen with his uncle, an attorney. At the age of 16 he became a bookkeeper's apprentice (casher) at a linen-draper's shop at Warmoesstraat in Amsterdam, which was owned by William Davidson. Van Leeuwenhoek left there after six years.\nIn July 1654, Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Mey in Delft, with whom he fathered one surviving daughter, Maria (four other children died in infancy). He would live and study for the rest of his life at Hypolytusbuurt in a house he bought in 1655. He opened a draper's shop, selling linen, yarn and ribbon to seamstresses and tailors. His status in Delft grew throughout the years. In 1660 he received a lucrative job as chamberlain for the sheriffs in the city hall, a position which he would hold for almost 40 years. His duties included maintaining the premises, heating, cleaning, opening for meetings, performing duties for those assembled, and maintaining silence on all matters discussed there.\nIn 1669 he was appointed as a land surveyor by the court of Holland; at some time he combined it with another municipal job, being the official \"wine-gauger\" of Delft and in charge of the city wine imports and taxation. His wife had died in 1666, and in 1671, Van Leeuwenhoek remarried to Cornelia Swalmius with whom he had no children.\nVan Leeuwenhoek was a contemporary of another famous Delft citizen, the painter Johannes Vermeer, who was baptized just four days earlier. It has been suggested that he is the man portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, \"The Astronomer\" and \"The Geographer\", but others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men in a city with only 24,000 inhabitants, living both close to the main market, it is likely they knew each other. Van Leeuwenhoek acted as the executor of Vermeer's will when the painter died in 1675.\nVan Leeuwenhoek's religion was \"Dutch Reformed\" and Calvinist. Like Jan Swammerdam he often referred with reverence to the wonders God designed in making creatures great and small, and believed that his discoveries were merely further proof of the wonder of creation.\nMicroscopic study.\nWhile running his draper shop, Van Leeuwenhoek wanted to see the quality of the thread better than what was possible using the magnifying lenses of the time. He developed an interest in lensmaking, although few records exist of his early activity. By placing the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, one can pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass. Then, by reinserting the end of one whisker into the flame, a very small, high-quality glass lens is created. Significantly, a May 2021 neutron tomography study of a high-magnification Leeuwenhoek microscope captured images of the short glass stem characteristic of this lens creation method. For lower magnifications he also made ground lenses. To help keep his methods confidential he apparently intentionally encouraged others to think grinding was his primary or only lens construction method.\nRecognition by the Royal Society.\nAfter developing his method for creating powerful lenses and applying them to the study of the microscopic world, Van Leeuwenhoek introduced his work to his friend, the prominent Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf. When the Royal Society in London published the groundbreaking work of an Italian lensmaker in their journal \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\", de Graaf wrote to the editor of the journal, Henry Oldenburg, with a ringing endorsement of Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes which, he claimed, \"far surpass those which we have hitherto seen\". In response, in 1673 the society published a letter from Van Leeuwenhoek that included his microscopic observations on mold, bees, and lice. Then, in 1674, Van Leeuwenhoek made his most significant discovery. Starting from the assumption that life and motility are similar, he determined that the moving objects observed under his microscope were little animals. He later recorded his observations in his diary.\nVan Leeuwenhoek's work fully captured the attention of the Royal Society, and he began corresponding regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his findings, regarding himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work. By the time Van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings in a wide variety of fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance. The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose. He was also the first to use the word \"animalcules\" to translate the Dutch words that Leeuwenhoek used to describe microorganisms. Despite the initial success of Van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. His credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms dated 9 October 1676. Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.\nEventually, in the face of Van Leeuwenhoek's insistence, the Royal Society arranged for Alexander Petrie, minister to the English Reformed Church in Delft; Benedict Haan, at that time Lutheran minister at Delft; and Henrik Cordes, then Lutheran minister at the Hague, accompanied by Sir Robert Gordon and four others, to determine whether it was in fact Van Leeuwenhoek's ability to observe and reason clearly, or perhaps, the Royal Society's theories of life that might require reform. Finally in 1677, Van Leeuwenhoek's observations were fully acknowledged by the Royal Society.\nVan Leeuwenhoek was elected to the Royal Society in February 1680 on the nomination of William Croone, a then-prominent physician. Van Leeuwenhoek was \"taken aback\" by the nomination, which he considered a high honour, although he did not attend the induction ceremony in London, nor did he ever attend a Royal Society meeting. He had his portrait painted by Jan Verkolje with the certificate signed by James II of England on the table beside him.\nScientific fame.\nBy the end of the seventeenth century, Van Leeuwenhoek had a virtual monopoly on microscopic study and discovery. His contemporary Robert Hooke, an early microscope pioneer, bemoaned that the field had come to rest entirely on one man's shoulders. In 1673, his first letter was published in the journal of the Royal Society of London. He was visited over the years by many notable individuals who gazed at the \"tiny creatures\". One of the first was Jan Swammerdam. Around 1675, it was Johan Huydecoper, who was very interested in collecting and growing plants for his estate \"Goudestein\", becoming in 1682 manager of the Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam. Christiaan Huygens, Leibniz (1676), John Locke (1678, 1685), James II of England (1679), William III of Orange, Mary II of England and Thomas Molyneux (in 1685) visited. In October 1697, Van Leeuwenhoek visited the Tsar Peter the Great on his boat, moored in the Schie or the Arsenaal. On this occasion, he presented the Tsar with an \"eel-viewer\", so Peter could study blood circulation whenever he wanted. In 1706, it was Govert Bidloo; in 1714, Richard Bradley (botanist); and, in 1716, Herman Boerhaave and Frederik Ruysch. To the disappointment of his guests, Van Leeuwenhoek refused to reveal the cutting-edge microscopes he relied on for his discoveries, instead showing visitors a collection of average-quality lenses.\nTechniques.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek made more than 500 optical lenses. He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that Van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could magnify up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.\nThe single-lens microscopes of Van Leeuwenhoek were relatively small devices, the largest being about 5\u00a0cm long. They are used by placing the lens very close in front of the eye. The other side of the microscope had a pin, where the sample was attached in order to stay close to the lens. There were also three screws to move the pin and the sample along three axes: one axis to change the focus, and the two other axes to navigate through the sample.\nVan Leeuwenhoek maintained throughout his life that there are aspects of microscope construction \"which I only keep for myself\", in particular his most critical secret of how he made the lenses. For many years no one was able to reconstruct Van Leeuwenhoek's design techniques, but, in 1957, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing, and successfully created some working samples of a Van Leeuwenhoek design microscope. Such a method was also discovered independently by A. Mosolov and A. Belkin at the Russian Novosibirsk State Medical Institute. In May 2021, researchers in the Netherlands published a non-destructive neutron tomography study of a Leeuwenhoek microscope. One image in particular shows a Stong/Mosolov-type spherical lens with a single short glass stem attached https://. Such lenses are created by pulling an extremely thin glass filament, breaking the filament, and briefly fusing the filament end. The nuclear tomography article notes this lens creation method was first devised by Robert Hooke rather than Leeuwenhoek, which is ironic given Hooke's subsequent surprise at Leeuwenhoek's findings.\nVan Leeuwenhoek used samples and measurements to estimate numbers of microorganisms in units of water. He also made good use of the huge advantage provided by his method. He studied a broad range of microscopic phenomena, and shared the resulting observations freely with groups such as the British Royal Society. Such work firmly established his place in history as one of the first and most important explorers of the microscopic world. Van Leeuwenhoek was one of the first people to observe cells, much like Robert Hooke. He also corresponded with Antonio Magliabechi.\nDiscoveries.\nLike Robert Boyle and Nicolaas Hartsoeker, Van Leeuwenhoek was interested in dried cochineal, trying to find out if the dye came from a berry or an insect.\nHe studied rainwater, the seeds of oranges, worms in sheep's liver, the eye of a whale, the blood of fishes, mites, coccinellidae, the skin of elephants, Celandine, and Cinchona.\nLegacy and recognition.\nBy the end of his life, Van Leeuwenhoek had written approximately 560 letters to the Royal Society and other scientific institutions concerning his observations and discoveries. Even during the last weeks of his life, Van Leeuwenhoek continued to send letters full of observations to London. The last few contained a precise description of his own illness. He suffered from a rare disease, an uncontrolled movement of the midriff, which now is named \"Van Leeuwenhoek's disease\". He died at the age of 90, on 26 August 1723, and was buried four days later in the Oude Kerk in Delft.\nIn 1981, the British microscopist Brian J. Ford found that Van Leeuwenhoek's original specimens had survived in the collections of the Royal Society of London. They were found to be of high quality, and all were well preserved. Ford carried out observations with a range of single-lens microscopes, adding to our knowledge of Van Leeuwenhoek's work. In Ford's opinion, Leeuwenhoek remained imperfectly understood, the popular view that his work was crude and undisciplined at odds with the evidence of conscientious and painstaking observation. He constructed rational and repeatable experimental procedures and was willing to oppose received opinion, such as spontaneous generation, and he changed his mind in the light of evidence.\nOn his importance in the history of microbiology and science in general, the British biochemist Nick Lane wrote that he was \"the first even to think of looking\u2014certainly, the first with the power to see.\" His experiments were ingenious, and he was \"a scientist of the highest calibre\", attacked by people who envied him or \"scorned his unschooled origins\", not helped by his secrecy about his methods.\nThe Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam, named after Van Leeuwenhoek, is specialized in oncology. In 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest Dutchman (\"De Grootste Nederlander\") named Van Leeuwenhoek the 4th-greatest Dutchman of all time.\nOn 24 October 2016, Google commemorated the 384th anniversary of Van Leeuwenhoek's birth with a Doodle that depicted his discovery of \"little animals\" or animalcules, now known as unicellular organisms.\nThe Leeuwenhoek Medal, Leeuwenhoek Lecture, Leeuwenhoek crater, \"Leeuwenhoeckia\", \"Levenhookia\" (a genus in the family Stylidiaceae), \"Leeuwenhoekiella\" (an aerobic bacterial genus), and the scientific publication \"\" are named after him.\nAs a fictional character, he appears as a flea circus owner, microscopist and magician in E.T.A. Hoffmann's novel Master Flea, together with Jan Swammerdam.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42005", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42005", "title": "Collaborative software", "text": "Type of application software\nCollaborative software or groupware is application software designed to help people working on a common task to attain their goals. One of the earliest definitions of groupware is \"intentional group processes plus software to support them.\"\nRegarding available interaction, collaborative software may be divided into real-time collaborative editing platforms that allow multiple users to engage in live, simultaneous, and reversible editing of a single file (usually a document); and version control (also known as revision control and source control) platforms, which allow users to make parallel edits to a file, while preserving every saved edit by users as multiple files that are variants of the original file. \nCollaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). According to Carstensen and Schmidt (1999), groupware is part of CSCW. The authors claim that CSCW, and thereby groupware, addresses \"how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems.\"\nThe use of collaborative software in the work space creates a collaborative working environment (CWE).\nCollaborative software relates to the notion of collaborative work systems, which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional. Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported cooperative work, collaborative work systems become a useful analytical tool to understand the behavioral and organizational variables that are associated to the broader concept of CSCW.\nHistory.\nDouglas Engelbart first envisioned collaborative computing in 1951 and documented his vision in 1962, with working prototypes in full operational use by his research team by the mid-1960s. He held the first public demonstration of his work in 1968 in what is now referred to as \"The Mother of All Demos\". The following year, Engelbart's lab was hooked into the ARPANET, the first computer network, enabling them to extend services to a broader userbase.\nOnline collaborative gaming software began between early networked computer users. In 1975, Will Crowther created Colossal Cave Adventure on a DEC PDP-10 computer. As internet connections grew, so did the numbers of users and multi-user games. In 1978 Roy Trubshaw, a student at University of Essex in the United Kingdom, created the game MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).\nThe US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s. One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling, Planning and Simulation Strategy (COMPASS). The COMPASS system allowed up to 6 users to create point-to-point connections with one another; the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active, and would have to be recreated if all six logged out. MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server into which each user logged. Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation (CVW), it allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms, and left as a persistent session that could be joined later.\nIn 1996, Pavel Curtis, who had built MUDs at PARC, created PlaceWare, a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium, with side chat between \"seat-mates\", and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak. In 1997, engineers at GTE used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW, calling it InfoWorkSpace (IWS). In 1998, IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center. The IWS product was sold to General Dynamics and then later to Ezenia.\nGroupware.\nCollaborative software was originally designated as \"groupware\" and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s, when Richman and Slovak (1987) wrote: \"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together, the new \"groupware\" aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers, technicians, and anyone else who interacts in groups, revolutionizing the way they work.\"\nIn 1978, Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware; their initial 1978 definition of groupware was, \"intentional group processes plus software to support them.\" Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as \"computer-mediated culture... an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace.\" Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems, yet is simply a single system.\nIn the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered, and big companies such as Boeing and IBM started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects. Lotus Notes appeared as a major example of that product category, allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy. Kirkpatrick and Losee (1992) wrote then: \"If really makes a difference in productivity long term, the very definition of an office may change. You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer. As computers become smaller and more powerful, that will mean anywhere.\" In 1999, Achacoso created and introduced the first wireless groupware.\nDesign and implementation.\nThe complexity of groupware development is still an issue. One reason is the socio-technical dimension of groupware. Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues (as in traditional software development) but also consider the organizational aspects and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application. Some examples for issues in groupware development are:\nOne approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design. The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process.\nLevels of collaboration.\nGroupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of collaboration:\nCollaborative management (coordination) tools.\nCollaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:\nCollaborative software and human interaction.\nThe design intent of collaborative software (groupware) is to transform the way documents and rich media are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration.\nCollaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.\nThere are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations.\n\"Conversational interaction\" is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints, generally focused on personal experiences. Communication technology such as telephones, instant messaging, and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions.\n\"Transactional interaction\" involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants.\nIn \"collaborative interaction\", the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity (i.e., the converse of transactional). When teams collaborate on projects it is collaborative project management.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42009", "revid": "4770293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42009", "title": "Amedeo Avogadro", "text": "Italian scientist (1776\u20131856)\nLorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, Count of Quaregna and Cerreto (, , ; 9 August 1776\u00a0\u2013 9 July 1856) was an Italian scientist, most noted for his contribution to molecular theory now known as Avogadro's law, which states that equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of molecules. In tribute to him, the ratio of the number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions or other particles) in a substance to its amount of substance (the latter having the unit mole), , is known as the Avogadro constant. This constant is denoted \"N\"A, and is one of the seven defining constants of the SI.\nBiography.\nAmedeo Avogadro was born in Turin to a noble family of the Kingdom of Sardinia (now part of Italy) in the year 1776. He graduated in ecclesiastical law at the late age of 20 and began to practice. Soon after, he dedicated himself to physics and mathematics (then called \"positive philosophy\"), and in 1809 started teaching them at a \"liceo\" (high school) in Vercelli, where his family lived and had some property.\nIn 1811, he published an article with the title \"Essai d'une mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9terminer les masses relatives des mol\u00e9cules \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons\" (\"Essay on a manner of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies and the Proportions by Which They Enter These Combinations\"), which contains Avogadro's hypothesis. Avogadro submitted this essay to Jean-Claude Delam\u00e9therie's \"Journal de Physique, de Chimie et d'Histoire naturelle\" (\"Journal of Physics, Chemistry and Natural History\").\nIn 1820, he became a professor of physics at the University of Turin. Turin was now the capital of the restored Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia under Victor Emmanuel I. Avogadro was active in the revolutionary movement of March 1821. As a result, he lost his chair in 1823 (or, as the university officially declared, it was \"very glad to allow this interesting scientist to take a rest from heavy teaching duties, in order to be able to give better attention to his researches\"). Eventually, King Charles Albert granted a Constitution (\"Statuto Albertino\") in 1848. Well before this, Avogadro had been recalled to the university in Turin in 1833, where he taught for another twenty years.\nLittle is known about Avogadro's private life, which appears to have been sober and religious. He married Felicita Mazz\u00e9 and had six children. Avogadro held posts dealing with statistics, meteorology, and weights and measures (he introduced the metric system into Piedmont) and was a member of the Royal Superior Council on Public Instruction.\nHe died on 9 July 1856.\nAccomplishments.\nIn honour of Avogadro's contributions to molecular theory, the number of molecules per mole of a substance is named the Avogadro constant, \"N\"A. It is exactly . The Avogadro constant is used to compute the results of chemical reactions. It allows chemists to determine the amounts of substances produced in a given reaction to a great degree of accuracy.\nJohann Josef Loschmidt first calculated the value of the Avogadro constant, the number of particles in one mole, sometimes referred to as the Loschmidt number in German-speaking countries (Loschmidt constant now has another meaning).\nAvogadro's law states that the relationship between the masses of the same volume of all gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights. Hence, the relative molecular mass of a gas can be calculated from the mass of a sample of known volume.\nAvogadro developed this hypothesis after Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published his law on volumes (and combining gases) in 1808. The greatest problem Avogadro had to resolve was the confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules. One of his most important contributions was clearly distinguishing one from the other, stating that gases are composed of molecules, and these molecules are composed of atoms. (For instance, John Dalton did not consider this possibility.) Avogadro did not actually use the word \"atom\", as the words \"atom\" and \"molecule\" were used almost without difference. He believed that there were three kinds of \"molecules\", including an \"elementary molecule\" (our \"atom\"). Also, he gave more attention to the definition of mass, as distinguished from weight.\nIn 1815, he published \"M\u00e9moire sur les masses relatives des mol\u00e9cules des corps simples, ou densit\u00e9s pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es de leur gaz, et sur la constitution de quelques-uns de leur compos\u00e9s, pour servir de suite \u00e0 l'Essai sur le m\u00eame sujet, publi\u00e9 dans le Journal de Physique, juillet 1811\" (\"Note on the Relative Masses of Elementary Molecules, or Suggested Densities of Their Gases, and on the Constituents of Some of Their Compounds, As a Follow-up to the Essay on the Same Subject, Published in the Journal of Physics, July 1811\") about gas densities.\nIn 1821 he published another paper, \"Nouvelles consid\u00e9rations sur la th\u00e9orie des proportions d\u00e9termin\u00e9es dans les combinaisons, et sur la d\u00e9termination des masses des mol\u00e9cules des corps\" (\"New Considerations on the Theory of Proportions Determined in Combinations, and on Determination of the Masses of Atoms\") and shortly afterwards, \"M\u00e9moire sur la mani\u00e8re de ramener les compos\u00e8s organiques aux lois ordinaires des proportions d\u00e9termin\u00e9es\" (\"Note on the Manner of Finding the Organic Composition by the Ordinary Laws of Determined Proportions\").\nIn 1841, he published his work in \"Fisica dei corpi ponderabili, ossia Trattato della costituzione materiale de' corpi\", 4 volumes.\nResponse to the theory.\nThe scientific community did not give great attention to Avogadro's theory, and it was not immediately accepted. Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re proposed a very similar theory three years later (in his \"\"; \"On the Determination of Proportions in which Bodies Combine According to the Number and the Respective Disposition of the Molecules by Which Their Integral Particles Are Made\"), but the same indifference was shown to his theory as well.\nOnly through studies by Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt and Auguste Laurent on organic chemistry was it possible to demonstrate that Avogadro's law explained why the same quantities of molecules in a gas have the same volume.\nUnfortunately, related experiments with some inorganic substances showed seeming contradictions. This was finally resolved by Stanislao Cannizzaro, as announced at Karlsruhe Congress in 1860, four years after Avogadro's death. He explained that these exceptions were due to molecular dissociations at certain temperatures, and that Avogadro's law determined not only molecular masses but atomic masses as well.\nIn 1911, a meeting in Turin commemorated the hundredth anniversary of the publication of Avogadro's classic 1811 paper. King Victor Emmanuel III attended, and Avogadro's great contribution to chemistry was recognised.\nRudolf Clausius, with his kinetic theory on gases proposed in 1857, provided further evidence for Avogadro's law. Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff showed that Avogadro's theory also held in dilute solutions.\nAvogadro is hailed as a founder of the atomic-molecular theory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42010", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42010", "title": "Queen (band)", "text": "British rock band\nQueen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), later joined by John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.\nBefore forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, \"Queen II\", in 1974. \"Sheer Heart Attack\" later that year and \"A Night at the Opera\" in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which topped the UK singles chart for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album \"News of the World\" contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"Another One Bites the Dust\" from \"The Game\" (1980) became their best-selling single, and their 1981 compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" is the best-selling album in the UK and has been certified 9\u00d7 Platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England.\nMercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. The band released two more albums, \"The Miracle\" in 1989 and \"Innuendo\" in 1991. On 23 November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed his AIDS diagnosis, and the next day died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocals, 1995's \"Made in Heaven\". Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as \"Queen +\", with vocalists Paul Rodgers until 2009 and Adam Lambert since 2011.\nQueen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250\u00a0million to 300\u00a0million, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2018, they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and they were awarded the Polar Music Prize in 2025.\nHistory.\n1968\u20131971: Foundations.\nThe founding members of Queen met in west London during the late 1960s. Guitarist Brian May had built his own guitar with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after Orwell's novel) the following year with singer Tim Staffell. May left the group in early 1968 to focus on his degree in Physics and Infrared Astronomy at Imperial College and find a group that could write original material. He formed the group Smile with Staffell (now playing bass) and keyboardist Chris Smith. To complete the line-up, May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a \"Mitch Mitchell/Ginger Baker type\" drummer; Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job. Smith left the group in early 1969, immediately before a gig at the Royal Albert Hall with Free and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.\nWhile attending Ealing Art College in west London, Staffell became friends with fellow student Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara, who was from Zanzibar and of Indian Parsi descent. Bulsara had studied fashion design for a year before switching to graphic art and design, and soon became a keen fan of Smile. He asked if he could join the group as lead singer, but May felt Staffell would not give up that role. He also ran a stall in Kensington Market with Taylor.\nIn 1970, Staffell quit Smile, feeling his interests in soul and R&amp;B clashed with the group's hard rock sound and being fed up with the lack of success. He formed the group Humpy Bong with former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen. The remaining members accepted Bulsara as lead singer, and recruited Taylor's friend Mike Grose as bassist. The four played their first gig at a fundraising event in Truro on 27 June 1970. Bulsara suggested the group should be renamed to \"Queen\". The others were uncertain at first, but he said, \"it's wonderful, dear, people will love it\". At the same time, he decided to change his surname to Mercury, inspired by the line \"Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me\" in the song \"My Fairy King\". The group played their first London gig on 18 July. The early set consisted of material that later appeared on the first two albums, along with various rock and roll covers, such as Cliff Richard and the Shadows' \"Please Don't Tease\". They attracted the attention of producer John Anthony, who was interested in the group's sound but thought they had the wrong bass player. After three live gigs, Mike Grose decided not to continue with the band and was replaced by Barry Mitchell (ex Crushed Butler). Mitchell played thirteen gigs with Queen between August 1970 and January 1971. In turn, Mitchell left in January 1971 and was replaced by Doug Bogie for two live gigs.\n1971\u20131974: \"Queen\" and \"Queen II\".\nIn February 1971, John Deacon joined Queen. In addition to being an experienced bassist, his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics. On 2 July, Queen played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London. May called Terry Yeadon, an engineer at Pye Studios where Smile had recorded, to see if he knew anywhere where Queen could go. Yeadon had since moved to De Lane Lea Studios' new premises in Wembley, and they needed a group to test out the equipment and recording rooms. He tried asking the Kinks but couldn't get hold of them. Therefore, he told Queen they could record some demos in exchange for the studio's acoustic tests. They recorded five of their own songs, \"Liar\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"Great King Rat\", \"The Night Comes Down\" and \"Jesus\". During the recording, producers John Anthony and Roy Thomas Baker visited the band. The two were taken with \"Keep Yourself Alive\" and began promoting the band to several record companies.\nPromoter Ken Testi managed to attract the interest of Charisma Records, who offered Queen an advance of around \u00a325,000, but the group turned them down as they realised the label would promote Genesis as a priority. Testi then entered discussions with Trident Studios' Norman Sheffield, who offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use their facilities, while the management searched for a deal. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by signed musicians. Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as \"gold dust\".\nQueen began 1972 with a gig at Bedford College, London where only six people turned up. After a few more shows, they stopped live performances for eight months to work on the album with Anthony and Baker. During the sessions at Trident, they saw David Bowie with the Spiders from Mars live and realised they needed to make an impact with the album, otherwise they would be left behind. Co-producers Anthony and Baker initially clashed with the band (May in particular) on the direction of the album, bringing the band's inexperience in the studio to bear. The band's fighting centered around their efforts to integrate technical perfection with the reality of live performances, leading to what Baker referred to as \"kitchen sink overproduction\". The resulting album was a mix of heavy metal and progressive rock. The group were unhappy with the re-recording of \"The Night Comes Down\", so the finished album uses the De Lane Lea demo. Another track, \"Mad the Swine\" was dropped from the running order after the band and Baker could not agree on a mix. Mike Stone created the final mix for \"Keep Yourself Alive\", and he went on to work on several other Queen albums. By January 1972, the band finished recording their debut album, but had yet to secure a record contract. In order to attract record company interest, Trident booked a \"showcase\" gig on 6 November at The Pheasantry, followed by a show at the Marquee Club on 20 December.\nQueen promoted the unreleased album in February 1973 on BBC Radio 1, still unsigned. The following month, Trident managed to strike a deal with EMI Records. \"Keep Yourself Alive\" was released as a single on 6 July, with the album \"Queen\" appearing a week later. The front cover showed a shot of Mercury live on stage taken by Taylor's friend Douglass Puddifoot. Deacon was credited as \"Deacon John\" while Taylor used his full name, Roger Meddows-Taylor. The album was received well by critics; Gordon Fletcher of \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"superb\", and Chicago's \"Daily Herald\" called it an \"above-average debut\". However, it drew little mainstream attention, and \"Keep Yourself Alive\" sold poorly. Retrospectively, it is cited as the album's highlight, and in 2008 \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it 31st in the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", describing it as \"an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song\". The album was certified gold in the UK and the US.\nThe group began to record their second album, \"Queen II\" in August 1973. Now able to use regular studio time, they decided to make full use of the facilities available. May created a multi-layer guitar introduction \"Procession\", while Mercury wrote \"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\" based on the painting of the same name by Richard Dadd. The group spent the remainder of the year touring the UK, supporting Mott the Hoople, and began to attract an audience. The tour ended with two shows at the Hammersmith Odeon on 14 December, playing to 7,000 people.\nIn January 1974, Queen played the Sunbury Pop Festival in Australia. They arrived late, and were jeered and taunted by the audience who expected to see home grown acts. Before leaving, Mercury announced, \"when we come back to Australia, Queen will be the biggest band in the world!\" \"Queen II\" was released in March, and features Mick Rock's iconic Dietrich-inspired image of the band on the cover. This image would later be used as the basis for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" music video production. The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK. The Mercury-written lead single \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" reached number 10 in the UK, giving the band their first hit. The album featured a 'layered' sound which would become their signature, and features long complex instrumental passages, fantasy-themed lyrics, and instrumental virtuosity. Aside from its only single, the album also included the song \"The March of the Black Queen\", a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus. Critical reaction was mixed; the \"Winnipeg Free Press\", while praising the band's debut album, described \"Queen II\" as an \"over-produced monstrosity\". AllMusic has described the album as a favourite among the band's hardcore fans, and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". The group ended their early 1974 UK tour with a show at the Rainbow Theatre on 31 March. Mercury chose to a wear a Zandra Rhodes-designed tunic for the gig, changing into a slashed black top midway through the show.\n1974\u20131976: \"Sheer Heart Attack\" to \"A Night at the Opera\".\nIn May 1974, a month into the band's first US tour opening for Mott the Hoople, May collapsed and was diagnosed with hepatitis, forcing the cancellation of their remaining dates. May was still absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process. Released in 1974, \"Sheer Heart Attack\" reached number two in the UK, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the US. It gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean. May's \"Now I'm Here\" documented the group's curtailed American tour, and \"Brighton Rock\" served as a vehicle for his regular on-stage solo guitar spot. Deacon wrote his first song for the group, \"Misfire\", while the live favourite \"Stone Cold Crazy\" was credited to the whole band. Mercury wrote the closing number, \"In the Lap of the Gods\u2026 Revisited\", with the intention that the audience could sing along to the chorus when played live. This would be repeated later on, more successfully, in songs such as \"We Are the Champions.\nThe single \"Killer Queen\" was written by Mercury about a high-class prostitute. It reached number two on the British charts, and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was partly recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales. With Mercury playing the grand piano, it combines camp, vaudeville, and British music hall with May's guitar. \"Now I'm Here\" was released as the second single, reached number eleven. In 2006, \"Classic Rock\" ranked \"Sheer Heart Attack\" number 28 in \"The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever\", and in 2007, \"Mojo\" ranked it No.88 in \"The 100 Records That Changed the World\". It is also the second of three Queen albums to feature in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\nIn January 1975, Queen left for a world tour with an upgraded light show. They toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time. Several dates were cancelled after Mercury contracted laryngitis. The band then toured Japan from mid-April to the beginning of May. They were greeted by thousands of screaming fans, and played eight times in seven cities. Despite the success, Queen were still tied to the original Trident deal and wages. They were all living in relative poverty in bedsits, and Deacon was refused money for a deposit on a house. EMI contacted lawyer Jim Beach, who tried to find a way of extracting them from their contract. Trident complained that they had invested \u00a3200,000 in Queen and wanted their money back first. In August, after an acrimonious split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their contract and searched for new management. One of the options they considered was an offer from Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant, who wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin's own production company, Swan Song Records. The band were concerned about being a lower priority than Zeppelin and Bad Company (also signed to Swan Song) and instead contacted Elton John's manager, John Reid, who accepted the position. Reid's first instruction to the band was \"I'll take care of the business; you make the best record you can\".\nQueen started work on their fourth album \"A Night at the Opera\", taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced, costing \u00a340,000 and using three different studios. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. Mercury wrote the opening song \"Death on Two Legs\", a savage dig at perceived wrongdoers (and later dedicated to Trident in concert) and the camp vaudeville \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\" and \"Seaside Rendezvous\". May's \"The Prophet's Song\" was an eight-minute epic; the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe knew exactly what he was doing. It was Freddie's baby. We just helped him bring it to life. We realized we'd look odd trying to mime such a hugely complex thing on TV. It had to be presented in some other way.\n \u2014Brian May on Mercury writing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and the groundbreaking music video.\nThe best-known song on the album, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", originated from pieces of music that Mercury had written at Ealing College. Mercury played a run-through of the track on piano in his flat to Baker, stopping suddenly to announce, \"This is where the opera section comes in\". When the rest of the band started recording the song they were unsure as to how it would be pieced together. After recording the backing track, Baker left a 30-second section of tape to add the operatic vocals. Reportedly, 180 overdubs were used, to the extent that the original tape wore thin. EMI initially refused to release the single, thinking it too long, and demanded a radio edit which Queen refused. Mercury's close friend and advisor, Capital London radio DJ Kenny Everett, played a pivotal role in giving the single exposure. He was given a promotional copy on the condition he didn't play it, but ended up doing so fourteen times over a single weekend. Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released. With EMI forced to release \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" due to public demand, the single reached number one in the UK for nine weeks. It is the third-best-selling single of all time in the UK, surpassed only by Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", and is the best-selling commercial single (i.e. \"not\" for charity) in the UK. It also reached number nine in the US (a 1992 re-release reached number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five weeks). It is the only single ever to sell a million copies on two separate occasions, and became the Christmas number one twice in the UK, the only single ever to do so. It has also been voted the greatest song of all time in three different polls.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was promoted with a music video directed by Bruce Gowers, who had already shot several of Queen's live concerts. The group wanted a video so they could avoid appearing on the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\", which would clash with tour dates, and it would have looked strange miming to such a complex song. Filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, the video cost \u00a33,500, five times the typical promotional budget, and was shot in three hours. The operatic section featured a reprise of the \"Queen II\" cover, with the band member's heads animated. On the impact of the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" promotional video, \"Rolling Stone\" states: \"Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.\" Ranking it number 31 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history, \"The Guardian\" stated it \"ensured videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music\". Radio broadcaster Tommy Vance states, \"It became the first record to be pushed into the forefront by virtue of a video. Queen were certainly the first band to create a 'concept' video. The video captured the musical imagery perfectly. You cannot hear that music without seeing the visuals in your mind's eye.\"\n\"A Night at the Opera\" was very successful in the UK, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th-greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th-greatest of all time, and an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th-greatest of all time. \"A Night at the Opera\" has frequently appeared in \"greatest albums\" lists reflecting the opinions of critics. Among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in \"Q\" magazine's \"The 50 Best British Albums Ever\" in 2004, a poll done in collaboration with British music and entertainment retailer HMV. It was also placed at number 230 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003. \"A Night at the Opera\" is the third and final Queen album to be featured in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". The second single from the album was Deacon's \"You're My Best Friend\", which peaked at number sixteen on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and went on to become a worldwide top-ten hit. The band's A Night at the Opera Tour began in November 1975, and covered Europe, the US, Japan, and Australia. On 24 December, Queen played a special concert at the Hammersmith Odeon which was broadcast live on the BBC show \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\", with the audio being later broadcast on BBC Radio 1. It became one of the band's most popular bootleg recordings for decades before being officially released in 2015.\n1976\u20131979: \"A Day at the Races\" to \"Live Killers\".\nBy 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording \"A Day at the Races\", which is often regarded as a sequel album to \"A Night at the Opera\". It again borrowed the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of \"A Night at the Opera\", a variation on the same Queen logo. The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed \"'39\" \"a cappella\". Baker did not return to produce the album; instead the band self-produced with assistance from Mike Stone, who performed several of the backing vocals. The major hit on the album was \"Somebody to Love\", a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to create a gospel choir. The song went to number two in the UK, and number thirteen in the US. The album also featured one of the band's heaviest songs, May's \"Tie Your Mother Down\", which became a staple of their live shows. Musically, \"A Day at the Races\" was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US.\nQueen played a landmark gig on 18 September 1976, a free concert in Hyde Park, London, organised by the entrepreneur Richard Branson. It set an attendance record at the park, with 150,000 people confirmed in the audience. Queen were late arriving onstage and ran out of time to play an encore; the police informed Mercury that he would be arrested if he attempted to go on stage again. May enjoyed the gig particularly, as he had been to see previous concerts at the park, such as the first one organised by Blackhill Enterprises in 1968, featuring Pink Floyd.\nOn 1 December 1976, Queen were the intended guests on London's early evening \"Today\" programme, but they pulled out at the last-minute, which saw their late replacement on the show, EMI labelmate the Sex Pistols, give their infamous expletive-strewn interview with Bill Grundy. During the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, Queen performed sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, New York, in February, supported by Thin Lizzy, and Mercury and Taylor socialised with that group's leader Phil Lynott. They ended the tour with two concerts at Earls Court, London, in June, which commemorated the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, and at the cost of \u00a350,000 the band used a lighting rig in the shape of a crown for the first time.\nThe band's sixth studio album \"News of the World\" was released in 1977, which has gone four times platinum in the US, and twice in the UK. The album contained many songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock's most recognisable anthems, \"We Will Rock You\" and the rock ballad \"We Are the Champions\", both of which became enduring international sports anthems, and the latter reached number four in the US. Queen commenced the News of the World Tour in November 1977, and Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called this concert tour the band's \"most spectacularly staged and finely honed show\". During the tour they sold out another two shows at MSG, and in 1978 they received the Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award for passing more than 100,000 unit ticket sales at the venue.\n In 1978, Queen released \"Jazz\", which reached number two in the UK and number six on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the US. The album included the hit singles \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" and \"Bicycle Race\" on a double-sided record. Critical reviews of the album in the years since its release have been more favourable than initial reviews. Another notable track from \"Jazz\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\", provides another example of the band's exuberant vocal harmonies.\nIn 1978, Queen toured the US and Canada, and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan. They released their first live album, \"Live Killers\", in 1979; it went platinum twice in the US. Queen also released the very successful single \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley. The song made the top 10 in many countries, topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks, and was the band's first number one single in the US where it topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for four weeks. Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record, Mercury played rhythm guitar when performing the song live, the first time he ever played guitar in concert. On 26 December 1979, Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London, having accepted a request by the event's organiser, Paul McCartney. The concert was the last date of their Crazy Tour of London.\n1980\u20131982: \"The Game\", \"Hot Space\" and stadium tours.\nQueen began their 1980s career with \"The Game\". It featured the singles \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" and \"Another One Bites the Dust\", both of which reached number one in the US. After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \"Another One Bites the Dust\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the \"Billboard\" 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive \"No Synthesisers!\" sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-\"hard\"-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for \"Flash Gordon\". At the 1981 American Music Awards in January, \"Another One Bites the Dust\" won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single, and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group.\nIn February 1981, Queen travelled to South America as part of The Game Tour, and became the first rock band outside the Americas to play stadiums in Latin America. On playing the concerts, \"Classic Rock\" magazine states, \"They were under the spotlight from all quarters, as the entire music industry waited to see if their ambitious plans would bear fruit\". Tom Pinnock in the March 1981 issue of \"Melody Maker\" wrote, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe tour included five shows in Argentina, one of which drew the largest single concert crowd in Argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in Buenos Aires and two concerts at the Morumbi Stadium in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where they played to more than 131,000 people in the first night (then the largest paying audience for a single band anywhere in the world) and more than 120,000 people the following night. A region then largely ruled by military dictatorships, the band were greeted with scenes of fan-fever, and the promoter of their first shows at the V\u00e9lez Sarsfield Stadium in Buenos Aires was moved to say: \"For music in Argentina, this has been a case of before the war and after the war. Queen have liberated this country, musically speaking.\" The group's second show at V\u00e9lez Sarsfield was broadcast on national television and watched by over 30 million. Backstage, they were introduced to footballer Diego Maradona.\nTopping the charts in Brazil and Argentina, the ballad \"Love of My Life\" stole the show in South American concerts. Mercury would stop singing and would then conduct the audience as they took over, with Lesley-Ann Jones writing \"the fans knew the song by heart. Their English was word-perfect.\" Later that year Queen performed for more than 150,000 on 9 October at Monterrey (Estadio Universitario) and 17 and 18 at Puebla (Estadio Zaragoza), Mexico. Though the gigs were successful, they were marred by a lack of planning and suitable facilities, with audiences throwing projectiles on stage. Mercury finished the final gig saying, \"Adios, amigos, you motherfuckers!\" On 24 and 25 November, Queen played two nights at the Montreal Forum, Quebec, Canada. One of Mercury's most notable performances of \"The Game\"'s final track, \"Save Me\", took place in Montreal, and the concert is recorded in the live album, \"Queen Rock Montreal\".\nQueen worked with David Bowie on the 1981 single \"Under Pressure\". The first-time collaboration with another artist was spontaneous, as Bowie happened to drop by the studio while Queen were recording. Mercury and Bowie recorded their vocals on the track separately to each other, each coming up with individual ideas. The song topped the UK charts. In October, Queen released their first compilation album, titled \"Greatest Hits\", which showcased the group's highlights from 1974 to 1981. The best-selling album in UK chart history, it is the only album to sell over seven million copies in the UK. As of July 2022, it has spent over 1000 weeks in the UK Album Chart. According to \"The Telegraph\", approximately one in three families in the UK own a copy. The album is certified nine times platinum in the US. As of August 2024, it has spent over 600 weeks on the US \"Billboard\" 200. \"Greatest Hits\" has sold over 25\u00a0million copies worldwide.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe moved out to Munich to isolate ourselves from normal life so we could focus on the music. We all ended up in a place that was rather unhealthy. A difficult period. We weren't getting along together. We all had different agendas. It was a difficult time for me, personally \u2013 some dark moments.\n\u2014 May on the recording of \"Hot Space\" during a difficult period for the band.\nIn 1982, the band released the album \"Hot Space\", a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of pop rock, dance, disco, funk, and R&amp;B. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history. Mercury and Deacon enjoyed the new soul and funk influences, but Taylor and May were less favourable, and were critical of the influence Mercury's personal manager Paul Prenter had on him. According to Mack, Queen's producer, Prenter loathed rock music and was in Mercury's ear throughout the \"Hot Space\" sessions. May was also scathing of Prenter\u2014Mercury's manager from 1977 to 1984\u2014for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury. May states, \"this guy, in the course of one tour, told every record station to fuck off\". Queen roadie Peter Hince wrote \"None of the band cared for him [Prenter], apart from Freddie\", with Hince regarding Mercury's favouring of Prenter as an act of \"misguided loyalty\". During the Munich sessions, Mercury spent time with Mack and his family, becoming godfather to Mack's first child. \"Q\" magazine would list \"Hot Space\" as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot. Though the album confused some fans with the change of musical direction, it still reached number 4 in the UK.\nQueen toured to promote \"Hot Space\", but found some audience unreceptive to the new material. At a gig in Frankfurt, Mercury told some people heckling the new material, \"If you don't want to listen to it, go home!\" Former Mott the Hoople keyboardist Morgan Fisher joined as an additional touring member. Shows were planned at Arsenal Stadium and Old Trafford, but these were cancelled as Pope John Paul II was touring Britain, leading to a lack of available outdoor facilities such as toilets. The gigs were moved to the Milton Keynes Bowl and Elland Road, Leeds instead. The Milton Keynes concert was filmed by Tyne Tees Television and later released on DVD. On 14 and 15 September 1982, the band performed their last two gigs in the US with Mercury on lead vocals, playing at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Fisher was replaced as touring keyboardist by Fred Mandel for the North American shows. The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they performed on American television for the only time during the eighth-season premiere of \"Saturday Night Live\" on 25 September of the same year; it became the final public performance of the band in North America before the death of their frontman. Their fall in popularity in the US has been partially attributed to homophobia: Mercury had adopted what \"Rolling Stone\"'s Mikal Gilmore referred to as a \"gay clone look,\" with a thick mustache. Gilmore wrote, \"At some shows on the band's 1980 American tour, fans tossed disposable razor blades onstage: They didn't like this identity of Mercury\u2014what they perceived as a brazenly gay rock &amp; roll hero\u2014and they wanted him to shed it.\" The group finished the year with a Japanese tour.\n1983\u20131984: \"The Works\".\nAfter the Hot Space Tour concluded with a concert at Seibu Lions Stadium in Tokorozawa, Japan in November 1982, Queen decided they would take a significant amount of time off. May later said at that point, \"we hated each other for a while\". The band reconvened nine months later to begin recording a new album at the Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles and Musicland Studios, Munich. Several members of the band also explored side projects and solo work. Taylor released his second solo album, \"Strange Frontier\". May released the mini-album \"Star Fleet Project\", collaborating with Eddie Van Halen. Queen left Elektra Records, their label in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and signed onto EMI/Capitol Records.\nIn February 1984, Queen released their eleventh studio album, \"The Works\". Hit singles included \"Radio Ga Ga\", which makes a nostalgic defence of the radio format, \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"I Want to Break Free\". \"Rolling Stone\" hailed the album as \"the \"Led Zeppelin II\" of the eighties.\" In the UK \"The Works\" went triple platinum and remained in the albums chart for two years. The album failed to do well in the US, where, in addition to issues with their new record label Capitol Records (who had recently severed ties with their independent promotions teams due to a government report on payola), the cross-dressing video for \"I Want to Break Free\", a spoof of the British soap opera \"Coronation Street\", proved controversial and was banned by MTV. The concept of the video came from Roger Taylor via a suggestion from his girlfriend. He told \"Q\" magazine: \"We had done some really serious, epic videos in the past, and we just thought we'd have some fun. We wanted people to know that we didn't take ourselves too seriously, that we could still laugh at ourselves.\" Director of the video David Mallet said Mercury was reluctant to do it, commenting \"it was a hell of a job to get him out of the dressing room\".\nThat year, Queen began The Works Tour, the first tour to feature keyboardist Spike Edney as an extra live musician. The tour featured nine sold-out dates in October in Bophuthatswana, South Africa, at the arena in Sun City. Upon returning to England, they were the subject of outrage, having played in South Africa during the height of apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts and a United Nations cultural boycott. The band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in South Africa, and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences. Queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the British Musicians' Union and placed on the United Nations' blacklisted artists. In 2021, Taylor voiced his regret for the decision to perform at Sun City, saying that \"we went with the best intentions, but I still think it was kind of a mistake.\"\n1985\u20131986: Live Aid, \"A Kind of Magic\" and tours.\nIn January 1985, Queen headlined two nights of the first Rock in Rio festival at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and played in front of over 300,000 people each night. \"The Boston Globe\" described it as a \"mesmerising performance\". Highlights from both nights were released on VHS as \"Queen: Live in Rio\", which was broadcast on MTV in the US. In April and May 1985, Queen completed the Works Tour with sold-out shows in Australia and Japan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nQueen were absolutely the best band of the day ... they just went and smashed one hit after another ... it was the perfect stage for Freddie: the whole world.\n \u2014Bob Geldof, on Queen's performance at Live Aid.\nAt Live Aid, held at Wembley on 13 July 1985, in front of the biggest-ever TV audience of an estimated 400 million, Queen performed some of their greatest hits. Many of the sold-out stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison. The show's organisers, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure; other musicians such as Elton John and Cliff Richard; and journalists writing for the BBC, CNN, \"Rolling Stone\", MTV, \"The Guardian\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\", among others, described Queen as the highlight. Interviewed backstage, Roger Waters stated: \"Everybody's been buzzing about Queen that I've run into. They had everybody completely spellbound.\" An industry poll in 2005 ranked it the greatest rock performance of all time. Mercury's powerful, sustained note\u2014\"Aaaaaay-o\"\u2014during the call-and-response \"a cappella\" segment came to be known as \"The Note Heard Round the World\". The band were revitalised by the response to Live Aid\u2014a \"shot in the arm\" Roger Taylor called it\u2014and the ensuing increase in record sales. In 1986 Mercury commented: \"From our perspective, the fact that Live Aid happened when it did was really lucky. It came out of nowhere to save us. For sure that was a turning point. Maybe you could say that in the history of Queen, it was a really special moment.\"\nQueen ended 1985 by releasing the single \"One Vision\" and a limited-edition boxed set of Queen albums, \"The Complete Works\". The package included the 1984 Christmas single \"Thank God It's Christmas\" and previously unreleased material. In early 1986, Queen recorded the album \"A Kind of Magic\", containing several reworkings of songs written for the fantasy action film \"Highlander\". The album was successful in the UK, West Germany and several other countries, producing a string of hits including \"A Kind of Magic\", \"Friends Will Be Friends\", \"Princes of the Universe\" and \"Who Wants to Live Forever\"; the latter featuring an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. The album was less successful in North America, reaching 46 in the US, and was described by biographer Mark Blake as \"a so-so album\" and \"a somewhat uneven listening experience\". In 2007, \"Classic Rock\" ranked it the 28th greatest soundtrack album of all time.\nIn mid-1986, Queen went on the Magic Tour, their final tour with Mercury. They once again hired Spike Edney. Queen began the tour at the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Stockholm, Sweden, and later performed a concert at Slane Castle, Ireland, in front of an audience of 95,000, which broke the venue's attendance record. The band also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 at the N\u00e9pstadion in Budapest (released in the concert film \"\"), in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe. More than one million people saw Queen on the tour\u2014400,000 in the UK alone, a record at the time.\nThe Magic Tour's highlight was at Wembley Stadium and resulted in the live double album \"Queen at Wembley\", released on CD and as a live concert VHS/DVD, which has gone five times platinum in the US and four times platinum in the UK. The demand for tickets saw extra dates added to the tour, with concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith stating \"they seem to have an endless market.\" Queen could not book Wembley for a third night, but played at Knebworth Park in Hertfordshire on 9 August. The show sold out within two hours and over 120,000 fans packed the park for what was Queen's final performance with Mercury. At the end of the concert the band appeared on stage for the final time to an encore of \"God Save the Queen\", with Mercury, in his crown and gown, bidding the crowd \"goodnight and sweet dreams\". Roadie Peter Hince states, \"At Knebworth, I somehow felt it was going to be the last for all of us\"; Brian May recalled Mercury saying \"I'm not going to be doing this forever. This is probably the last time.\"\n1988\u20131992: \"The Miracle\", \"Innuendo\" and Mercury's final years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere was all that time when we knew Freddie was on the way out, we kept our heads down.\n\u2014Brian May\nIn October 1986, two months after his final concert, Mercury, on his return to London from holiday, was confronted by a tabloid frenzy at Heathrow Airport with the British newspapers the \"News of the World\" and \"The Sun\" reporting he had his blood tested for HIV/AIDS at a Harley Street clinic, but Mercury was quoted as saying he was \"perfectly fit and healthy\". Fans noticed his increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, with Mercury insisting he was merely \"exhausted\" and too busy to provide interviews; he was now 42 years old and had been involved in music for nearly two decades. He had in fact been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987, but did not make his illness public, with only his inner circle of colleagues and friends aware of his condition.\nAfter working on various solo projects during 1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with Montserrat Caball\u00e9, \"Barcelona\"), the band released \"The Miracle\" in 1989. The album continued the direction of \"A Kind of Magic\", using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers. It spawned the hit singles \"I Want It All\"\u2014which became an anti-apartheid anthem in South Africa\u2014\"Scandal\", and \"The Miracle\". \"The Miracle\" also began a change in direction of Queen's songwriting philosophy. Beforehand, nearly all songs had been written by and credited to a single member. With \"The Miracle\", their songwriting became more collaborative, and they vowed to credit the final product only to Queen as a group.\nIn 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and signed with Hollywood Records; through the deal, Disney acquired the North American distribution rights to Queen's catalogue for $10\u00a0million, and remains the group's music catalogue owner and distributor in the US and Canada; the band retained ownership of the global rights through the UK-based Queen Productions Ltd. In February that year, Mercury made what would prove to be his final public appearance when he joined the rest of Queen onstage at the Dominion Theatre in London to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.\nTheir fourteenth studio album, \"Innuendo\", was released in early 1991 with \"Innuendo\" and other charting singles released later in the year. The music video for \"The Show Must Go On\" featured archive footage of Queen's performances between 1981 and 1989, and along with the manner of the song's lyrics, fuelled reports that Mercury was dying. Mercury was increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded \"The Show Must Go On\" in 1990. Because of this, May had concerns about whether he was physically capable of singing it, but May recalled that he \"completely killed it\". The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May says of Mercury: \"He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really.\" The band's second-greatest hits compilation, \"Greatest Hits II\", followed in October 1991; it is the tenth best-selling album in the UK, the seventh best-selling album in Germany, is certified Diamond in France where it is one of the best-selling albums, and has sold 16\u00a0million copies worldwide.\nOn 23 November 1991, in a prepared statement made on his deathbed, Mercury confirmed that he had AIDS. Within 24 hours of the statement, he died of bronchial pneumonia, which was brought on as a complication of the disease. His funeral service on 27 November in Kensal Green, West London was private, and held in accordance with the Zoroastrian religious faith of his family.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a single shortly after Mercury's death, with \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" as the double A-side. The music video for the latter contains Mercury's final scenes in front of the camera. Ron Hart of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"the conga-driven synth ballad \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" is \"Innuendo\"'s most significant single, given that its video marked the last time his fans were able to see the singer alive.\" The video was recorded on 30 May 1991 (which proved to be Mercury's final work with Queen). The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks\u2014the only recording to top the Christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992). Initial proceeds from the single\u2014approximately \u00a31,000,000\u2014were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity.\nQueen's popularity was stimulated in North America when \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was featured in the 1992 comedy film \"Wayne's World\". Its inclusion helped the song reach number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five weeks in 1992 (including its 1976 chart run, it remained in the Hot 100 for a combined 41 weeks), and won the band an MTV Award at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. The compilation album \"Classic Queen\" also reached number four on the \"Billboard\" 200, and is certified three times platinum in the US. \"Wayne's World\" footage was used to make a new music video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", with which the band and management were delighted.\nOn 20 April 1992, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert was held at London's Wembley Stadium to a crowd of 72,000. Performers, including Def Leppard, Robert Plant, Tony Iommi, Roger Daltrey, Guns N' Roses, Elton John, David Bowie, George Michael, Annie Lennox, Seal, Extreme, and Metallica performed various Queen songs along with the three remaining Queen members (and Spike Edney.) The concert is listed in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as \"The largest rock star benefit concert\", as it was televised to over 1.2\u00a0billion viewers worldwide, and raised over \u00a320,000,000 for AIDS charities.\n1995\u20132003: \"Made in Heaven\" to 46664 Concert.\nQueen's last album with Mercury, titled \"Made in Heaven\", was released in 1995, four years after his death. Featuring tracks such as \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" and \"Heaven for Everyone\", it was constructed from Mercury's final recordings in 1991, material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from May, Taylor, and Mercury's solo albums. The album also featured the song \"Mother Love\", the last vocal recording Mercury made, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he \"wasn't feeling that great\" and stated, \"I will finish it when I come back, next time\". Mercury never returned to the studio afterwards, leaving May to record the final verse of the song. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album reached number one in the UK following its release, their ninth number one album, and sold 20\u00a0million copies worldwide. On 25 November 1996, a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva, almost five years to the day since his death.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYou guys should go out and play again. It must be like having a Ferrari in the garage waiting for a driver.\n \u2014Elton John, on Queen being without a lead singer since the death of Freddie Mercury.\nIn 1997, Queen returned to the studio to record \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\", a song dedicated to Mercury and all those who die too soon. It was released as a bonus track on the \"Queen Rocks\" compilation album later that year, and features in \"Greatest Hits III\". In January 1997, Queen performed \"The Show Must Go On\" live with Elton John and the B\u00e9jart Ballet in Paris on a night Mercury was remembered, and it marked the last performance and public appearance of John Deacon, who chose to retire; this left May and Taylor as the two remaining original members. The Paris concert was only the second time Queen had played live since Mercury's death, prompting Elton John to urge them to perform again. Brian May and Roger Taylor performed together at several award ceremonies and charity concerts, sharing vocals with various guest singers. During this time, they were billed as \"Queen +\" followed by the guest singer's name. In 1998, the duo appeared at Luciano Pavarotti's benefit concert with May performing \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" with Pavarotti, later playing \"Radio Ga Ga\", \"We Will Rock You\", and \"We Are the Champions\" with Zucchero. They again attended and performed at Pavarotti's benefit concert in Modena, Italy in May 2003. Several of the guest singers recorded new versions of Queen's hits under the \"Queen +\" name, such as Robbie Williams providing vocals for \"We Are the Champions\" for the soundtrack of \"A Knight's Tale\" (2001).\nIn November 1999, \"Greatest Hits III\" was released. This featured, among others, \"Queen + Wyclef Jean\" on a rap version of \"Another One Bites the Dust\". A live version of \"Somebody to Love\" by George Michael and a live version of \"The Show Must Go On\" with Elton John were also featured in the album. By this point, Queen's vast amount of record sales made them the second-bestselling artist in the UK of all time, behind the Beatles. In November 2000, the band released the box set, \"The Platinum Collection\". It is certified seven times platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. On 18 October 2002, Queen were awarded the 2,207th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for their work in the music industry, which is located at 6358 Hollywood Blvd. On 29 November 2003, May and Taylor performed at the 46664 Concert hosted by Nelson Mandela at Green Point Stadium, Cape Town, to raise awareness of the spread of HIV/AIDS in South Africa. A new song, \"Invincible Hope\", featuring Mandela's speech and credited to Queen + Nelson Mandela, was performed during the concert and later released on the \"46664: One Year On\" EP. During that period May and Taylor spent time at Mandela's home, discussing how Africa's problems might be approached, and two years later the band were made ambassadors for the 46664 cause.\n2004\u20132009: Queen + Paul Rodgers.\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \"featured with\" Queen as \"Queen + Paul Rodgers\", not replacing Mercury. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist.\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. Taylor said: \"We never thought we would tour again, Paul came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\" The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. Foo Fighters performed \"Tie Your Mother Down\" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.\nQueen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled \"The Cosmos Rocks\", was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the US on 28 October 2008. The band again toured Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans; the concert was released on DVD. The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena. Having completed the first leg of the European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was the O2 Arena on 13 October. The last leg of the tour was in South America, and included a sold-out concert at Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani Stadium, Buenos Aires.\nQueen and Paul Rodgers split up on 12 May 2009. Rodgers stated: \"My arrangement with [Queen] was similar to my arrangement with Jimmy [Page] in The Firm in that it was never meant to be a permanent arrangement\". Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working with Queen again.\n2009\u20132011: Departure from EMI, 40th anniversary.\nOn 20 May 2009, May and Taylor performed \"We Are the Champions\" live on the season finale of \"American Idol\" with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a vocal duet. A new greatest hits compilation \"Absolute Greatest\" was released on 16 November and peaked at number 3 in the UK. It contains 20 of Queen's hits spanning their career and was released in four different formats: single disc, double disc (with commentary), double disc with feature book, and a vinyl record. Before its release, Queen ran an online competition to guess the track listing as a promotion for the album. On 15 November 2009, May and Taylor performed \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" live on the British TV show \"The X Factor\" alongside the finalists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMany of you will have read bits and pieces on the internet about Queen changing record companies and so I wanted to confirm to you that the band have signed a new contract with Universal Music ... we would like to thank the EMI team for all their hard work over the years, the many successes and the fond memories, and of course we look forward to continuing to work with EMI Music Publishing who take care of our songwriting affairs. Next year we start working with our new record company to celebrate Queen's 40th anniversary and we will be announcing full details of the plans over the next 3 months. As Brian has already said Queen's next moves will involve 'studio work, computers and live work.\n \u2014Jim Beach, Queen's Manager, on the change of record label.\nOn 20 August 2010, Queen's manager Jim Beach announced that the band had signed a new contract with Universal Music after almost 40 years with EMI. On 22 September, May confirmed that the band's new deal was with Island Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Hollywood Records remained as the group's label in the US and Canada. For the first time since the late 1980s, Queen's catalogue now has the same distributor worldwide, as Universal distributes for both the Island and Hollywood labels (for a time in the late 1980s, Queen was on EMI-owned Capitol Records in the US).\nOn 14 March 2011, the band's 40th anniversary, Queen's first five albums were re-released in the UK and some other territories as remastered deluxe editions; the US versions were released on 17 May. The second five albums of Queen's back catalogue were released worldwide on 27 June, and on 27 September in the US and Canada. The final five were released in the UK on 5 September.\nIn May 2011, Jane's Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell said that Queen were scouting their live bassist Chris Chaney to join the band. In the same month, Paul Rodgers stated he might tour with Queen again in the future. At the 2011 Broadcast Music, Incorporated (BMI) Awards held in London on 4 October, Queen received the BMI Icon Award for their airplay success in the US. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, which Katy Perry presented to Brian May. Queen closed the awards ceremony, with Lambert singing \"The Show Must Go On\", \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\". The collaboration received a positive response from fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together.\n2011\u2013present: Queen + Adam Lambert, \"Queen Forever\".\nOn 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of \"American Idol\" at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed \"Somebody to Love\" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band. Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen said that they were looking to find another venue. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kyiv, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.\nOn 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The performance at London's Olympic Stadium opened with a remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium. Following this, May performed part of the \"Brighton Rock\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \"We Will Rock You\".\nOn 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August and September 2014. In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him. In November 2014 Queen released a new album \"Queen Forever\". The album is largely a compilation of previously released material but features three new tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, \"There Must Be More to Life Than This\", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson. Queen + Adam Lambert performed in Central Hall, Westminster, at the Big Ben New Year concert on New Year's Eve 2014 and New Year's Day 2015.\nIn 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017\u20132018, the band toured North America in mid-2017, Europe in late 2017, then played Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018. On 24 February 2019, Queen + Adam Lambert opened the 91st Academy Awards ceremony held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. In July 2019 they embarked on the North American leg of The Rhapsody Tour, with the dates sold out in April. They toured Japan and South Korea in January 2020 followed by Australia and New Zealand the following month. On 16 February the band reprised their Live Aid set for the first time in 35 years at the \"Fire Fight Australia\" concert at ANZ Stadium in Sydney to raise money for the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire crisis.\nBecause Queen were not able to tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they released a live album with Adam Lambert on 2 October 2020. The song collection, titled \"Live Around the World\", contains highlights selected by the band members from over 200 shows throughout their history. It marked their first live album with Lambert who, as of 2020, has played 218 shows with the band. On 31 December 2020, Queen performed on the Japanese New Year's Eve television special \"K\u014dhaku\" with composer Yoshiki and vocalist Sarah Brightman. In 2021, Queen received the Japan Gold Disc Award for the fourth time (having previously won it in 2005, 2019 and 2020) as the most popular Western act in Japan.\nOn 4 June 2022, Queen + Adam Lambert opened the Platinum Party at the Palace outside Buckingham Palace to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Performing a three-song set, they opened with \"We Will Rock You\" which had been introduced in a comedy segment where Queen Elizabeth II and Paddington Bear tapped their tea cups to the beat of the song. A previously unheard Queen song with Mercury's vocals, \"Face It Alone\", recorded over thirty years previously and originally thought \"unsalvageable\" by May and Taylor, was released on 13 October 2022; five more songs \u2014 \"You Know You Belong to Me\", \"When Love Breaks Up\", \"Dog With a Bone\", \"Water\", and \"I Guess We're Falling Out\" \u2014 were released on 18 November 2022 as part of \"The Miracle Collector's Edition\" box set.\nOn 13 September 2025, May and Taylor performed \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" at the Last Night of the Proms in celebration of the song's fiftieth anniversary, accompanied by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and with theatrical tenor Sam Oladeinde providing the lead vocal.\nMusic style and influences.\nQueen drew artistic influence from British rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s, such as the Beatles, the Kinks, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Who, Black Sabbath, Slade, Deep Purple, David Bowie, Genesis, and Yes, with Mercury also inspired by the rock and roll singers Little Richard, Elvis Presley and the gospel singer Aretha Franklin. On the Beatles, Brian May stated they \"built our bible as far as musical composition, arrangement and production went. \"The White Album\" is a complete catalogue of how you should use a studio to build songs.\" Mercury said, \"John Lennon was larger than life, and an absolute genius. Even at a very early stage when they were the Beatles, I always preferred John Lennon's things. I don't know why. He just had that magic.\" May and Mercury were influenced by Jimi Hendrix, with Mercury saying \"he really had everything any rock 'n' roll star should have\", and May saying \"Jimi is, of course, my number one. And I've always said that [...] I never stop learning from Jimi.\" Mercury's thesis for his Ealing College diploma was on Hendrix, and Mercury and Taylor closed their Kensington Market stall on 18 September 1970 to commemorate his death.\nAt their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as \"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\" due to its combination of \"acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics\". Although Mercury stated Robert Plant as his favourite singer and Led Zeppelin as \"the greatest\" rock band, he also said Queen \"have more in common with Liza Minnelli than Led Zeppelin. We're more in the showbiz tradition than the rock'n'roll tradition\". In his book on \"Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal\", Eddie Trunk described Queen as \"a hard rock band at the core but one with a high level of majesty and theatricality that delivered a little something for everyone\", as well as observing that the band \"sounded British\". Rob Halford of Judas Priest commented, \"It's rare that you struggle to label a band. If you're a heavy metal band you're meant to look and sound like a heavy metal band but you can't really call Queen anything. They could be a pop band one day or the band that wrote 'Bicycle Race' the next and a full-blown metal band the next. In terms of the depth of the musical landscape that they covered, it was very similar to some extent to the Beatles.\" While stating they were influenced by various artists and genres, Joe Bosso of \"Guitar World\" magazine writes, \"Queen seemed to occupy their own lane.\"\nQueen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music, often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. The music styles and genres they have been associated with include progressive rock (also known as symphonic rock), art rock, glam rock, arena rock, heavy metal, operatic pop, pop rock, psychedelic rock, baroque pop, and rockabilly. Queen also wrote songs that were inspired by musical styles not typically associated with rock groups, such as opera, music hall, folk music, gospel, ragtime, and dance/disco. Their 1980 single \"Another One Bites the Dust\" became a major hit single in the funk rock genre. Known for their anthemic songs which are a staple of sports arenas and stadiums the world over, several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\". Similarly, \"Radio Ga Ga\" became a live favourite for the band because it would have \"crowds clapping like they were at a Nuremberg rally\".\nIn 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. May has used Vox AC30 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s or early 1970s. He also uses a sixpence as a plectrum. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races\". Some of the development of this sound is attributed to the producer Roy Thomas Baker and engineer Mike Stone. Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The band's vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys.\nMedia.\nLogo.\nHaving studied graphic design in art college, Mercury also designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple line drawing. Later sleeves bore more intricately coloured versions of the logo.\nMusic videos.\nDirected by Bruce Gowers, the groundbreaking \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" promotional video sees the band adopt a \"decadent 'glam' sensibility\". Replicating Mick Rock's photograph of the band from the cover of \"Queen II\"\u2014which itself was inspired by a photo of actress Marlene Dietrich from \"Shanghai Express\" (1932)\u2014the video opens with \"Queen standing in diamond formation, heads tilted back like Easter Island statues\" in near darkness as they sing the \"a cappella\" part.\nOne of the industry's leading music video directors, David Mallet, directed some of their subsequent videos. Some of their later videos use footage from classic films: \"Under Pressure\" incorporates 1920s silent films, Sergei Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\" and F. W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu\"; the 1984 video for \"Radio Ga Ga\" includes footage from Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927); \"Calling All Girls\" was a homage to George Lucas's \"THX 1138\"; and the 1995 video \"Heaven for Everyone\" shows footage from Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' \"A Trip to the Moon\" (1902) and \"The Impossible Voyage\" (1904). The first part of Mallet's music video for \"I Want to Break Free\" spoofed the popular long-running British soap opera \"Coronation Street\".\nThe music video for \"Innuendo\" combines stop motion animation with rotoscoping and band members appear as illustrations and images taken from earlier Queen music videos on a cinema screen akin to the dystopian film \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1984). The music videos for \"Flash\" (from \"Flash Gordon\") and \"Princes of the Universe\" (from \"Highlander\") are themed on the films the band recorded soundtracks for, with the latter featuring Mercury briefly re-enact the sword-fighting scene with the titular character. Queen also appeared in conventional music videos. \"We Will Rock You\" was filmed outdoors in Roger Taylor's back garden during a cold day in early January 1977. Filmed at the New London Theatre later that year, the music video for \"We Are the Champions\" features the band\u2014with Mercury in a trademark Harlequin outfit\u2014performing in front of an enthusiastic crowd who wave Queen scarves in a manner similar to English football fans. The last music video of the group while Mercury was alive, \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\", was filmed in black and white to hide the full extent of his illness.\nMusical theatre.\nIn May 2002, a musical or \"rock theatrical\" based on the songs of Queen, titled \"We Will Rock You\", opened at the Dominion Theatre in London's West End. The musical was written by British comedian and author Ben Elton in collaboration with Brian May and Roger Taylor, and produced by Robert De Niro. It has since been staged in many cities around the world. The launch of the musical coincided with Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. As part of the Jubilee celebrations, Brian May performed a guitar solo of \"God Save the Queen\", as featured on Queen's \"A Night at the Opera\", from the roof of Buckingham Palace. The recording of this performance was used as video for the song on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of \"A Night at the Opera\". Following the Las Vegas premiere on 8 September 2004, Queen were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.\nThe original London production was scheduled to close on Saturday, 7 October 2006, at the Dominion Theatre, but due to public demand, the show ran until May 2014. \"We Will Rock You\" has become the longest-running musical ever to run at this prime London theatre, overtaking the previous record holder, the musical \"Grease\". Brian May stated in 2008 that they were considering writing a sequel to \"We Will Rock You\". The musical toured around the UK in 2009, playing at Manchester Palace Theatre, Sunderland Empire, Birmingham Hippodrome, Bristol Hippodrome, and Edinburgh Playhouse. By December 2022 the musical had been seen by 20 million people across 28 countries. In the summer of 2023 it returned to London with a 12-week run at the London Coliseum.\nSean Bovim created \"Queen at the Ballet\", a tribute to Mercury, which uses Queen's music as a soundtrack for the show's dancers, who interpret the stories behind tracks such as \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Radio Ga Ga\", and \"Killer Queen\". Queen's music also appears in the Off-Broadway production \"Power Balladz\", most notably the song \"We Are the Champions\", with the show's two performers believing the song was \"the apex of artistic achievement in its day\".\nSoftware and digital releases.\nIn conjunction with Electronic Arts, Queen released the computer game \"\" in 1998. The game received mixed reviews. Several reviewers described the fight sequences as frustrating, due to unresponsive controls and confusing camera angles. \"PC Zone\" found the game's graphics unimpressive, although \"PC PowerPlay\" considered them \"absolutely stunning\". The extremely long development time resulted in graphic elements that already seemed outdated by the time of release.\nUnder the supervision of May and Taylor, numerous restoration projects have been under way involving Queen's lengthy audio and video catalogue. DVD releases of their 1986 Wembley concert (titled \"Live at Wembley Stadium\"), 1982 Milton Keynes concert (\"Queen on Fire \u2013 Live at the Bowl\"), and two Greatest Video Hits (Volumes 1 and 2, spanning the 1970s and 1980s) have seen the band's music remixed into 5.1 and DTS surround sound. So far, only two of the band's albums, \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"The Game\", have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on DVD-Audio. \"A Night at the Opera\" was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album's original release (CD+DVD-Video set). In 2007, a Blu-ray edition of Queen's previously released concerts, \"Queen Rock Montreal\" &amp; Live Aid, was released, marking their first project in 1080p HD.\nQueen have been featured multiple times in the \"Guitar Hero\" franchise: a cover of \"Killer Queen\" in the original \"Guitar Hero\", \"We Are The Champions\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", and the Paul Rodgers collaboration \"C-lebrity\" in a track pack for \"Guitar Hero World Tour\", \"Under Pressure\" with David Bowie in \"Guitar Hero 5\", \"I Want It All\" in ', \"Stone Cold Crazy\" in ', and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in \"\". On 13 October 2009, Brian May revealed there was \"talk\" going on \"behind the scenes\" about a dedicated Queen \"Rock Band\" game.\nQueen have also been featured multiple times in the \"Rock Band\" franchise: a track pack of 10 songs which are compatible with \"Rock Band\", \"Rock Band 2\", and \"Rock Band 3\" (three of those are also compatible with \"Lego Rock Band\"). Their hit \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was featured in \"Rock Band 3\" with full harmony and keys support.\nThe band also appeared in the video game \"Lego Rock Band\" as playable Lego avatars. In March 2009, Sony Computer Entertainment released a Queen branded version of the company's karaoke franchise, \"SingStar\". The game, which is available on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, is titled \"SingStar Queen\" and has 25 songs on the PS3 and 20 on the PS2. \"We Will Rock You\" and other songs by Queen also appear in \"DJ Hero\".\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\nIn a September 2010 BBC interview, Brian May announced that Sacha Baron Cohen was to play Mercury in a biographical film about the band. \"Time\" commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to \"creative differences\" between him and the surviving band members. In December 2013, it was announced that Ben Whishaw, known for playing Q in the James Bond film \"Skyfall\", was a possible replacement for Baron Cohen in the role of Mercury, but Whishaw pulled out a few months later amidst uncertainty about how the film was progressing.\nThe project regained momentum in 2016. It was announced on 4 November that the film had secured the backing of 20th Century Fox, New Regency and GK Films. By this time, the film's working title was \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", after the band's song of the same name. Freddie Mercury was to be played by Rami Malek, and shooting was scheduled to begin in early 2017. The motion picture was written by Anthony McCarten, with a story by McCarten and Peter Morgan, who received Oscar nominations for his screenplays \"The Queen\" and \"Frost/Nixon\".\nReleased in October 2018, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" focuses on Queen's formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert. The film has grossed over $900\u00a0million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time. Despite receiving mixed reviews, it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama. Malek received wide acclaim and numerous accolades for his portrayal of Mercury, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. The Live Aid segment was praised, but there was criticism from not exploring more complex themes involving Mercury, with the \"New York Posts Johnny Oleksinski stating, \"What we ultimately wanted from Bohemian Rhapsody was not carbon-copied concerts, but behind-closed-doors insight into a deeply private, complicated, internationally beloved superstar.\" After the release of the film, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" re-entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the third time (having previously charted in 1976 and 1992), charting at number 33 on 12 November 2018. ' received an American Music Award for Top Soundtrack.\nOther films.\nThe soundtrack for the film \"Flash Gordon\" (1980) was by Queen. The band also contributed music to \"Highlander\" (the original 1986 film), with \"A Kind of Magic\", \"One Year of Love\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", \"Hammer to Fall\", and the theme \"Princes of the Universe\", which was also used as the theme of the (1992\u20131998). In choosing music for \"Highlander\", director Russell Mulcahy stated, \"I thought about one band \u2013 Queen. They write strong, anthemic songs and this movie needs their energy\". In the US, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a single in 1992 after appearing in the comedy film \"Wayne's World\". The single subsequently reached number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (with \"The Show Must Go On\" as the first track on the single) and helped rekindle the band's popularity in North America.\nSeveral films have featured their songs performed by other artists. A version of \"Somebody to Love\" by Anne Hathaway was in the 2004 film \"Ella Enchanted\". In 2006, Brittany Murphy also recorded a cover of the same song for the 2006 film \"Happy Feet\". In 2001, a version of \"The Show Must Go On\" was performed by Jim Broadbent and Nicole Kidman in the film musical \"Moulin Rouge!\". The 2001 film \"A Knight's Tale\" has a version of \"We Are the Champions\" performed by Robbie Williams and Queen; the film also features \"We Will Rock You\" played by the medieval audience.\nTelevision.\n\"I Was Born to Love You\" was used as the theme song of the Japanese television drama \"Pride\" on Fuji Television in 2004, starring Takuya Kimura and Y\u016bko Takeuchi. The show's soundtrack also contained other songs by Queen. A song that has grown in popularity four decades since its release, the initial rebirth of \"Don't Stop Me Now\" has been attributed to its appearance in the 2004 cult classic zombie apocalypse film \"Shaun of the Dead\". The song has featured in the BBC television show \"Top Gear\", and in 2005 it was voted as \"The Greatest Driving Song Ever\" by the series' viewers. In the Channel 4 sitcom \"Father Ted\", Graham Norton as Father Noel Furlong performs \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in the episode \"The Mainland\".\nKeeping in a tradition of naming each season's episodes after songs by 1970s rock bands, the eighth and final season of \"That '70s Show\" had episodes named after Queen songs. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" served as the season premiere. With an entry for the year 1977, Queen featured in the VH1 series \"I Love the '70s\", broadcast in the US. \"The Simpsons\" has made storylines which have featured Queen songs such as \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" (both sung by Homer), and \"You're My Best Friend\". The latter also appears in \"Family Guy\", as does \"Another One Bites the Dust\", and an episode of the show, \"Killer Queen\", is named after (and features) the song. Queen were profiled in season 1, episode 16 of \"VH1's Legends\", broadcast in 1998.\nOn 11 April 2006, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the American singing contest television show \"American Idol\". Each contestant was required to sing a Queen song during that week of the competition. Songs which appeared on the show included \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"The Show Must Go On\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", and \"Innuendo\". Brian May later criticised the show for editing specific scenes, one of which made the group's time with contestant Ace Young look negative, despite it being the opposite. Taylor and May again appeared on the \"American Idol\" season 8 finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists Adam Lambert and Kris Allen. On 15 November 2009, Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on the singing contest television show \"The X Factor\" in the UK.\nIn 2007, Queen featured as one of the main artists in the fifth episode of the BBC/VH1 series \"Seven Ages of Rock\"\u2014focusing on stadium rock, the episode itself was named \"We Are the Champions\". In the autumn of 2009, \"Glee\" featured the fictional high school's show choir singing \"Somebody to Love\" as their second act performance in the episode \"The Rhodes Not Taken\". The performance was included on the show's ' soundtrack CD. In June 2010, the choir performed \"Another One Bites the Dust\" in the episode \"Funk\". The following week's episode, \"Journey to Regionals\", features a rival choir performing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in its entirety. The song was featured on the . In May 2012, the choir performed \"We Are the Champions\" in the episode \"Nationals\", and the song features in '. In November 2014, \"The Nation's Favourite Queen Song\", a 90-minute television special counting down Britain's 20 favourite Queen songs, aired on ITV in the UK. In November 2021, \"The Queen Family Singalong\", featuring performances of songs by Queen accompanied with on-screen karaoke lyrics encouraging viewers to sing along, aired on ABC in the US.\nLegacy.\nUpon being awarded the Polar Music Prize in 2025, Queen were described as being \"a band synonymous with the very fabric of pop culture\" who \"have made an impact on music that spans decades, generations and genres\", and they are \"beloved the world over\".\nIn 2002, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was voted \"the UK's favourite hit of all time\" in a poll conducted by the \"Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book\". In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Many scholars consider the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" music video groundbreaking, crediting it with popularising the medium. Rock historian Paul Fowles stated that the song is \"widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy\". It has been hailed as paving the way for the MTV Generation. In December 2018, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became the most-streamed song from the 20th century, and the most-streamed classic rock song of all time. The song and original video were downloaded more than 1.6\u00a0billion times. In March 2021 it was certified Diamond in the US for combined digital sales and streams equal to 10 million units. Acclaimed for their stadium rock, in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen's performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history. In 2007, they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf you have to go back and watch one performance it has to be Queen. That was not just a career-defining moment ... rock 'n' roll might have peaked right there. Freddie Mercury on stage at Live Aid is the summit of rock 'n' roll. For a band some people said was washed up, that was just the most stunning, breathtaking, flawless, powerful, jubilant performance. It was everything you want in rock 'n' roll.\n \u20141980s MTV VJ Martha Quinn speaking in July 2015 on the 30th anniversary of Live Aid.\nAs of 2005, according to the \"Guinness Book of World Records\", Queen albums have spent a total of 1,322 weeks (twenty-six years) on the UK Album Charts, more time than any other act. Also in 2005, with the release of their live album with Paul Rodgers, Queen moved into third place on the list of acts with the most aggregate time spent on the British record charts. In 2022, \"Greatest Hits\" was the best-selling album in UK chart history, and the only album to sell over seven million copies in the UK. As of August 2024, the album has spent over 600 weeks on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Their \"Greatest Hits II\" album is the UK's tenth best seller, with sales of 3,746,404 copies. Based on record sales, \"Billboard\" charts performance, online views and popularity on Spotify, in 2018 \"Business Insider\" in the US ranked Queen the third most popular rock band of all time, after the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.\nThe band have released a total of 18 number-one albums, 18 number-one singles, and 10 number-one DVDs worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. Estimates of their record sales range from 250\u00a0million to 300\u00a0million worldwide. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the band is the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single, and all four members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2009, \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\" were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the latter was voted the world's favourite song in a 2005 Sony Ericsson global music poll. The band received Ivor Novello Awards for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, in 1987, and Outstanding Song Collection, in 2005, from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In recognition of the vocal harmonies of Mercury, May and Taylor, in 2006 Queen were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In their list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the IFPI named Queen the sixth best-selling artist worldwide in 2018, and the fifth best-selling artist in 2019, in both cases the most popular act of their contemporaries. In January 2020, Queen became the first band to join Elizabeth II on a British coin, with the commemorative \u00a35 coin, issued by the Royal Mint, featuring the instruments of all four bandmembers. In July 2020, Queen became the third band (after the Beatles and Pink Floyd) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.\nQueen are one of the most bootlegged bands ever, according to Nick Weymouth, who manages the band's official website. A 2001 survey discovered the existence of 12,225 websites dedicated to Queen bootlegs, the highest number for any band. Bootleg recordings have contributed to the band's popularity in certain countries where Western music is censored, such as Iran. In a project called \"Queen: The Top 100 Bootlegs\", many of these have been made officially available to download for a nominal fee from Queen's website, with profits going to the Mercury Phoenix Trust. In 2004, Queen became the first Western rock act to be officially accepted in Iran following the release of their \"Greatest Hits\" album. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Queen at number 52 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", while ranking Mercury the 18th-greatest singer, and May the twenty-sixth-greatest guitarist. \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted Mercury the second-greatest frontman. Queen were named 13th on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list, and in 2010 were ranked 17th on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. In 2012, \"Gigwise\" readers named Queen the best band of the past 60 years. Eddie Trunk argued that Queen's importance, in common with Thin Lizzy and Deep Purple, was \"not as fully recognized\" in the US because elsewhere they \"often played to much bigger crowds in stadium venues\". Queen had stopped touring the US in 1982 as their success there had started to wane, but they remained a touring \"juggernaut\", filling stadiums and arenas internationally in the 1980s until their final tour (with Mercury) in 1986.\nInfluence.\nQueen have been credited with making a significant contribution to genres such as hard rock and heavy metal. In the early 1970s, they helped spur the metal genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence. Their 1974 song \"Stone Cold Crazy\" has been cited as a precursor of speed metal. Metallica recorded a cover version of \"Stone Cold Crazy\", which first appeared on the \"\" album in 1990, and they still performed it live in the 2000s. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, a pioneer of \"neo-classical metal\", listened to Queen as a child, and spoke of Brian May being \"very inventive when it comes to tones and having all those pickup configurations. Brian tends not to stick to just pentatonics, either; he mixes it all up, which is how I like to think, too.\"\nThe band have been cited as an influence by many other musicians. Moreover, like their music, the bands and artists that have claimed to be influenced by Queen or have expressed admiration for them are diverse, spanning different generations, countries, and genres, including heavy metal: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, Trivium, Megadeth, Anthrax, Melvins, Slipknot, Rob Zombie, and Rage Against the Machine; hard rock: Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Steve Vai, the Cult, the Darkness, and Foo Fighters; alternative rock: Nirvana, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, the Flaming Lips, Kid Rock, and Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins; shock rock: Marilyn Manson; pop rock: the Killers, My Chemical Romance, and Panic! at the Disco; country: Faith Hill, and Carrie Underwood; pop: George Michael, Robbie Williams, Adele, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry; and K-pop: Psy, and BTS.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Musicians have been saying for decades Queen are in the pantheon of all-time greats. In the countless interviews I have done over the years they have been name checked by numerous superstars. What is most impressive though is the diversity of artists they've influenced. Why Queen were able to cut across such an incredibly wide range of musicians is easy to see \u2013 they are one of the most versatile bands that rock has ever had.\u2014\u200a\nThom Yorke of Radiohead received his first guitar at seven years old, encouraged after seeing May in a broadcast of a Queen concert. At 10 years old, he made his own homemade guitar, trying to imitate what May had done with his Red Special, but he was not satisfied with the result. Subsequently, Queen became one of the first influences of his band.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nConcert tours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42012", "revid": "50052465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42012", "title": "Macedonia (ancient kingdom)", "text": "Ancient Greek kingdom in the southern Balkans\nMacedonia ( ; , ), also called Macedon ( ), was an ancient kingdom on the periphery of Archaic and Classical Greece, which later became the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece. The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty, which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centred on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the southwest, Illyria to the northwest, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south.\nBefore the 4th century BC, Macedonia was a small kingdom with its capital at Aigai, outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens, Sparta and Thebes, and briefly subordinate to the Achaemenid Empire. During the reign of the Argead king PhilipII (359\u2013336 BC), Macedonia (with its capital at Pella) subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the \"sarissa\" pike, PhilipII defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC. PhilipII's son Alexander the Great, leading a federation of Greek states, accomplished his father's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexander's subsequent campaign of conquest, he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River. For a brief period, his Macedonian Empire was the most powerful in the world \u2013 the definitive Hellenistic state, inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy, engineering, and science spread across the empire and beyond. Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle, tutor to Alexander, whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy.\nAfter Alexander's death in 323BC, the ensuing wars of the Diadochi, and the partitioning of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political centre in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Attalid kingdom. Important cities such as its capital Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles for control of the territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia's decline began with the Macedonian Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150\u2013148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.\nThe Macedonian kings, who wielded absolute power and commanded state resources such as gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other \"diadochi\" successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by the institution of the army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies.\nEtymology.\nThe name Macedonia (, \"\") comes from the ethnonym (), which itself is derived from the ancient Greek adjective \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (), meaning \"tall, slim\", also the name of a people related to the Dorians (Herodotus), and possibly descriptive of Ancient Macedonians. It is most likely cognate with the adjective (), meaning \"long\" or \"tall\" in Ancient Greek. The name is believed to have originally meant either \"highlanders\", \"the tall ones\", or \"high grown men\". Linguist Robert S. P. Beekes claims that both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology; however Filip De Decker rejects Beekes\u02bc arguments as insufficient. The shorter English name variant \"Macedon\" developed in Middle English, based on a borrowing from the French form of the name, \"Mac\u00e9doine\".\nHistory.\nEarly history and legend.\nThe Classical Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides reported the legend that the Macedonian kings of the Argead dynasty were descendants of Temenus, king of Argos, and could therefore claim the mythical Heracles as one of their ancestors as well as a direct lineage from Zeus, chief god of the Greek pantheon. Contradictory legends state that either Perdiccas I of Macedon or Caranus of Macedon were the founders of the Argead dynasty, with either five or eight kings before AmyntasI. The assertion that the Argeads descended from Temenus was accepted by the \"Hellanodikai\" authorities of the Ancient Olympic Games, permitting Alexander I of Macedon (r.\u2009498\u00a0\u2013\u00a0454\u00a0BC) to enter the competitions owing to his perceived Greek heritage. Little is known about the kingdom before the reign of AlexanderI's father Amyntas I of Macedon (r.\u2009547\u00a0\u2013\u00a0498\u00a0BC) during the Archaic period.\nThe kingdom of Macedonia was initially situated along the Haliacmon and Loudias rivers in Lower Macedonia, north of Mount Olympus, east of the Vermio and Pierian mountain ranges, stretching along the coast of the Thermaic Gulf. Historian Robert Malcolm Errington suggests that one of the earliest Argead kings established Aigai (modern Vergina) as their capital in the mid-7th centuryBC. Before the 4th centuryBC, the kingdom covered a region corresponding roughly to the western and central parts of the region of Macedonia in modern Greece. It gradually expanded into the regions of Emathia, Pieria, Bottiaea, Almopia, Eordaea, Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Bisaltia, which were inhabited by various peoples such as Thracians and Phrygians, and into the region of Upper Macedonia, inhabited by the Greek tribes of Lyncestae, Orestae, and Elimiotae. Macedonia's non-Greek neighbours included Thracians, inhabiting territories to the northeast, Illyrians to the northwest, and Paeonians to the north, while the lands of Thessaly to the south and Epirus to the west were inhabited by Greeks with similar cultures to that of the Macedonians.\nA year after Darius I of Persia (r.\u2009522\u00a0\u2013\u00a0486\u00a0BC) launched an invasion into Europe against the Scythians, Paeonians, Thracians, and several Greek city-states of the Balkans, the Persian general Megabazus used diplomacy to convince AmyntasI to submit as a vassal of the Achaemenid Empire, ushering in the period of Achaemenid Macedonia. Achaemenid Persian hegemony over Macedonia was briefly interrupted by the Ionian Revolt (499\u2013493BC), yet the Persian general Mardonius brought it back under Achaemenid suzerainty.\nAlthough Macedonia enjoyed a large degree of autonomy and was never made a satrapy (i.e. province) of the Achaemenid Empire, it was expected to provide troops for the Achaemenid army. AlexanderI provided Macedonian military support to Xerxes I (r.\u2009486\u00a0\u2013\u00a0465\u00a0BC) during the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480\u2013479 BC, and Macedonian soldiers fought on the side of the Persians at the 479BC Battle of Platea. Following the Greek victory at Salamis in 480BC, AlexanderI was employed as an Achaemenid diplomat to propose a peace treaty and alliance with Athens, an offer that was rejected. Soon afterwards, the Achaemenid forces were forced to withdraw from mainland Europe, marking the end of Persian control over Macedonia.\nInvolvement in the Classical Greek world.\nAlthough initially a Persian vassal, AlexanderI of Macedon fostered friendly diplomatic relations with his former Greek enemies, the Athenian and Spartan-led coalition of Greek city-states. His successor PerdiccasII (r.\u2009454\u00a0\u2013\u00a0413\u00a0BC) led the Macedonians to war in four separate conflicts against Athens, leader of the Delian League, while incursions by the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian kingdom threatened Macedonia's territorial integrity in the northeast. The Athenian statesman Pericles promoted colonization of the Strymon River near the Kingdom of Macedonia, where the colonial city of Amphipolis was founded in 437/436BC so that it could provide Athens with a steady supply of silver and gold as well as timber and pitch to support the Athenian navy. Initially Perdiccas II did not take any action and might have even welcomed the Athenians, as the Thracians were foes to both of them. This changed due to an Athenian alliance with a brother and cousin of PerdiccasII who had rebelled against him. Thus, two separate wars were fought against Athens between 433 and 431BC. The Macedonian king retaliated by promoting the rebellion of Athens' allies in Chalcidice and subsequently won over the strategic city of Potidaea. After capturing the Macedonian cities Therma and Beroea, Athens besieged Potidaea but failed to overcome it; Therma was returned to Macedonia and much of Chalcidice to Athens in a peace treaty brokered by Sitalces, who provided Athens with military aid in exchange for acquiring new Thracian allies.\nPerdiccasII sided with Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, but he was forced to retreat owing to a shortage of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, and he was able to put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.\nBrasidas died in 422 BC, the year Athens and Sparta struck an accord, the Peace of Nicias, that freed Macedonia from its obligations as an Athenian ally. Following the 418BC Battle of Mantinea, the victorious Spartans formed an alliance with Argos, a military pact PerdiccasII was keen to join given the threat of Spartan allies remaining in Chalcidice. When Argos suddenly switched sides as a pro-Athenian democracy, the Athenian navy was able to form a blockade against Macedonian seaports and invade Chalcidice in 417BC. PerdiccasII sued for peace in 414BC, forming an alliance with Athens that was continued by his son and successor ArchelausI (r.\u2009413\u00a0\u2013\u00a0399\u00a0BC). Athens then provided naval support to ArchelausI in the 410BC Macedonian siege of Pydna, in exchange for timber and naval equipment.\nAlthough Archelaus I was faced with some internal revolts and had to fend off an invasion of Illyrians led by Sirras of Lynkestis, he was able to project Macedonian power into Thessaly where he sent military aid to his allies. Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious centre, ArchelausI moved the capital of the kingdom north to Pella, which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea. He improved Macedonia's currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage. His royal court attracted the presence of well-known intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides. When ArchelausI was assassinated (perhaps following a homosexual love affair with royal pages at his court), the kingdom was plunged into chaos, in an era lasting from 399 to 393BC that included the reign of four different monarchs: Orestes, son of ArchelausI; AeropusII, uncle, regent, and murderer of Orestes; Pausanias, son of AeropusII; and AmyntasII, who was married to the youngest daughter of ArchelausI. Very little is known about this turbulent period; it came to an end when AmyntasIII (r.\u2009393\u00a0\u2013\u00a0370\u00a0BC), son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of AmyntasI, killed Pausanias and claimed the Macedonian throne.\nAmyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrians led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet AmyntasIII eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. AmyntasIII was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379BC.\nAlexander II (r.\u2009370\u00a0\u2013\u00a0368\u00a0BC), son of EurydiceI and AmyntasIII, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the \"tagus\" (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both AlexanderII and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including AlexanderII's brother and future king PhilipII (r.\u2009359\u00a0\u2013\u00a0336\u00a0BC). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for PerdiccasIII (r.\u2009368\u00a0\u2013\u00a0359\u00a0BC), younger brother of AlexanderII, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery. However, an Athenian invasion led by Timotheus, son of Conon, captured Methone and Pydna, and an Illyrian invasion led by Bardylis succeeded in killing PerdiccasIII and 4,000 Macedonian troops in battle.\nRise of Macedon.\nPhilip II was twenty-four years old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to convince the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender. He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis. He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.\nPhilip II spent his initial years radically transforming the Macedonian army. A reform of its organization, equipment, and training, including the introduction of the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the \"sarissa\"), proved immediately successful when tested against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much PhilipII's royal predecessors may have contributed to these reforms and the extent to which his ideas were influenced by his adolescent years of captivity in Thebes as a political hostage during the Theban hegemony, especially after meeting with the general Epaminondas.\nThe Macedonians, like the other Greeks, traditionally practised monogamy, but PhilipII practised polygamy and married seven wives with perhaps only one that did not involve the loyalty of his aristocratic subjects or new allies. His first marriages were to Phila of Elimeia of the Upper Macedonian aristocracy as well as the Illyrian princess Audata to ensure a marriage alliance. To establish an alliance with Larissa in Thessaly, he married the Thessalian noblewoman Philinna in 358BC, who bore him a son who would later rule as Philip III Arrhidaeus (r.\u2009323\u00a0\u2013\u00a0317\u00a0BC). In 357BC, he married Olympias to secure an alliance with Arybbas, the King of Epirus and the Molossians. This marriage would bear a son who would later rule as AlexanderIII (better known as Alexander the Great) and claim descent from the legendary Achilles by way of his dynastic heritage from Epirus. It is unclear whether or not the Achaemenid Persian kings influenced PhilipII's practice of polygamy, although his predecessor AmyntasIII had three sons with a possible second wife Gygaea: Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and Menelaus. PhilipII had Archelaus put to death in 359BC, while PhilipII's other two half brothers fled to Olynthos, serving as a \"casus belli\" for the Olynthian War (349\u2013348BC) against the Chalcidian League.\nWhile Athens was preoccupied with the Social War (357\u2013355 BC), PhilipII retook Amphipolis from them in 357BC and the following year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he handed over to the Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty. In 356BC, he took Crenides, refounding it as Philippi, while his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos II of the Grabaei. During the 355\u2013354BC siege of Methone, PhilipII lost his right eye to an arrow wound, but managed to capture the city and treated the inhabitants cordially, unlike the Potidaeans, who had been enslaved.\nPhilip II then involved Macedonia in the Third Sacred War (356\u2013346BC). It began when Phocis captured and plundered the temple of Apollo at Delphi instead of submitting unpaid fines, causing the Amphictyonic League to declare war on Phocis and a civil war among the members of the Thessalian League aligned with either Phocis or Thebes. PhilipII's initial campaign against Pherae in Thessaly in 353BC at the behest of Larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by the Phocian general Onomarchus. PhilipII in turn defeated Onomarchus in 352BC at the Battle of Crocus Field, which led to PhilipII's election as leader (\"archon\") of the Thessalian League, provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council, and allowed for a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding Nicesipolis, niece of the tyrant Jason of Pherae.\nPhilip II had some early involvement with the Achaemenid Empire, especially by supporting satraps and mercenaries who rebelled against the central authority of the Achaemenid king. The satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia Artabazos II, who was in rebellion against Artaxerxes III, was able to take refuge as an exile at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC. He was accompanied in exile by his family and by his mercenary general Memnon of Rhodes. Barsine, daughter of Artabazos, and future wife of Alexander the Great, grew up at the Macedonian court.\nAfter campaigning against the Thracian ruler Cersobleptes, in 349BC, PhilipII began his war against the Chalcidian League, which had been reestablished in 375BC following a temporary disbandment. Despite an Athenian intervention by Charidemus, Olynthos was captured by PhilipII in 348BC, and its inhabitants were sold into slavery, including some Athenian citizens. The Athenians, especially in a series of speeches by Demosthenes known as the \"Olynthiacs\", were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack and in 346BC concluded a treaty with Macedonia known as the Peace of Philocrates. The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories, the Chalcidice, and Amphipolis in return for the release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that PhilipII would not attack Athenian settlements in the Thracian Chersonese. Meanwhile, Phocis and Thermopylae were captured by Macedonian forces, the Delphic temple robbers were executed, and PhilipII was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council and the position of master of ceremonies over the Pythian Games. Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest, but they eventually accepted these conditions, perhaps after some persuasion by Demosthenes in his oration \"On the Peace\".\nOver the next few years, Philip II reformed local governments in Thessaly, campaigned against the Illyrian ruler Pleuratus I, deposed Arybbas in Epirus in favour of his brother-in-law AlexanderI (through PhilipII's marriage to Olympias), and defeated Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the Hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into Achaemenid Anatolia. In 342BC, PhilipII conquered a Thracian city in what is now Bulgaria and renamed it Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv). War broke out with Athens in 340BC while PhilipII was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of Perinthus and Byzantion, followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the Danube and Macedonia's involvement in the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa in 339BC. Thebes ejected a Macedonian garrison from Nicaea (near Thermopylae), leading Thebes to join Athens, Megara, Corinth, Achaea, and Euboea in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC. After the Macedonian victory at Chaeronea, PhilipII installed an oligarchy in Thebes, yet was lenient toward Athens, wishing to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the League of Corinth that included the major Greek city-states except Sparta. Despite the Kingdom of Macedonia's official exclusion from the league, in 337BC, PhilipII was elected as the leader (\"hegemon\") of its council (\"synedrion\") and the commander-in-chief (\"strategos autokrator\") of a forthcoming campaign to invade the Achaemenid Empire. Philip's plan to punish the Persians for the suffering of the Greeks and to liberate the Greek cities of Asia Minor as well as perhaps the panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece, contributed to his decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire. The Persians offered aid to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341\u2013340BC, highlighting Macedonia's strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment, as the Persian king Artaxerxes III further consolidated his control over satrapies in western Anatolia. The latter region, yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans, was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer economic potential.\nWhen Philip II married Cleopatra Eurydice, niece of general Attalus, talk of providing new potential heirs at the wedding feast infuriated PhilipII's son Alexander, a veteran of the Battle of Chaeronea, and his mother Olympias. They fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella by PhilipII. When PhilipII arranged a marriage between his son Arrhidaeus and Ada of Caria, daughter of Pixodarus, the Persian satrap of Caria, Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead. PhilipII then cancelled the wedding altogether and exiled Alexander's advisors Ptolemy, Nearchus, and Harpalus. To reconcile with Olympias, PhilipII had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias' brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) AlexanderI of Epirus, but PhilipII was assassinated by his bodyguard, Pausanias of Orestis, during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander in 336BC.\nEmpire.\nModern scholars have argued over the possible role of AlexanderIII \"the Great\" and his mother Olympias in the assassination of PhilipII, noting the latter's choice to exclude Alexander from his planned invasion of Asia, choosing instead for him to act as regent of Greece and deputy \"hegemon\" of the League of Corinth, and the potential bearing of another male heir between PhilipII and his new wife, Cleopatra Eurydice. AlexanderIII (r.\u2009336\u00a0\u2013\u00a0323\u00a0BC) was immediately proclaimed king by an assembly of the army and leading aristocrats, chief among them being Antipater and Parmenion. By the end of his reign and military career in 323BC, Alexander would rule over an empire consisting of mainland Greece, Asia Minor, the Levant, ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and much of Central and South Asia (i.e. modern Pakistan). Among his first acts was the burial of his father at Aigai. The members of the League of Corinth revolted at the news of PhilipII's death, but were soon quelled by military force alongside persuasive diplomacy, electing Alexander as \"hegemon\" of the league to carry out the planned invasion of Achaemenid Persia.\nIn 335 BC, Alexander fought against the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube, forcing their surrender on Peuce Island. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus, son of Bardylis, threatened to attack Macedonia with the aid of Glaucias, king of the Taulantii, but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Illyrians at Pelion (in modern Albania). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned the city to the ground as a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.\nThroughout his military career, Alexander won every battle that he personally commanded. His first victory against the Persians in Asia Minor at the Battle of the Granicus in 334BC used a small cavalry contingent as a distraction to allow his infantry to cross the river followed by a cavalry charge from his companion cavalry. Alexander led the cavalry charge at the Battle of Issus in 333BC, forcing the Persian king Darius III and his army to flee. DariusIII, despite having superior numbers, was again forced to flee the Battle of Gaugamela in 331BC. The Persian king was later captured and executed by his own satrap of Bactria and kinsman, Bessus, in 330BC. The Macedonian king subsequently hunted down and executed Bessus in what is now Afghanistan, securing the region of Sogdia in the process. At the 326BC Battle of the Hydaspes (modern-day Punjab), when the war elephants of King Porus of the Pauravas threatened Alexander's troops, he had them form open ranks to surround the elephants and dislodge their handlers by using their \"sarissa\" pikes. When his Macedonian troops threatened mutiny in 324BC at Opis, Babylonia (near modern Baghdad, Iraq), Alexander offered Macedonian military titles and greater responsibilities to Persian officers and units instead, forcing his troops to seek forgiveness at a staged banquet of reconciliation between Persians and Macedonians.\nAlexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331BC. His attempt in 327BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of \"proskynesis\" borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330BC, this was \"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328BC is described as \"vengeful and reckless\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of DariusIII, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324BC.\nMeanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy \"hegemon\" of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom was to be restored.\nWhen Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother PhilipIII Arrhidaeus (r.\u2009323\u00a0\u2013\u00a0317\u00a0BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, AlexanderIV (r.\u2009323\u00a0\u2013\u00a0309\u00a0BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323\u2013322BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the \"diadochi\", the former generals of Alexander's army.\nA council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming PhilipIII as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the council of the army as well.\nForming an alliance with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens' port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319\u2013315BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317BC, PhilipIII, by way of his politically engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards, Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of PhilipIII and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor and dozens of other Macedonian nobles killed, but by the spring of 316BC, Cassander had defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.\nCassander married Philip II's daughter Thessalonike and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as Epidamnos (modern Durr\u00ebs, Albania). By 313BC, it was retaken by the Illyrian king Glaucias of Taulantii. By 316BC, Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject Seleucus Nicator from his Babylonian satrapy, leading Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus to issue a joint ultimatum to Antigonus in 315BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia. Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon, now based in Corinth, and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander, charging him with murder for executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family, King AlexanderIV and the queen mother Roxana. The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312/311BC, when a new peace settlement recognized Cassander as general of Europe, Antigonus as \"first in Asia\", Ptolemy as general of Egypt, and Lysimachus as general of Thrace. Cassander had AlexanderIV and Roxana put to death in the winter of 311/310BC, and between 306 and 305BC the \"diadochi\" were declared kings of their respective territories.\nHellenistic era.\nThe beginning of Hellenistic Greece was defined by the struggle between the Antipatrid dynasty, led first by Cassander (r.\u2009305\u00a0\u2013\u00a0297\u00a0BC), son of Antipater, and the Antigonid dynasty, led by the Macedonian general Antigonus I Monophthalmus (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0301\u00a0BC) and his son, the future king DemetriusI (r.\u2009294\u00a0\u2013\u00a0288\u00a0BC). Cassander besieged Athens in 303BC, but was forced to retreat to Macedonia when Demetrius invaded Boeotia to his rear, attempting to sever his path of retreat. While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate PhilipII's Hellenic league with themselves as dual hegemons, a revived coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy I Soter (r.\u2009305\u00a0\u2013\u00a0283\u00a0BC) of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, Seleucus I Nicator (r.\u2009305\u00a0\u2013\u00a0281\u00a0BC) of the Seleucid Empire, and Lysimachus (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0281\u00a0BC), King of Thrace, defeated the Antigonids at the Battle of Ipsus in 301BC, killing Antigonus and forcing Demetrius into flight.\nCassander died in 297 BC, and his sickly son PhilipIV died the same year, succeeded by Cassander's other sons Alexander V of Macedon (r.\u2009297\u00a0\u2013\u00a0294\u00a0BC) and Antipater II of Macedon (r.\u2009297\u00a0\u2013\u00a0294\u00a0BC), with their mother Thessalonike of Macedon acting as regent. While Demetrius fought against the Antipatrid forces in Greece, AntipaterII killed his own mother to obtain power. His desperate brother AlexanderV then requested aid from Pyrrhus of Epirus (r.\u2009297\u00a0\u2013\u00a0272\u00a0BC), who had fought alongside Demetrius at the Battle of Ipsus, but was sent to Egypt as a hostage as part of an agreement between Demetrius and PtolemyI. In exchange for defeating the forces of AntipaterII and forcing him to flee to the court of Lysimachus in Thrace, Pyrrhus was awarded the westernmost portions of the Macedonian kingdom. Demetrius had his nephew AlexanderV assassinated and was then proclaimed king of Macedonia, but his subjects protested against his aloof, Eastern-style autocracy.\nWar broke out between Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290BC when Lanassa, wife of Pyrrhus, daughter of Agathocles of Syracuse, left him for Demetrius and offered him her dowry of Corcyra. The war dragged on until 288BC, when Demetrius lost the support of the Macedonians and fled the country. Macedonia was then divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, the former taking western Macedonia and the latter eastern Macedonia. By 286BC, Lysimachus had expelled Pyrrhus and his forces from Macedonia. In 282BC, a new war erupted between SeleucusI and Lysimachus; the latter was killed in the Battle of Corupedion, allowing SeleucusI to take control of Thrace and Macedonia. In two dramatic reversals of fortune, SeleucusI was assassinated in 281BC by his officer Ptolemy Keraunos, son of PtolemyI and grandson of Antipater, who was then proclaimed king of Macedonia before being killed in battle in 279BC by Celtic invaders in the Gallic invasion of Greece. The Macedonian army proclaimed the general Sosthenes of Macedon as king, although he apparently refused the title. After defeating the Gallic ruler Bolgios and driving out the raiding party of Brennus, Sosthenes died and left a chaotic situation in Macedonia. The Gallic invaders ravaged Macedonia until Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius, defeated them in Thrace at the 277BC Battle of Lysimachia and was then proclaimed king Antigonus II of Macedon (r.\u2009277\u00a0\u2013\u00a0274,\u00a0272\u00a0\u2013\u00a0239\u00a0BC).\nIn 280 BC, Pyrrhus embarked on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos secured his position on the Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.\nPyrrhus lost much of his support among the Macedonians in 273BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal cemetery of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued AntigonusII in the Peloponnese, yet AntigonusII was ultimately able to recapture Macedonia. Pyrrhus was killed while besieging Argos in 272BC, allowing AntigonusII to reclaim the rest of Greece. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai and annexed the Kingdom of Paeonia.\nThe Aetolian League hampered AntigonusII's control over central Greece, and the formation of the Achaean League in 251BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta. While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia against Ptolemaic Egypt during the Syrian Wars, the Ptolemaic navy heavily disrupted AntigonusII's efforts to control mainland Greece. With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy, the Athenian statesman Chremonides led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261BC). By 265BC, Athens was surrounded and besieged by AntigonusII's forces, and a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the Battle of Cos. Athens finally surrendered in 261BC. After Macedonia formed an alliance with the Seleucid ruler Antiochus II, a peace settlement between AntigonusII and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt was finally struck in 255BC.\nIn 251 BC, Aratus of Sicyon led a rebellion against AntigonusII, and in 250BC, PtolemyII declared his support for the self-proclaimed King Alexander of Corinth. Although Alexander died in 246BC and Antigonus was able to score a naval victory against the Ptolemies at Andros, the Macedonians lost the Acrocorinth to the forces of Aratus in 243BC, followed by the induction of Corinth into the Achaean League. AntigonusII made peace with the Achaean League in 240BC, ceding the territories that he had lost in Greece. AntigonusII died in 239BC and was succeeded by his son Demetrius II of Macedon (r.\u2009239\u00a0\u2013\u00a0229\u00a0BC). Seeking an alliance with Macedonia to defend against the Aetolians, the queen mother and regent of Epirus, Olympias II, offered her daughter Phthia of Macedon to DemetriusII in marriage. Demetrius II accepted her proposal, but he damaged relations with the Seleucids by divorcing Stratonice of Macedon. Although the Aetolians formed an alliance with the Achaean League as a result, DemetriusII was able to invade Boeotia and capture it from the Aetolians by 236BC.\nThe Achaean League managed to capture Megalopolis in 235BC, and by the end of DemetriusII's reign most of the Peloponnese except Argos was taken from the Macedonians. DemetriusII also lost an ally in Epirus when the monarchy was toppled in a republican revolution. DemetriusII enlisted the aid of the Illyrian king Agron to defend Acarnania against Aetolia, and in 229BC, they managed to defeat the combined navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the Battle of Paxos. Another Illyrian ruler, Longarus of the Dardanian Kingdom, invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of DemetriusII shortly before his death in 229BC. Although his young son Philip immediately inherited the throne, his regent Antigonus III Doson (r.\u2009229\u00a0\u2013\u00a0221\u00a0BC), nephew of AntigonusII, was proclaimed king by the army, with Philip as his heir, following a string of military victories against the Illyrians in the north and the Aetolians in Thessaly.\nAratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229\u2013222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII's forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league in the same vein as PhilipII's League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power for the first time in its history, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor PhilipV.\nPhilip V of Macedon (r.\u2009221\u00a0\u2013\u00a0179\u00a0BC) faced immediate challenges to his authority by the Illyrian Dardani and Aetolian League. PhilipV and his allies were successful against the Aetolians and their allies in the Social War (220\u2013217 BC), yet he made peace with the Aetolians once he heard of incursions by the Dardani in the north and the Carthaginian victory over the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217BC. Demetrius of Pharos is alleged to have convinced PhilipV to first secure Illyria in advance of an invasion of the Italian peninsula. In 216BC, PhilipV sent a hundred light warships into the Adriatic Sea to attack Illyria, a move that prompted Scerdilaidas of the Ardiaean Kingdom to appeal to the Romans for aid. Rome responded by sending ten heavy quinqueremes from Roman Sicily to patrol the Illyrian coasts, causing PhilipV to reverse course and order his fleet to retreat, averting open conflict for the time being.\nConflict with Rome.\nIn 215 BC, at the height of the Second Punic War with the Carthaginian Empire, Roman authorities intercepted a ship off the Calabrian coast holding a Macedonian envoy and a Carthaginian ambassador in possession of a treaty composed by Hannibal declaring an alliance with PhilipV. The treaty stipulated that Carthage had the sole right to negotiate the terms of Rome's hypothetical surrender and promised mutual aid if a resurgent Rome should seek revenge against either Macedonia or Carthage. Although the Macedonians were perhaps only interested in safeguarding their newly conquered territories in Illyria, the Romans were nevertheless able to thwart whatever grand ambitions PhilipV had for the Adriatic region during the First Macedonian War (214\u2013205BC). In 214BC, Rome positioned a naval fleet at Oricus, which was assaulted along with Apollonia by Macedonian forces. When the Macedonians captured Lissus in 212BC, the Roman Senate responded by inciting the Aetolian League, Sparta, Elis, Messenia, and Attalus I (r.\u2009241\u00a0\u2013\u00a0197\u00a0BC) of Pergamon to wage war against PhilipV, keeping him occupied and away from Italy.\nThe Aetolian League concluded a peace agreement with PhilipV in 206BC, and the Roman Republic negotiated the Treaty of Phoenice in 205BC, ending the war and allowing the Macedonians to retain some captured settlements in Illyria. Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again, the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally Rhodes in 201BC. These states were concerned about PhilipV's alliance with Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, which invaded the war-weary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War (202\u2013195BC) as PhilipV captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea. Although Rome's envoys played a critical role in convincing Athens to join the anti-Macedonian alliance with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200BC, the \"comitia centuriata\" (people's assembly) rejected the Roman Senate's proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia. Meanwhile, PhilipV conquered territories in the Hellespont and Bosporus as well as Ptolemaic Samos, which led Rhodes to form an alliance with Pergamon, Byzantium, Cyzicus, and Chios against Macedonia. Despite PhilipV's nominal alliance with the Seleucid king, he lost the naval Battle of Chios in 201BC and was blockaded at Bargylia by the Rhodian and Pergamene navies.\nWhile Philip V was busy fighting Rome's Greek allies, Rome viewed this as an opportunity to punish this former ally of Hannibal with a war that they hoped would supply a victory and require few resources. The Roman Senate demanded that PhilipV cease hostilities against neighbouring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances. When the \"comitia centuriata\" finally voted in approval of the Roman Senate's declaration of war in 200BC and handed their ultimatum to PhilipV, demanding that a tribunal assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon, the Macedonian king rejected it. This marked the beginning of the Second Macedonian War (200\u2013197BC), with Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus spearheading military operations in Apollonia.\nThe Macedonians successfully defended their territory for roughly two years, but the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus managed to expel PhilipV from Macedonia in 198BC, forcing his men to take refuge in Thessaly. When the Achaean League switched their loyalties from Macedonia to Rome, the Macedonian king sued for peace, but the terms offered were considered too stringent, and so the war continued. In June 197BC, the Macedonians were defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae. Rome then ratified a treaty that forced Macedonia to relinquish control of much of its Greek possessions outside of Macedonia proper, if only to act as a buffer against Illyrian and Thracian incursions into Greece. Although some Greeks suspected Roman intentions of supplanting Macedonia as the new hegemonic power in Greece, Flaminius announced at the Isthmian Games of 196BC that Rome intended to preserve Greek liberty by leaving behind no garrisons and by not exacting tribute of any kind. His promise was delayed by negotiations with the Spartan king Nabis, who had meanwhile captured Argos, yet Roman forces evacuated Greece in 194BC.\nEncouraged by the Aetolian League and their calls to liberate Greece from the Romans, the Seleucid king AntiochusIII landed with his army at Demetrias, Thessaly, in 192BC, and was elected \"strategos\" by the Aetolians. Macedonia, the Achaean League, and other Greek city-states maintained their alliance with Rome. The Romans defeated the Seleucids in the 191BC Battle of Thermopylae as well as the Battle of Magnesia in 190BC, forcing the Seleucids to pay a war indemnity, dismantle most of its navy, and abandon its claims to any territories north or west of the Taurus Mountains in the 188BC Treaty of Apamea. With Rome's acceptance, PhilipV was able to capture some cities in central Greece in 191\u2013189BC that had been allied to AntiochusIII, while Rhodes and Eumenes II (r.\u2009197\u00a0\u2013\u00a0159\u00a0BC) of Pergamon gained territories in Asia Minor.\nFailing to please all sides in various territorial disputes, the Roman Senate decided in 184/183BC to force PhilipV to abandon Aenus and Maronea, since these had been declared free cities in the Treaty of Apamea. This assuaged the fear of EumenesII that Macedonia could pose a threat to his lands in the Hellespont. Perseus of Macedon (r.\u2009179\u00a0\u2013\u00a0168\u00a0BC) succeeded PhilipV and executed his brother Demetrius, who had been favoured by the Romans but was charged by Perseus with high treason. Perseus then attempted to form marriage alliances with Prusias II of Bithynia and Seleucus IV Philopator of the Seleucid Empire, along with renewed relations with Rhodes that greatly unsettled EumenesII. Although EumenesII attempted to undermine these diplomatic relationships, Perseus fostered an alliance with the Boeotian League, extended his authority into Illyria and Thrace, and in 174BC, won the role of managing the Temple of Apollo at Delphi as a member of the Amphictyonic Council.\nEumenes II came to Rome in 172 BC and delivered a speech to the Senate denouncing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Perseus. This convinced the Roman Senate to declare the Third Macedonian War (171\u2013168BC). Although Perseus's forces were victorious against the Romans at the Battle of Callinicus in 171BC, the Macedonian army was defeated at the Battle of Pydna in June 168BC. Perseus fled to Samothrace but surrendered shortly afterwards, was brought to Rome for the triumph of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, and was placed under house arrest at Alba Fucens, where he died in 166BC. The Romans abolished the Macedonian monarchy by installing four separate allied republics in its stead, their capitals located at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia. The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many social and economic interactions between the inhabitants of these republics, including the banning of marriages between them and the (temporary) prohibition on gold and silver mining. A certain Andriscus, claiming Antigonid descent, rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Juventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War (150\u2013148BC). Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose forces occupied the kingdom. This was followed in 146BC by the Roman destruction of Carthage and victory over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth, ushering in the era of Roman Greece and the gradual establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.\nInstitutions.\nDivision of power.\nAt the head of Macedonia's government was the king (\"basileus\"). From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (\"basilikoi paides\"), bodyguards (\"somatophylakes\"), companions (\"hetairoi\"), friends (\"philoi\"), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence is lacking regarding the extent to which each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.\nKingship and the royal court.\nThe earliest known government of ancient Macedonia was that of its monarchy, lasting until 167BC when it was abolished by the Romans. The Macedonian hereditary monarchy existed since at least the time of Archaic Greece, with Homeric aristocratic roots in Mycenaean Greece. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages, Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions, each having its own petty king, the tribes of Lower Macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over the lesser kings of Upper Macedonia. The direct line of father-to-son succession was broken after the assassination of Orestes of Macedon in 396BC (allegedly by his regent and successor Aeropus II of Macedon), clouding the issue of whether primogeniture was the established custom or if there was a constitutional right for an assembly of the army or of the people to choose another king. It is unclear if the male offspring of Macedonian queens or consorts were always preferred over others given the accession of Archelaus I of Macedon, son of Perdiccas II of Macedon and a slave woman, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father's designated heir apparent.\nIt is known that Macedonian kings before PhilipII upheld the privileges and carried out the responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, determining the kingdom's foreign policies, and negotiating alliances with foreign powers. After the Greek victory at Salamis in 480BC, the Persian commander Mardonius had Alexander I of Macedon sent to Athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the Achaemenid Empire and Athens. The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.\nLittle is known about the judicial system of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the chief judge of the kingdom. The Macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of the military. PhilipII was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the high priest of the nation. He performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals. Alexander imitated various aspects of his father's reign, such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers, but lost some core support among them for adopting some of the trappings of an Eastern, Persian monarch, a \"lord and master\" as Carol J. King suggests, instead of a \"comrade-in-arms\" as was the traditional relationship of Macedonian kings with their companions. Alexander's father, PhilipII, was perhaps influenced by Persian traditions when he adopted institutions similar to those found in the Achaemenid realm, such as having a royal secretary, royal archive, royal pages, and a seated throne.\nRoyal pages.\nThe royal pages were adolescent boys and young men conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during \"symposia\" (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period, it is known that some of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168BC.\nBodyguards.\nRoyal bodyguards served as the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the \"agema\" of the \"hypaspistai\", a type of ancient special forces usually numbering in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged. Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king's inner circle, were not always responsible for protecting the king's life on and off the battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.\nCompanions, friends, councils, and assemblies.\nThe companions, including the elite companion cavalry and \"pezhetairoi\" infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king. A small amount of evidence suggests the existence of an assembly of the army during times of war and a people's assembly during times of peace.\nMembers of the council had the right to speak freely, and although there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state, it is clear that the king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander the Great acted as prosecutor in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father's assassination plot (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.\nMagistrates, the commonwealth, local government, and allied states.\nAntigonid Macedonian kings relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, such as the military \"strategos\" and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (\"archon\") of a large city (\"polis\"), as well as the politico-religious office of the \"epistates\". No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic \"philoi\" and \"hetairoi\" who filled vacancies for army officers.\nIn ancient Athens, the Athenian democracy was restored on three separate occasions following the initial conquest of the city by Antipater in 322BC. When it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state. Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (\"boule\"), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (\"epistates\") to monitor the city's political affairs. Philippi, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (\"ecclesia\") of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods.\nWithin the Macedonian commonwealth, some evidence from the 3rd centuryBC indicates that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although individual Macedonian cities nominally participated in Panhellenic events as independent entities, in reality, the granting of \"asylia\" (inviolability, diplomatic immunity, and the right of asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities was handled directly by the king. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek \"koina\" (i.e., federations of city-states, the \"sympoliteia\") obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of \"proxenia\" (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. Abundant evidence exists for the granting of \"proxenia\" as being the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighbouring Epirote League, and some evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. City-states that were allied with Macedonia issued their own decrees regarding \"proxenia\". Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (\"prostates\") of the league.\nMilitary.\nEarly Macedonian army.\nThe basic structure of the Ancient Macedonian army was the division between the companion cavalry (\"hetairoi\") and the foot companions (\"pezhetairoi\"), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries. The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon. Macedonian cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War, at times siding with either Athens or Sparta. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen. As evidenced by early 4th century BC artwork, there was a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before PhilipII. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of PhilipII's reign in 359BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, yet Malcolm Errington cautions that these figures cited by ancient authors should be treated with some skepticism.\nPhilip II and Alexander the Great.\nAfter spending years as a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the \"embolon\" (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded \"peltai\" shields that replaced the earlier \"aspis\"-style shields, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either cuirasses breastplates or \"kotthybos\" stomach bands, and armed with \"sarissa\" pikes and daggers as secondary weapons. The elite \"hypaspistai\" infantry, composed of handpicked men from the ranks of the \"pezhetairoi\", were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (\"somatophylakes\").\nFor his lighter missile troops, Philip II employed mercenary Cretan archers as well as Thracian, Paeonian, and Illyrian javelin throwers, slingers, and archers. He hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery that fired large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues under PhilipII allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes.\nThe only Macedonian cavalry units attested under Alexander were the companion cavalry, yet he formed a \"hipparchia\" (i.e. unit of a few hundred horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians while campaigning in Asia. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 cavalrymen from Thessaly, 600 cavalrymen from the rest of Greece, and 900 \"prodromoi\" cavalry from Thrace. Antipater was able to quickly raise a force of 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the Lamian War when it began in 323BC. The most elite members of Alexander's \"hypaspistai\" were designated as the \"agema\", and a new term for \"hypaspistai\" emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331BC: the \"argyraspides\" (silver shields). The latter continued to serve after the reign of Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. Overall, his pike-wielding phalanx infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite \"hypaspistai\" and 9,000 of which were \"pezhetairoi\". Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers and introduced native Macedonian archers into the army. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace.\nAntigonid period military.\nThe Macedonian army continued to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty. It is uncertain how many men were appointed as \"somatophylakes\", which numbered eight men at the end of Alexander the Great's reign, while the \"hypaspistai\" seem to have morphed into assistants of the \"somatophylakes\". At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great's royal squadron of companion cavalry contained 800 men, the same number of cavalrymen in the sacred squadron (Latin: \"sacra ala\"; Greek: \"hiera ile\") commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219BC. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the sacred squadron and royal cavalry. While Macedonian cavalry of the 4th century BC had fought without shields, the use of shields by cavalry was adopted from the Celtic invaders of the 270s BC who settled in Galatia, central Anatolia.\nThanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181BC, respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under PhilipV. From at least the time of Antigonus III Doson, the most elite Antigonid-period infantry were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding \"peltai\" javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected to serve in the elite \"agema\" vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men. They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into \"chalkaspides\" (bronze shield) and \"leukaspides\" (white shield) regiments.\nThe Antigonid Macedonian kings continued to expand and equip the navy. Cassander maintained a small fleet at Pydna, Demetrius I of Macedon had one at Pella, and Antigonus II Gonatas, while serving as a general for Demetrius in Greece, used the navy to secure the Macedonian holdings in Demetrias, Chalkis, Piraeus, and Corinth. The navy was considerably expanded during the Chremonidean War (267\u2013261BC), allowing the Macedonian navy to defeat the Ptolemaic Egyptian navy at the 255BC Battle of Cos and 245BC Battle of Andros, and enabling Macedonian influence to spread over the Cyclades. AntigonusIII Doson used the Macedonian navy to invade Caria, while PhilipV sent 200 ships to fight in the Battle of Chios in 201BC. The Macedonian navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in the 197BC peace treaty that concluded the Second Macedonian War with the Roman Republic, although Perseus of Macedon quickly assembled some \"lemboi\" at the outbreak of the Third Macedonian War in 171BC.\nSociety and culture.\nLanguage and dialects.\nFollowing its adoption as the court language of Philip II of Macedon's regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in Koine Greek, the \"lingua franca\" of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of Greek similar to Thessalian Greek and Northwestern Greek, or a language closely related to Greek. The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) Greek was the preferred language of the Ancient Macedonian army, although it is known that Alexander the Great once shouted an emergency order in Macedonian to his royal guards during the drinking party where he killed Cleitus the Black. Macedonian became extinct in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period, and entirely replaced by Koine Greek.\nReligious beliefs and funerary practices.\nBy the 5th century BC, the Macedonians and the southern Greeks worshiped more or less the same deities of the Greek pantheon. In Macedonia, political and religious offices were often intertwined. For instance, the head of state for the city of Amphipolis also served as the priest of Asklepios, Greek god of medicine; a similar arrangement existed at Cassandreia, where a cult priest honoring the city's founder Cassander was the nominal head of the city. The main sanctuary of Zeus was maintained at Dion, while another at Veria was dedicated to Herakles and was patronized by Demetrius II Aetolicus (r.\u2009239\u00a0\u2013\u00a0229\u00a0BC). Meanwhile, foreign cults from Egypt were fostered by the royal court, such as the temple of Sarapis at Thessaloniki. The Macedonians also had relations with \"international\" cults; for example, Macedonian kings Philip III of Macedon and Alexander IV of Macedon made votive offerings to the internationally esteemed Samothrace temple complex of the Cabeiri mystery cult.\nIn the three royal tombs at Vergina, professional painters decorated the walls with a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes, while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about the identity of the tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977\u20131978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded that at least one of the persons buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the above-ground ruins of a \"heroon\", a shrine for cult worship of the dead. In 2014, the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece (as of 2017).\nEconomics and social class.\nYoung Macedonian men were typically expected to engage in hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their transhumance lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, land reclamation, and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centres and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle during the course of the 5thcenturyBC.\nThe Macedonian king was an autocratic figure at the head of both government and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, but he was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his \"hetairoi\", the core of the Macedonian aristocracy. These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege, filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Great's empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy, Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.\nVisual arts.\nBy the reign of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was importing customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.\nSurviving Macedonian painted artwork includes frescoes and murals, but also decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colours still exist on the bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.\nTheatre, music and performing arts.\nPhilip II was assassinated in 336 BC at the theatre of Aigai, amid games and spectacles celebrating the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra. Alexander the Great was allegedly a great admirer of both theatre and music. He was especially fond of the plays by Classical Athenian tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, whose works formed part of a proper Greek education for his new eastern subjects alongside studies in the Greek language, including the epics of Homer. While he and his army were stationed at Tyre (in modern-day Lebanon), Alexander had his generals act as judges not only for athletic contests but also for stage performances of Greek tragedies. The contemporaneous famous actors Thessalus and Athenodorus performed at the event.\nMusic was also appreciated in Macedonia. In addition to the agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, one of the main markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also for cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.\nLiterature, education, philosophy, and patronage.\nPerdiccas II of Macedon was able to host well-known Classical Greek intellectual visitors at his royal court, such as the lyric poet Melanippides and the renowned medical doctor Hippocrates, and Pindar's \"enkomion\" written for Alexander I of Macedon may have been composed at his court. ArchelausI received many more Greek scholars, artists, and celebrities at his court than his predecessors. His honored guests included the painter Zeuxis, the architect Callimachus, the poets Choerilus of Samos, Timotheus of Miletus, and Agathon, as well as the famous Athenian playwright Euripides. The philosopher Aristotle, who studied at the Platonic Academy of Athens and established the Aristotelian school of thought, moved to Macedonia, and is said to have tutored the young Alexander the Great, as well as serving as an esteemed diplomat for PhilipII. Among Alexander's retinue of artists, writers, and philosophers was Pyrrho of Elis, founder of Pyrrhonism, the school of philosophical skepticism. During the Antigonid period, Antigonos Gonatas fostered cordial relationships with Menedemos of Eretria, founder of the Eretrian school of philosophy, and Zenon, the founder of Stoicism.\nIn terms of early Greek historiography and later Roman historiography, Felix Jacoby identified thirteen possible ancient historians who wrote about Macedonia in his \"Fragmente der griechischen Historiker\". Aside from accounts in Herodotus and Thucydides, the works compiled by Jacoby are only fragmentary, whereas other works are completely lost, such as the history of an Illyrian war fought by Perdiccas III written by Antipater. The Macedonian historians Marsyas of Pella and Marsyas of Philippi wrote histories of Macedonia, the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy I Soter authored a history about Alexander, and Hieronymus of Cardia wrote a history about Alexander's royal successors. Following the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian military officer Nearchus wrote a work of his voyage from the mouth of the Indus river to the Persian Gulf. The Macedonian historian Craterus published a compilation of decrees made by the popular assembly of the Athenian democracy, ostensibly while attending the school of Aristotle. Philip V of Macedon had manuscripts of the history of PhilipII written by Theopompus gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies.\nSports and leisure.\nWhen Alexander I of Macedon petitioned to compete in the foot race of the ancient Olympic Games, the event organizers at first denied his request, explaining that only Greeks were allowed to compete. However, AlexanderI produced proof of an Argead royal genealogy showing ancient Argive Temenid lineage, a move that ultimately convinced the Olympic \"Hellanodikai\" authorities of his Greek descent and ability to compete. By the end of the 5thcenturyBC, the Macedonian king ArchelausI was crowned with the olive wreath at both Olympia and Delphi (in the Pythian Games) for winning chariot racing contests. PhilipII allegedly heard of the Olympic victory of his horse (in either an individual horse race or chariot race) on the same day his son Alexander the Great was born, on either 19 or 20July 356BC. Non-royal Macedonians also competed in and won various Olympic contests by the 4th century BC. In addition to literary contests, Alexander the Great staged competitions for music and athletics across his empire.\nDining and cuisine.\nAncient Macedonia produced only a few fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, although there was no notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into the dessert course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced \"mattye\" to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.\nThe \"symposium\" in the Macedonian and wider Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class, an occasion for feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes philosophical discussion. The \"hetairoi\", leading members of the Macedonian aristocracy, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat as well as for sport.\nEthnic identity.\nAncient authors and modern scholars alike disagree about the precise ethnic identity of the ancient Macedonians. The predominant viewpoint supports that the Macedonians were \"truly Greeks\" who had just retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern parts of Greece. Ernst Badian notes however that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived at the time of the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and the other Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected \"hegemon\" PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself); N. G. L. Hammond asserts that ancient views differentiating Macedonia's ethnic identity from the rest of the Greek-speaking world should be seen as an expression of conflict between two different political systems: the democratic system of the city-states (e.g. Athens) versus the monarchy (Macedonia). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.\nAnson argues that some Hellenic authors expressed complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous ideas about the exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Simon Hornblower argues on the Greek identity of the Macedonians, taking into consideration their origin, language, cults and customs related to ancient Greek traditions. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).\nTechnology and engineering.\nArchitecture.\nMacedonian architecture, although utilizing a mixture of different forms and styles from the rest of Greece, did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient Greek architecture. Among the classical orders, Macedonian architects favoured the Ionic order, especially in the peristyle courtyards of private homes. There are several surviving examples, albeit in ruins, of Macedonian palatial architecture, including a palace at the site of the capital Pella, the summer residence of Vergina near the old capital Aigai, and the royal residence at Demetrias near modern Volos. At Vergina, the ruins of three large banquet halls with marble-tiled floors (covered in the debris of roof tiles) with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16.7 x 17.6\u00a0m (54.8 x 57.7\u00a0ft) demonstrate perhaps the earliest examples of monumental triangular roof trusses, if dated before the reign of Antigonus II Gonatas or even the onset of the Hellenistic period. Later Macedonian architecture also featured arches and vaults. The palaces of both Vergina and Demetrias had walls made of sundried bricks, while the latter palace had four corner towers around a central courtyard in the manner of a fortified residence fit for a king or at least a military governor.\nMacedonian rulers also sponsored works of architecture outside of Macedonia proper. For instance, following his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), PhilipII raised a round memorial building at Olympia known as the Philippeion, decorated inside with statues depicting him, his parents Amyntas III of Macedon and Eurydice I of Macedon, his wife Olympias, and his son Alexander the Great.\nThe ruins of roughly twenty Greek theatres survive in the present-day regions of Macedonia and Thrace in Greece: sixteen open-air theatres, three odea, and a possible theatre in Veria undergoing excavation.\nMilitary technology and engineering.\nBy the Hellenistic period, it became common for Greek states to finance the development and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion siege engines, naval ships, and standardized designs for arms and armor. Under PhilipII and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to siege artillery such as bolt-shooting ballistae and siege engines such as huge rolling siege towers. E.W.Marsden and M.Y.Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his successor Demetrius I of Macedon had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world at the end of the 4thcenturyBC. The siege of Salamis, Cyprus, in 306BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of West Asia. The siege tower commissioned by DemetriusI for the Macedonian Siege of Rhodes (305\u2013304 BC) and defended by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories. It had a base of , eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.\nDuring the siege of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they went back and forth from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the centre for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.\nOther innovations.\nAlthough perhaps not as prolific as other areas of Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotary-operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia. Mould-pressed glass first appeared in Macedonia in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and Rhodes and date to the second half of the 4thcenturyBC. Greek technical and scientific literature began with Classical Athens in the 5thcenturyBC, while the major production centres for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were Alexandria, Rhodes, and Pergamon.\nCurrency, finances, and resources.\nThe minting of silver coinage began during the reign of AlexanderI as a means to pay for royal expenditures. ArchelausI increased the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce. The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of PhilipII and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Attalid kingdom exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies. By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon produced standard coins. The right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments, i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth. The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation.\nState revenues were also raised by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on imports and exports at harbors. Some mines, groves, agricultural lands, and forests belonging to the Macedonian state were exploited by the Macedonian king, although these were often leased as assets or given as grants to members of the nobility such as the \"hetairoi\" and \"philoi\". Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports existed from at least the reign of AmyntasIII, and Callistratus of Aphidnae (d.c.350BC) aided PerdiccasIII in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.\nAfter the defeat of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly established autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.\nLegacy.\nThe reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great witnessed the demise of Classical Greece and the birth of Hellenistic civilization, following the spread of Greek culture to the Near East during and after Alexander's conquests. Macedonians then migrated to Egypt and parts of Asia, but the intensive colonization of foreign lands sapped the available manpower in Macedonia proper, weakening the kingdom in its fight with other Hellenistic powers and contributing to its downfall and conquest by the Romans. However, the diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexander's conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a \"precondition\" for the later Roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the Byzantine Empire, according to Errington.\nThe ethnic Macedonian rulers of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid successor states accepted men from all over the Greek world as their \"hetairoi\" companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids. Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions. While Spartan society remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship, the cosmopolitan Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and Macedonian colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.\nThe deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps began with the death of PhilipII, but it was his son Alexander the Great who unambiguously claimed to be a living god. Following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon\u2014the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Amun-Ra\u2014at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332BC to confirm his divine status. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian priesthoods and deities, strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world, while beliefs in the Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nOnline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrint.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The decree exhorts Eastern Catholics to \"take steps to return to their ancestral traditions.\" This aspect of the decree was directed against Latinisation.\nThe document specifies some of the autonomous powers of the Eastern Churches. In particular, the Patriarch (or where applicable, major archbishop) and synod have the power to establish eparchies, to nominate bishops within their patriarchate, to legislate the rights and obligations of the minor orders (including subdiaconate), and to determine the date for celebrating Easter within their rite. It furthermore recognized the ancient practice in the East regarding the sacrament of confirmation (Chrismation), stating that all Eastern priests have the power to administer this sacrament using chrism blessed by a bishop. One of the implications of this is the further practice of infant communion was formally recognized.\nContents.\nThere are 30 articles, divided into 6 chapters, plus a preamble and a conclusion.\nThe Preamble affirms the Church's respect for Eastern Catholics (\u00a71):\nThe Catholic Church holds in high esteem the institutions, liturgical rites, ecclesiastical traditions and the established standards of the Christian life of the Eastern Churches, for in them, distinguished as they are for their venerable antiquity, there remains conspicuous the tradition that has been handed down from the Apostles through the Fathers and that forms part of the divinely revealed and undivided heritage of the universal Church. \nThe Individual Churches or Rites\n- \u201cEach individual Church or Rite should retain its traditions whole and entire\u201d but \u201cshould adapt its way of life to the different needs of time and place\u201d (\u00a72)\n- The individual Churches, whether Eastern or Western, are of equal dignity (\u00a73)\n- Every Catholic must retain his own rite, cherish and protect it (\u00a74)\nPreservation of the Spiritual Heritage of the Eastern Churches\n- \u201cThe Churches of the East, as much as those of the West, have a full right and are in duty bound to rule themselves, each in accordance with its own established disciplines\u201d (\u00a75)\n- All Eastern Churches may preserve their liturgical traditions and way of life, and if history has imposed changes on them, \u201cthey should take steps to return to their ancestral traditions\u201d (\u00a76)\nEastern Rite Patriarchs\n- \u201cThe patriarchate, as an institution, has existed in the Church from the earliest times\u201d (\u00a77)\n- All patriarchs are of equal dignity (\u00a78)\n- The rights and privileges of patriarchs \u201cshould be re-established in accordance with the ancient tradition of each of the Churches and the decrees of the ecumenical councils\u201d (\u00a79)\n- \u201cThe patriarchs with their synods are the highest authority for all business of the patriarchate\u201d, subject to the Pope's right to intervene in individual cases (\u00a79)\n- New patriarchates should be established where there is a need (\u00a711)\nThe discipline of the Sacraments (\u00a712-18) is concerned with the regulation of the sacraments. An important issue is the right of priests of one rite to administer sacraments to faithful of another rite. It also recommends that the diaconate be restored as a permanent ministry.\nDivine Worship (\u00a719-23) deals with the regulation of such liturgical matters as feast days (including Easter), the Divine Office and the languages to be used in the liturgy. \nRelations with the Brethren of the Separated Churches\n- Eastern Catholics have a special duty to promote Christian unity, especially with the Eastern Orthodox (\u00a724)\n- If a member of an Eastern Orthodox Church becomes Catholic, \u201cno more should be required of him than what a bare profession of the Catholic faith demands\u201d. An Orthodox priest or bishop is permitted to act as a priest or bishop upon joining the Catholic Church (\u00a725)\n- A member of an Eastern Orthodox Church, if he asks of his own accord, may receive the sacraments of Penance, Eucharist and Anointing of the sick from an Eastern Catholic priest. And an Eastern Catholic, if no Catholic priest is available, may receive these sacraments from an Eastern Orthodox priest. Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox may take part in each other's liturgical services (\u00a726-29)\nThe Conclusion (\u00a730) asks all Christians, Eastern and Western, to pray for the reunion of Christians, and also to pray for those Christians suffering for their faith in Christ (a reference to Christians in communist countries). \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most known radioisotopes are synthetically made; only 84 out of over 3,000 radioisotopes are found in nature.\nThe first synthetic radioisotope was phosphorus-30, which was produced in 1934 by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie using aluminum foil and a polonium source . The two won the 1935 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery. The discovery of artificial radioactivity enabled the development of nuclear weapons based on plutonium-239, including the Fat Man atomic bomb.\nIn the modern day, synthetic radioisotopes have many other applications. They are used in medical imaging (such as technetium-99m), radiotherapy, nuclear energy sources (plutonium-239), and ionization-type smoke detectors (americium-241). These synthetic radioisotopes are manufactured in nuclear reactors using neutron irradiation, and in particle accelerators using charged particles.\nProduction.\nSome synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent nuclear reactor fuel rods, which contain various fission products. For example, it is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 terabecquerels (78 metric tons) of technetium were produced in nuclear reactors; as such, anthropogenic technetium is far more abundant than technetium from natural radioactivity.\nSome synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed. Other isotopes are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor (for example, technetium-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of ruthenium-96) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator.\nMany isotopes, including radiopharmaceuticals, are produced in cyclotrons. For example, the synthetic fluorine-18 and oxygen-15 are widely used in positron emission tomography.\nUses.\nMost synthetic radioisotopes have a short half-life. Though a health hazard, radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses.\nNuclear medicine.\nThe field of nuclear medicine covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment.\nDiagnosis.\nRadioactive tracer compounds, radiopharmaceuticals, are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied. That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope, usually one which emits a gamma ray which is energetic enough to travel through the body and be captured outside by a gamma camera to map the concentrations. Gamma cameras and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.\nThe metastable nuclear isomer technetium-99m is a gamma-ray emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours, but can be easily made in the hospital using a technetium-99m generator. Weekly global demand for the parent isotope molybdenum-99 was in 2010, overwhelmingly provided by fission of uranium-235.\nTreatment.\nSeveral radioisotopes and compounds are used for medical treatment, usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ. For example, iodine-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the thyroid gland.\nIndustrial radiation sources.\nAlpha particle, beta particle, and gamma ray radioactive emissions are industrially useful. Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes. Areas of use include the petroleum industry, industrial radiography, homeland security, process control, food irradiation and underground detection.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trace radioisotopes are therefore present only because they are continually produced on Earth by natural processes. Natural processes which produce trace radioisotopes include cosmic ray bombardment of stable nuclides, ordinary alpha and beta decay of the long-lived heavy nuclides, thorium-232, uranium-238, and uranium-235, spontaneous fission of uranium-238, and nuclear transmutation reactions induced by natural radioactivity, such as the production of plutonium-239 and uranium-236 from neutron capture by natural uranium.\nElements.\nThe elements that occur on Earth only in traces are listed below. \nIsotopes of other elements (not exhaustive):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king. He was concurrently duke and prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the first monarch of the House of Hanover who was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover.\nGeorge was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King George II, as the first son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Following his father's death in 1751, Prince George became heir apparent and Prince of Wales. He succeeded to the throne on George II's death in 1760. The following year, he married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with whom he had 15 children. George III's life and reign were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, Britain lost 13 of its North American colonies in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In 1807, the transatlantic slave trade was banned from the British Empire.\nIn the later part of his life, George had recurrent and eventually permanent mental illness. The exact nature of George's illness is not known definitively, but historians and medical experts have suggested that his symptoms and behaviour traits were consistent with either bipolar disorder or porphyria. In 1810, George suffered a final relapse, and his eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year. The King died aged 81, at which time the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the and longest-reigning male monarch in British history.\nEarly life.\nGeorge was born at Norfolk House in St James's Square, London, on 4 June 1738. He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As he was born two months prematurely, and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford. One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy), and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy).\nGeorge grew into a healthy, reserved and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Edward (later Duke of York and Albany) were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically.\nApart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At the age of 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play \"Cato\" and said in the new prologue: \"What, tho' a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in \"England\" born, in England bred.\" Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear \"to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated\".\nKing George II disliked Prince Frederick and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751, Frederick died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and his son George became heir apparent to the throne and inherited his father's title of Duke of Edinburgh. The King now took more interest in his grandson and created him Prince of Wales three weeks later.\nIn the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at St James's Palace, but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, who later served as prime minister. George's mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.\nAccession and marriage.\nIn 1759, George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. \"I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,\" he wrote, \"and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.\" Nevertheless, George and his mother resisted attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\nThe following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather George II died suddenly on 25 October 1760, at age 76. The search for a suitable wife intensified: after giving consideration to a number of Protestant German princesses, George's mother sent Colonel David Graeme with, on her son's behalf, an offer of marriage to Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Charlotte accepted. While a royal household and staff were assembled for Charlotte in London, Lord Harcourt, the royal Master of the Horse, escorted her from Neustrelitz to London. Charlotte arrived in the afternoon of 8 September 1761 and the marriage ceremony was conducted that same evening in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. George and Charlotte's coronation was held at Westminster Abbey a fortnight later on 22 September. George never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a happy marriage until his mental illness struck.\nThe King and Queen had 15 children\u2014nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace) for use as a family retreat. His other residences were Kew Palace and Windsor Castle. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth, Dorset, which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.\nEarly reign.\nEarly regnal years.\nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain. During George III's lengthy reign, Britain was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by his ministerial government and prominent men in Parliament. Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. George came to be perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.\nOn his accession, the Crown lands produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the Crown Estate to Parliamentary control in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government. Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who say such claims \"rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition\". Debts amounting to over \u00a33\u00a0million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time. He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds, and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity. Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer's \"Lady at the Virginals\" and a set of Canalettos, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered. The King's Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.\nLegislation and politics.\nIn May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was replaced with one led by Lord Bute, a Scottish Tory. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish sentiment amongst the English. John Wilkes, a member of parliament, published \"The North Briton\", which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons and found guilty \"in absentia\" of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power. Britain received enormous concessions, including West Florida. Britain restored to France lucrative slave-sugar islands in the West Indies, including Guadeloupe and Martinique. The treaty also ended French control over nearly all of New France; Canada was ceded to Britain in its entirety, while Louisiana was divided in two, with the eastern half (from the Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi River) ceded to Britain and the western half, plus the city of New Orleans, ceded to Spain.\nLater that year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 placed a limit upon the westward expansion of the American colonies and created an Indian reserve. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida), and protect the British fur trade with the Indians. The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority. This discontent ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions.\nThe central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to \"no taxation without representation\". In 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax.\nMeanwhile, George had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of prime minister. After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.\nLord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act. Rockingham's government was weak, and he was replaced as prime minister in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, took over the government. Grafton did not formally become prime minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. He was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.\nFamily issues.\nGeorge was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer. The following year, Henry married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession.\nGeorge insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the royal family from legally marrying without the consent of the sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterwards, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.\nIncreasing issues in America.\nLord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was \"one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]\". In 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea was thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was \"certainly criminal\".\nWith the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's \"hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.\" Though both the Americans and older British historians characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers.\nAmerican War of Independence.\nThe American War of Independence was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution. Armed conflict began between British regulars and colonial militiamen at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The Second Continental Congress sent petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament, but the King and Parliament ignored them. George declared the American leaders to be traitors and a year of fighting ensued. Thomas Paine's book \"Common Sense\" referred to George III as \"the Royal Brute of Great Britain\".\nThe colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing twenty-seven grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the declaration charged, \"He has abdicated Government here\u00a0... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\" The gilded equestrian statue of the King in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776 but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne following the battles of Saratoga.\nPrime Minister Lord North was not an ideal war leader, but George III managed to give Parliament a sense of purpose to fight, and North was able to keep his cabinet together. North's cabinet ministers John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Lord George Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, proved to lack leadership skills suited for their positions.\nGeorge III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the rebels, despite the opinions of his own ministers. In the words of British historian George Otto Trevelyan, the King was determined \"never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.\" He wanted to \"keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse\". Later historians defend George by saying that, in the context of the times, no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporaneous monarchs in Europe. After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and political opponents, though vocal, remained a small minority.\nWith the setbacks in America, Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in North's administration, but Chatham refused; he died later in the same year. North was allied to the \"King's Friends\" in Parliament and believed that George III had the right to exercise powers. In early 1778, Louis XVI of France (Britain's chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States. The French Navy outran the British naval blockade of the Mediterranean and sailed to America. The conflict now affected America, Europe, and India. Charles III of Spain had misgivings because of his own colonies but decided to side with France in the war in limited fashion in 1779. One faction of the Dutch Republic aided the Americans, whereas another aided Britain, whose allies included Loyalists and German auxiliaries. Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence.\nDuring the summer of 1779, a combined French\u2013Spanish naval fleet threatened to invade England and transport 31,000 French troops across the English Channel. George III said that Britain was confronted by the \"most serious crisis the nation ever knew\". In August, 66 warships entered the English Channel, but sickness, hunger, and adverse winds forced the French\u2013Spanish armada to withdraw, ending the invasion threat.\nIn late 1779, George III advocated sending more British warships and troops across the Atlantic to the West Indies. He boldly said: \"We must risk something, otherwise we will only vegetate in this war. I own I wish either with spirit to get through it, or with a crash be ruined.\" In January 1780, 7,000 British troops under General Sir John Vaughan were transported to the West Indies. Nonetheless, opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon riots.\nAs late as the siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the siege of Yorktown reached London; North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. George drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered. He finally accepted the defeat in America and authorized peace negotiations. Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaties of Paris signed in 1782 and 1783. In early 1783, George III privately conceded \"America is lost!\" He reflected that the Northern colonies had developed into Britain's \"successful rivals\" in commercial trade and fishing. Up to 70,000 Loyalists fled to Canada (where they became known as the United Empire Loyalists), the Caribbean, or England after their homes and businesses were looted and destroyed by pro-revolutionary Americans.\nJohn Adams was appointed American minister to London in 1785, by which time George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, \"I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.\"\nMid-reign.\nGovernment.\nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became prime minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox\u2013North Coalition. Portland became prime minister, with Fox and Lord North, as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively.\nThe King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character: he thought Fox unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales. George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the East India Company to Parliamentary commissioners. Although George actually favoured greater control over the company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox. Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised Lord Temple to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and William Pitt the Younger was appointed prime minister, with Temple as his secretary of state. On 17 December 1783, the Commons voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a \"high crime\" and Temple was forced to resign. Temple's departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate.\nPitt's appointment was a great victory for George. It proved that the King could appoint prime ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy, in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.\nIllness.\nBy this time, George's health was deteriorating. He suffered from a mental illness characterised by acute mania. Until the mid-20th century, the King's illness was generally considered to be psychological. In 1966, a study by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter suggested that the illness was physiological, caused by the blood disease porphyria. Although meeting with some contemporary opposition, the view subsequently gained widespread scholarly acceptance. A study of samples of George's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a cause of metabolic blood disorders and thus a possible trigger for porphyria. The source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. The theory was also established in the public mind through influential dramatisations, such as Alan Bennett's play \"The Madness of George III\", and in Nicholas Hytner's subsequent film. From 2010, this view has been increasingly challenged, and Macalpine and Hunter's study criticised. Recent scholarship discounts the porphyria theory and contends that George's illness was psychiatric, most probably bipolar disorder.\nGeorge may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, and a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate and in August visited the Bishop of Worcester at Hartlebury Castle and Viscount Mount Edgcumbe at Cotehele, Cornwall, with the Queen, and their daughters the Princess Royal and Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth. It was the furthest he had ever been from London, but his condition worsened. In November of that year, he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and his voice to become hoarse. George would frequently repeat himself and write sentences with over 400 words at a time, and his vocabulary became \"more complex, creative and colourful\", possible symptoms of bipolar disorder. His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he had shaken hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards; George's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out \"evil humours\".\nIn the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for the Prince of Wales to act as regent, Fox suggested, to Pitt's consternation, that it was the Prince's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George recovered.\nHe would suffer brief temporary relapses in 1801 and 1804, followed by permanent illness from 1810 onward.\nLater reign.\nWar in Europe.\nAfter George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot George in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.\nThe French Revolution of 1789, in which the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in response to the crisis, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of \"habeas corpus\". Pitt prosecuted British radicals for treason in 1794, and in October 1795, crowds attacked George's carriage on his way to opening Parliament, demanding an end to the war and lower bread prices. In response, Parliament passed the Treason and Seditious Meetings Acts a month later. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.\nA brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. George used the opportunity to abandon the title \"King of France\", which English and British sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. It was suggested that George adopt the title \"Emperor of the British Isles\", but he refused. As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. At about the same time, George had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.\nGeorge did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an \"experiment\". The war resumed in 1803, but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. \"The Times\" said: \"The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression.\" A courtier wrote on 13 November that \"The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning.\" George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, \"We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion\u00a0... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them.\" After Admiral Lord Nelson's famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, the possibility of invasion was extinguished.\nIn 1804, George's recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George refused. Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry. Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health, and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Grenville became prime minister, and his \"Ministry of All the Talents\" included Fox. Grenville pushed through the Slave Trade Act 1807, which passed both houses of Parliament with large majorities. George was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the armed forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland, as the nominal prime minister, with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spencer Perceval. Parliament was dissolved, and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little real significance.\nFinal years and death.\nIn late 1810, at the height of his popularity, King George, already virtually blind with cataracts and in pain from rheumatism, suffered a relapse into his mental disorder and became dangerously ill. In his view, the malady had been triggered by stress over the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, Princess Amelia. The princess's nurse reported that \"the scenes of distress and crying every day... were melancholy beyond description.\" George accepted the need for the Regency Act 1811, and the Prince of Wales (later George IV) acted as regent for the remainder of the King's life. Despite signs of a recovery in May 1811, by the end of the year, George III had become permanently insane, and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death.\nPrime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated in 1812 and was replaced by Lord Liverpool. Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent Congress of Vienna led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was elevated from an electorate to a kingdom. Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable of knowing or understanding that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk.\nHe died of pneumonia at Windsor Castle at 8:38\u00a0pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. His favourite son, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, was with him. George III lay in state for two days, and his funeral and interment took place on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\nSlavery.\nOver the course of George's reign, a coalition of abolitionists and Atlantic slave uprisings caused the British public to spurn slavery. According to the historian Andrew Roberts, \"George never bought or sold a slave in his life. He never invested in any of the companies that did such a thing. He signed legislation to abolish slavery.\" George wrote a document in the 1750s \"denouncing all of the arguments for slavery, and calling them an execration and ridiculous and 'absurd'\", but the King and his son, the Duke of Clarence, supported the efforts of the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants to delay the abolition of the British slave trade for almost 20 years. William Pitt the Younger conversely wished to see slavery abolished but, because the cabinet was divided and the King was in the pro-slavery camp, Pitt decided to refrain from making abolition official government policy. Instead, he worked toward abolition in an individual capacity.\nOn 7 November 1775, during the American War of Independence, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, issued a proclamation that offered freedom to the slaves of rebel masters if they enlisted to put down the colonial rebellion. Dunmore was the last Royal Governor of Virginia, appointed by King George III in July 1771. Dunmore's Proclamation inspired slaves to escape from captivity and fight for the British. On 30 June 1779, George III's Commanding General Henry Clinton broadened Dunmore's proclamation with his Philipsburg Proclamation. For all colonial slaves who fled their rebel masters, Clinton forbade their recapture and resale, giving them protection by the British military. Approximately 20,000 freed slaves joined the British, fighting for George III. In 1783, given British certificates of freedom, 3,000 former slaves, including their families, settled in Nova Scotia.\nBetween 1791 and 1800, almost 400,000 Africans were shipped to the Americas by 1,340 slaving voyages mounted from British ports. On 25 March 1807, George III signed into law \"An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade\", under which the transatlantic slave trade was banned in the British Empire.\nLegacy.\nGeorge was succeeded by two of his sons, George IV and William IV in turn, who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to Victoria, the only legitimate child of his fourth son Prince Edward.\nGeorge III lived for 81 years and 239 days, and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors and reigned longer.\nGeorge III was dubbed \"Farmer George\" by satirists, at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to portray him as a man of the people, contrasting his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity. Under George III, the British Agricultural Revolution reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent Industrial Revolution. George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now owned by King's College London but housed in the Science Museum, London, to which it has been on long-term loan since 1927. He had the King's Observatory built in Richmond-upon-Thames for his own observations of the 1769 transit of Venus. When William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, he at first named it \"Georgium Sidus\" (George's Star) after the King, who later funded the construction and maintenance of Herschel's 1785 40-foot telescope, which at the time was the biggest ever built.\nGeorge III hoped that \"the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve\" but, in the popular mind, George III has been both demonised and praised. While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists. The grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" that he had committed to establish an \"absolute Tyranny\" over the colonies. The declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. Contemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating \"attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power\", while the other \"derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition\".\nBuilding on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was \"much maligned\", started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: \"Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence\u00a0... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors\u00a0... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.\" In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III, the monarchy continued to lose its political power and grew as the embodiment of national morality.\nTitles, styles, honours and arms.\nTitles and styles.\nIn Great Britain, George III used the official style \"George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and so forth\". In 1801, when Great Britain united with Ireland, he dropped the title of King of France, which had been used for every English monarch since Edward III's claim to the French throne in the medieval period. His style became \"George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.\"\nIn Germany, he was \"Duke of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg, Arch-Treasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire\" (\"Herzog von Braunschweig und L\u00fcneburg, Erzschatzmeister und Kurf\u00fcrst des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reiches\") until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as duke until the Congress of Vienna declared him \"King of Hanover\" in 1814.\nArms.\nBefore his succession, George was granted the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, and along with the dukedom of Edinburgh and the position of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on the arms of the heir, only on the Sovereign's.\nFrom his succession until 1800, George bore the royal arms: Quarterly, I Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); IV tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for L\u00fcneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Saxony), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).\nFollowing the Acts of Union 1800, the royal arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet. In 1816, after the Electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42030", "revid": "7098284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42030", "title": "Laudanum", "text": "Tincture of opium\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox drug/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLaudanum is a tincture of opium containing approximately 10% powdered opium by weight (the equivalent of 1% morphine). Laudanum is prepared by dissolving extracts from the opium poppy (\"Papaver somniferum\") in alcohol (ethanol).\nReddish-brown in color and extremely bitter, laudanum contains several opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. Laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of conditions, but its principal use was as a pain medication and cough suppressant. Until the early 20th century, laudanum was sold without a prescription and was a constituent of many patent medicines. Laudanum has since been recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled throughout most of the world. The United States Controlled Substances Act, for example, lists it on Schedule II, the second strictest category.\nLaudanum is known as a \"whole opium\" preparation since it historically contained all the alkaloids found in the opium poppy, which are extracted from the dried latex of ripe seed pods (\"Papaver somniferum L., succus siccus\"). However, the modern drug is often processed to remove all or most of the noscapine (also called \"narcotine\") present as this is a strong emetic and does not add appreciably to the analgesic or antipropulsive properties of opium; the resulting solution is called Denarcotized Tincture of Opium or Deodorized Tincture of Opium (DTO).\nLaudanum remains available by prescription in the United States (under the generic name \"opium tincture\") and in the European Union and United Kingdom (under the trade name Dropizol), although the drug's therapeutic indication is generally limited to controlling diarrhea when other medications have failed.\nThe terms \"laudanum\" and \"tincture of opium\" are generally interchangeable, but in contemporary medical practice, the latter is used almost exclusively.\nHistory.\nParacelsus' laudanum.\nParacelsus, a 16th-century Swiss alchemist, experimented with various opium concoctions, and recommended opium for reducing pain. One of his preparations, a pill which he extolled as his \"archanum\" or \"laudanum\", may have contained opium. Paracelsus's laudanum was strikingly different from the standard laudanum of the 17th century and beyond, containing crushed pearls, musk, amber, and other substances.\nBritish laudanum.\nOne researcher has documented that \"Laudanum, as listed in the \"London Pharmacopoeia\" (1618), was a pill made from opium, saffron, castor, ambergris, musk and nutmeg\".\nSydenham's laudanum.\nIn the 1660s English physician Thomas Sydenham (1624\u20131689) popularized a proprietary opium tincture that he also named laudanum, although it differed substantially from the laudanum of Paracelsus. In 1676 Sydenham published a seminal work, \"Medical Observations Concerning the History and Cure of Acute Diseases\", in which he promoted his brand of opium tincture, and advocated its use for a range of medical conditions.\n18th century.\nBy the 18th century, the medicinal properties of opium and laudanum were well known, and the term \"laudanum\" came to refer to any combination of opium and alcohol.\nIn the 18th century several physicians published works about it, including John Jones, who wrote \"The Mysteries of Opium Revealed\" (1700), which was described by one commentator as \"extraordinary and perfectly unintelligible\". The Scottish physician John Brown, creator of the Brunonian system of medicine, recommended opium for what he termed asthenic conditions, but his system was discredited by the time of his death. The most influential work was by George Young, who published a comprehensive medical text entitled \"Treatise on Opium (1753).\" Young, an Edinburgh surgeon and physician, wrote this to counter an essay on opium by his contemporary Charles Alston, professor of botany and materia medica at Edinburgh who had recommended the use of opium for a wide variety of conditions. Young countered this by emphasising the risks \"'...that I may prevent such mischief as I can, I here give it as my sincere opinion... that opium is a poison by which great numbers are daily destroyed.\"' Young gives a comprehensive account of the indications for the drug including its complications. He is critical about writers whose knowledge of the drug is based on chemical or animal experiments rather than clinical practice. The treatise is a detailed, balanced and valuable guide to prevailing knowledge and practice. As it gained popularity, opium, and after 1820, morphine, was mixed with a wide variety of agents, drugs and chemicals including mercury, hashish, cayenne pepper, ether, chloroform, belladonna, whiskey, wine and brandy.\"\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, patients undergoing surgery were often administered laudanum and alcohol, and had their hands restrained and bodies held down while the operation was performed.\n19th century.\nBy the 19th century, laudanum was used in many patent medicines to \"relieve pain ... to produce sleep ... to allay irritation ... to check excessive secretions ... to support the system ... [and] as a soporific\". The limited pharmacopoeia of the day meant that opium derivatives were among the most effective of available treatments, so laudanum was widely prescribed for ailments from colds to meningitis to cardiac diseases, in both adults and children. Laudanum was used during the yellow fever epidemic.\nInnumerable Victorian women were prescribed the drug for relief of menstrual cramps and vague aches. Nurses also spoon-fed laudanum to infants. The Romantic and Victorian eras were marked by the widespread use of laudanum in Europe and the United States. Mary Lincoln, for example, the wife of the US president Abraham Lincoln, was a laudanum addict, as was the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was famously interrupted in the middle of an opium-induced writing session of \"Kubla Khan\" by \"a person on business from Porlock\". Initially a working-class drug, laudanum was cheaper than a bottle of gin or wine, because it was treated as a medication for legal purposes and not taxed as an alcoholic beverage.\nAs one researcher has noted: \"To understand the popularity of a medicine that eased\u2014even if only temporarily\u2014coughing, diarrhoea and pain, one only has to consider the living conditions at the time\". In the 1850s, \"cholera and dysentery regularly ripped through communities, its victims often dying from debilitating diarrhoea\", and dropsy, consumption, ague and rheumatism were all too common.\nAn 1869 article in \"Scientific American\" describes a farmer growing and harvesting poppy in Indian Springs, Georgia, and subsequently selling the raw material to a local pharmacist who prepared laudanum.\n20th century.\nLaudanum was used in home remedies and prescriptions, as well as a single medication. For example, a 1901 medical book published for home health use gave the following two \"Simple Remedy Formulas\" for \"dysenterry\" [\"sic\"]: (1) Thin boiled starch, 2 ounces; Laudanum, 20 drops; \"Use as an injection [meaning as an enema] every six to twelve hours\"; (2) Tincture rhubarb, 1 ounce; Laudanum 4 drachms; \"Dose: One teaspoonful every three hours.\" In a section entitled \"Professional Prescriptions\" is a formula for \"diarrhoea (acute)\": Tincture opium, deodorized, 15 drops; Subnitrate of bismuth, 2 drachms; Simple syrup, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 ounce; Chalk mixture, 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 ounces, \"A teaspoonful every two or three hours to a child one year old.\" \"Diarrhoea (chronic)\": Aqueous extract of ergot, 20 grains; Extract of nux vomica, 5 grains; Extract of Opium, 10 grains, \"Make 20 pills. Take one pill every three or four hours.\"\nThe early 20th century brought increased regulation of all manner of narcotics, including laudanum, as the addictive properties of opium became more widely understood, and \"patent medicines came under fire, largely because of their mysterious compositions\". In the US, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 required that certain specified drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated. In 1906 in Britain and in 1908 in Canada \"laws requiring disclosure of ingredients and limitation of narcotic content were instituted\".\nThe Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 restricted the manufacture and distribution of opiates, including laudanum, and coca derivatives in the US. This was followed by France's \"\" in 1916, and Britain's Dangerous Drugs Act in 1920.\nLaudanum was supplied to druggists and physicians in regular and concentrated versions. For example, in 1915, Frank S. Betz Co., a medical supply company in Hammond, Indiana, advertised Tincture of Opium, U.S.P., for $2.90 per lb., Tincture of Opium Camphorated, U.S.P, for 85 cents per lb., and Tincture of Opium Deodorized, for $2.85 per lb. Four versions of opium as a fluid extract were also offered: (1) Opium, Concentrated (assayed) \"For making Tincture Opii (Laudanum) U.S.P. Four times the strength of the regular U.S.P.\" tincture, for $9.35 per pint; (2) Opium, Camphorated Conc. \"1 oz. making 8 ozs. Tr. Opii Camphorated U.S.P (Paregoric)\" for $2.00 per pint; (3) Opium, Concentrated (Deodorized and Denarcotized) \"Four times the strength of tincture, Used when Tinct. Opii U.S.P. is contraindicated\" for $9.50 per pint, and (4) Opium (Aqueous), U.S.P., 1890, \"Tr. (assayed) Papaver Somniferum\" for $2.25 per pint.\nIn 1929\u201330, Parke, Davis &amp; Co., a major US drug manufacturer based in Detroit, Michigan, sold \"Opium, U.S.P. (Laudanum)\", as Tincture No. 23, for $10.80 per pint (16 fluid ounces), and \"Opium Camphorated, U.S.P. (Paregoric)\", as Tincture No. 20, for $2.20 per pint. Concentrated versions were available. \"Opium Camphorated, for U.S.P. Tincture: Liquid No. 338\" was \"exactly 8 \"times the strength of Tincture Opium Camphorated (Paregoric)\" [italics in original], U.S.P., \"designed for preparing the tincture by direct dilution,\" and cost $7 per pint. Similarly, at a cost of $36 per pint, \"Opium Concentrated, for U.S.P. Tincture: Liquid No. 336\", was \"four times the strength of the official tincture\", and \"designed for the extemporaneous preparation of the tincture\". The catalog also noted: \"For quarter-pint bottles add 80c. per pint to the price given for pints.\"\nToward the middle 20th century, the use of opiates was generally limited to the treatment of pain, and opium was no longer a medically accepted 'cure-all'. Further, the pharmaceutical industry began synthesizing various opioids, such as propoxyphene, oxymorphone and oxycodone. These synthetic opioids, along with codeine and morphine were preferable to laudanum since a single opioid could be prescribed for different types of pain rather than the 'cocktail of laudanum, which contains nearly all of the opium alkaloids. Consequently, laudanum became mostly obsolete as an analgesic, since its principal ingredient is morphine, which can be prescribed by itself to treat pain. Until now, there has been no medical consensus on which of the two (laudanum or morphine alone) is the better choice for treating pain.\nIn 1970, the US adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which regulated opium tincture (Laudanum) as a Schedule II substance (currently DEA #9630), placing even tighter controls on the drug.\nBy the late 20th century, laudanum's use was almost exclusively confined to treating severe diarrhea.\n21st century.\nThe current prescribing information for laudanum in the US states that opium tincture's sole indication is as an anti-diarrheal, although the drug is occasionally prescribed off-label for treating pain and neonatal withdrawal syndrome.\nHistorical varieties.\nSeveral historical varieties of laudanum exist, including Paracelsus' laudanum, Sydenham's Laudanum (also known as \"tinctura opii crocata\"), benzoic laudanum (\"tinctura opii benzoica\"), and deodorized tincture of opium (the most common contemporary formulation), among others. Depending on the version, additional amounts of the substances and additional active ingredients (e.g. saffron, sugar, eugenol) are added, modifying its effects (e.g., amount of sedation, or antitussive properties).\nThere is probably no single reference that lists all the pharmaceutical variations of laudanum that were created and used in different countries during centuries since it was initially formulated. The reasons are that in addition to official variations described in pharmacopeias, pharmacists and drug manufacturers were free to alter such formulas. The alcohol content of Laudanum probably varied substantially; on the labels of turn-of-the-century bottles of Laudanum, alcoholic content is stated as 48%. In contrast, the current version of Laudanum contains about 18% alcohol.\nThe four variations of laudanum listed here were used in the United States during the late 19th century. The first, from an 1870 publication, is \"Best Turkey opium 1 oz., slice, and pour upon it boiling water 1 gill, and work it in a bowl or mortar until it is dissolved; then pour it into the bottle, and with alcohol of 70 percent proof &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 pt., rinse the dish, adding the alcohol to the preparation, shaking well, and in 24 hours it will be ready for use. Dose\u2014From 10 to 30 drops for adults, according to the strength of the patient, or severity of the pain. Thirty drops of this laudanum will be equal to one grain of opium. And this is a much better way to prepare it than putting the opium into alcohol, or any other spirits alone, for in that case much of the opium does not dissolve.\" The remaining three formulas are copied from an 1890 publication of the day:\nModern status.\nUnited Kingdom.\nOpium tincture remains in the British Pharmacopoeia, where it is referred to as Tincture of Opium, B.P., Laudanum, Thebaic Tincture or Tinctura Thebaica, and \"adjusted to contain 1% w/v of anhydrous morphine.\" It is a Class A substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971. At least one manufacturer (Macfarlan Smith) still produces opium tincture in the UK as of 2011[ [update]].\n\"Gee's Linctus\" is also available from most UK pharmacies, especially independent stores. This contains \"Opium Tincture\", at 0.083\u00a0mL, per 5\u00a0mL.\nUnited States.\nTincture of Opium is available by prescription in the United States. It is regulated as a Schedule II drug (No. 9639) under the Controlled Substances Act.\nIn the United States, opium tincture is marketed and distributed by several pharmaceutical firms, each producing a single formulation of the drug, which is deodorized. Each mL contains 10\u00a0mg of anhydrous morphine (the equivalent of 100\u00a0mg of powdered opium), other opium alkaloids (except noscapine), and ethanol, 19%. It is available packaged in bottles of and .\nTincture of Opium is known as one of many \"unapproved drugs\" regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the marketing and distribution of opium tincture prevails only because opium tincture was sold prior to the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act of 1938. Its \"grandfathered\" status protects opium tincture from being required to undergo strict FDA drug reviews and subsequent approval processes. However, the FDA closely monitors the labeling of opium tincture. Bottles of opium tincture are required by the FDA to bear a bright red \"POISON\" label given the potency of the drug and the potential for overdose (see discussion about confusion with Paregoric below). Additionally, in a warning letter to a manufacturer of opium tincture in late 2009, the FDA noted that \"we found that your firm is manufacturing and distributing the prescription drug Opium Tincture USP (Deodorized \u2013 10\u00a0mg/mL). Based on our information, there are no FDA-approved applications on file for this drug product.\"\nPharmacology.\nOpium tincture is useful as an analgesic and antidiarrheal. Opium enhances the tone in the long segments of the longitudinal muscle and inhibits propulsive contraction of circular and longitudinal muscles. The pharmacological effects of opium tincture are due principally to its morphine content. The quantity of the papaverine and codeine alkaloids in opium tincture is too small to have any demonstrable central nervous system effect.\nMost modern formulations of opium tincture do not contain the alkaloid narcotine (also known as noscapine), which has antitussive properties. Even modest doses of narcotine can induce profound nausea and vomiting. Since opium tincture is usually prescribed for its antidiarrheal and analgesic properties (rather than as an antitussive), opium tincture without narcotine is generally preferred. This \"de-narcotized\" or \"deodorized\" opium tincture is formulated using a petroleum distillate to remove the narcotine.\nOral doses of opium tincture are rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Peak plasma concentrations of the morphine content are reached in about one hour, and nearly 75% of the morphine content of the opium tincture is excreted in the urine within 48 hours after oral administration.\nMedical uses.\nDiarrhea.\nOpium tincture is indicated for the treatment of severe fulminant (intense, prolific) diarrhea that does not respond to standard therapy (e.g., Imodium or Lomotil).\nThe usual starting dose is 0.3\u00a0mL to 0.6\u00a0mL (about six to 12 drops) in a glass of water or juice four times a day. Refractory cases (such as diarrhea resulting from the complications of HIV/AIDS) may require higher than normal dosing, for example, 1 to 2\u00a0mL every 3 hours, for a total daily dose of up to 16\u00a0mL a day. In terminal diseases, there is no ceiling dose for opium tincture; the dose is increased slowly until diarrhea is controlled.\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome.\nOpium tincture is used to treat neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) when diluted 1:25 (one part opium tincture to 25 parts water). The recommended dose is 0.2\u00a0mL of the diluted solution under the tongue every three hours, which may be increased by 0.05\u00a0mL every three hours until no objective signs of withdrawal are observed. In no event, however, should the dose exceed 0.7\u00a0mL every three hours. The opium tincture is gradually tapered over a 3- to 5-week period, at which point the newborn should be completely free of withdrawal symptoms.\nHazards.\nPotency of laudanum.\nOpium tincture is one of the most potent oral formulations of morphine available by prescription. Accidental or deliberate overdose is common with opium tincture given the highly concentrated nature of the solution. Overdose and death may occur with a single oral dose of between 100 and 150\u00a0mg of morphine in a healthy adult who has no tolerance to opiates. This represents the equivalent of between two and three teaspoons () of opium tincture. Suicide by laudanum was common in the mid-19th century. Prudent medical judgment necessitates toward dispensing very small quantities of opium tincture in small dropper bottles or in pre-filled syringes to reduce the risk of intentional or accidental overdose.\nDanger of confusion with paregoric.\nIn the United States, opium tincture contains 10\u00a0mg per mL of anhydrous morphine. By contrast, opium tincture's weaker cousin, paregoric, also confusingly known as \"camphorated tincture of opium\", is 1/25th the strength of opium tincture, containing only 0.4\u00a0mg of morphine per mL. A 25-fold morphine overdose may occur if opium tincture is used where paregoric is indicated. Opium tincture is almost always dosed in drops, or fractions of a mL, or less commonly, in minims, while paregoric is dosed in teaspoons or tablespoons. Thus, an order for opium tincture containing directions in teaspoons is almost certainly in error. To avoid this potentially fatal outcome, the term \"camphorated tincture of opium\" is avoided in place of paregoric since the former can easily be mistaken for opium tincture.\nIn 2004, the FDA issued a \"Patient Safety\" news bulletin stating that \"To help resolve the confusion [between opium tincture and paregoric], FDA will be working with the manufacturers of these two drugs to clarify the labeling on the containers and in the package inserts.\" Indeed, in 2005, labels for opium tincture began to include the concentration of morphine (10\u00a0mg/mL) in large text beneath the words \"Opium Tincture\". The FDA has also alerted pharmacists and other medical practitioners about the dangers of confusing these drugs, and has recommended that opium tincture not be stocked as a standard item (i.e., that it should not be \"on the shelf\"), that opium tincture be dispensed in oral syringes, and that pharmacy software alert the dispenser if unusually large doses of opium tincture appear to be indicated.\nDespite the FDA's efforts over the past few years, the confusion persists, sometimes with deadly results. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends that opium tincture not be stocked at all in a pharmacy's inventory, and that \"It may be time to relegate opium tincture and paregoric to the museum of outmoded opioid therapy.\" Despite the risk of confusion, opium tincture, like many end-stage medications, is indispensable for intractable diarrhea for terminally ill patients, such as those with AIDS and cancer.\nMisinterpretation of \"DTO\".\nThe abbreviation \"DTO,\" traditionally used to refer to Deodorized Tincture of Opium, is sometimes also erroneously employed to abbreviate \"\"diluted\" tincture of opium.\" Diluted tincture of opium, also known as Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) is a 1:25 mixture of opium tincture to water prescribed to treat withdrawal symptoms in newborns whose mothers were using opioids while pregnant. The United States Pharmacopeia and FDA recommend that practitioners refrain from using DTO in prescriptions, given this potential for confusion. In cases where pharmacists have misinterpreted DTO, and given \"deodorized tincture of opium\" when \"diluted tincture of opium\" was meant, infants have received a massive 25-fold overdose of morphine, sometimes resulting in fatalities.\nSide effects.\nSide effects of laudanum are generally the same as with morphine, and include euphoria, dysphoria, pruritus, sedation, constipation, reduced tidal volume, respiratory depression, as well as psychological dependence, physical dependence, miosis, and xerostomia. Overdose can result in severe respiratory depression or collapse and death. The ethanol component can also induce adverse effects at higher doses; the side effects are the same as with alcohol.\nLong-term use of laudanum in nonterminal diseases is discouraged due to the possibility of drug tolerance and addiction. Long-term use can also lead to abnormal liver function tests; specifically, prolonged morphine use can increase ALT and AST blood serum levels.\nTreatment for overdose.\nLife-threatening overdose of opium tincture owes to the preparation's morphine content. Morphine produces a dose-dependent depressive effect on the respiratory system, which can lead to profound respiratory depression, hypoxia, coma and finally respiratory arrest and death. If overdose of opium tincture is suspected, rapid professional intervention is required. The primary concern is re-establishing a viable airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if the patient is unable to breathe on their own. Other supportive measures such as the use of vasopressors and oxygen may be indicated to treat cardiac and/or pulmonary failure. Cardiac arrhythmias or arrest will require advanced life-saving measures.\nIntravenous naloxone or nalmefene, quick-acting opioid antagonists, are the first-line treatment to reverse respiratory depression caused by an overdose of opium tincture. Gastric lavage may be of some use in certain cases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "42031", "revid": "473822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42031", "title": "Carl Jung", "text": "Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist (1875\u20131961)\nCarl Gustav Jung ( ; ; 26 July 1875 \u2013 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and psychologist who founded the school of analytical psychology. A prolific author of over twenty books, illustrator, and correspondent, Jung was a complex and convoluted academic, best known for his concept of archetypes. Alongside contemporaries Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, Jung became one of the most influential psychologists of the early 20th century and has fostered not only scholarship, but also popular interest.\nJung's work has been influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology, and religious studies. He worked as a research scientist at the Burgh\u00f6lzli psychiatric hospital in Zurich, under Eugen Bleuler. Jung established himself as an influential mind, developing a friendship with Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, conducting a lengthy correspondence paramount to their joint vision of human psychology. Jung is widely regarded as one of the most influential psychologists in history.\nFreud saw the younger Jung not only as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis but as a means to legitimize his own work: Freud and other contemporary psychoanalysts were Jews facing rising antisemitism in Europe, and Jung was raised as Christian, although he did not strictly adhere to traditional Christian doctrine, he saw religion, including Christianity, as a powerful expression of the human psyche and its search for meaning. Freud secured Jung's appointment as president of Freud's newly founded International Psychoanalytical Association. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it difficult to follow his older colleague's doctrine, and they parted ways. This division was painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology, as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. \nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation\u2014the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best-known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion. His treatment of American businessman and politician Rowland Hazard in 1926 with his conviction that alcoholics may recover if they have a \"vital spiritual (or religious) experience\" played a crucial role in the chain of events that led to the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung was an artist, craftsman, builder, and prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death, and some remain unpublished.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nCarl Gustav Jung was born 26 July 1875 in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, as the first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842\u20131896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848\u20131923). His birth was preceded by two stillbirths and that of a son named Paul, born in 1873, who survived only a few days.\nPaul Jung, Carl's father, was the youngest son of a noted German-Swiss professor of medicine at Basel, Karl Gustav Jung (1794\u20131864). Paul's hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, nor did he progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church. Emilie Preiswerk, Carl's mother, had also grown up in a large family whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, Samuel Preiswerk (1799\u20131871), and his second wife. Samuel Preiswerk was an \"Antistes\" (the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city) as well as a Hebraist, author, and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University.\nJung's father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen when Carl was six months old. Tensions between father and mother had developed. Jung's mother was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom, where she said spirits visited her at night. Though she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He said that one night, he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room, with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.\nJung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for some unspecified physical ailment. His father took Carl to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with \"innate unreliability\", whereas \"father\" meant for him reliability, but also powerlessness. In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the \"handicap I started off with\". Later, these early impressions were revised: \"I have trusted men friends and been disappointed by them, and I have mistrusted women and was not disappointed.\" After three years living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer. In 1879, he was called to Kleinh\u00fcningen, next to Basel, where his family lived in a church parsonage. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer to contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was 9, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884\u20131935) was born. Known in the family as \"Trudi\", she became a secretary to her brother.\nMemories of childhood.\nJung was a solitary and introverted child. From childhood, he believed that, like his mother, he had two personalities\u2014a modern Swiss citizen and a personality more suited to the 18th century. \"Personality Number 1\", as he termed it, was a typical schoolboy living in the era of the time. \"Personality Number 2\" was a dignified, authoritative, and influential man from the past. Though Jung was close to both parents, he was disappointed by his father's academic approach to faith.\nSome childhood memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny mannequin into the end of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside it. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language. He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with totems in Indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the \"tjurungas\" of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced in a way that was strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about. His observations about symbols, archetypes, and the collective unconscious were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.\nAt the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the \"Humanistisches Gymnasium\" in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized the incident was indirectly his fault.) A thought then came to him\u2014\"Now you won't have to go to school anymore\". From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained home for six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He entered his father's study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, \"was when I learned what a neurosis is\".\nUniversity studies and early career.\nInitially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a Christian minister. His household had a strong moral sense, and several of his family were clergy. Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach it. After studying philosophy in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided to pursue psychiatry and medicine. His interest was captured\u2014it combined the biological and spiritual, exactly what he was searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later, his father, Paul, died and left the family nearly destitute. They were helped by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.\nIt was during this early period when Jung was an assistant at the Anatomical Institute at Basel University, that he took an interest in palaeoanthropology and the revolutionary discoveries of \"Homo erectus\" and Neanderthal fossils. These formative experiences contributed to his fascination with the evolutionary past of humanity and his belief that an ancient evolutionary layer in the psyche, represented by early fossil hominins, is still evident in the psychology of modern humans.\nIn 1900, Jung moved to Zurich and began working at the Burgh\u00f6lzli psychiatric hospital under Eugen Bleuler. Bleuler was already in communication with the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud. Jung's dissertation, published in 1903, was titled \"On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena\". It was based on the analysis of the supposed mediumship of Jung's cousin H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Preiswerk, under the influence of Freud's contemporary Th\u00e9odore Flournoy. Jung studied with Pierre Janet in Paris in 1902 and later equated his view of the complex with Janet's . In 1905, Jung was appointed as a permanent 'senior' doctor at the hospital and became a lecturer \"Privatdozent\" in the medical faculty of Zurich University. In 1904, he published with Franz Riklin their \"Diagnostic Association Studies\", of which Freud obtained a copy. In 1909, Jung left the psychiatric hospital and began a private practice in his home in K\u00fcsnacht.\nEventually, a close friendship and strong professional association developed between the elder Freud and Jung, which left a sizeable correspondence. In late summer 1909, the two sailed for the U.S., where Freud was the featured lecturer at the twentieth-anniversary celebration of the founding of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, the Vicennial Conference on Psychology and Pedagogy, 7\u201311 September. Jung spoke as well and received an honorary degree.\nIt was during this trip that Jung first began separating psychologically from Freud, his mentor, which occurred after intense communications around their individual dreams. It was during this visit that Jung was introduced to the elder philosopher and psychologist William James, known as the \"Father of American psychology,\" whose ideas Jung would incorporate into his own work. Jung connected with James around their mutual interests in mysticism, spiritualism and psychical phenomena. James wrote to a friend after the conference stating Jung \"left a favorable impression,\" while \"his views of Freud were mixed.\" James died about eleven months later.\nThe ideas of both Jung and James, on topics including hopelessness, self-surrender, and spiritual experiences, were influential in the development and founding of the international altruistic, self-help movement Alcoholics Anonymous on 10 June 1935, in Akron, Ohio, a quarter of a century after James' death and in Jung's sixtieth year.\nFor six years, Jung and Freud cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published \"Psychology of the Unconscious\", which manifested the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured\u2014each stating the other could not admit he could be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung's intense experience a \"creative illness\" and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called neurasthenia and hysteria.\nMarriage.\nIn 1903, Jung married Emma Rauschenbach (1882\u20131955), seven years his junior and the elder daughter of a wealthy industrialist in eastern Switzerland, Johannes Rauschenbach-Schenck. Rauschenbach was the owner, among other concerns, of IWC Schaffhausen\u2014the International Watch Company, manufacturer of luxury time-pieces. Upon his death in 1905, his two daughters and their husbands became owners of the business. Jung's brother-in-law\u2014Ernst Homberger\u2014became the principal proprietor, but the Jungs remained shareholders in a thriving business that ensured the family's financial security for decades. Emma Jung, whose education had been limited, showed considerable ability and interest in her husband's research and threw herself into studies and acted as his assistant at Burgh\u00f6lzli. She eventually became a noted psychoanalyst in her own right. The marriage lasted until Emma died in 1955. He had five children:\nNone of the children continued their father's career. The daughters, Agathe and Marianne, assisted in publishing work.\nDuring his marriage, Jung engaged in at least one extramarital relationship: his affair with his patient and, later, fellow psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein. A continuing affair with Toni Wolff is also alleged.\nRelationship with Freud.\nMeeting and collaboration.\nJung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung's life. Jung became interested in psychiatry as a student by reading \"Psychopathia Sexualis\" by Richard von Krafft-Ebing. In 1900, Jung completed his degree and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler at Burgh\u00f6lzli Hospital. It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1899). In the early 1900s psychology as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new \"psycho-analysis\". Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burgh\u00f6lzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich, and Jung's research had already gained him international recognition. Jung sent Freud a copy of his \"Studies in Word Association\" in 1906. The same year, he published \"Diagnostic Association Studies\", a copy of which he later sent to Freud, who had already purchased a copy. Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time in Vienna on 3 March 1907. Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable and unceasing for 13 hours. Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich. This began an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years. In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded \"Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research\".\nIn 1909, Jung traveled with Freud and Hungarian psychoanalyst S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi to the United States; in September, they took part in a conference at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. The conference at Clark University was planned by the psychologist G. Stanley Hall and included 27 distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America. This forged welcome links between Jung and influential Americans. Jung returned to the United States the next year for a brief visit.\nIn 1910, Freud proposed Jung, \"his adopted eldest son, his crown prince, and successor,\" for the position of lifetime President of the newly formed International Psychoanalytical Association. However, after forceful objections from his Viennese colleagues, it was agreed Jung would be elected to serve a two-year term of office.\nDivergence and break.\nWhile Jung worked on his \"Psychology of the Unconscious: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido\", tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of libido. Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that the libido was an important source of personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not think that the libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality.\nIn 1912, these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague Ludwig Binswanger in Kreuzlingen without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as \"the Kreuzlingen gesture\". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the US and gave the Fordham University lectures, a six-week series, which were published later in the year as \"Psychology of the Unconscious\", subsequently republished as \"Symbols of Transformation\". While they contain remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the libido, they represent largely a \"psychoanalytical Jung\" and not the theory of analytical psychology, for which he became famous in the following decades. Nonetheless, it was their publication which, Jung declared, \"cost me my friendship with Freud\".\nAnother disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious. Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete, unnecessarily negative, and inelastic. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires. Jung's observations overlap to an extent with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the \"personal unconscious\", but his hypothesis is more about a process than a static model, and he also proposed the existence of a second, overarching form of the unconscious beyond the personal, that he named the psychoid\u2014a term borrowed from neo-vitalist philosopher and embryologist Hans Driesch (1867\u20131941)\u2014but with a somewhat altered meaning. The collective unconscious is not so much a 'geographical location', but a deduction from the alleged ubiquity of archetypes over space and time.\nIn November 1912, Jung and Freud met in Munich for a meeting among prominent colleagues to discuss psychoanalytical journals. At a talk about a new psychoanalytic essay on Amenhotep IV, Jung expressed his views on how it related to actual conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement. While Jung spoke, Freud suddenly fainted, and Jung carried him to a couch.\nJung and Freud personally met for the last time in September 1913 at the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the introvert and extraverted types, in analytical psychology.\nMidlife isolation.\nIt was the publication of Jung's book \"The Psychology of the Unconscious\" in 1912 that led to the final break with Freud. The letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what Jung described in his posthumously published autobiography, \"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\" (1962) as a \"resounding censure\". Everyone he knew dropped away from him except two of his colleagues. After the Munich congress, he was on the verge of a suicidal psychosis that precipitated his writing of his \"Red Book,\" his seven-volume personal diaries that were only published partially and posthumously in 2009. Eleven years later, in 2020, they were published as his \"Black Books.\" Jung described his 1912 book as \"an attempt, only partially successful, to create a wider setting for medical psychology and to bring the whole of the psychic phenomena within its purview\". The book was later revised and retitled \"Symbols of Transformation\" in 1952.\nLondon 1913\u20131914.\nJung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of Constance Long, who translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.\n\"The Black Books and The Red Book\".\nIn 1913, at the age of 38, Jung experienced a horrible \"confrontation with the unconscious\". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was \"menaced by a psychosis\" or was \"doing a schizophrenia\". He decided that it was a valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, a process of \"active imagination\". He recorded everything he experienced in small journals, which Jung referred to in the singular as his \"Black Book\", considering it a \"single integral whole\", even though some of these original journals have a brown cover. The material Jung wrote was subjected to several edits, hand-written and typed, including another, \"second layer\" of text, his continual psychological interpretations during the process of editing. Around 1915, Jung commissioned a large red leather-bound book, and began to transcribe his notes and paint, working intermittently for sixteen years.\nJung left no posthumous instructions about the final disposition of what he called the \"Liber Novus\" or \"Red Book\". Sonu Shamdasani, a historian of psychology from London, tried for three years to persuade Jung's resistant heirs to have it published. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it when the necessary additional funds were raised through the Philemon Foundation. Up to September 2008, fewer than about two dozen people had ever seen it.\nIn 2007, two technicians for DigitalFusion, working with New York City publishers W. W. Norton &amp; Company, scanned the manuscript with a 10,200-pixel scanner. It was published on 7 October 2009 in German, with a \"separate English translation along with Shamdasani's introduction and footnotes\" at the back of the book. According to Sara Corbett, reviewing the text for \"The New York Times\", \"The book is bombastic, baroque and like so much else about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an antediluvian and mystical reality.\"\nThe Rubin Museum of Art in New York City displayed Jung's \"Red Book\" leather folio, as well as some of his original \"Black Book\" journals, from 7 October 2009 to 15 February 2010. According to them, \"During the period in which he worked on this book Jung developed his principal theories of archetypes, collective unconscious, and the process of individuation.\" Two-thirds of the pages bear Jung's illuminations and illustrations to the text.\nWartime army service.\nDuring World War I, Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made commandant of an internment camp for British officers and soldiers. The Swiss were neutral and obliged to intern personnel from either side of the conflict, who crossed their frontier to evade capture. Jung worked to improve the conditions of soldiers stranded in Switzerland and encouraged them to attend university courses.\nTravels.\nJung emerged from his period of isolation in the late 1910s with the publication of several journal articles, followed in 1921 with \"Psychological Types\", one of his most influential books. There followed a decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels.\nEngland (1920, 1923, 1925, 1935, 1938, 1946).\nConstance Long arranged for Jung to deliver a seminar in Cornwall in 1920. Another seminar was held in 1923, this one organized by Jung's British prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Helton Godwin Baynes (known as \"Peter\") (1882\u20131943), and another in 1925.\nIn 1935, at the invitation of his close British friends and colleagues, H. G. Baynes, E. A. Bennet and Hugh Crichton-Miller, Jung gave a series of lectures at the Tavistock Clinic in London, later published as part of the \"Collected Works\".\nIn 1938, Jung was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. At the tenth International Medical Congress for Psychotherapy held at Oxford from 29 July to 2 August 1938, Jung gave the presidential address, followed by a visit to Cheshire to stay with the Bailey family at Lawton Mere.\nIn 1946, Jung agreed to become the first Honorary President of the newly formed Society of Analytical Psychology in London, having previously approved its training programme devised by Michael Fordham.\nUnited States 1909\u20131912, 1924\u20131925, &amp; 1936\u20131937.\nDuring the period of Jung's collaboration with Freud, both visited the US in 1909 to lecture at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, where both were awarded honorary degrees. In 1912, Jung gave a series of lectures at Fordham University, New York, which were published later in the year as \"Psychology of the Unconscious\". Jung made a more extensive trip westward in the winter of 1924\u20135, financed and organized by Fowler McCormick and George Porter. Of particular value to Jung was a visit with Chief Mountain Lake of the Taos Pueblo near Taos, New Mexico. Jung made another trip to America in 1936, receiving an honorary degree at Harvard and giving lectures in New York and New England for his growing group of American followers. He returned in 1937 to deliver the Terry Lectures at Yale University, later published as \"Psychology and Religion\".\nEast Africa.\nIn October 1925, Jung embarked on his most ambitious expedition, the \"Bugishu Psychological Expedition\" to East Africa. He was accompanied by his English friend, \"Peter\" Baynes, and an American associate, George Beckwith. On the voyage to Africa, they became acquainted with an English woman named Ruth Bailey, who joined their safari a few weeks later. The group traveled through Kenya and Uganda to the slopes of Mount Elgon, where Jung hoped to increase his understanding of \"primitive psychology\" through conversations with the culturally isolated residents of that area. Later, he concluded that the major insights he had gleaned had to do with himself and the European psychology in which he had been raised. One of Jung's most famous proposed constructs is kinship libido. Jung defined this as an instinctive feeling of belonging to a particular group or family and believed it was vital to the human experience and used this as an endogamous aspect of the libido and what lies amongst the family. This is similar to a Bantu term called Ubuntu that emphasizes humanity and almost the same meaning as kinship libido, which is, \"I am because you are.\"\nIndia.\nIn December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself \"under the direct influence of a foreign culture\" for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but he could converse extensively in India. Hindu philosophy became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with Ramana Maharshi. He described Ramana as being absorbed in \"the self\". During these travels, he visited the Vedagiriswarar Temple, where he had a conversation with a local expert about the symbols and sculptures on the gopuram of this temple. He later wrote about this conversation in his book Aion. Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of delirium in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.\nLater life and death.\nJung became a full professor of medical psychology at the University of Basel in 1943 but resigned after a heart attack the next year to lead a more private life. In 1945, he began corresponding with an English Roman Catholic priest, Father Victor White, who became a close friend, regularly visiting the Jungs at the Bollingen estate. Jung became ill again in 1952.\nJung continued to publish books until the end of his life, including \"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies\" (1959), which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of UFOs. In 1961, he wrote his last work, a contribution to \"Man and His Symbols\" entitled \"Approaching the Unconscious\" (published posthumously in 1964). Jung died on 6 June 1961 at K\u00fcsnacht after a short illness. He had been beset by circulatory diseases.\nAwards.\nAmong his principal distinctions are honorary doctorates from:\nIn addition, he was:\nThought.\nJung's thought derived from the classical education he received at school and from early family influences, which on the maternal side were a combination of Reformed Protestant academic theology with an interest in occult phenomena. On his father's side was a dedication to academic discipline emanating from his grandfather, the physician, scientist, and first Basel Professor of Medicine, Karl Gustav Jung, a one-time student activist and convert from Catholicism to Swiss Reformed Protestantism. Family lore suggested there was at least a social connection to the German polymath, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, through the latter's niece, Lotte Kestner, known as \"Lottchen\", who was a frequent visitor in Jung senior's household.\nCarl Jung, the practicing clinician, writer, and founder of analytical psychology, had, through his marriage, the economic security to pursue interests in other intellectual topics of the moment. His early celebrity as a research scientist through the Word Association Test led to the start of prolific correspondence and worldwide travel. It opened academic as well as social avenues, supported by his explorations into anthropology, quantum physics, vitalism, Eastern and Western philosophy. He delved into epistemology, alchemy, astrology, and sociology, as well as literature and the arts. Jung's interest in philosophy and spiritual subjects led many to label him a mystic, although he preferred to be seen as a man of science. Jung, unlike Freud, was deeply knowledgeable about philosophical concepts and sought links between epistemology and emergent theories of psychology.\nKey concepts.\nWithin the field of analytical psychology, a brief survey of major concepts developed by Jung includes (alphabetical):\nCollective unconscious.\nSince the establishment of psychoanalytic theory, the notion and meaning of individuals having a \"personal\" unconscious has gradually come to be commonly accepted. This was popularised by both Freud and Jung. Whereas an individual's personal unconscious is made up of thoughts and emotions that have, at some time, been experienced or held in mind but which have been repressed or forgotten, in contrast, the \"collective\" unconscious is neither acquired by activities within an individual's life nor a container of things that are thoughts, memories or ideas which are capable of being conscious during one's life. The contents of it were never naturally \"known\" through physical or cognitive experience and then forgotten.\nThe collective unconscious consists of universal heritable elements common to all humans, distinct from other species. However, this does not necessarily imply a genetic cause. It encapsulates fields of evolutionary biology, history of civilization, ethnology, brain and nervous system development, and general psychological development. Considering its composition in practical physiological and psychological terms, \"it consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.\" Jung writes about causal factors in personal psychology as stemming from, influenced by an abstraction of the impersonal physical layer, the common and universal physiology among all humans. Jung considers that science would hardly deny the existence and basic nature of \"instincts\", existing as a whole set of motivating urges. The collective unconscious acts as the frame where science can distinguish individual motivating urges, thought to be universal across all individuals of the human species, while instincts are present in all species. Jung contends, \"The hypothesis of the collective unconscious is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there are instincts.\"\nArchetype.\n Common archetypal motifs: Devourer, Great/Benevolent Mother, Wise Old Man, Hero/Self\nThe archetype is a concept \"borrowed\" from anthropology to denote a process of nature. Jung's definitions of archetypes varied over time and have been the subject of debate regarding their usefulness. Archetypal images, also referred to as motifs in mythology, are universal symbols that can mediate opposites in the psyche, are often found in religious art, mythology and fairy tales across cultures. Jung saw archetypes as pre-configurations in nature that give rise to repeating, understandable, describable experiences. In addition, the concept considers the passage of time and patterns resulting from transformation. Archetypes are said to exist independently of any current event or its effect. They are said to exert influence both across all domains of experience and throughout the stages of each individual's unique development. Being in part based on heritable physiology, they are thought to have \"existed\" since humans became a differentiated species. They have been deduced through the development of storytelling over tens of thousands of years, indicating repeating patterns of individual and group experience, behaviors, and effects across the planet, apparently displaying common themes.\nThe concept did not originate with Jung but with Plato, who first conceived of primordial patterns. Later contributions came from Adolf Bastian and Hermann Usener, among others. In the first half of the twentieth century, it proved impossible to objectively isolate and categorize the notion of an archetype within a materialist frame. According to Jung, there are \"as many archetypes as there are typical situations in life\", and he asserted that they have a dynamic mutual influence on one another. Their alleged presence could be extracted from thousand-year-old narratives, from comparative religion, and from mythology. Jung elaborated on many archetypes in \"\"The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious\" and in \"Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self\"\". Examples of archetypes might be the shadow, the hero, the self, anima, animus, mother, father, child, and trickster.\nShadow.\nThe \"shadow\" exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of the traits individuals instinctively or consciously resist identifying as their own and would rather ignore, typically repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. Much of the shadow comes as a result of an individual's adaptation to cultural norms and expectations. Thus, this archetype not only consists of all the things deemed unacceptable by society but also those things that are not aligned with one's own personal morals and values.\nJung argues that the \"shadow\" plays a distinctive role in balancing one's overall psyche, the counter-balancing to consciousness\u2014\"where there is light, there must also be shadow\". Without a well-developed \"shadow\" (often \"shadow work\", \"integrating one's shadow\"), an individual can become shallow and extremely preoccupied with the opinions of others; that is, a walking \"persona\". Not wanting to look at their shadows directly, Jung argues, often results in psychological projection. Individuals project imagined attitudes onto others without awareness. The qualities an individual may hate (or love) in another may manifest in those who do not see the external, material truth. In order to truly grow as an individual, Jung believed that both the \"persona\" and \"shadow\" should be balanced.\nThe shadow can often appear as a dark, wild, exotic figure in dreams or visions.\nExtraversion and introversion.\nJung was one of the first to define introversion and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung's \"Psychological Types\", he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories: the introvert or the extravert. Jung compares these two psychological types to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened to Apollo, who shines a light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming, and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception, and action. Energetic and lively, the extravert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extraversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, etc.), whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion are expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world \"subjectively\", whereas extraverts interpret the world \"objectively\".\nPersona.\nIn his psychological theory\u2014which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of social structure\u2014the \"persona\" appears as a consciously created personality or identity, fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through socialization, acculturation and experience. Jung applied the term \"persona\" explicitly because, in Latin, it means both \"personality\" and the \"masks\" worn by Roman actors of the classical period, expressive of the individual roles played.\nThe \"persona\", he argues, is a mask for the \"collective psyche\", a mask that 'pretends' individuality so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played \"role\" through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the \"persona-mask\" as a complicated system that \"mediates\" between individual consciousness and the social community: it is \"a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be\". But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a \"character mask\" in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression on others and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual. The therapist then aims to assist the individuation process through which the client (re)gains their \"own self\"\u2014by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the \"persona\" and from the power of unconscious impulses.\nJung has influenced management theory because managers and executives create an appropriate \"management persona\" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity, and they have to evaluate \"what sort of people\" the workers are, to manage them (for example, using personality tests and peer reviews).\nEvolutionary thought.\nOf his early years, Jung would write that \"mentally my greatest adventure had been the study of Kant and Schopenhauer. The great news of the day was the work of\nCharles Darwin.\" While Jung\u2019s conception of human psychology is grounded in Darwinian evolutionary theory, it is important to note that his evolutionary thought had a distinctively German quality to it. This is because the idiosyncratic reception of Darwin in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Germany resulted in the integration of Darwin's ideas with German embryological and developmental traditions formulated by the Naturphilosophen and theorists such as Ernst Haeckel. These traditions formed the intellectual background of Jung\u2019s evolutionary thought.\nThe result was that Jung's evolutionary conception of mind focused on embryology and development. From this perspective, the emergence of consciousness both in ontogeny (development) and phylogeny (evolution) was built upon much more archaic, affect-based subcortical brain systems. This developmental approach to evolution underpinned his \"archaeological\" conception of the human psyche, consisting of different evolutionary layers, from the deeply archaic to the more evolutionarily recent. Those more archaic structures in the brain, Jung believed to be the basis of the \"collective unconscious\"\u2014an aspect of human psychology shared by all members of the species \"Homo sapiens\".\nIn commenting on humanity's evolution from an ancient primate ancestor, Jung wrote: \"We keep forgetting that we are primates and that we have to make allowances for these primitive layers in our psyche.\" Jung also developed the notion of different evolutionary layers in the psyche in his discussion of fossil hominins such as \"Pithecanthropus\" (\"Homo erectus\"). As he writes:\nFor just as a man has a body that is no different in principle from that of an animal, so also his psychology has a whole series of lower storeys [\"sic\"] in which the spectres from humanity\u2019s past epochs still dwell, then the animal souls from the age of Pithecanthropus and the hominids, then the \"psyche\" of the cold-blooded saurian.\nJung\u2019s notion of different evolutionary layers in the human mind has been compared with the work of neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, particularly as outlined in his book \"The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotions\". Of these affinities it has been suggested that \u2018Jung and Panksepp have, independently it seems, developed similar metaphors of an archeologically layered psyche in which jewels and treasures are discoverable in the deepest phylogenetically ancient regions of the brain \u2013 for Jung they are archetypal structures for Panksepp cross-species homologies.' \nSignificantly, in a 2017 article entitled \"The Affective Core of the Self: A Neuro-Archetypical Perspective\non the Foundations of Human (and Animal) Subjectivity\", when noting Jung\u2019s belief that archetypes may be related to evolutionarily ancient subcortical brain systems, Panksepp and colleagues wrote that \"such assertions by Jung were not only quite farsighted, but they actually open ways to connect his theory of the psyche with the most advanced scientific theories and discoveries of our day.\" \nSpirituality.\nJung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. The main task for people, he believed, is to discover and fulfill their deep, innate potential. Based on his study of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Taoism, and other traditions, Jung believed this journey of transformation, which he called individuation, is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self and at the same time to meet the Divine. Unlike Freud's atheistic worldview, Jung's pantheism may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole.\nIn 1959, Jung was asked by the host, John Freeman, on the BBC interview program \"Face to Face\" whether he believed in God, to which Jung answered, \"I do not need to believe. I \"know\".\" Jung's ideas on religion counterbalance Freudian skepticism. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation is still treated in modern textbooks on the psychology of religion, though his ideas have been criticized.\nJung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism, and is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung treated an American patient named Rowland Hazard III who had chronic alcoholism. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that, occasionally, such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics when all other options had failed. Hazard took Jung's advice seriously and sought a personal, spiritual experience. He returned to the United States and joined a Christian evangelical movement known as the Oxford Group. He told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was Ebby Thacher, a long-time friend and drinking buddy of William Griffith Wilson, later co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them, Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original twelve-step program.\nThe above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Wilson. Although some historians dispute the detail, Jung discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in his \"Collected Works\", \"For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can't do it better than Jesus.'\" Jung goes on to state he has seen similar cures among Roman Catholics. The 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous has a psychological backdrop involving the human ego and the dichotomy between the conscious and unconscious mind.\nInquiries into the paranormal.\nJung had an apparent interest in the paranormal and occult. For decades, he attended seances and claimed to have witnessed \"parapsychic phenomena\". Initially, he attributed these to psychological causes, even delivering a 1919 lecture in England for the Society for Psychical Research on \"The Psychological Foundations for the belief in spirits\". However, he began to \"doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to the phenomena in question\" and stated that \"the spirit hypothesis yields better results\".. Still, he retained some skepticism toward his own postulation, as he could not find material evidence of the existence of spirits.\nJung's ideas about the paranormal culminated in \"synchronicity\". This is the idea that certain coincidences manifest in the world, have exceptionally intense meaning to observers. Such coincidences have a great effect on the observer from multiple cumulative aspects: from the immediate personal relevance of the coincidence to the observer, from the peculiarities of (the nature of, the character, novelty, curiosity of) any such coincidence; from the sheer improbability of the coincidence, having no apparent causal link (hence Jung's essay subtitle \"An Acausal Connecting Principle\"). Despite his own experiments failing to confirm the phenomenon he held on to the idea as an explanation for apparent ESP. In addition, he proposed it as a functional explanation for how the I-Ching worked. However, he was never clear about how synchronicity worked.\nInterpretation of quantum mechanics.\nJung influenced one philosophical interpretation (not the science) of quantum physics with the concept of synchronicity regarding some events as non-causal. That idea influenced the physicist Wolfgang Pauli (with whom, via a letter correspondence, Jung developed the notion of \"unus mundus\" in connection with the idea of nonlocality) and some other physicists.\nAlchemy.\nJung's acquaintance with alchemy came between 1928 and 1930 when he was introduced to a manuscript of \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\", translated by Richard Wilhelm. The work and writings of Jung from the 1930s onwards shifted to a focus on the psychological significance of alchemy.\nIn 1944, Jung published \"Psychology and Alchemy\", in which he analyzed the alchemical symbols and came to the conclusion that there is a direct relationship between them and the psychoanalytical process. He argued that the alchemical process was the transformation of the impure soul (lead) to perfected soul (gold), and a metaphor for the individuation process.\nIn 1963, \"Mysterium Coniunctionis\" first appeared in English as part of \"The Collected Works of C. G. Jung\". \"Mysterium Coniunctionis\" was Jung's last major book and focused on the \"Mysterium Coniunctionis\" archetype, known as the sacred marriage between the sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening, and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation\u2014his chosen term for personal growth (75).\nArt therapy.\nJung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore, and heal. In his work with patients and his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could help recover from trauma and emotional distress. At times of emotional distress, he often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions, which he recognized as more than recreational.\nDance/movement therapy.\nDance and movement therapy, as a form of active imagination, was developed by Jung and Toni Wolff in 1916 and practiced by Tina Keller-Jenny and other analysts. It remained largely unknown until the 1950s when it was rediscovered by Marian Chace and therapist Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse, after studying with Martha Graham and Mary Wigman, became a dancer and teacher of modern dance, and, along with Swiss dancer Trudi Schoop, is considered one of the founders of dance/movement therapy in the U.S.\nPolitical views.\nThe state.\nJung stressed the importance of individual rights in a person's relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as \"a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected\" but that this personality was \"only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it\". He referred to the state as a form of slavery. He also thought that the state \"swallowed up [people's] religious forces\", and therefore that the state had \"taken the place of God\"\u2014making it comparable to a religion in which \"state slavery is a form of worship\". Jung observed that \"stage acts of [the] state\" are comparable to religious displays:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Brass bands, flags, banners, parades and monster demonstrations are no different in principle from ecclesiastical processions, cannonades and fire to scare off demons.\nFrom Jung's perspective, this replacement of God with the state in a mass society leads to the dislocation of the religious drive and results in the same fanaticism of the church-states of the Dark Ages\u2014wherein the more the state is 'worshipped', the more freedom and morality are suppressed; this ultimately leaves the individual psychically undeveloped with extreme feelings of marginalization.\nService to the Allies during World War II.\nJung was in contact with Allen Dulles of the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) and provided valuable intelligence on the psychological condition of Hitler. Dulles referred to Jung as \"Agent 488\" and offered the following description of his service: \"Nobody will probably ever know how much Professor Jung contributed to the Allied Cause during the war, by seeing people who were connected somehow with the other side\". Jung's service to the Allied cause through the OSS remained classified after the war.\nRelationship to Nazism and antisemitism.\nIn \"The State of Psychotherapy Today\", published in 1934 in the \"Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychotherapie\", Jung wrote: \"The Aryan unconscious has a greater potential than the Jewish unconscious\" and \"The Jew, who is something of a nomad, has never yet created a cultural form of his own and as far as we can see never will\". Andrew Samuels argues that his remarks on the \"Aryan unconscious\" and the \"corrosive character\" of Freud's \"Jewish gospel\" demonstrate a form of antisemitism \"fundamental to the structure of Jung's thought\" but also argues that there is a \"pioneering nature of Jung's contributions\" and that \"his intuition of the importance of exploring difference remains intact.\"\nIn 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung became the president of the new International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy (\"Allgemeine \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychotherapie\"); the professional body aimed to have affiliated organizations in different countries. The German affiliated organization, the Deutsche Allgemeine \u00c4rztliche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychotherapie, led by Matthias G\u00f6ring, an Adlerian psychotherapist and a cousin of the prominent Nazi Hermann G\u00f6ring, excluded Jews. In 1933, the society's \"Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychotherapie\" journal published a statement endorsing Nazi positions and Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\". In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the \"Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung\", that he experienced \"great surprise and disappointment\" when the \"Zentralblatt\" associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement. He did not end his relationship with the \"Zentralblatt\" at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, Carl Alfred Meier of Switzerland. For the next few years, the \"Zentralblatt\" under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis in that it continued to acknowledge the contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy. In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939, the year the Second World War started.\nThe International Society's constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a circular in 1934. This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.\nJung said, \"The main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake.\"\nScholar Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi believed that Jung's antisemitism may have contributed to the schism between Freud and his circle of psychoanalysts, who were predominantly Jews.\nJung's interest in European mythology and folk psychology was shared by the Nazis. Richard Noll describes Jung's own reaction to this connection:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Jung clearly identifies himself with the spirit of German Volkstumsbewegung throughout this period and well into the 1920s and 1930s, until the horrors of Nazism finally compelled him to reframe these neopagan metaphors in a negative light in his 1936 essay on Wotan.\nVarious statements made by Jung in the 1930s have been cited as evidence of both contempt for Nazism and sympathy for Nazism. In the 1936 essay \"Wotan\", Jung described the influence of Adolf Hitler on Germany as \"one man who is obviously 'possessed' has infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motion and has started rolling on its course towards perdition.\" He would later say, during a lengthy interview with H. R. Knickerbocker in October 1938:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hitler seemed like the 'double' of a real person, as if Hitler the man might be hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so concealed in order not to disturb the mechanism\u00a0... You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there\u00a0... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation.\nIn an interview in 1949, Carl Jung said, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It must be clear to anyone who has read any of my books that I have never been a Nazi sympathizer and I never have been anti-Semitic, and no amount of misquotation, mistranslation, or rearrangement of what I have written can alter the record of my true point of view. Nearly every one of these passages has been tampered with, either by malice or by ignorance. Furthermore, my friendly relations with a large group of Jewish colleagues and patients over a period of many years in itself disproves the charge of anti-Semitism.Jung is also known to have possessed an interest in the Jewish mystic tradition of Kabbalah.\nViews on homosexuality.\nJung addressed homosexuality in his published writings, in one comment specifying that homosexuality should not be a concern of legal authorities nor be considered a crime. He also stated that homosexuality does not reduce the value of a person as a member of society. Jung also said that homosexuality is a result of psychological immaturity (\"nurture\"), but only if one's sexuality is not an aspect of their constitutional characteristics (\"nature\").\nPsychedelics.\nJung's theories are considered to be a useful therapeutic framework for the analysis of unconscious phenomena that become manifest in the acute psychedelic state. This view is based on correspondence Jung had with researchers involved in psychedelic research in the 1950s, as well as more recent neuroimaging research where subjects who are administered psychedelic compounds seem to have archetypal religious experiences of \"unity\" and \"ego dissolution\" associated with reduced activity in the default mode network.\nThis research has led to a re-evaluation of Jung's work, particularly the visions detailed in \"The Red Book\", in the context of contemporary psychedelic, evolutionary, and developmental neuroscience. For example, in a chapter entitled \"Integrating the Archaic and the Modern: The Red Book, Visual Cognitive Modalities and the Neuroscience of Altered States of Consciousness\", in the 2020 volume \"Jung's Red Book for Our Time: Searching for Soul Under Postmodern Conditions, Volume 4\", it is argued Jung was a pioneer who explored uncharted \"cognitive domains\" that are alien to Western modes of thought. While such domains of experience are not part of mainstream Western culture and thought, they are central to various Indigenous cultures that use psychedelics such as Iboga and Ayahuasca during rituals to alter consciousness. The author writes: \"Jung seems to have been dealing with modes of consciousness alien to mainstream Western thought, exploring the terrain of uncharted cognitive domains. I argue that science is beginning to catch up with Jung who was a pioneer whose insights contribute a great deal to our emerging understanding of human consciousness.\" In this analysis, Jung's paintings of his visions in \"The Red Book\" were compared to the paintings of Ayahuasca visions by the Peruvian shaman Pablo Amaringo.\nCommenting on research that was being undertaken during the 1950s, Jung wrote the following in a letter to Betty Eisner, a psychologist who was involved in LSD research at the University of California: \"Experiments along the line of mescaline and related drugs are certainly most interesting since such drugs lay bare a level of the unconscious that is otherwise accessible only under peculiar psychic conditions. It is a fact that you get certain perceptions and experiences of things appearing either in mystical states or in the analysis of unconscious phenomena.\"\nAn account of Jung and psychedelics, as well as the importance of Jungian psychology to psychedelic-assisted therapies, is outlined in Scott Hill's 2013 book \"Confrontation with the Unconscious: Jungian Depth Psychology and Psychedelic Experience\". A 2021 article discusses Jung's attitude towards psychedelics, as well as the applicability of his ideas to current research. As the author writes, Jung's \"...legitimate reservations about the clinical use of psychedelics are no longer relevant as the field has progressed significantly, devising robust clinical and experimental protocols for psychedelic-assisted therapies. That said Jung's concept of individuation\u2014that is the integration of the archaic unconscious with consciousness\u2014seems extremely pertinent to modern psychedelic research.\" The author also uses work in evolutionary and psychedelic neuroscience, and specifically the latter's ability to make manifest ancient subcortical brain systems, to illuminate Jung's concept of an archaic collective unconscious that evolved before the ego complex and the uniquely human default mode network.\nLegacy.\nThe Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a psychometric instrument mostly popular with non-psychologists, as well as the concepts of socionics, were developed from Jung's model of psychological types. The MBTI is considered pseudoscience and is not widely accepted by researchers in the field of psychology.\nJung is considered a \"godparent\" of the altruistic, mutual self-help movement, Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung told Rhode Island businessman and politician Rowland Hazard III, who had come under his care for the first time in 1926, that the only chance he might have to recover was through a \"spiritual or religious experience\" or \"genuine conversion,\" which Hazard later had, through the Oxford Group and the Emmanuel Movement, and, according to some sources, never drank again.\nHazard, in turn, helped Ebby Thatcher, another alcoholic, get sober, with help from the Oxford Group. Thatcher brought Jung's ideas to a third alcoholic, Bill W., who consequently co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous with Dr. Bob. Years later, Bill W. corresponded with Jung, in 1961, thanking him for helping to inspire the organization. Of Hazard, the alcoholic who came under his care, Jung wrote: \"His craving for alcohol was the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness, expressed in medieval language: the union with God.\"\nJung concludes his letter to Bill W.:\n\"You see, \"alcohol\" in Latin is \"spiritus\", and you use the same word for the highest religious experience as well as for the most depraving poison. The helpful formula therefore is: \"spiritus contra spiritum\".\"\nJung saw the human psyche as \"by nature religious\" and made this idea a principal focus of his explorations. Jung is one of the best-known contemporary contributors to dream analysis and symbolization. His influence on popular psychology, the \"psychologization of religion\", spirituality, and the New Age movement has been immense. A \"Review of General Psychology\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Jung as the 23rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century. The list however focused on U.S. journals and was made by the psychology department of Arkansas State University.\nAlthough psychoanalysis is still studied in the humanities, a 2008 study in \"The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association\" found that psychology departments and textbooks treat it as \"desiccated and dead\". Similarly, Alan Stone noted, \"As academic psychology becomes more 'scientific' and psychiatry more biological, psychoanalysis is being brushed aside.\"\nBibliography.\n\"Collected Works\".\nEditors: Herbert Read, Michael Fordham, Gerhard Adler.

Although these processes exist beneath the surface of conscious awareness, they are thought to exert an effect on conscious thought processes and behavior. The term was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\nThe emergence of the concept of the unconscious in psychology and general culture was mainly due to the work of Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. In psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious mind consists of ideas and drives that have been subject to the mechanism of repression: anxiety-producing impulses in childhood are barred from consciousness, but do not cease to exist, and exert a constant pressure in the direction of consciousness. However, the content of the unconscious is only knowable to consciousness through its representation in a disguised or distorted form, by way of dreams and neurotic symptoms, as well as in slips of the tongue and jokes. The psychoanalyst seeks to interpret these conscious manifestations in order to understand the nature of the repressed.\nThe unconscious mind can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking). Phenomena related to semi-consciousness include awakening, implicit memory, subliminal messages, trances, hypnagogia and hypnosis. While sleep, sleepwalking, dreaming, delirium and comas may signal the presence of unconscious processes, these processes are seen as symptoms rather than the unconscious mind itself.\nSome critics have doubted the existence of the unconscious altogether.\nHistorical overview.\nGerman.\nThe term \"unconscious\" () was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling (in his \"System of Transcendental Idealism\", http://) and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge (in his \"Biographia Literaria\"). Some rare earlier instances of the term \"unconsciousness\" (\"\") can be found in the work of the 18th-century German physician and philosopher Ernst Platner.\nVedas.\nInfluences on thinking that originate from outside an individual's consciousness were reflected in the ancient ideas of temptation, divine inspiration, and the predominant role of the gods in affecting motives and actions. The idea of internalised unconscious processes in the mind was present in antiquity, and has been explored across a wide variety of cultures. Unconscious aspects of mentality were referred to between 2,500 and 600 BC in the Hindu texts known as the Vedas, found today in Ayurvedic medicine.\nParacelsus.\nParacelsus is credited as the first to make mention of an unconscious aspect of cognition in his work \"Von den Krankheiten\" (translates as \"About illnesses\", 1567), and his clinical methodology created a cogent system that is regarded by some as the beginning of modern scientific psychology.\nShakespeare.\nWilliam Shakespeare explored the role of the unconscious in many of his plays, without naming it as such.\nPhilosophy.\nIn his work \"Anthropology\", philosopher Immanuel Kant was one of the first to discuss the subject of unconscious ideas.\nWestern philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, Carl Gustav Carus, S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche and Thomas Carlyle used the word unconscious.\nIn 1880 at the Sorbonne, Edmond Colsenet defended a philosophy thesis (PhD) on the unconscious. Elie Rabier and Alfred Fouillee performed syntheses of the unconscious \"at a time when Freud was not interested in the concept\".\nPsychology.\nNineteenth century.\nAccording to historian of psychology Mark Altschule, \"It is difficult\u2014or perhaps impossible\u2014to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance.\" In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, William James, in his monumental treatise on psychology (\"The Principles of Psychology\"), examined the way Schopenhauer, von Hartmann, Janet, Binet and others had used the term 'unconscious' and 'subconscious.'\" German psychologists, Gustav Fechner and Wilhelm Wundt, had begun to use the term in their experimental psychology, in the context of manifold, jumbled sense data that the mind organizes at an \"unconscious\" level before revealing it as a cogent totality in conscious form.\" Eduard von Hartmann published a book dedicated to the topic, \"Philosophy of the Unconscious,\" in 1869.\nFreud.\nSigmund Freud and his followers developed an account of the unconscious mind. He worked with the unconscious mind to develop an explanation for mental illness.\nFor Freud, the unconscious is not merely that which is not conscious. He refers to that as the \"descriptive unconscious\" and it is only the starting postulate for real investigation into the psyche. He further distinguishes the unconscious from the \"pre-conscious\": the pre-conscious is merely latent \u2013 thoughts, memories, etc. that are not present to consciousness but are capable of becoming so; the \"unconscious\" consists of psychic material that is made completely inaccessible to consciousness by the act of repression. The distinctions and inter-relationships between these three regions of the psyche\u2014the conscious, the pre-conscious, and the unconscious\u2014form what Freud calls the \"topographical\" model of the psyche. He later sought to respond to the perceived ambiguity of the term \"unconscious\" by developing what he called the \"structural\" model of the psyche, in which unconscious processes were described in terms of the \"id\" and the \"superego\" in their relation to the \"ego\".\nIn the psychoanalytic view, unconscious mental processes can only be recognized through analysis of their effects in consciousness. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary introspection, but they are capable of partially evading the censorship mechanism of repression in a disguised form, manifesting, for example, as dream elements or neurotic symptoms. Such symptoms are supposed to be capable of being \"interpreted\" during psychoanalysis, with the help of methods such as free association, dream analysis, and analysis of verbal slips and other unintentional manifestations in conscious life.\nJung.\nCarl Gustav Jung agreed with Freud that the unconscious is a determinant of personality, but he proposed that the unconscious be divided into two layers: the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is a reservoir of material that was once conscious but has been forgotten or suppressed, much like Freud's notion. The collective unconscious, however, is the deepest level of the psyche, containing the accumulation of inherited psychic structures and archetypal experiences. Archetypes are not memories but energy centers or psychological functions that are apparent in the culture's use of symbols. The collective unconscious is therefore said to be inherited and contain material of an entire species rather than of an individual. The collective unconscious is, according to Jung, \"[the] whole spiritual heritage of mankind's evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual\".\nIn addition to the structure of the unconscious, Jung differed from Freud in that he did not believe that sexuality was at the base of all unconscious thoughts.\nDreams.\nFreud.\nThe purpose of dreams, according to Freud, is to fulfill repressed wishes while simultaneously allowing the dreamer to remain asleep. The dream is a \"disguised\" fulfillment of the wish because the unconscious desire in its raw form would disturb the sleeper and can only avoid censorship by associating itself with elements that are not subject to repression. Thus Freud distinguished between the manifest content and latent content of the dream. The manifest content consists of the plot and elements of a dream as they appear to consciousness, particularly upon waking, as the dream is recalled. The latent content refers to the hidden or disguised meaning of the events and elements of the dream. It represents the unconscious psychic realities of the dreamer's current issues and childhood conflicts, the nature of which the analyst is seeking to understand through interpretation of the manifest content. \nIn Freud's theory, dreams are instigated by the events and thoughts of everyday life. In what he called the \"dream-work\", these events and thoughts, governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the \"primary process\" of unconscious thought, which is governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. The dream-work involves a process of disguising these unconscious desires in order to preserve sleep. This process occurs primarily by means of what Freud called condensation and displacement. Condensation is the focusing of the energy of several ideas into one, and displacement is the surrender of one idea's energy to another more trivial representative. The manifest content is thus thought to be a highly significant simplification of the latent content, capable of being deciphered in the analytic process, potentially allowing conscious insight into unconscious mental activity.\nNeurobiological theory of dreams.\nAllan Hobson and colleagues developed what they called the activation-synthesis hypothesis which proposes that dreams are simply the side effects of the neural activity in the brain that produces beta brain waves during REM sleep that are associated with wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, neurons fire periodically during sleep in the lower brain levels and thus send random signals to the cortex. The cortex then synthesizes a dream in reaction to these signals in order to try to make sense of why the brain is sending them. However, the hypothesis does not state that dreams are meaningless, it just downplays the role that emotional factors play in determining dreams.\nContemporary cognitive psychology.\nResearch.\nThere is an extensive body of research in contemporary cognitive psychology devoted to mental activity that is not mediated by conscious awareness. Most of this research on unconscious processes has been done in the academic tradition of the information processing paradigm. The cognitive tradition of research into unconscious processes does not rely on the clinical observations and theoretical bases of the psychoanalytic tradition; instead it is mostly data driven. Cognitive research reveals that individuals automatically register and acquire more information than they are consciously aware of or can consciously remember and report.\nMuch research has focused on the differences between conscious and unconscious perception. There is evidence that whether something is consciously perceived depends both on the incoming stimulus (bottom up strength) and on top-down mechanisms like attention. Recent research indicates that some unconsciously perceived information can become consciously accessible if there is cumulative evidence. Similarly, content that would normally be conscious can become unconscious through inattention (e.g. in the attentional blink) or through distracting stimuli like visual masking.\nUnconscious processing of information about frequency.\nAn extensive line of research conducted by Hasher and Zacks has demonstrated that individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (outside conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). Moreover, perceivers do this unintentionally, truly \"automatically\", regardless of the instructions they receive, and regardless of the information processing goals they have. The ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual's age, education, intelligence, or personality. Thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of procedural knowledge and experience, in general.\nCriticism of the Freudian concept.\nThe notion that the unconscious mind exists at all has been disputed.\nFranz Brentano rejected the concept of the unconscious in his 1874 book \"Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\", although his rejection followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness.\nJean-Paul Sartre offers a critique of Freud's theory of the unconscious in \"Being and Nothingness\", based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. Philosopher Thomas Baldwin argues that Sartre's argument is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.\nErich Fromm contends that \"The term 'the unconscious' is actually a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There is no such thing as \"the\" unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, \"of which we are unconscious\". If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious.\"\nJohn Searle has offered a critique of the Freudian unconscious. He argues that the Freudian cases of shallow, consciously held mental states would be best characterized as 'repressed consciousness,' while the idea of more deeply unconscious mental states is more problematic. He contends that the very notion of a collection of \"thoughts\" that exist in a privileged region of the mind such that they are \"in principle never accessible\" to conscious awareness, is incoherent. This is not to imply that there are not \"nonconscious\" processes that form the basis of much of conscious life. Rather, Searle simply claims that to posit the existence of something that is like a \"thought\" in every way except for the fact that no one can ever be aware of it (can never, indeed, \"think\" it) is an incoherent concept. To speak of \"something\" as a \"thought\" either implies that it is being thought by a thinker or that it could be thought by a thinker. Processes that are not causally related to the phenomenon called thinking are more appropriately called the nonconscious processes of the brain.\nOther critics of the Freudian unconscious include David Stannard, Richard Webster, Ethan Watters, Richard Ofshe, and Eric Thomas Weber.\nSome scientific researchers proposed the existence of unconscious mechanisms that are very different from the Freudian ones. They speak of a \"cognitive unconscious\" (John Kihlstrom), an \"adaptive unconscious\" (Timothy Wilson), or a \"dumb unconscious\" (Loftus and Klinger), which executes automatic processes but lacks the complex mechanisms of repression and symbolic return of the repressed, and the \"deep unconscious system\" of Robert Langs.\nIn modern cognitive psychology, many researchers have sought to strip the notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as \"implicit\" or \"automatic\" have been used. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior. Active research traditions related to the unconscious include implicit memory (for example, priming), and Pawel Lewicki's nonconscious acquisition of knowledge.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among these books are: the \"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\" (and a concise version titled \"Concise Rules of APA Style\"), which is the official guide to APA style; the \"APA Dictionary of Psychology\"; an eight-volume \"Encyclopedia of Psychology\"; and many scholarly books on specific subjects such as \"Varieties of Anomalous Experience\". The APA has also published children's books under the Magination Press imprint, software for data analysis, videos demonstrating therapeutic techniques, reports, and brochures.\nThe Psychologically Healthy Workplace program.\nThe Psychologically Healthy Workplace Program (PHWP) is a collaborative effort between the American Psychological Association and the APA Practice Organization designed to help employers optimize employee well-being and organizational performance. The PHWP includes APA's Psychologically Healthy Workplace Awards, a variety of APA Practice Organization resources, including PHWP Web content, e-newsletter, podcast and blog, and support of local programs currently implemented by 52 state, provincial and territorial psychological associations as a mechanism for driving grassroots change in local business communities. The awards are designed to recognize organizations for their efforts to foster employee health and well-being while enhancing organizational performance. The award program highlights a variety of workplaces, large and small, profit and non-profit, in diverse geographical settings. Applicants are evaluated on their efforts in the following five areas: employee involvement, work-life balance, employee growth and development, health and safety, and employee recognition. Awards are given at the local and national level.\nAPA style.\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) style is a set of rules developed to assist reading comprehension in the social and behavioral sciences. Used to ensure clarity of communication, the layout is designed to \"move the idea forward with a minimum of distraction and a maximum of precision.\" The \"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\" contains the rules for every aspect of writing, especially in the social sciences from determining authorship to constructing a table to avoiding plagiarism and constructing accurate reference citations. \"The General Format of APA is most commonly used to cite sources within the social sciences. General guidelines for a paper in APA style includes: typed, double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5\" x 11\") with 1\" margins on all sides. The font should be clear and highly readable. APA recommends using 12 pt. Times New Roman font.\" The seventh edition of the \"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\" was published in October 2019.\nDatabases.\nAPA maintains a number of databases, including PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycBOOKS, PsycEXTRA, PsycCRITIQUES, PsycTESTS, and PsycTHERAPY. APA also operates a comprehensive search platform, PsycNET, covering multiple databases.\nPsycINFO is a bibliographic database that contains citations and summaries dating from the 19th century, including journal articles, book chapters, books, technical reports, and dissertations within the field of psychology. As of January\u00a02010[ [update]], PsycINFO has collected information from 2,457 journals.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe APA was founded in July 1892 at Clark University by a small group of around 30 men; by 1916 there were over 300 members. The first president was G. Stanley Hall. During World War II, the APA merged with other psychological organizations, resulting in a new divisional structure. Nineteen divisions were approved in 1944; the divisions with the most members were the clinical and personnel (now counseling) divisions. From 1960 to 2007, the number of divisions expanded to 54. Today the APA is affiliated with 60 state, territorial, and Canadian provincial associations.\nDominance of clinical psychology.\nDue to the dominance of clinical psychology in APA, several research-focused groups have broken away from the organization. These include the Psychonomic Society in 1959 (with a primarily cognitive orientation), and the Association for Psychological Science (which changed its name from the American Psychological Society in early 2006) in 1988 (with a broad focus on the science and research of psychology). Theodore H. Blau was the first clinician in independent practice to be elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1977.\nPresidents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;APA Presidents from the present to 1892\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;: 2024 \u00a0Cynthia de las Fuentes\n 2023 \u00a0Thema Bryant\n 2022 \u00a0Frank C.

Stanley Hall\nDivisions.\nThe APA has 56 numbered divisions, 54 of which are currently active:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSexual orientation and gender identity.\nCause of sexual orientation.\nThe APA states the following:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.\nIn 1975, APA issued a supporting statement that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.\nConversion therapy.\nConversion therapy, also called reparative therapy, is the practice of attempting to change the patient's sexual orientation to heterosexual. The American Psychological Association (APA) task force report on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation concluded that conversion therapy was \"unlikely to be successful\" and involved \"some risk of harm\". In the task force's report, the APA recommends that therapists adopt an affirmative, supportive approach for clients who present for therapy to change their sexual orientation rather than attempting to convert their sexual orientation.\nThe APA adopted a resolution in August 2009 stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments. The approval, by APA's governing Council of Representatives, came at APA's annual convention, during which a task force presented a report that in part examined the efficacy of so-called \"reparative therapy\", or sexual orientation change efforts.\nThe \"Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts\" also advises that parents, guardians, young people, and their families avoid sexual orientation treatments that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and instead seek psychotherapy, social support, and educational services \"that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth.\"\nSame-sex marriage.\nThe APA adopted a resolution stating that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant rights, benefits, and privileges. It also filed an amicus brief in the federal court case in which Judge Vaughn Walker struck down California's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. The APA later praised the decision and denied the existence of any \"scientific justification\" for a ban on same-sex marriage.\nIn August 2011, the APA clarified their support of same-sex marriage in light of continued research suggesting that the same community benefits accepted as result of heterosexual marriage apply to same-sex couples as well. Clinton Anderson, then associate executive director of the APA and director of the Office on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns, said that, prior to this research, \"We knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in very significant ways, but we didn't know if that would be true for same-sex couples.\" Anderson also put forward the APA's view that merely allowing same-sex civil unions is an inadequate option: \"Anything other than marriage is, in essence, a stigmatization of same-sex couples. Stigma does have negative impacts on people.\"\nSex assignment.\nIn 2024, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and physicist Alan Sokal co-authored an op-ed in \"The Boston Globe\" criticizing the use of the terminology \"sex assigned at birth\" instead of \"sex\" by the APA, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dawkins and Sokal argued that sex is an \"objective biological reality\" that \"is determined at conception and is then \"observed\" at birth,\" rather than assigned by a medical professional. Calling this \"social constructionism gone amok\", Dawkins and Sokal argued that \"distort[ing] the scientific facts in the service of a social cause\" risks undermining trust in medical institutions.\nAPA internship crisis for graduate students.\nThe APA is the main accrediting body for U.S. clinical and counseling psychology doctoral training programs and internship sites. APA-accredited clinical psychology PhD and PsyD programs typically require students to complete a one-year, full-time clinical internship in order to graduate (or a two-year, part-time internship). However, there is currently an \"internship crisis\" as defined by the American Psychological Association, in that approximately 25% of clinical psychology doctoral students do not match for internship each year. This crisis has led many students (approximately 1,000 each year) to re-apply for internship, thus delaying graduation, or to complete an unaccredited internship, and often has many emotional and financial consequences. Students who do not complete an APA-accredited internship in the U.S. are barred from certain employment settings, including VA hospitals, the military, and cannot get licensed in some states, such as Utah and Mississippi. Additionally, some postdoctoral fellowships and other employment settings require or prefer an APA-accredited internship. The APA has been criticized for not addressing this crisis adequately and many psychologists and graduate students have petitioned for the APA to take action by regulating graduate training programs.\nWarfare and the use of torture.\nA year after the establishment of the Human Resources Research Organization by the U.S. military in 1951, the CIA began funding numerous psychologists (and other scientists) in the development of psychological warfare methods under the supervision of APA treasurer Meredith Crawford. Donald O. Hebb, the APA president in 1960 who was awarded the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961, defended the torture of research subjects, arguing that what was being studied was other nations' methods of brainwashing. Former APA president Martin Seligman spoke upon the invitation of the CIA on his animal experimentation where he shocked a dog unpredictably and repeatedly into total, helpless passivity. Former APA president Ronald F. Levant, upon visiting Guantanamo Bay, affirmed that psychologists were present during the torture of prisoners, arguing that their presence was to \"add value and safeguards\" to interrogations. Former APA president Gerald Koocher after being exposed as instrumental in rewriting ethics code, threatened to sue whistlowers and suggested that they were struggling with unresolved grief and that the concerned psychologists were \"opportunistic commentators masquerading as scholars.\"\nDuring the Iraq War, Amnesty International released a series of reports, calling attention to violations of the human rights of prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison and American detention camps, and the role of the United States and the United Kingdom in enacting these abuses. The reports called on the occupying powers to protect the human rights of any detained civilians by giving them a fair and timely trial, not detaining civilians arbitrarily, and treating all people ethically while in detention. Amnesty International also called for justice, by trying individual perpetrators of abuse for their crimes.\nDespite these reports, the Bush administration instituted \"enhanced\" interrogation techniques, stating publicly that reported abuses were isolated incidents, and not standard practice. Internal memos from the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed that an executive order by George W. Bush had sanctioned certain interrogation techniques, such as playing loud music, depriving prisoners of sleep, and stripping prisoners of their clothing.\nThe CIA reportedly required involvement from health professionals to continue its practice of \"enhanced\" interrogations on detainees, to maintain the lawfulness of their practices. Psychiatrists and medical doctors were reluctant to participate in interrogations, however some psychologists participated. A report by a group of psychologists alleges the same, implicating a number of APA officials as well.\nWhen it emerged that psychologists, as part of the Behavioral Science Consultation Team, were assisting interrogators in Guant\u00e1namo and other U.S. facilities on improving the effectiveness of the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", the APA called on the U.S. government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques and labeled specific techniques as torture. However, the APA declined to advise its members not to participate in such \"enhanced interrogations\". Finally, after the scandal broke, In September 2008, the APA's members passed a resolution stating that psychologists may not work in settings where \"persons are held outside, or in violation of, either international law (e.g., the UN Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions) or the U.S. Constitution (where appropriate), unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights.\" The resolution became official APA policy in February 2009. However, the APA has refused to sanction those members known to have participated in and, in some cases, designed abusive interrogation techniques used in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan interrogation centers.\nThe APA directive was in contrast to the American Psychiatric Association ban in May 2006 of all direct participation in interrogations by psychiatrists, and the American Medical Association ban in June 2006 of the direct participation in interrogations by physicians. An independent panel of medical, military, ethics, education, public health, and legal professionals issued a comprehensive report in November 2013 that \"charged that U.S. military and intelligence agencies directed doctors and psychologists working in U.S. military detention centers to violate standard ethical principles and medical standards to avoid infliction of harm.\" One group of psychologists in particular, the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, has been very harsh in its criticism of the APA stance on its refusal to categorically prohibit members from participating in any phase of military interrogations. They stated their continuing disagreement with APA leadership in an open letter posted on their website on October 31, 2012, in which they reiterated their condemnation of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques, and called for the APA to require its members to refuse participation in military conducted interrogations of any kind.\nAfter the abuses were made public, the APA created a task force called Psychological Ethics and National Security (PENS) and released a report stating that the APA Code of Ethics applies to psychologists working in any setting, and that psychologists do not facilitate or participate in any degrading or cruel behavior, referring back to the APA's 1986 Resolution Against Torture. The report also called on psychologists to report any suspected or observed inhumane treatment to the appropriate authorities and obey federal law.\nAmending the Ethics Code.\nIn February 2010, the APA's Council of Representatives voted to amend the association's Ethics Code to make clear that its standards can never be interpreted to justify or defend violating human rights. There is a history of similar issues with the Canadian Psychological Association. Following are the two relevant ethical standards from the APA Ethics Code, with the amended language shown in bold:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1.02, Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If psychologists' ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the Ethics Code and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code. Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1.03, Conflicts Between Ethics and Organizational Demands&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the demands of an organization with which psychologists are affiliated or for whom they are working are in conflict with this Ethics Code, psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the Ethics Code, and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code. Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights.\nIn its 2013 \"\"Policy Related to Psychologists' Work in National Security Settings and Reaffirmation of the APA Position Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\" the APA condemns the use of any of the following practices by military interrogators trying to elicit anti-terrorism information from detainees, on the ground that \"there are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether induced by a state of war or threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, that may be invoked as a justification.\"\nHoffman report.\nIn November 2014, the APA ordered an independent review into whether it cooperated with the government's use of torture of prisoners during the George W. Bush administration, naming Chicago attorney David H. Hoffman to conduct the review. On July 2, 2015, a 542-page report was issued to the special committee of the board of directors of the APA relating to ethics guidelines, national security interrogations, and torture. The report concluded that the APA secretly collaborated with the Bush administration to bolster a legal and ethical justification for the torture of prisoners. Furthermore, the report stated that the association's ethics director Stephen Behnke and others had \"colluded with important Department of Defense officials to have the APA issue loose, high-level ethical guidelines that did not constrain\" the interrogation of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. The association's \"principal motive in doing so was to align APA and curry favor with DOD.\" An APA official said that ethics director Stephen Behnke had been \"removed from his position as a result of the report\" and indicated that other firings or sanctions might follow.\nUltimately, the findings of the Hoffman Report revealed that the APA had an unfair bias towards prisoners due to the organization's relationship with the federal government. This resulted in a tidal wave of consequences for the APA. On July 14, 2015, the APA announced the retirement of its CEO, Norman B. Anderson, effective the end of 2015, and of Deputy Chief Executive Officer Michael Honaker, effective August 15, 2015, and the resignation of Rhea K. Farberman, APA's executive director for public and member communication. Anderson had been CEO since 2003.\nBan on involvement.\nFor at least a decade, dissident psychologists within and outside the APA, including the group WithholdAPAdues, had protested the involvement of psychologists \"in interrogations at CIA black sites and Guant\u00e1namo.\" Prior to the release of the Hoffman report, which undermined the APA's repeated denials and showed that some APA leaders were complicit in torture, the dissidents were ignored or ridiculed.\nOn August 7, 2015, just weeks following the release of the Hoffman report, the APA council of representatives met at the association's 123rd annual convention in Toronto, Ontario. At that meeting, the APA council passed Resolution 23B, which implemented the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from settings that operate outside international law, and banning the participation of psychologists in unlawful interrogations. With 156 votes in favor and only one vote against, the resolution passed with the near unanimous approval of council members. The adoption of Resolution 23B aligned the APA's policy with that of the American Psychiatric Association and that of the American Medical Association by prohibiting psychologists from participating in interrogations deemed illegal by the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Convention against Torture.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Implementation of the 2008 Membership Vote to Remove Psychologists from All Settings That Operate Outside of International Law (NBI #23B)&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Council is asked to approve the substitute main motion below that includes a revised resolution with a new title, Resolution to Amend the 2006 and 2013 Council Resolutions to Clarify the Roles of Psychologists Related to Interrogation and Detainee Welfare in National Security Settings, to Further Implement the 2008 Petition Resolution, and to Safeguard Against Acts of Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in All Settings. This resolution further aligns the APA policy definition for \"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" (in the 2006 and 2013 Council resolutions) with the United Nations (UN) Convention Against Torture and ensures that the definition applies broadly to all individuals and settings; offers APA as a supportive resource for ethical practice for psychologists, including those in military and national security roles; prohibits psychologists from participating in national security interrogations; clarifies the intended application of the 2008 petition resolution... and calls for APA letters to be sent to federal officials to inform them of these policy changes and clarifications of existing APA policy. The ban will not \"prohibit psychologists from working with the police or prisons in criminal law enforcement interrogations\".\nClass action lawsuit by members claiming deceptive dues assessments.\nIn 2013 a class action lawsuit was brought against APA on behalf of approximately 60,000 of its 122,000 members who were licensed clinicians. Those members paid an additional $140 practice assessment fee as part of their membership dues every year beginning in 2001 to fund the lobbying arm of APA, the APA Practice Organization (APAPO). The lawsuit accused APA of using deceptive means by representing that the assessment was mandatory for APA membership even though payment of the assessment was only required for membership in the APAPO. In 2015 APA settled the case by establishing a $9.02 million settlement fund to be used to pay claims made by members of APA who paid the practice assessment, as well as attorneys' fees and certain other costs. APA agreed to change its policies to make clear that the APAPO membership dues are not required for membership in APA.\nAnimal research.\nCurrently, the APA enforces ethical standards to protect nonhuman animal subjects from unnecessary harm during the research process. Some of the requirements for using nonhuman animals in research include: proper justification of the research, maintenance and inspection of appropriate housing for the animals, minimizing discomfort and stress whenever possible, and preference of noninvasive measures.\nDespite these guidelines, however, many advocacy groups exist to either reduce or eliminate animal research, arguing that it is unethical to capture animals and subject them to research procedures.\nEvidence-based practice.\nA current controversy among mental health professionals involves the use of the terms evidence based practice or evidence based treatment. Proponents of the evidence-based treatments movement argue that it is unethical to administer a therapeutic intervention with questionable research support when another treatment's effectiveness has been demonstrated for the client's condition, particularly when the intervention in question is potentially harmful (such as conversion therapy). Proponents argue that administration of an empirically questionable treatment violates the general Principle A of the ethical principles of psychologist: Beneficence and nonmaleficence (or \"do no harm\").\nCritics of the evidence-based practice movement note ethical concerns regarding the research and practice of evidenced-based treatments themselves. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of a range of treatments, including psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies, evidence-based practice is a term now associated only with short-term, manualized treatments which have been evaluated in randomized control trials. However, focusing only on randomized control trials is problematic when determining treatment efficacy. Among problems associated with this approach, one issue is that such trials are conducted on highly select patient populations. Thus, the relevance of these trials is unclear because real-world patients might differ from patients in such trials. Furthermore, while the public may assume evidence-based is synonymous for \"likely to help\", research studies indicate that most patients do not show meaningful improvement in so-called evidence-based treatments.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term MKUltra is a CIA cryptonym: \"MK\" is an arbitrary prefix standing for the Office of Technical Service and \"Ultra\" is an arbitrary word out of a dictionary used to name this project. The program has been widely condemned as a violation of individual rights and an example of the CIA's abuse of power, with critics highlighting its disregard for consent and its corrosive impact on democratic principles.\nProject MKUltra began in 1953 and was halted in 1973. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals without the subjects' consent. Additionally, other methods beyond chemical compounds were used, including electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and other forms of torture.\nProject MKUltra was preceded by Project Artichoke. It was organized through the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. The program engaged in illegal activities, including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects.74 MKUltra's scope was broad, with activities carried out under the guise of research at more than 80 institutions aside from the military, including colleges and universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.\nProject MKUltra was revealed to the public in 1975 by the Church Committee (named after Senator Frank Church) of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States (the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms's order. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings. Some surviving information about MKUltra was declassified in 2001.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nOrigin of the project.\nDuring the early 1940s, Nazi scientists working in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau during World War II conducted interrogation experiments on human subjects. Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Jewish, and other nationalities' prisoners of war. The aim of these experiments was to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Pl\u00f6tner, \"eliminate the will of the person examined.\" American historian Stephen Kinzer said that the CIA project was a continuation of these earlier Nazi experiments, as evidenced by MKUltra's use of mescaline on unwitting subjects, replicating previous Nazi experiments conducted at Dachau. Numerous Nazi scientists would be employed by the United States government after the war as part of Operation Paperclip, with some figures such as Kurt Blome becoming involved in MKUltra.\nAmerican interest in drug-related interrogation experiments began in 1943, when the Office of Strategic Services began developing a \"truth drug\" that would produce \"uninhibited truthfulness\" in an interrogated person. In 1947, the United States Navy initiated Project CHATTER, an interrogation program which saw the first testing of LSD on human subjects.\nIn 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency under the direction of General Walter Bedell Smith initiated a series of interrogation projects involving human subjects, beginning with the launch of Project Bluebird, officially renamed Project Artichoke on August 20, 1951. Directed and overseen by Brigadier General Paul F. Gaynor, the objective of Artichoke was to determine whether an individual could be made to involuntarily perform an act of attempted assassination. Morphine, mescaline and LSD were all administered on unknowing CIA agents in an attempt to produce amnesia in the subjects. In addition, Project Artichoke aimed to employ certain viruses such as dengue fever as potential incapacitating agents.\nAims and leadership.\nThe project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953. Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War. The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating foreign leaders with such techniques, devising several schemes to drug Fidel Castro. It often conducted experiments without the subjects' knowledge or consent. In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations but were unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.\nThe project attempted to produce a perfect truth serum for interrogating suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War and to explore other possibilities of mind control. Subproject 54 was the Navy's top-secret \"Perfect Concussion\" program, which was supposed to use sub-aural frequency blasts to erase memory; the program was never carried out.\nMost MKUltra records were destroyed in 1973 by order of CIA director Richard Helms, so it has been difficult for investigators to gain a complete understanding of the more than 150 funded research subprojects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs.\nThe project began during a period of what English journalist Rupert Cornwell described as \"paranoia\" at the CIA, when the U.S. had lost its nuclear monopoly and fear of communism was at its height. CIA counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton believed that a mole had penetrated the organization at the highest levels. The agency poured millions of dollars into studies examining ways to influence and control the mind and enhance its ability to extract information from resistant subjects during interrogation. Some historians assert that one goal of MKUltra and related CIA projects was to create a \"Manchurian Candidate\"\u2013style subject. American historian Alfred W. McCoy has claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of \"ridiculous\" programs so that the public would not look at the research's primary goal, which was effective methods of interrogation.\nApplications.\nThe 1976 Church Committee report found that, in the MKDELTA program, \"Drugs were used primarily as an aid to interrogations, but MKULTRA/MKDELTA materials were also used for harassment, discrediting or disabling purposes.\"\nOther related projects.\nIn 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program. The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971. The project was a joint project between the U.S. Army Chemical Corps and the CIA's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents, with a focus on incapacitating agents. Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques of producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements.\nBy March 1971, over 26,000 potential agents had been acquired for future screening. The CIA was interested in bird migration patterns for chemical and biological warfare (CBW) research; subproject 139 designated \"Bird Disease Studies\" at Pennsylvania State University. MKOFTEN was to deal with testing and toxicological transmissivity and behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans. MKCHICKWIT was concerned with acquiring information on new drug developments in Europe and Asia, and with acquiring samples.\nIn January 1957, the CIA started a subproject of MKUltra in effort to broaden their scientific research. \"Subproject 68\", conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal under the direction of psychiatrist Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, represents one of the most infamous and ethically controversial endeavors within the MKUltra program. This subproject aimed to explore innovative techniques for manipulating and controlling human behavior, particularly through the methods of \"psychic driving\" and \"depatterning\". Psychic driving involved subjecting patients to continuous playback of recorded messages, often with themes of self-improvement or identity reinforcement, while they were under the influence of powerful psychoactive substances such as LSD or barbiturates.\nExperiments on Americans.\nCIA documents suggest that they investigated \"chemical, biological, and radiological\" methods of mind control as part of MKUltra. They spent an estimated $10 million or more, roughly $87.5 million adjusted for inflation.\nDuring a hearing by the Senate Health Subcommittee, a testimony by the deputy director of the CIA stated that over 30 institutions and universities were involved in the experimentation program of testing drugs on unknowing citizens \"at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign.\" Several of these tests involved the issuing of LSD to unaware subjects in social situations.\nThe Army was subject to the testing of LSD which occurred in three phases. The first phase included over 1,000 American soldiers who willingly volunteered for testing of chemical warfare experiments. Phase two had 96 volunteers who were dosed with LSD in evaluation of the possibility of intelligence uses of the drug. The third phase included Project Third Chance and Project Derby Hat which conducted experiments on 16 unwitting nonvolunteer subjects that after receiving LSD were interrogated as a part of operation field tests.\nAfter retiring in 1972, Gottlieb dismissed his entire effort for the CIA's MKUltra program as useless. Files discovered in 1977 containing 700 pages of new information showed that experiments had continued until Gottlieb ordered the program halted on July 10, 1972.\nLSD.\nIn 1938, LSD was isolated by Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. The early directors of MKUltra became aware of the existence of LSD and sought to use it for \"mind-control\". In the early 1950s, MKUltra director Sidney Gottlieb arranged for the CIA to buy the entire supply of LSD for $240,000, which in 2024, would be $4,227,079. This LSD supply gave Gottlieb the ability to fulfill his experiment by spreading LSD to prisons, hospitals, institutions, clinics, and foundations in order to see how citizens would react to the drug without knowing exactly what was happening to them.\nEarly CIA efforts focused on LSD-25, which later came to dominate many of MKUltra's programs. The CIA wanted to know if they could make Soviet spies defect against their will and whether the Soviets could do the same to the CIA's own operatives.\nDocuments obtained from the CIA by John D. Marks under Freedom of Information in 1976 showed that, in 1953, the CIA considered purchasing 10 kilograms of LSD, enough for 100 million doses. The proposed purchase aimed to stop other countries from controlling the supply. The documents showed that the CIA purchased some quantities of LSD from Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland.\nOnce Project MKUltra started, in April 1953, experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts, and prostitutes \u2013 \"people who could not fight back\", as one agency officer put it. In one case, they administered LSD to a mental patient in Kentucky for 174 days. They also administered LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and members of the general public to study their reactions. The aim was to find drugs that would bring out deep confessions or wipe a subject's mind clean and program them as \"a robot agent\". Military personnel who received the mind-altering drugs were also threatened with courts-martial if they told anyone about the experiments. LSD and other drugs were often administered \"without\" the subject's knowledge or informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code the U.S. had agreed to follow after World War II. Many veterans who were subjected to experimentation later sought legal and monetary reparations.\nIn Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels within agency safehouses in San Francisco to obtain a selection of men who would be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD, the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors, and the sessions were filmed for later viewing and study. In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. They told subjects they would extend their \"trips\" if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people subjected to these interrogations were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this. Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.\nAt the invitation of Stanford psychology graduate student Vik Lovell, an acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey volunteered to take part in what turned out to be a CIA-financed study under the aegis of MKUltra, at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital where he worked as a night aide. The project studied the effects of hallucinogens and other psychoactive drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, AMT, and DMT on people.\nThe Office of Security used LSD in interrogations, but Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who directed MKUltra, had other ideas: he thought it could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed it could be given to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches, etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in \"normal\" settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, such as an operative who received the drug in his morning coffee, became psychotic and ran across Washington, D.C., seeing a monster in every car passing him. The experiments continued even after Frank Olson, an army chemist who had never taken LSD, was covertly dosed by his CIA supervisor and nine days later plunged to his death from the window of a 13th-story New York City hotel room, supposedly as a result of deep depression induced by the drug. According to Stephen Kinzer, Olson had approached his superiors some time earlier, doubting the morality of the project, and asked to resign from the CIA.\nSome subjects' participation was consensual, and in these cases they appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case, seven drug-addicted African-American participants at the National Institute of Mental Health Addiction Research Center in Kentucky were given LSD for 77 consecutive days.\nMKUltra's researchers later dismissed LSD as too unpredictable in its results. They gave up on the notion that LSD was \"the secret that was going to unlock the universe\", but it still had a place in the cloak-and-dagger arsenal. However, by 1962, the CIA and the army developed a series of super-hallucinogens such as the highly touted BZ, which was thought to hold greater promise as a mind control weapon. This resulted in the withdrawal of support by many academics and private researchers, and LSD research became less of a priority altogether.\nOther drugs.\nAnother technique investigated was the intravenous administration of a barbiturate into one arm and an amphetamine into the other. The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released.\nOther experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, alcohol and sodium pentothal.\nA 1955 MKUltra document details research objectives to identify drugs that could be used as cognitive enhancers, disease mimetics, euphoriants \u201cwithout letdown,\u201d and agents to diminish ambition, among other uses. The extent of testing toward these objectives is unclear given the deliberate destruction of most drug-related MKUltra files in 1973.\nHypnosis.\nDeclassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied hypnosis in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included creating \"hypnotically induced anxieties\", \"hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter\", studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, \"hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects\", and studying \"relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis\". They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.\nExperiments on Canadians.\nThe CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the \"psychic driving\" concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University, and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (US$766,936 in 2024, adjusted for inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there. The Montreal experiments research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA.\nIn addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His \"driving\" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were often carried out on patients who entered the institute for common problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions. His treatments resulted in victims' urinary incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents and thinking their interrogators were their parents.\nDuring this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of both the American Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Psychiatric Association. Cameron was also a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946\u20131947.141\nMotivation and assessments.\nHis work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Sutton, who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage. Although Sargant acted as a consultant for MI5, no evidence has emerged that his work with deep sleep treatment at St Thomas' hospital had any links with intelligence services.\nIn the 1980s, several of Cameron's former patients sued the CIA for damages, which the Canadian news program \"The Fifth Estate\" documented. Their experiences and lawsuit were adapted in the 1998 television miniseries \"The Sleep Room\".\nNaomi Klein argues in her book \"The Shock Doctrine\" that Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing \"a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources'. In other words, torture.\"\nAlfred W. McCoy writes, \"Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron's experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb's earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method\", referring to first creating a state of disorientation in the subject, and then creating a situation of \"self-inflicted\" discomfort in which the disoriented subject can alleviate pain by capitulating.\nSecret detention camps.\nIn areas under American control in the early 1950s in Europe and East Asia, mostly Japan, West Germany and the Philippines, the CIA created secret detention centers (black sites) so that the U.S. could avoid criminal prosecution. The CIA captured people suspected of being enemy agents and other people it deemed \"expendable\" to undergo various types of torture and human experimentation. The prisoners were interrogated while being administered psychoactive drugs, electroshocked and subjected to extremes of temperature, sensory isolation and the like to develop a better understanding of how to destroy and to control human minds.\nRevelation.\nIn 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by the Watergate scandal, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed. Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms's purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.\nIn December 1974, \"The New York Times\" alleged that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. That report prompted investigations by the United States Congress, in the form of the Church Committee, and by a commission known as the Rockefeller Commission that looked into the illegal domestic activities of the CIA, the FBI and intelligence-related agencies of the military.\nIn the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, Frank Olson, had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973. However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously and had headed MKUltra, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.\nThe congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator Frank Church, concluded that \"prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects.\" The committee noted that the \"experiments sponsored by these researchers[...] call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments.\"\nFollowing the recommendations of the Church Committee, President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited \"experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject\" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.\nIn 1977, during a hearing held by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to look further into MKUltra, Admiral Stansfield Turner, then Director of Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set of records, consisting of about 20,000 pages, that had survived the 1973 destruction orders because they had been incorrectly stored at a records center not usually used for such documents. These files dealt with the financing of MKUltra projects and contained few project details, but much more was learned from them than from the Inspector General's 1963 report.\nOn the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an \"extensive testing and experimentation\" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens \"at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign.\" Several of these tests involved the administration of LSD to \"unwitting subjects in social situations.\"\nAt least one death, the result of the alleged defenestration of Frank Olson, was attributed to Olson's being subjected, without his knowledge, to such experimentation nine days before his death. The CIA itself subsequently acknowledged that these tests had little scientific rationale. The officers conducting the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.\nIn Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a CBC news show, \"The Fifth Estate\". It was learned that not only had the CIA funded Cameron's efforts, but also that the Canadian government was aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. Cameron died on September 8, 1967, after suffering a heart attack while he and his son were mountain climbing. None of Cameron's personal records of his involvement with MKUltra survived because his family destroyed them after his death. A 1986 report found that Canadian government officials were not fully aware of Cameron's experiments.\n1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report.\nThe U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, the Department of Defense and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.\nThe quote from the study:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugs to thousands of \"volunteer\" soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to LSD, the Army also tested quinuclidinyl benzilate, a hallucinogen code-named BZ. (Note 37) Many of these tests were conducted under the so-called MKULTRA program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects\n\"CIA vs Sims\".\nIn \"CIA v. Sims\" (1985), the U.S. Supreme Court endorsed the mosaic effect to justify broad judicial deference under FOIA Exemption 3, allowing the CIA to withhold seemingly innocuous details about Project MKUltra on grounds that aggregated disclosures could expose intelligence sources, a rationale that has since granted the agency near-total immunity from FOIA and been broadly applied by lower courts.\nDeath of Frank Olson.\nSeveral known deaths have been associated with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. By 1951, Olson was a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher. In 1951 academic sources attributed the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning incident to ergot poisoning through a local bakery (which appeared to be plausible because ergot naturally contains lysergic acid, the chemical precursor to LSD).\nIn 1953, a few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research.&lt;br&gt;\nAmong Olson's concerns were:\nIn November 1953, Olson was given LSD without his knowledge or consent as part of a CIA experiment, and died after falling from a 13th-story window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson fell to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment \"with\" Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.\nIn 1975, Olson's family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby, though their apologies were limited to informed consent issues concerning Olson's ingestion of LSD.\nIn 1977, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Committee on Human Resources wrote:\nGiven the CIA's purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, may never be known.\nIn 1994, Olson's body was exhumed and cranial injuries indicated that Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window. This means the forensic evidence conflicted with the former official version of events by the CIA. The medical examiner termed Olson's death a \"homicide\".\nSince 2001 (or earlier), the Olson family disputes the official version of events. They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.\nA 2010 book alleged:\nOn November 28, 2012, the Olson family filed suit against the U.S. federal government for the wrongful death of Frank Olson. In 2013 (July) the case was dismissed, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government.\nIn the decision dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote,\nWhile the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family's suit], farfetched as they may sound.\nLegal issues involving informed consent.\nThe revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\nPreviously, the CIA and the Army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under the Feres doctrine.\nIn 1987, the Supreme Court affirmed this defense in a 5\u20134 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: \"United States v. Stanley\". The majority argued that \"a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.\" In dissent, Justice William Brennan argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of constitutional rights:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing a separate dissent, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential[...] to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.\nIn another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party, which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent and that Ritchie's behavior was typical of someone on LSD, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of MKUltra's victims or that LSD caused his robbery attempt, and dismissed the case in 2005.\nNotable people.\nDocumented experimenters.\nConfirmed experimenters:\nAlleged experimenters:\nDocumented subjects.\nConfirmed subjects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlleged subjects:\nIn popular culture.\nMKUltra plays a part in many conspiracy theories due to its nature and to the destruction of most records concerning it. This has also led to the idea that the human experiments performed by the CIA are ongoing in the present day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a prominent figure in the study of undue influence in social and religious contexts, and a proponent of the brainwashing theory of cults.\nSinger's main areas of research included schizophrenia, family therapy, brainwashing and coercive persuasion. In the 1960s, she began to study the nature of social and religious group influence and brainwashing, and sat as a board member of the American Family Foundation and as an advisory board member of the Cult Awareness Network. She was the co-author of the book \"Cults in Our Midst\".\nEducation.\nSinger was born in Denver, Colorado, to Margaret McDonough Thaler and Raymond Willard Thaler. Her mother was a secretary to a federal judge and her father was chief operating engineer at the US Mint. While attending the University of Denver, she played cello in the Denver Civic Symphony. She received her Bachelor of Arts in speech and a Master of Science in speech pathology and special education from the University of Denver. Singer received her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in clinical psychology from the University of Denver in 1943.\nCareer.\nAfter obtaining her PhD in clinical psychology, Singer worked at the University of Colorado's School of Medicine's department of psychiatry for eight years. In 1953, she started working at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where she specialized in studying the returned prisoners of war who had been brainwashed by their captors into denouncing the United States and supporting North Korea and China.\nIn the scientific community, Singer was best known and respected for her studies in schizophrenia and family therapy. She conducted research with the National Institute of Mental Health, the United States Air Force, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Singer was a guest lecturer of psychology at University of California, Berkeley, from 1964 to 1991, and she served as a faculty member and lecturer at other University of California campuses as well as the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of Rochester, and other institutions.\nSinger's work on family communication won her a place as one of the pioneers in the developing field of family therapy. As noted in one obituary, her collaboration with Lyman Wynne was particularly important. \nSinger began to study brainwashing in the 1950s at Walter Reed in Washington, DC, where she interviewed United States soldiers who had been taken prisoner during the Korean War. Beginning in the late 1960s, she expanded her studies in the field of cults and published a number of articles on mind control (\"psychological coercion\") and similar areas. She developed theories about how cults recruit and retain members (such as her Theory of Systematic Manipulation of Social and Psychological Influence) and was on the board of many of the major anti-cult groups and organizations in the United States. At one point, Singer interviewed Charles Manson.\nBy the 1970s, Singer was a leading researcher in the field of psychosomatic medicine, and became the first female and first psychologist President of the American Psychosomatic Society in 1974. She also served as a member of the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute review board and the American Family Foundation board.\nSinger testified as a brainwashing expert at the trial of Patty Hearst, presenting her conclusions that Hearst had been brainwashed, but outside the jury's presence. Singer described Hearst as \"a low-IQ, low-affect zombie\" and testified that by using speech patterns, she determined that Hearst was reading statements prepared by her captors. Prosecutors argued that Singer's testimony should not be presented to the jury because brainwashing had never before been accepted as a field of expertise upon which expert testimony could be presented. The judge decided in favor of the prosecution, and Hearst was convicted. Singer's testimony was widely reported, which increased her reputation as a brainwashing expert.\nSinger played a role in the \"Hillside Strangler\" trial of Kenneth Bianchi. Singer concluded that Bianchi had faked symptoms of multiple personality disorder, in order to escape responsibility for the murders of several women in Los Angeles. Later, she spoke about the trial on \"PBS Frontline\" in a special show entitled: \"The Mind of a Murderer.\" Singer asserted that Bianchi was a psychopath, and stated: \"He may simply be evil.\"\nHer expert testimony was no longer accepted after the report of the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control, of which she was chair, was rejected by the Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) of the American Psychological Association. Melton has written that afterward, courts began to shift toward accepting the position held by the great majority of scholars studying new religious movements, moving away from the minority perspective of Singer and others sympathetic to her brainwashing claims. According to Melton, this had significant consequences later on, since it meant that brainwashing could no longer be used as a defense for the practice of deprogramming.\nDIMPAC task force controversy and aftermath.\nIn the early 1980s, some American mental health professionals became well-known figures due to their involvement as expert witnesses in court cases against groups they considered to be cults. In their testimonies they presented theories of brainwashing, mind control, or coercive persuasion to support the legal positions of former group members against their former groups.\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) in 1983 asked Singer, who was one of the leading proponents of coercive persuasion theories, to chair a taskforce to investigate whether brainwashing or \"coercive persuasion\" did indeed play a role in recruitment by such groups. The task force was called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC). The task force completed its final report in November 1986. In May 1987 the APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC final report, stating that the report \"lack[ed] the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur,\" and also stating that the BSERP did \"not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue.\"\nSinger and her associate, sociologist Richard Ofshe, subsequently sued the APA, and a group of scholars and lawyers, in 1992 for \"defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy,\" and lost in 1994. In a further ruling, James R. Lambden ordered Ofshe and Singer to pay 80,000 USD in attorneys' fees under California's SLAPP-suit law. At that time, Singer and Ofshe declared their intention to sue Michael Flomenhaft, the lawyer that represented them in the case, for malpractice.\nSinger was subsequently not accepted by judges as an expert witness in four cases alleging brainwashing and mind control. After the report was rejected, Singer reworked much of the rejected material into the book \"Cults in Our Midst: The Hidden Menace in Our Everyday Lives\", which she co-authored with Janja Lalich.\nLandmark Education legal dispute (1996).\nIn 1996, Landmark Education sued Singer for defamation. Singer mentioned Landmark Education in \"Cults in our Midst\"; it was unclear whether she labeled Landmark Education as a cult or not. Singer issued a statement stating that she did not intend to call Landmark a cult, nor did she consider it a cult.\nAmanda Scioscia reported in the \"Phoenix New Times\" that Singer never called Landmark a cult, but that she described it as a \"controversial new age training course\". She also stated that she would not recommend the group to anyone, and would not comment on whether Landmark used coercive persuasion for fear of legal recrimination from Landmark.\nHarassment and death threat complaints.\nSinger faced harassment, including death threats and dead animals placed on her doorstep, from groups that disagreed with her views on cults. According to Richard Behar's article in \"Time\" magazine, Singer was an outspoken critic of Scientology and was known to travel under an assumed name to avoid harassment.\nHer criticism of cults and their brainwashing tactics resulted in harassment of Singer's family and students as well, including breaking into Singer's office, stealing students' term papers and sending notes to Singer's students. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", other examples included cult operatives going through Singer's trash and mail, picketing her lectures, hacking into her computer, and releasing live rats in her house.\nPersonal life.\nSinger was married to Jerome\u00a0R. Singer, a physicist and professor at University of California, Berkeley. The couple had two children.\nDeath.\nMargaret Singer died of pneumonia on November 23, 2003, in Berkeley, California, at the Alta Bates Medical Center at the age of 82. Singer was survived by her husband, two children, and five grandchildren.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
