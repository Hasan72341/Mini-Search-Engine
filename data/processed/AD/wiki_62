First conceived in 1854, the music was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10\u00a0June 1865 with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting. While performed by opera companies, Wagner preferred the term \"Handlung\" (German for \"plot\" or \"action\") for \"Tristan\" to distinguish its structure of continuous narrative flow (\"endless melody\") as distinct from that of conventional opera at the time which was constructed of mundane recitatives punctuated by showpiece arias, which Wagner had come to regard with great disdain.\nWagner's composition of \"Tristan und Isolde\" was inspired in part by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, as well as by his relationship with his muse Mathilde Wesendonck. The opera, which explores existential themes such as that of mankind's insatiable striving and the transcendental nature of a love beyond death, incorporates spirituality from Christian mysticism as well as Vedantic and Buddhist metaphysics, subjects that also interested Schopenhauer. As such, Wagner was one of the earliest Western artists to introduce concepts from the Dharmic religions into their works.\n\"Tristan und Isolde\" is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest achievements of Western art music, intriguing audiences with philosophical depths not usually associated with opera, and the \"terrible and sweet infinity\" of its musical-poetic language. Its advanced harmony, immediately announced by the famous opening \"Tristan chord\" of its prelude, marks a defining moment in the evolution of modern music, characterized by unprecedented use of chromaticism, tonal ambiguity, orchestral colour, and prolonged harmonic suspension. While these innovations divided audiences initially, the opera grew in popularity and became enormously influential among Western classical composers, providing direct inspiration to Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy.\nComposition history.\nWagner was forced to abandon his position as conductor of the Dresden Opera in 1849, as there was a warrant posted for his arrest for his participation in the unsuccessful May Revolution. He left his wife, Minna, in Dresden, and fled to Zurich. There, in 1852, he met the wealthy silk trader Otto Wesendonck. Wesendonck became a supporter of Wagner and bankrolled the composer for several years. Wesendonck's wife, Mathilde, became enamoured of the composer. Though Wagner was working on his epic \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", he found himself intrigued by the legend of Tristan and Isolde.\nThe re-discovery of medieval Germanic poetry, including Gottfried von Strassburg's version of Tristan, the and Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\", left a large impact on the German Romantic movements during the mid-19th century. The story of Tristan and Isolde is a quintessential romance of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Several versions of the story exist, the earliest dating to the middle of the 12th century. Gottfried's version, part of the \"courtly\" branch of the legend, had a huge influence on later German literature.\nAccording to his autobiography, \"Mein Leben\", Wagner decided to dramatise the Tristan legend after his friend, Karl Ritter, attempted to do so, writing that:\nHe had, in fact, made a point of giving prominence to the lighter phases of the romance, whereas it was its all-pervading tragedy that impressed me so deeply that I felt convinced it should stand out in bold relief, regardless of minor details.\nThis influence, together with his discovery of the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer in October 1854, led Wagner to find himself in a \"serious mood created by Schopenhauer, which was trying to find ecstatic expression. It was some such mood that inspired the conception of a \"Tristan und Isolde\".\"\nWagner wrote of his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and \"Tristan\" in a letter to Franz Liszt (16 December 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true happiness of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a \"Tristan und Isolde\", the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the 'black flag' that waves at the end I shall cover myself over \u2013 to die.\nBy the end of 1854, Wagner had sketched out all three acts of an opera on the Tristan theme, based on Gottfried von Strassburg's telling of the story. While the earliest extant sketches date from December 1856, it was not until August 1857 that Wagner began devoting his attention entirely to the opera, putting aside the composition of \"Siegfried\" to do so. On 20 August he began the prose sketch for the opera, and the libretto (or \"poem\", as Wagner preferred to call it) was completed by 18 September. Wagner, at this time, had moved into a cottage built in the grounds of Wesendonck's villa, where, during his work on \"Tristan und Isolde\", he became passionately involved with Mathilde Wesendonck. Whether or not this relationship was platonic remains uncertain. One evening in September of that year, Wagner read the finished poem of \"Tristan\" to an audience including his wife, Minna, his current muse, Mathilde, and his future mistress (and later wife), Cosima von B\u00fclow.\nBy October 1857, Wagner had begun the composition sketch of the first act. During November, however, he set five of Mathilde's poems to music known today as the \"Wesendonck Lieder\". This was an unusual move by Wagner, who almost never set to music poetic texts other than his own. Wagner described two of the songs \u2013 \"Im Treibhaus\" and \"Tr\u00e4ume\" \u2013 as \"Studies for Tristan und Isolde\": \"Tr\u00e4ume\" uses a motif that forms the love duet in act 2 of \"Tristan\", while \"Im Treibhaus\" introduces a theme that later became the prelude to act 3. But Wagner resolved to write \"Tristan\" only after he had secured a publishing deal with the Leipzig-based firm Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel, in January 1858. From this point on, Wagner finished each act and sent it off for engraving before he started on the next \u2013 a remarkable feat given the unprecedented length and complexity of the score.\nIn April 1858 Wagner's wife Minna intercepted a note from Wagner to Mathilde and, despite Wagner's protests that she was putting a \"vulgar interpretation\" on the note, she accused first Wagner and then Mathilde of unfaithfulness. After enduring much misery, Wagner persuaded Minna, who had a heart condition, to rest at a spa while Otto Wesendonck took Mathilde to Italy. It was during the absence of the two women that Wagner began the composition sketch of the second act of \"Tristan\". However, Minna's return in July 1858 did not clear the air, and on 17 August, Wagner was forced to leave both Minna and Mathilde and move to Venice.\nWagner would later describe his last days in Zurich as \"a veritable Hell\". Minna wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: I must tell you with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.\nWagner finished the second act of \"Tristan\" during his eight-month exile in Venice, where he lived in the Palazzo Giustinian. In March 1859, fearing extradition to Saxony, where he was still considered a fugitive, Wagner moved to Lucerne where he composed the last act, completing it in August 1859.\nPremiere.\n\"Tristan und Isolde\" proved to be a difficult opera to stage, and Wagner considered various possibilities for the venue. In 1857 he was invited by a representative of Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, to stage his operas in Rio de Janeiro (in Italian, the language of the Imperial Opera); he told Liszt he was considering settling in Rio, and that that city would be given the honour of premiering \"Tristan\". Wagner sent the Emperor bound copies of his earlier operas in expression of his interest, but nothing more came of the plan. He then proposed that the premiere take place in Strasbourg, following interest in the project shown by the Grand Duchess of Baden. Again, the project failed to eventuate. His thoughts then turned to Paris, the centre of the operatic world in the middle of the 19th century. However, after a disastrous staging of \"Tannh\u00e4user\" at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, Wagner offered the work to the Karlsruhe opera in 1861.\nWhen Wagner visited the Vienna Court Opera to rehearse possible singers for this production, the management at Vienna suggested staging the opera there. Originally, the tenor Alois Ander was employed to sing the part of Tristan, but later proved incapable of learning the role. Parallel attempts to stage the opera in Dresden, Weimar and Prague failed. Despite over 70 rehearsals between 1862 and 1864, \"Tristan und Isolde\" was unable to be staged in Vienna, winning the opera a reputation as unperformable.\nIt was only after King Ludwig II of Bavaria became a sponsor of Wagner (he granted the composer a generous stipend and supported Wagner's artistic endeavours in other ways) that enough resources could be found to mount the premiere of \"Tristan und Isolde\". Hans von B\u00fclow was chosen to conduct the production at the Nationaltheater in Munich, despite the fact that Wagner was having an affair with his wife, Cosima von B\u00fclow. Even then, the planned premiere on 15 May 1865 had to be postponed until the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, had recovered from hoarseness. The work finally premiered on 10 June 1865, with Malvina's husband Ludwig partnering her as Tristan.\nOn 21 July 1865, having sung the role only four times, Ludwig died suddenly \u2013 prompting speculation that the exertion involved in singing the part of Tristan had killed him. (The stress of performing \"Tristan\" has also claimed the lives of conductors Felix Mottl in 1911 and Joseph Keilberth in 1968. Both men died after collapsing while conducting the second act of the opera.) Malvina sank into a deep depression over her husband's death, and never sang again, although she lived for another 38 years.\nFor some years thereafter, the only performers of the roles were another husband\u2013wife team, Heinrich Vogl and Therese Vogl.\nPerformance history.\nThe next production of \"Tristan\" was in Weimar in 1874. Wagner himself supervised another production of \"Tristan\" in Berlin in March 1876, but the opera was only performed in his own theatre at the Bayreuth Festival after his death; Cosima Wagner, his widow, oversaw this in 1886, a production that was widely acclaimed.\nThe first production outside of Germany was given at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London in 1882; Tristan was performed by Hermann Winkelmann, who later that year sang the title role of \"Parsifal\" at Bayreuth. It was conducted by Hans Richter, who also conducted the first Covent Garden production two years later. Winkelmann was also the first Vienna Tristan, in 1883. The first American performance was held at the Metropolitan Opera in December 1886, conducted by Anton Seidl.\nSignificance in the development of Western music.\nThe score of \"Tristan und Isolde\" has often been cited as a landmark in the development of Western music. Throughout the opera, Wagner uses a remarkable range of orchestral colour, harmony, and polyphony, doing so with a freedom rarely found in his earlier operas. The first chord in the piece, the \"Tristan chord\", is of great significance in the move away from traditional tonal harmony as it resolves to another dissonant chord:\n&lt;score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\"&gt;\n \\new PianoStaff \u00ab\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new Voice \\relative c\" {\n \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n \\voiceOne \\partial8 b8\\rest R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.-&gt;(~ gis4 a8 ais8-&gt; b4~ b8) \\oneVoice r r\n \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\&lt; f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\&gt; d!4.)~\\p d8\n \u00bb\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\relative c {\n \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red &lt;f b&gt;2.( &lt;e gis&gt;4.)~ &lt;e gis&gt;8 r r\n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThe opera is noted for its numerous expansions of harmonic practice; for instance, one significant innovation is the frequent use of two consecutive chords containing tritones (diminished fifth or augmented fourth), neither of which is a diminished seventh chord (F\u2013B, bar 2; E\u2013A\u266f, bar 3). \"Tristan und Isolde\" is also notable for its use of harmonic suspension \u2013 a device used by a composer to create musical tension by exposing the listener to a series of prolonged unfinished cadences, thereby inspiring a desire and expectation on the part of the listener for musical resolution. While suspension is a common compositional device (in use since before the Renaissance), Wagner was one of the first composers to employ harmonic suspension over the course of an entire work. The cadences first introduced in the prelude are not resolved until the finale of act 3, and, on a number of occasions throughout the opera, Wagner primes the audience for a musical climax with a series of chords building in tension \u2013 only to deliberately defer the anticipated resolution. One particular example of this technique occurs at the end of the love duet in act 2 (\"Wie sie fassen, wie sie lassen...\") where Tristan and Isolde gradually build up to a musical climax, only to have the expected resolution destroyed by the dissonant interruption of Kurwenal (\"Rette Dich, Tristan!\"). Resolution of the music does not occur until the very end of the opera, after Isolde sings the closing excerpt commonly referred to as the \"Liebestod\" (\"Love-Death\"), after which she sinks down, \"as if transfigured\", dead onto Tristan's body.\nThe tonality of \"Tristan\" was to prove immensely influential in western Classical music. Wagner's use of musical colour also influenced the development of film music. Bernard Herrmann's score for Alfred Hitchcock's classic, \"Vertigo\", is heavily reminiscent of the \"Liebestod\", most evidently in the resurrection scene. The \"Liebestod\" was incorporated in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's surrealist film \"L'Age d'Or\". Not all composers, however, reacted favourably: Claude Debussy's piano piece \"Golliwog's Cakewalk\" mockingly quotes the opening of the opera in a distorted form, instructing the passage to be played \". However, Debussy was highly influenced by Wagner and was particularly fond of \"Tristan\". Frequent moments of \"Tristan\"-inspired tonality mark Debussy's early compositions.\nInstrumentation.\n\"Tristan und Isolde\" is scored for the following instruments:\n\"on-stage\"\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nIsolde, promised to King Marke in marriage, and her handmaid, Brang\u00e4ne, are quartered aboard Tristan's ship being transported to the king's lands in Cornwall. The opera opens with the voice of a young sailor singing of a \"wild Irish maid\" (\"Westw\u00e4rts schweift der Blick\"), which Isolde construes to be a mocking reference to herself. In a furious outburst, she wishes the seas to rise up and sink the ship, killing herself and all on board (\"Erwache mir wieder, k\u00fchne Gewalt\"). Her scorn and rage are directed particularly at Tristan, the knight responsible for taking her to Marke, and Isolde sends Brang\u00e4ne to command Tristan to appear before her (\"Befehlen liess' dem Eigenholde\"). Tristan, however, refuses Brang\u00e4ne's request, claiming that his place is at the helm. His henchman, Kurwenal, answers more brusquely, saying that Isolde is in no position to command Tristan and reminds Brang\u00e4ne that Isolde's previous fianc\u00e9, Morold, was killed by Tristan (\"Herr Morold zog zu Meere her\").\nBrang\u00e4ne returns to Isolde to relate these events, and Isolde, in what is termed the \"narrative and curse\", sadly tells her of how, following the death of Morold, she happened upon a stranger who called himself Tantris. Tantris was found mortally wounded in a barge (\"von einem Kahn, der klein und arm\") and Isolde used her healing powers to restore him to health. She discovered during Tantris' recovery, however, that he was actually Tristan, the murderer of her fianc\u00e9. Isolde attempted to kill the man with his own sword as he lay helpless before her. However, Tristan looked not at the sword that would kill him or the hand that wielded the sword, but into her eyes (\"Er sah' mir in die Augen\"). His gaze pierced her heart and she was unable to slay him. Tristan was allowed to leave with the promise never to come back, but he later returned with the intention of marrying Isolde to his uncle, King Marke. Isolde, furious at Tristan's betrayal, insists that he drink atonement to her, and from her medicine chest produces a vial to make the drink. Brang\u00e4ne is shocked to see that it is a lethal poison.\nKurwenal appears in the women's quarters (\"Auf auf! Ihr Frauen!\") and announces that the voyage is coming to an end. Isolde warns Kurwenal that she will not appear before the King if Tristan does not come before her as she had previously ordered and drink atonement to her. When Tristan arrives, Isolde reproaches him about his conduct and tells him that he owes her his life and how his actions have undermined her honour, since she blessed Morold's weapons before battle and therefore she swore revenge. Tristan first offers his sword but Isolde refuses; they must drink atonement. Brang\u00e4ne brings in the potion that will seal their pardon; Tristan knows that it may kill him, since he knows Isolde's magic powers (\"Wohl kenn' ich Irlands K\u00f6nigin\"). The journey almost at its end, Tristan drinks and Isolde takes half the potion for herself. The potion seems to work, but instead of death, it brings relentless love (\"Tristan!\" \"Isolde!\"). Kurwenal, who announces the imminent arrival on board of King Marke, interrupts their rapture. Isolde asks Brang\u00e4ne which potion she prepared and Brang\u00e4ne replies, as the sailors hail the arrival of King Marke, that it was not poison; rather, she has substituted a love potion in order to save Isolde from herself.\nAct 2.\nKing Marke leads a hunting party out into the night, leaving Isolde and Brang\u00e4ne alone in the castle. A torch is burning at the open door of Isolde's apartments. Isolde, listening to the hunting horns, believes several times that the hunting party is far enough away to warrant extinguishing the torch \u2013 the prearranged signal for Tristan to join her (\"Nicht H\u00f6rnerschall t\u00f6nt so hold\"). Brang\u00e4ne warns Isolde that Melot, one of King Marke's knights, has seen the amorous looks exchanged between Tristan and Isolde and suspects their passion (\"Ein Einz'ger war's, ich achtet' es wohl\"). Isolde, however, believes Melot to be Tristan's most loyal friend, and, in a frenzy of desire, extinguishes the flame. Brang\u00e4ne retires to the ramparts to keep watch as Tristan arrives.\nThe lovers, at last alone and freed from the constraints of courtly life, declare their passion for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart. It is only in night, he claims, that they can truly be together and only in the long night of death can they be eternally united (\"O sink' hernieder, Nacht der Liebe\"). During their long tryst, Brang\u00e4ne calls a warning several times that the night is ending (\"Einsam wachend in der Nacht\"), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other's arms. Marke is heartbroken, not only because of his nephew's betrayal but also because Melot chose to betray his friend Tristan to Marke and because of Isolde's betrayal as well (\"Mir \u2013 dies? Dies, Tristan \u2013 mir?\").\nWhen questioned, Tristan explains that he cannot reveal the reason for his betrayal to the King, as he believes the King wouldn't understand. He then turns to Isolde, who agrees to accompany him once again into the realm of night. Tristan further reveals that Melot has also fallen in love with Isolde. A fight ensues between Melot and Tristan, but at a critical moment, Tristan deliberately throws his sword aside, allowing Melot to stab him.\nAct 3.\nKurwenal has brought Tristan home to his castle at Kareol in Brittany. A shepherd pipes a mournful tune and asks if Tristan is awake. Kurwenal replies that only Isolde's arrival can save Tristan, and the shepherd offers to keep watch and claims that he will pipe a joyful tune to mark the arrival of any ship. Tristan awakes (\"Die alte Weise \u2013 was weckt sie mich?\") and laments his fate \u2013 to be, once again, in the false realm of daylight, once more driven by unceasing unquenchable yearning (\"Wo ich erwacht' weilt ich nicht\"). Tristan's sorrow ends when Kurwenal tells him that Isolde is on her way. Tristan, overjoyed, asks if her ship is in sight, but only a sorrowful tune from the shepherd's pipe is heard.\nTristan relapses and recalls that the shepherd's mournful tune is the same as was played when he was told of the deaths of his father and mother (\"Muss ich dich so versteh'n, du alte, ernst Weise\"). He rails once again against his desires and against the fateful love potion (\"verflucht sei, furchtbarer Trank!\") until, exhausted, he collapses in delirium. After his collapse, the shepherd is heard piping the arrival of Isolde's ship, and, as Kurwenal rushes to meet her, Tristan tears the bandages from his wounds in his excitement (\"Hahei! Mein Blut, lustig nun fliesse!\"). As Isolde arrives at his side, Tristan dies with her name on his lips.\nIsolde collapses beside her deceased lover just as the appearance of another ship is announced. Kurwenal spies Melot, Marke and Brang\u00e4ne arriving (\"Tod und H\u00f6lle! Alles zur Hand!\"). He believes they have come to kill Tristan and, in an attempt to avenge him, furiously attacks Melot. Marke tries to stop the fight to no avail. Both Melot and Kurwenal are killed in the fight. Marke and Brang\u00e4ne finally reach Tristan and Isolde. Marke, grieving over the body of his \"truest friend\" (\"Tot denn alles!\"), explains that Brang\u00e4ne revealed the secret of the love potion and that he had come not to part the lovers, but to unite them (\"Warum Isolde, warum mir das?\"). Isolde appears to wake at this and in a final aria describing her vision of Tristan risen again (the \"Liebestod\", \"love death\"), dies (\"Mild und leise wie er l\u00e4chelt\").\nInfluences.\nSchopenhauer.\nReading \"The World as Will and Representation\" by German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854 profoundly impacted Wagner and triggered in him a spiritual and artistic reassessment. Schopenhauer's pessimistic worldview, his emphasis on the primacy of \"Will\" as the fundamental force of existence, and his notion that music is the highest of the arts because it directly expresses the Will resonated deeply with Wagner. In response, Wagner composed works such as \"Tristan and Isolde\" and \"Parsifal\" whose libretti are pervaded with Schopenhauer's ideas and whose music dominates the opera. This is in contrast to Wagner's earlier theorizing in \"The Artwork of the Future\" (1849) that music, poetry, and drama should be balanced and serve as equal partners in the Gesamtkunstwerk.\nWagner gives heightened importance to music in \"Tristan und Isolde\", often regarded as his most symphonically rich work. Unlike his other operas, Wagner wrote some music material for \"Tristan\" prior to completing the libretto. The music itself embodies Schopenhauer's concept of the Will, a force that is inherently restless and never fully satisfied that drives all human urges and desires, leading to a cycle of longing and suffering. Wagner captures this in the musical structure of the opera through his use of unresolved harmonic tension and extreme chromaticism, creating a sense of perpetual yearning and lack of resolution. Only at the very end of the opera, when Isolde undergoes transfiguration and \"Love-Death\", does the musical tension finally resolve. The passion of the music is often referred to as being \"sensual\" and \"erotic\", this not only reflects the desires of the illicit lovers but is consistent with Schopenhauer's position that the sexual urge is the most powerful manifestation of the Will.\nWagner uses the metaphors of \"Day\" and \"Night\" in the second act to designate the realms inhabited by Tristan and Isolde. The Day represents the external world of social obligations, duties, and constraints\u2014embodied by King Marke's court, where Tristan and Isolde must suppress their love and live according to the norms and expectations of society. This is a world of falsehood and deception because it requires them to deny their true feelings. The Night, by contrast, represents the inner world of truth, love, and authentic existence, where Tristan and Isolde can express their love freely and fully. It is a realm where the constraints of the external world are suspended, and their deepest desires can be realized. However, this realm is also linked to death, as true fulfillment and unity can only be achieved beyond the physical world.\nSchopenhauer's philosophy distinguishes between the world as \"Phenomenon\"\u2014the world of appearances shaped by our perceptions and intellect\u2014and the \"Noumenon\", which refers to the underlying reality that is not directly accessible to us but is the true essence of existence. Wagner implicitly equates the realm of Day with Schopenhauer's concept of Phenomenon and the realm of Night with the concept of Noumenon.\nMysticism and Spirituality.\nIn the years leading up to 1857, when Wagner would set aside his work on \"The Ring\" to instead focus on \"Tristan und Isolde\", Wagner's interests were dominated by spiritual matters. In 1855 his attention turned to Indian religion, reading Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf's \"Introduction to the History of Indian Buddhism\", and Hindu texts published in Adolf Holtzmann's \"Indian Sagas\". In addition to \"Tristan\", this culminated in the conception of two additional operas at this time, \"Die Sieger\", based on the life of the Buddhist monk \u0100nanda, and \"Parsifal\", a Holy Grail quest based on the medieval poem \"Parzival\" by Wolfram von Eschenbach.\nWagner was interested in the Orient and already acquainted with Islamic mysticism prior to reading Schopenhauer in 1854, having written to his friend August R\u00f6ckel in September 1852 declaring the Persian Sufi poet Hafez to be the \"greatest of all poets\". Schopenhauer's discussion of German Christian mystics, such as Meister Eckhart, further piqued Wagner's interest in mysticism.\nWhen Tristan and Isolde willingly drink the potion at the end of act 1 but do not die, their eyes are opened to the illusions of material Day and to the higher spiritual insight of Night. Tristan celebrates the enlightenment brought about by the potion in act 2:\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\"&gt;\nOh hail the potion! Hail to the draft!\nHail to its magic's magnificent craft!\nThrough the gates of Death, to me it flowed,\nwide and open, for me it showed,\nthat which I've only dreamed to have sight,\nthe wondrous realm of Night!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nMythologist Joseph Campbell described this moment of drinking the potion as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...as [Tristan and Isolde] have already renounced psychologically both love as lust and the fear of death, when they drink, and live, and again look upon each other, the veil of m\u0101y\u0101 has fallen.\nM\u0101y\u0101 is a concept in the Indian religions that refers to the appearance of the material world, connoting a \"magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem\", and \"conceals the true character of spiritual reality\"; it finds its parallel in Schopenhauer's \"Phenomenon\". Tristan denounces the lying \"disguise\" of Day and resolves to yearn for and seek out only the \"Holy Night\":\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\"&gt;\nOh, now we are with Night anointed!\nThe treacherous Day, with envy pointed,\ncould part us with its disguise,\nbut no longer cheat us with lies!\nAmid the Day's deluded churning,\nremains one single yearning\u2014\nthe yearning for the Holy Night,\nwhere all-eternal's solely true\nLove does laugh with delight!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAfter expressing this sentiment, the famous act 2 love duet, the \"Liebesnacht\" (\"O sink hernieder, Nacht der Liebe\"), begins. Here, Tristan and Isolde dedicate themselves to eternal Night and wish that Day would never come again, instead dying a transcendental \"Love-Death\" together as the ultimate consummation of their love. The music builds to ecstatic, mystically-elated climaxes, where they imagine the dissolution of their individual egos and merging into unity with each other and \"supreme love\":\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\"&gt;\nTristan you, I Isolde, no longer Tristan!\nYou Isolde, Tristan I, no longer Isolde!\nWithout naming, without separating,\nnewly perceiving, newly igniting;\nendless, eternal, one-consciousness:\na heart fervently burning with supreme love's joy!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe themes of spiritual yearning in \"Tristan\" resonate with the introspective and passionate elements found in Christian mysticism, particularly the concept of \"unio mystica\"\u2014the soul's union with the divine. The character's relentless pursuit of an idealized love that transcends earthly bounds and the notion of love leading to a metaphysical union can be seen as parallel to the Sufi pursuit of \"fana\", the annihilation of the self in the universal presence of the divine.\nThe closing \"Liebestod\", Isolde's \"transfiguration\" sung before she dies, invokes Hindu and Buddhist sentiments. The German word for breath, Atem, is related etymologically to the Sanskrit word \u0100tman, meaning soul or eternal Self. Isolde sinking \"unconscious\" into a state of bliss is associated with the Buddhist concept of Nirvana, although Schopenhauer and Wagner at the time misunderstood this concept to imply a state of non-being:\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\"&gt;\nIn the unbounded swell,\nin the resounding call,\nin the world's breath, flowing in all!\nTo drown...\nto sink...\nunconscious...\nsupreme bliss!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWagner scholar John Pohanka has written on the spiritual influences in Wagner's works, commenting that they not only contribute material to the libretto but how the power of the Wagnerian music and drama can itself invoke a transformative, ineffable experience in some audience members comparable to a mystical experience.\nGiven the influence of Schopenhauer and the apparent framing of \"Tristan und Isolde\" as a tragedy, many have remarked on the opera's \"pessimism\". On this, British scholar George Ainslie Hight wrote in 1912:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Such is Wagner's pessimism: it is the pessimism of the Ved\u00e2nta philosophy; that is to say, it is most clearly formulated in that system, and in the Upanishads upon which it rests, but really it is the common basis of all religions. It breathes in the poems of Hafiz, in the philosophy of Parmenides, Plato, and the Stoics, in the profound wisdom of Ecclesiastes, in mediaeval mysticism, and the faith of the early Christian Church. Buddhism and Christianity are both pessimist in their origin.\nReactions.\nAlthough \"Tristan und Isolde\" is now widely performed in major opera houses around the world, critical opinion of the opera was initially unfavourable. The 5 July 1865 edition of the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" reported:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Not to mince words, it is the glorification of sensual pleasure, tricked out with every titillating device, it is unremitting materialism, according to which human beings have no higher destiny than, after living the life of turtle doves, 'to vanish in sweet odours, like a breath'. In the service of this end, music has been enslaved to the word; the most ideal of the Muses has been made to grind the colours for indecent paintings... (Wagner) makes sensuality itself the true subject of his drama... We think that the stage presentation of the poem \"Tristan und Isolde\" amounts to an act of indecency. Wagner does not show us the life of heroes of Nordic sagas which would edify and strengthen the spirit of his German audiences. What he does present is the ruination of the life of heroes through sensuality.\nEduard Hanslick's reaction in 1868 to the prelude to \"Tristan\" was that it \"reminds one of the old Italian painting of a martyr [Erasmus of Formia] whose intestines are slowly unwound from his body on a reel\". The first performance in London's Drury Lane Theatre drew the following response from \"The Era\" in 1882:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We cannot refrain from making a protest against the worship of animal passion which is so striking a feature in the late works of Wagner. We grant there is nothing so repulsive in \"Tristan\" as in \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", but the system is the same. The passion is unholy in itself and its representation is impure, and for those reasons we rejoice in believing that such works will not become popular. If they did we are certain their tendency would be mischievous, and there is, therefore, some cause for congratulation in the fact that Wagner's music, in spite of all its wondrous skill and power, repels a greater number than it fascinates.\nMark Twain, on a visit to Germany, heard \"Tristan\" at Bayreuth and commented: \"I know of some, and have heard of many, who could not sleep after it, but cried the night away. I feel strongly out of place here. Sometimes I feel like the one sane person in the community of the mad; sometimes I feel like the one blind man where all others see; the one groping savage in the college of the learned, and always, during service, I feel like a heretic in heaven.\"\nClara Schumann wrote that \"Tristan und Isolde\" was \"the most repugnant thing I have ever seen or heard in all my life\".\nWith the passage of time, \"Tristan\" became more favourably regarded. In an interview shortly before his death, Giuseppe Verdi said that he \"stood in wonder and terror\" before Wagner's \"Tristan\". In \"\", the writer and satirist George Bernard Shaw writes that \"Tristan\" was \"an astonishingly intense and faithful translation into music of the emotions which accompany the union of a pair of lovers\" and described it as \"a poem of destruction and death\". Richard Strauss, initially dismissive of \"Tristan\", claimed that Wagner's music \"would kill a cat and would turn rocks into scrambled eggs from fear of [its] hideous discords\". Later, however, Strauss became part of the Bayreuth coterie and writing to Cosima Wagner in 1892 declared: \"I have conducted my first \"Tristan\". It was the most wonderful day of my life.\" In 1935 he wrote to Joseph Gregor, one of his librettists, that \"Tristan und Isolde\" was \"the end of all romanticism, as it brings into focus the longing of the entire 19th century.\"\nThe conductor Bruno Walter heard his first \"Tristan und Isolde\" in 1889 as a student:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So there I sat in the topmost gallery of the Berlin Opera House, and from the first sound of the cellos my heart contracted spasmodically... Never before has my soul been deluged with such floods of sound and passion, never had my heart been consumed by such yearning and sublime bliss... A new epoch had begun: Wagner was my god, and I wanted to become his prophet.\nArnold Schoenberg referred to Wagner's technique of shifting chords in \"Tristan\" as \"phenomena of incredible adaptability and nonindependence roaming, homeless, among the spheres of keys; spies reconnoitering weaknesses; to exploit them in order to create confusion, deserters for whom surrender of their own personality is an end in itself\".\nFriedrich Nietzsche, who in his younger years was one of Wagner's staunchest allies, wrote that, for him, \"\"Tristan and Isolde\" is the real \"opus metaphysicum\" of all art\u00a0... insatiable and sweet craving for the secrets of night and death\u00a0... it is overpowering in its simple grandeur\". In a letter to his friend Erwin Rohde in October 1868, Nietzsche described his reaction to \"Tristan's\" prelude: \"I simply cannot bring myself to remain critically aloof from this music; every nerve in me is atwitch, and it has been a long time since I had such a lasting sense of ecstasy as with this overture\". Even after his break with Wagner, Nietzsche continued to consider \"Tristan\" a masterpiece: \"Even now I am still in search of a work which exercises such a dangerous fascination, such a spine-tingling and blissful infinity as \"Tristan\" \u2013 I have sought in vain, in every art.\"\nMarcel Proust, greatly influenced by Wagner, refers to \"Tristan und Isolde\" and its \"inexhaustible repetitions\" throughout his novel \"In Search of Lost Time\". He describes the prelude theme as \"linked to the future, to the reality of the human soul, of which it was one of the most special and distinctive ornaments\".\nRecordings.\n\"Tristan und Isolde\" has a long recorded history and most of the major Wagner conductors since the end of the First World War have had their interpretations captured on disc. The limitations of recording technology meant that until the 1930s it was difficult to record the entire opera, however recordings of excerpts or single acts exist going back to 1901, when excerpts of Tristan were captured on the Mapleson Cylinders recorded during performances at the Metropolitan Opera.\nIn the years before World War II, Kirsten Flagstad and Lauritz Melchior were considered to be the prime interpreters of the lead roles, and mono recordings exist of this pair in a number of live performances led by conductors such as Thomas Beecham, Fritz Reiner, Artur Bodanzky and Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad recorded the part commercially only near the end of her career in 1952, under Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler for EMI, producing a set which is considered a classic recording.\nFollowing the war, another classic recording is the 1952 performance at the Bayreuth Festival with Martha M\u00f6dl and Ram\u00f3n Vinay under Herbert von Karajan, which is noted for its strong, vivid characterizations and is now available as a live recording. In the 1960s, the soprano Birgit Nilsson was considered the major Isolde interpreter, and she was often partnered with the Tristan of Wolfgang Windgassen. Their performance at Bayreuth in 1966 under the baton of Karl B\u00f6hm was captured by Deutsche Grammophon \u2013 a performance often hailed as one of the best \"Tristan\" recordings.\nKarajan did not record the opera officially until 1971\u201372. Karajan's selection of a lighter soprano voice (Helga Dernesch) as Isolde, paired with an extremely intense Jon Vickers and the unusual balance between orchestra and singers favoured by Karajan was controversial. In the 1980s recordings by conductors such as Carlos Kleiber, Reginald Goodall, and Leonard Bernstein were mostly considered to be important for the interpretation of the conductor, rather than that of the lead performers. The set by Kleiber is notable as Isolde was sung by the famous Mozartian soprano Margaret Price, who never sang the role of Isolde on stage. The same is true for Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who sang the role of Tristan to critical acclaim in the 2005 EMI release under the baton of Antonio Pappano despite never having sung the role on stage. In the last ten years acclaimed sets include a studio recording with the Berlin Philharmonic by Daniel Barenboim and a live set from the Vienna Staatsoper led by Christian Thielemann.\nThere are several DVD productions of the opera including G\u00f6tz Friedrich's production at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin featuring the seasoned Wagnerians Ren\u00e9 Kollo and Dame Gwyneth Jones in the title roles. Deutsche Grammophon released a DVD of a Metropolitan Opera performance featuring Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner, conducted by James Levine, in a production staged by Dieter Dorn and a DVD of the 1993 Bayreuth Festival production with conductor Daniel Barenboim and featuring Waltraud Meier as Isolde and Siegfried Jerusalem as Tristan, staged by Heiner M\u00fcller. More recently Barenboim's production at La Scala, Milan, in the production by Patrice Ch\u00e9reau has also been issued on DVD. There is also a technically flawed, but historically important video recording with Birgit Nilsson and Jon Vickers from a 1973 live performance at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre antique d'Orange, conducted by Karl B\u00f6hm.\nIn a world first, the British opera house Glyndebourne made a full digital video download of the opera available for purchase online in 2009. The performance stars Robert Gambill as Tristan, Nina Stemme as Isolde, Katarina Karn\u00e9us as Brang\u00e4ne, Bo Skovhus as Kurwenal, Ren\u00e9 Pape as King Marke, and Stephen Gadd as Melot, with Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek as the conductor, and was recorded on 1 and 6 August 2007.\nA performance typically lasts approximately 3 hours and 50 minutes.\nConcert extracts and arrangements.\nThe \"Prelude and Liebestod\" is a concert version of the overture and Isolde's act 3 aria, \"Mild und leise\". The arrangement was by Wagner himself, and it was first performed in 1862, several years before the premiere of the complete opera in 1865. The \"Liebestod\" can be performed either in a purely orchestral version, or with a soprano singing Isolde's vision of Tristan resurrected.\nHowever, the first time the prelude and its opening \"Tristan chord\" was heard publicly was on 12 March 1859, when it was performed at the Sophieninselsaal in Prague, in a charity concert in aid of poor medical students, conducted by Hans von B\u00fclow, who provided his own concert ending for the occasion. Wagner had authorised such an ending, but did not like what B\u00fclow had done with it and later wrote his own. Wagner then included the prelude in his own three concerts at the Paris Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in January\u2013February 1860.\nWagner called the prelude the \"Liebestod\" (Love-death) while Isolde's final aria \"Mild und leise\" he called the \"Verkl\u00e4rung\" (Transfiguration). In 1867 his father-in-law Franz Liszt made a piano transcription of \"Mild und leise\", which he called \"Liebestod\" (S.447); he prefaced his score with a four-bar motto from the love duet from act 2, which in the opera is sung to the words \"sehnend verlangter Liebestod\". Liszt's transcription became well known throughout Europe well before Wagner's opera reached most places, and it is Liszt's title for the final scene that persists. The transcription was revised in 1875.\nWagner wrote a concert ending for the act 2 love duet for a planned 1862 concert performance that did not eventuate. The music was lost until 1950, then passed into private hands, before coming to the attention of Daniel Barenboim, who passed it on to Sir Antonio Pappano. The first recording of the Love Duet with the concert ending was made in 2000, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Deborah Voigt and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House under Pappano.\nAnother composer to rework material from \"Tristan\" was Emmanuel Chabrier in his humorous \"Souvenirs de Munich \u2013 quadrilles on themes from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde\". These were augmented and orchestrated by Markus Lehmann in 1988. Leopold Stokowski made a series of purely orchestral \"Symphonic Syntheses\" of Wagner's operas during his time as conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, bringing to concert audiences of the 1920s and '30s music they might not otherwise have heard. He made a 'long version' of music from \"Tristan and Isolde\" which consisted mainly of the act 1 prelude, the from act 2 and the from act 3. A shorter version of music from the 2nd and 3rd acts was called \"Love Music from \"Tristan and Isolde\"\". He made recordings of both versions on 78s and again on LP.\nThe British composer Ronald Stevenson has made two arrangements based on the opera. The first is \"The Fugue on the Shepherd's Air from Tristan und Isolde\" from 1999. Its composition was inspired by a lecture given by the Wagner biographer and chair of the Wagner Society of Scotland, Derek Watson, to whom the piece is dedicated. In a contrapuntal climax, Stevenson combines both the Shepherd's Air and Isolde's \"Liebestod\". The second is a setting, for voices and organ, of lines from Tom Hubbard's 1998 narrative poem in Scots, \"Isolde's Luve-Daith\", the premiere of which took place in Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh in March 2003.\nIn 2022, the music publisher Edition Peters published an arrangement of Prelude und Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for chamber ensemble (12 or 13 musicians).\nOther works based on the opera include:\nIn popular culture.\nAubrey Beardsley's pen and ink drawing \"The Wagnerites\" shows highly coiffured men and women attending a performance of \"Tristan und Isolde\". The drawing was first published in the Yellow Book, vol III [October 1894]. According to Stephen Calloway, \"Beardsley had an obsessive interest in Wagner, and avidly attended the London performances of the works. This depiction of the Wagnerian audience rather than the action of the opera identified by the fallen programme as \"Tristan and Isolde\", is one of the greatest masterpieces of Beardsley's mani\u00e8re noire. Sickert claimed to have warned him that the drawings in which the area of black exceeded that of white paper were bound to fail artistically, and to have 'convinced him' of the truth of this aesthetic rule. Fortunately Beardsley seems to have ignored the advice.\" The drawing is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe following year Beardsley produced a print depicting a stylised image of a woman, standing in front of a half length yellow curtain, wearing an ornate flowered hat and holding a large drinking vessel to her mouth. In the bottom right-hand corner is the word 'ISOLDE'. \"Isolde\" was first reproduced in colour lithography (red, green, grey and black) as a supplement to The Studio, October 1895. The drawing (in yellow, black and white) is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe opera forms the backdrop of Horacio Quiroga's tale of love lost, \"La muerte de Isolda\" (The Death of Isolde) from his collection \"Cuentos de amor de locura y de muerte\" (1917).\nIn Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film \"The Birds\", a recording of \"Tristan\" is prominently displayed in the scene in which Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) resignedly reveals to Melanie (Tippi Hedren) her unrequited love for Mitch. For Camille Paglia, the visual inclusion of the LP cover, with the opera's 'theme of self-immolation through doomed love' signifies that Annie is a forlorn romantic.\nDalit Warshaw's concerto for piano and orchestra, \"Conjuring Tristan\", draws on the opera's leitmotifs to recast the narrative and dramatic events of Thomas Mann's \"Tristan\" through Wagner's music. Warshaw was inspired by developments in Mann's mediation of the Tristan legend which see a former pianist's love for music rekindled by the opera's score.\nLars von Trier's 2011 film \"Melancholia\" prominently features music from the prelude.\nThe famous \"Liebestod\" is used in the soundtrack of the third episode of the first season of \"The Crown\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "38243", "revid": "50649442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38243", "title": "Suspension of disbelief", "text": "Allowing imagination when reading or viewing a fictional story\nSuspension of disbelief is the avoidance\u2014often described as willing\u2014of critical thinking and logic in understanding something that is unreal or impossible in reality, such as something in a work of speculative fiction, in order to believe it for the sake of enjoying its narrative. Historically, the concept originates in the Greco-Roman principles of theatre, wherein the audience ignores the unreality of fiction to experience catharsis from the actions and experiences of characters. \nThe phrase was coined and elaborated upon by the English poet and philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his 1817 work \"Biographia Literaria\": \"that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic\nfaith\".\nOrigin.\nThe phrase first appeared in English poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Biographia Literaria\", where he suggested that if an author could infuse a \"human interest and a semblance of truth\" into a story with implausible elements, the reader would willingly suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Coleridge was interested in returning fantastic elements to poetry and developed the concept to support how a modern, enlightened audience would continue to enjoy such types of literature. Coleridge observed that his work, such as his contributions to the \"Lyrical Ballads\", his collaboration with William Wordsworth, essentially involved attempting to explain supernatural characters and events in plausible terms so that implausible characters and events of the imagination can seem to be truthful and present a greater contrast between fiction and reality. Coleridge also referred to this concept as \"poetic faith\", citing the concept as a feeling analogous to the supernatural, which stimulates the mind's faculties regardless of the irrationality of what is being understood.\nColeridge recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object, to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us.\nThis concept had previously been understood in antiquity, particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace and Cicero who wrote in a time of increasing skepticism about the supernatural. In Horace's \"Ars Poetica\", he used the quotation \"Ut pictura poesis\", meaning \"as is painting so is poetry\". According to David Chandler, Coleridge also originally drew his notion from Johann Jakob Brucker's \"Historia Critica Philosophiae\" which cited the phrase \"assensus suspensione\" (\"suspension of assent\"); Brucker's phrase was itself a modernization of the phrase \"adsensionis retentio\" (\"a holding back of assent\") used by Cicero in his \"Academica\".\nConcept.\nThe traditional concept of the suspension of disbelief as proposed by Coleridge has been claimed - despite Coleridge's own statement quoted above - to be not about suspending disbelief in the reality of fictional characters or events, but the suspension of disbelief in phenomena that are regarded as implausible. This can be demonstrated in the way a reader suspends disbelief in supernatural phenomena themselves \u2014 simulating the feelings of a character that is experiencing the phenomena in the narrative of a story\u2014rather than simply the implausibility of the phenomena in a story.\nThe phrase \"suspension of disbelief\" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories. With a film, for instance, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. Early black-and-white films are an example of visual media that require the audience to suspend their disbelief for this reason. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.\nExamples in literature.\nSuspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by Shakespeare, who refers to it in the Prologue to \"Henry V\": \"make imaginary puissance [...] 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings [...] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass\". Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. Alexander Pope, notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in \"The Rape of the Lock\", one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural.\nPsychology.\nAmerican psychological critic Norman N. Holland provided a neuroscientific theory of suspension of disbelief. Neurally, when a person engages with a narrative in a work of fiction, the brain goes wholly into a perceiving mode, engaging less intensely with the faculties for acting or planning to act; \"poetic faith\" is a willing act that is supported by the value of a narrative that is being engaged with. When the person stops perceiving to think about what has been seen or heard, its \"truth-value\" is assessed.\nCriticisms.\nAesthetic philosophers generally reject claims that a \"suspension of disbelief\" can accurately characterize the relationship between people and \"fictions\". American philosopher Kendall Walton noted that if viewers were to \"truly\" suspend disbelief when viewing a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions that are impractical and contradict the safety of the leisure of viewing the movie. For instance, if this logic generally applied, then audience members would try to help endangered on-screen characters, or call authorities when witnessing on-screen murders.\nNot all authors believe that \"suspension of disbelief\" adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. J. R. R. Tolkien challenged this concept in \"On Fairy-Stories\", choosing instead the paradigm of \"secondary belief\" based on inner consistency of reality: in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what they read is true \"within\" the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an internally consistent fictional world, the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argued that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief, saying that from that point on, the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and so must make a conscious effort to suspend their disbelief or else give up on it entirely.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38245", "revid": "20322972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38245", "title": "Tosca", "text": "1900 opera by Giacomo Puccini\nTosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, \"La Tosca\", is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias.\nPuccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. \"Tosca\" premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.\nMusically, \"Tosca\" is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot\u2014musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it a \"shabby little shocker\"\u2014the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of \"Tosca\" and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.\nBackground.\nThe French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, but in modern times, unperformed. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, \"La Tosca\", which premiered in Paris on 24\u00a0November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.\nPuccini had seen \"La Tosca\" at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7\u00a0May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \"I see in this \"Tosca\" the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\"\nRicordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception \"La Tosca\" had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.\nIn 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment.\nWhen Puccini once again became interested in \"Tosca\", Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand gesture, saying, \"He has more talent than I do.\" American scholar Deborah Burton contends that Franchetti gave it up simply because he saw little merit in it and could not feel the music in the play. Whatever the reason, Franchetti surrendered the rights in May 1895, and in August Puccini signed a contract to resume control of the project.\nSynopsis.\nHistorical context.\nAccording to the libretto, the action of \"Tosca\" occurs in Rome in June 1800. Sardou, in his play, dates it more precisely; \"La Tosca\" takes place in the afternoon, evening, and early morning of 17 and 18\u00a0June 1800.\nItaly had long been divided into a number of small states, with the Pope in Rome ruling the Papal States in Central Italy. Following the French Revolution, a French army under Napoleon invaded Italy in 1796, entering Rome almost unopposed on 11\u00a0February 1798 and establishing a republic there. Pope Pius VI was taken prisoner, and was sent into exile on February 20, 1798. (Pius VI would die in exile in 1799, and his successor, Pius VII, who was elected in Venice on 14 March 1800, would not enter Rome until 3 July. There is thus neither a Pope nor papal government in Rome during the days depicted in the opera). The new republic was ruled by seven consuls; in the opera this is the office formerly held by Angelotti, whose character may be based on the real-life consul Liborio Angelucci. In September 1799 the French, who had protected the republic, withdrew from Rome. As they left, troops of the Kingdom of Naples occupied the city.\nIn May 1800 Napoleon, by then the undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14\u00a0June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were initially successful; by mid-morning they were in control of the field of battle. Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in the late afternoon, and Napoleon attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. As a consequence, soon after the events depicted in \"Tosca\" Rome was restored under the rule of Pope Pius VII.\nAct 1.\n\"Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle\"\nCesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel \u2013 his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.\nThe painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \"hidden harmony\" (\"Recondita armonia\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving.\nAngelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place.\nTosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing \u2013 she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. After Cavaradossi reassures her, Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\" (\"Do you not long for our little cottage\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: \"Quale occhio al mondo\" (\"What eyes in the world\").\nAfter Tosca has left, Angelotti reappears and discusses with the painter his plan to flee disguised as a woman, using clothes left in the chapel by his sister. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti a key to his villa, suggesting that he hide in a disused well in the garden. The sound of a cannon signals that Angelotti's escape has been discovered. He and Cavaradossi hasten out of the church.\nThe Sacristan re-enters with choristers, celebrating the news that Napoleon has apparently been defeated at Marengo. The celebrations cease abruptly with the entry of Scarpia, his henchman Spoletta and several police agents. They have heard that Angelotti has sought refuge in the church. Scarpia orders a search, and the empty food basket and a fan bearing the Attavanti coat of arms are found in the chapel. Scarpia questions the Sacristan, and his suspicions are aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti's escape.\nWhen Tosca arrives looking for her lover, Scarpia artfully arouses her jealous instincts by implying a relationship between the painter and the Marchesa Attavanti. He draws Tosca's attention to the fan and suggests that someone must have surprised the lovers in the chapel. Tosca falls for his deceit; enraged, she rushes off to confront Cavaradossi. Scarpia orders Spoletta and his agents to follow her, assuming she will lead them to Cavaradossi and Angelotti. He privately gloats as he reveals his intentions to possess Tosca and execute Cavaradossi. A procession enters the church singing the Te Deum; exclaiming 'Tosca, you make me forget even God!', Scarpia joins the chorus in the prayer.\nAct 2.\n\"Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening\"\nScarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace.\nShe enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa.\nScarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He is devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an unexpected turn on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be executed.\nScarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \"Vissi d'arte\" (\"I lived for art\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia is not interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself.\nSpoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi's execution. Scarpia hesitates to give the order, looking to Tosca, and despairingly she agrees to submit to him. He tells Spoletta to arrange a mock execution, both men repeating that it will be \"as we did with Count Palmieri\", and Spoletta exits.\nTosca insists that Scarpia must provide safe-conduct out of Rome for herself and Cavaradossi. He easily agrees to this and heads to his desk. While he's drafting the document, she quietly takes a knife from the supper table. Scarpia triumphantly strides toward Tosca. When he begins to embrace her, she stabs him, crying \"this is Tosca's kiss!\" Once she's certain he's dead, she ruefully says \"now I forgive him.\" She removes the safe-conduct from his pocket, lights candles in a gesture of piety, and places a crucifix on the body before leaving.\nAct 3.\n\"The upper parts of the Castel Sant'Angelo, early the following morning\"\nA shepherd boy is heard offstage singing (in Romanesco dialect) \"Io de' sospiri\" (\"I give you sighs\") as church bells sound for matins. The guards lead Cavaradossi in and a jailer informs him that he has one hour to live. He declines to see a priest, but asks permission to write a letter to Tosca. He begins to write, but is soon overwhelmed by memories: \"E lucevan le stelle\" (\"And the stars shone\").\nTosca enters and shows him the safe-conduct pass she has obtained, adding that she has killed Scarpia and that the imminent execution is a sham. Cavaradossi must feign death, after which they can flee together before Scarpia's body is discovered. Cavaradossi is awestruck by his gentle lover's courage: \"O dolci mani\" (\"Oh sweet hands\"). The pair ecstatically imagine the life they will share, far from Rome. Tosca then anxiously coaches Cavaradossi on how to play dead when the firing squad shoots at him with blanks. He promises he will fall \"like Tosca in the theatre\".\nCavaradossi is led away, and Tosca watches with increasing impatience as the firing squad prepares. The men fire, and Tosca praises the realism of his fall, \"Ecco un artista!\" (\"What an actor!\"). Once the soldiers have left, she hurries towards Cavaradossi, urging him, \"Mario, su presto!\" (\"Mario, up quickly!\"), only to find that Scarpia betrayed her: the bullets were real. Heartbroken, she clasps her lover's lifeless body and weeps.\nThe voices of Spoletta, Sciarrone, and the soldiers are heard, shouting that Scarpia is dead and Tosca has killed him. As the men rush in, Tosca rises, evades their clutches, and runs to the parapet. Crying \"O Scarpia, avanti a Dio!\" (\"O Scarpia, we meet before God!\"), she flings herself over the edge to her death.\nAdaptation and writing.\nSardou's five-act play \"La Tosca\" contains a large amount of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, but to make the characters' motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not really want to complete the project.\nThe first draft libretto that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences from the final libretto, relatively minor in the first two acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual \"E lucevan le stelle\", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head in her lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.\nLittle work was done on the score during 1897, which Puccini devoted mostly to performances of \"La boh\u00e8me\". The opening page of the autograph \"Tosca\" score, containing the motif that would be associated with Scarpia, is dated January 1898. At Puccini's request, Giacosa irritably provided new lyrics for the act 1 love duet. In August, Puccini removed several numbers from the opera, according to his biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, \"cut[ting] \"Tosca\" to the bone, leaving three strong characters trapped in an airless, violent, tightly wound melodrama that had little room for lyricism\". At the end of the year, Puccini wrote that he was \"busting his balls\" on the opera.\nPuccini asked clerical friends for words for the congregation to mutter at the start of the act 1 Te Deum; when nothing they provided satisfied him, he supplied the words himself. For the Te Deum music, he investigated the melodies to which the hymn was set in Roman churches, and sought to reproduce the cardinal's procession authentically, even to the uniforms of the Swiss Guards. He adapted the music to the exact pitch of the great bell of St. Peter's Basilica, and was equally diligent when writing the music that opens act 3, in which Rome awakens to the sounds of church bells. He journeyed to Rome and went to the Castel Sant'Angelo to measure the sound of matins bells there, as they would be heard from its ramparts. Puccini had bells for the Roman dawn cast to order by four different foundries. This apparently did not have its desired effect, as Illica wrote to Ricordi on the day after the premiere, \"the great fuss and the large amount of money for the bells have constituted an additional folly, because it passes completely unnoticed\". Nevertheless, the bells have continued to be a source of trouble and expense to opera companies performing \"Tosca\".\nIn act 2, when Tosca sings offstage the cantata that celebrates the supposed defeat of Napoleon, Puccini was tempted to follow the text of Sardou's play and use the music of Giovanni Paisiello, before finally writing his own imitation of Paisello's style. It was not until 29\u00a0September 1899 that Puccini was able to mark the final page of the score as completed. Despite the notation, there was additional work to be done, such as the shepherd boy's song at the start of act 3. Puccini, who always sought to put local colour in his works, wanted that song to be in Roman dialect. The composer asked a friend to have a \"good romanesco poet\" write some words; eventually the poet and folklorist Luigi \"Giggi\" Zanazzo wrote the verse which, after slight modification, was placed in the opera.\nIn October 1899, Ricordi realized that some of the music for Cavaradossi's act 3 aria, \"O dolci mani\" was borrowed from music Puccini had cut from his early opera, \"Edgar\" and demanded changes. Puccini defended his music as expressive of what Cavaradossi must be feeling at that point, and offered to come to Milan to play and sing act 3 for the publisher. Ricordi was overwhelmed by the completed act 3 prelude, which he received in early November, and softened his views, though he was still not completely happy with the music for \"O dolci mani\". In any event time was too short before the scheduled January 1900 premiere to make any further changes.\nReception and performance history.\nPremiere.\nBy December 1899, \"Tosca\" was in rehearsal at the Teatro Costanzi. Because of the Roman setting, Ricordi arranged a Roman premiere for the opera, even though this meant that Arturo Toscanini could not conduct it as Puccini had planned\u2014Toscanini was fully engaged at La Scala in Milan. Leopoldo Mugnone was appointed to conduct. The accomplished (but temperamental) soprano Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e was selected for the title role; Eugenio Giraldoni, whose father had originated many Verdi roles, became the first Scarpia. The young Enrico Caruso had hoped to create the role of Cavaradossi, but was passed over in favour of the more experienced Emilio De Marchi. The performance was to be directed by Nino Vignuzzi, with stage designs by Adolfo Hohenstein.\nAt the time of the premiere, Italy had experienced political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14\u00a0January.\nBy 1900, the premiere of a Puccini opera was a national event. Many Roman dignitaries attended, as did Queen Margherita, though she arrived late, after the first act. The Prime Minister of Italy, Luigi Pelloux was present, with several members of his cabinet. A number of Puccini's operatic rivals were there, including Franchetti, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea and Ildebrando Pizzetti. Shortly after the curtain was raised there was a disturbance in the back of the theatre, caused by latecomers attempting to enter the auditorium, and a shout of \"Bring down the curtain!\", at which Mugnone stopped the orchestra. A few moments later the opera began again, and proceeded without further disruption.\nThe performance, while not quite the triumph that Puccini had hoped for, was generally successful, with numerous encores. Much of the critical and press reaction was lukewarm, often blaming Illica's libretto. In response, Illica condemned Puccini for treating his librettists \"like stagehands\" and reducing the text to a shadow of its original form. Nevertheless, any public doubts about \"Tosca\" soon vanished; the premiere was followed by twenty performances, all given to packed houses.\nSubsequent productions.\nThe Milan premiere at La Scala took place under Toscanini on 17\u00a0March 1900. Darcl\u00e9e and Giraldoni reprised their roles; the prominent tenor Giuseppe Borgatti replaced De Marchi as Cavaradossi. The opera was a great success at La Scala, and played to full houses.\nThe first known performance of \"Tosca\" outside Italy was in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The opera was produced at the Teatro de la Opera on 16 June 1900. The cast included Emma Carelli as Tosca, and De Marchi (Cavaradossi) and Giraldoni (Scarpia), who had sung those roles in the world premiere in Rome.\nPuccini travelled to London for the British premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 12\u00a0July, with Milka Ternina and Fernando De Lucia as the doomed lovers and Antonio Scotti as Scarpia. Puccini wrote that \"Tosca\" was \"[a] complete triumph\", and Ricordi's London representative quickly signed a contract to take \"Tosca\" to New York. The premiere at the Metropolitan Opera was on 4\u00a0February 1901, with De Lucia's replacement by Giuseppe Cremonini the only change from the London cast. For its French premiere at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 13\u00a0October 1903, the 72-year-old Sardou took charge of all the action on the stage. Puccini was delighted with the public's reception of the work in Paris, despite adverse comments from critics. The opera was subsequently premiered at venues throughout Europe, the Americas, Australia and the Far East; by the outbreak of war in 1914 it had been performed in more than 50 cities worldwide.\nAmong the prominent early Toscas was Emmy Destinn, who sang the role regularly in a long-standing partnership with the tenor Enrico Caruso. Maria Jeritza, over many years at the Met and in Vienna, brought her own distinctive style to the role, and was said to be Puccini's favorite Tosca. Jeritza was the first to deliver \"Vissi d'arte\" from a prone position, having fallen to the stage while eluding the grasp of Scarpia. This was a great success, and Jeritza sang the aria while on the floor thereafter. Of her successors, opera enthusiasts tend to consider Maria Callas as the supreme interpreter of the role, largely on the basis of her performances at the Royal Opera House in 1964, with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia. This production, by Franco Zeffirelli, remained in continuous use at Covent Garden for more than 40 years until replaced in 2006 by a new staging, which premiered with Angela Gheorghiu. Callas had first sung Tosca at age\u00a018 in a performance given in Greek, in the Greek National Opera in Athens on 27\u00a0August 1942. Tosca was also her last on-stage operatic role, in a special charity performance at the Royal Opera House on 7\u00a0May 1965.\nAmong non-traditional productions, Luca Ronconi, in 1996 at La Scala, used distorted and fractured scenery to represent the twists of fate reflected in the plot. Jonathan Miller, in a 1986 production for the 49th \"Maggio Musicale Fiorentino\", transferred the action to Nazi-occupied Rome in 1944, with Scarpia as head of the fascist police. In Philipp Himmelmann's production on the Lake Stage at the Bregenz Festival in 2007 the act 1 set, designed by Johannes Leiacker, was dominated by a huge Orwellian \"Big Brother\" eye. The iris opens and closes to reveal surreal scenes beyond the action. This production updates the story to a modern Mafia scenario, with special effects \"worthy of a Bond film\".\nIn 1992 a television version of the opera was filmed at the locations prescribed by Puccini, at the times of day at which each act takes place. Featuring Catherine Malfitano, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Ruggero Raimondi, the performance was broadcast live throughout Europe. Luciano Pavarotti, who sang Cavaradossi from the late 1970s, appeared in a special performance in Rome, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo as conductor, on 14\u00a0January 2000, to celebrate the opera's centenary. Pavarotti's last stage performance was as Cavaradossi at the Met, on 13\u00a0March 2004.\nEarly Cavaradossis played the part as if the painter believed that he was reprieved, and would survive the \"mock\" execution. Beniamino Gigli, who performed the role many times in his forty-year operatic career, was one of the first to assume that the painter knows, or strongly suspects, that he will be shot. Gigli wrote in his autobiography: \"he is certain that these are their last moments together on earth, and that he is about to die\". Domingo, the dominant Cavaradossi of the 1970s and 1980s, concurred, stating in a 1985 interview that he had long played the part that way. Gobbi, who in his later years often directed the opera, commented, \"Unlike Floria, Cavaradossi knows that Scarpia never yields, though he pretends to believe in order to delay the pain for Tosca.\"\nCritical reception.\nThe enduring popularity of \"Tosca\" has not been matched by consistent critical enthusiasm. After the premiere, Ippolito Valetta of \"Nuova antologia\" wrote, \"[Puccini] finds in his palette all colours, all shades; in his hands, the instrumental texture becomes completely supple, the gradations of sonority are innumerable, the blend unfailingly grateful to the ear.\" However, one critic described act\u00a02 as overly long and wordy; another echoed Illica and Giacosa in stating that the rush of action did not permit enough lyricism, to the great detriment of the music. A third called the opera \"three hours of noise\".\nThe critics gave the work a generally kinder reception in London, where \"The Times\" called Puccini \"a master in the art of poignant expression\", and praised the \"wonderful skill and sustained power\" of the music. In \"The Musical Times\", Puccini's score was admired for its sincerity and \"strength of utterance.\" After the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Faur\u00e9 was offended by \"disconcerting vulgarities\". In the 1950s, the young musicologist Joseph Kerman described \"Tosca\" as a \"shabby little shocker.\"; in response the conductor Thomas Beecham remarked that anything Kerman says about Puccini \"can safely be ignored\". Writing half a century after the premiere, the veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the \"enormously difficult business of boiling [Sardou's] play down for operatic purposes\", thought that the subtleties of Sardou's original plot are handled \"very lamely\", so that \"much of what happens, and why, is unintelligible to the spectator\". Overall, however, Newman delivered a more positive judgement: \"[Puccini's] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, but no one else has performed the same tricks nearly as well\". Opera scholar Julian Budden remarks on Puccini's \"inept handling of the political element\", but still hails the work as \"a triumph of pure theatre\". Music critic Charles Osborne ascribes \"Tosca\"'s immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in \"Vissi d'arte\" and \"E lucevan le stelle\". The work remains popular today: according to Operabase, it ranks as fifth in the world with 540 performances given in the five seasons 2009\u201310 to 2013\u201314.\nMusic.\nGeneral style.\nBy the end of the 19th century the classic form of opera structure, in which arias, duets and other set-piece vocal numbers are interspersed with passages of recitative or dialogue, had been largely abandoned, even in Italy. Operas were \"through-composed\", with a continuous stream of music which in some cases eliminated all identifiable set-pieces. In what critic Edward Greenfield calls the \"Grand Tune\" concept, Puccini retains a limited number of set-pieces, distinguished from their musical surroundings by their memorable melodies. Even in the passages linking these \"Grand Tunes\", Puccini maintains a strong degree of lyricism and only rarely resorts to recitative.\nBudden describes \"Tosca\" as the most Wagnerian of Puccini's scores, in its use of musical leitmotifs. Unlike Wagner, Puccini does not develop or modify his motifs, nor weave them into the music symphonically, but uses them to refer to characters, objects and ideas, and as reminders within the narrative. The most potent of these motifs is the sequence of three very loud and strident chords which open the opera and which represent the evil character of Scarpia\u2014or perhaps, Charles Osborne proposes, the violent atmosphere that pervades the entire opera. Budden has suggested that Scarpia's tyranny, lechery and lust form \"the dynamic engine that ignites the drama\". Other motifs identify Tosca herself, the love of Tosca and Cavaradossi, the fugitive Angelotti, the semi-comical character of the sacristan in act 1 and the theme of torture in act 2.\nAct 1.\nThe opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \"fugitive\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \"Grand Tunes\", Cavaradossi's \"Recondita armonia\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.\nAfter Tosca's \"Non la sospiri\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \"Qual'occhio\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \"fugitive\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation. In Scarpia's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious atmosphere, for which Puccini draws on music from his then unpublished Mass of 1880. The final scene in the act is a juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane, as Scarpia's lustful reverie is sung alongside the swelling Te Deum chorus. He joins with the chorus in the final statement \"Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur\" (\"Everlasting Father, all the earth worships thee\"), before the act ends with a thunderous restatement of the Scarpia motif.\nAct 2.\nIn the second act of \"Tosca\", according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \"torture\" motif\u2014an \"ideogram of suffering\", according to Budden\u2014is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\". The cantata is most likely the \"Cantata a Giove\", in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.\nOsborne describes the scenes that follow\u2014Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca\u2014as Puccini's musical equivalent of \"grand guignol\" to which Cavaradossi's brief \"Vittoria! Vittoria!\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \"Gi\u00e0, mi dicon venal\" (\"Yes, they say I am venal\") is closely followed by Tosca's \"Vissi d'arte\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\" (\"All Rome trembled before him\"), sung on a middle C\u266f monotone (sometimes spoken), the music gradually fades, ending what Newman calls \"the most impressively macabre scene in all opera.\" The final notes in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, softly, in a minor key.\nAct 3.\nThe third act's tranquil beginning provides a brief respite from the drama. An introductory 16-bar theme for the horns will later be sung by Cavaradossi and Tosca in their final duet. The orchestral prelude which follows portrays the Roman dawn; the pastoral aura is accentuated by the shepherd boy's song, and the sounds of sheep bells and church bells, the authenticity of the latter validated by Puccini's early morning visits to Rome. Themes reminiscent of Scarpia, Tosca and Cavaradossi emerge in the music, which changes tone as the drama resumes with Cavaradossi's entrance, to an orchestral statement of what becomes the melody of his aria \"E lucevan le stelle\".\nThis is a farewell to love and life, \"an anguished lament and grief built around the words 'muoio disperato' (I die in despair)\". Puccini insisted on the inclusion of these words, and later stated that admirers of the aria had treble cause to be grateful to him: for composing the music, for having the lyrics written, and \"for declining expert advice to throw the result in the waste-paper basket\". The lovers' final duet \"Amaro sol per te\", which concludes with the act's opening horn music, did not equate with Ricordi's idea of a transcendental love duet which would be a fitting climax to the opera. Puccini justified his musical treatment by citing Tosca's preoccupation with teaching Cavaradossi to feign death.\nIn the execution scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates the two parts of act\u00a01 in Wagner's \"Parsifal\". In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of \"E lucevan le stelle\" is played \"tutta forze\" (as loudly as possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Kerman mocked the final music, \"Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams the first thing that comes into its head.\" Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: \"The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives the end of the opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini's papers, can never truly be resolved.\"\nInstrumentation.\n\"Tosca\" is scored for three flutes (the second and third doubling piccolo); two oboes; one English horn; two clarinets in B-flat; one bass clarinet in B-flat; two bassoons; one contrabassoon; four French horns in F and E; three trumpets in F; three tenor trombones; one bass trombone; a percussion section with timpani, cymbals, cannon, one triangle, one bass drum, one glockenspiel, and six church bells; one celesta, one pipe organ; one harp; and strings.\nRecordings.\nThe first complete \"Tosca\" recording was made in 1918, using the acoustic process. The conductor, Carlo Sabajno, had been the Gramophone Company's house conductor since 1904; he had made early complete recordings of several operas, including Verdi's \"La traviata\" and \"Rigoletto\", before tackling \"Tosca\" with a largely unknown cast, featuring the Italian soprano Lya Remondini in the title role. The next year, in 1919, Sabajno recorded \"Tosca\" again, this time with more well-known singers, including Valentina Bartolomasi and Attilio Salvaneschi as Tosca and Cavaradossi. Ten years later, in 1929, Sabajno returned to the opera for the third time, recording it, by the electrical process, with the orchestra and chorus of the Teatro alla Scala and with stars Carmen Melis and Apollo Granforte in the roles of Tosca and Scarpia. In 1938 His Master's Voice secured the services of the renowned tenor Beniamino Gigli, together with the soprano Maria Caniglia as Tosca and conductor Oliviero De Fabritiis, for a \"practically complete\" recording that extended over 14 double-sided shellac discs.\nIn the post-war period, following the invention of long-playing records, \"Tosca\" recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. In 1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, she made the recording for EMI which for decades has been considered the best of all the recorded performances of the opera. She recorded the role again for EMI in stereo in 1964. A number of Callas's live stage performances of \"Tosca\" were also preserved. The earliest were two performances in Mexico City, in 1950 and 1952, and the last was in London in 1965. The first stereo recording of the opera was made in 1957 by RCA Victor. Erich Leinsdorf conducted the Rome Opera House orchestra and chorus with Zinka Milanov as Tosca, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling as Cavaradossi and Leonard Warren as Scarpia. Herbert von Karajan's acclaimed performance with the Vienna State Opera was in 1963, with Leontyne Price, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Giuseppe Taddei in the leading roles.\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw a proliferation of \"Tosca\" recordings of both studio and live performances. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo made his first recording of Cavaradossi for RCA in 1972, and he continued to record other versions at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976, he was joined by his son, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Jr., who sang the shepherd boy's song in a filmed version with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have included Antonio Pappano's 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Recordings of \"Tosca\" in languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued. An admired English language version was released in 1995 in which David Parry led the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast. Since the late 1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD). These include recent productions and remastered versions of historic performances.\nEditions and amendments.\nThe orchestral score of \"Tosca\" was published in late 1899 by Casa Ricordi. Despite some dissatisfaction expressed by Ricordi concerning the final act, the score remained relatively unchanged in the 1909 edition. An unamended edition was published by Dover Press in 1991.\nThe 1909 score contains a number of minor changes from the autograph score. Some are changes of phrase: Cavaradossi's reply to the sacristan when he asks if the painter is doing penance is changed from \"Pranzai\" (\"I have eaten.\") to \"Fame non ho\" (\"I am not hungry.\"), which William Ashbrook states, in his study of Puccini's operas, accentuates the class distinction between the two. When Tosca comforts Cavaradossi after the torture scene, she now tells him, \"Ma il giusto Iddio lo punir\u00e1\" (\"But a just God will punish him\" [Scarpia]); formerly she stated, \"Ma il sozzo sbirro lo pagher\u00e0\" (\"But the filthy cop will pay for it.\"). Other changes are in the music; when Tosca demands the price for Cavaradossi's freedom (\"Il prezzo!\"), her music is changed to eliminate an octave leap, allowing her more opportunity to express her contempt and loathing of Scarpia in a passage which is now near the middle of the soprano vocal range. A remnant of a \"Latin Hymn\" sung by Tosca and Cavaradossi in act 3 survived into the first published score and libretto, but is not in later versions. According to Ashbrook, the most surprising change is where, after Tosca discovers the truth about the \"mock\" execution and exclaims \"Finire cos\u00ec? Finire cos\u00ec?\" (\"To end like this? To end like this?\"), she was to sing a five-bar fragment to the melody of \"E lucevan le stelle\". Ashbrook applauds Puccini for deleting the section from a point in the work where delay is almost unendurable as events rush to their conclusion, but points out that the orchestra's recalling \"E lucevan le stelle\" in the final notes would seem less incongruous if it was meant to underscore Tosca's and Cavaradossi's love for each other, rather than being simply a melody which Tosca never hears.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

Long's version was dramatized by David Belasco as the one-act play \"Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan\", which, after premiering in New York in 1900, moved to London, where Puccini saw it in the summer of that year.\nThe original version of the opera, in two acts, had its premiere on 17 February 1904 at La Scala in Milan. It was poorly received, despite having such notable singers as soprano Rosina Storchio, tenor Giovanni Zenatello and baritone Giuseppe De Luca in lead roles. This was due in part to a late completion by Puccini, which gave inadequate time for rehearsals. Puccini revised the opera, splitting the second act in two, with the Humming Chorus as a bridge to what became Act III, and making other changes. Success ensued, starting with the first performance on 28 May 1904 in Brescia.\nVersions.\nPuccini wrote five versions of the opera. The original two-act version, which was presented at the world premiere at La Scala on 17 February 1904, was withdrawn after the disastrous premiere. Puccini then substantially rewrote it, this time in three acts. This second version was performed on 28 May 1904 in Brescia, where it was a great success, with Solomiya Krushelnytska as Cio-Cio-San. It was this second version that premiered in the United States in 1906, first in Washington, D.C., in October, and then in New York in November, performed by Henry Savage's New English Opera Company (so named because it performed in English-language translations).\nIn 1906, Puccini wrote a third version, which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 11 February 1907. Later that year, Puccini made several changes in the orchestral and vocal scores, and this became the fourth version.\nAgain in 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, which has become known as the \"Standard Version\" and is the one which is most often performed today. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed, such as for the opening of La Scala's 2016\u201317 season, on 7 December 2016, with Riccardo Chailly conducting.\nPerformance history.\nPremieres of versions of \"Madama Butterfly\" in major opera houses throughout the world include the Teatro de la Opera de Buenos Aires on 7 July 1904, under Arturo Toscanini, this being the first performance in the world outside Italy. As in the world premiere in Milan a few months earlier, the protagonist was Rosina Storchio. Its first performance in Britain was in London on 10 July 1905 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, while the first US performance was presented in English on 15 October 1906, in Washington, D.C., at the Columbia Theater. The first performance in New York took place on 12 November of the same year at the Garden Theatre. The Metropolitan Opera first performed the opera on 11 February 1907 under the supervision of the composer with Geraldine Farrar as Cio-Cio-San, Enrico Caruso as Pinkerton, Louise Homer as Suzuki, Antonio Scotti as Sharpless, with Arturo Vigna conducting; \"Madama Butterfly\" has since been heard virtually every season at the Met except for a hiatus during World War II from 1942 through 1945 due to the hostilities between the United States and Japan. The first Canadian performance was in April 1907 at Princess Theatre in Toronto by the H. W. Savage Company. The first Australian performance was presented at the Theatre Royal in Sydney on 26 March 1910, starring Amy Eliza Castles.\nBetween 1915 and 1920, Japan's best-known opera singer Tamaki Miura won international fame for her performances as Cio-Cio-San. A memorial to this singer, along with one to Puccini, can be found in the Glover Garden in the port city of Nagasaki, where the opera is set.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nIn 1904, a U.S. naval officer named Pinkerton rents a house on a hill in Nagasaki, Japan, for himself and his soon-to-be wife, \"Butterfly\". Her real name is Cio-Cio-San (from the Japanese word for ; \"-san\" is a plain honorific). She is a 15-year old Japanese girl whom he is marrying for convenience, and he intends to leave her once he finds a proper American wife, since Japanese divorce laws are very lenient. The wedding is to take place at the house. Butterfly had been so excited to marry an American that she had earlier secretly converted from Buddhism to Christianity. After the wedding ceremony, her uninvited uncle, a \"bonze\", who has found out about her conversion, comes to the house, curses her and orders all the guests to leave, which they do while renouncing her. Pinkerton and Butterfly sing a love duet and prepare to spend their first night together.\nAct 2.\nPinkerton left shortly after the wedding, and three years later, Butterfly is still waiting for him to return. Her maid Suzuki keeps trying to convince her that he is not coming back, but Butterfly does not believe her. Goro, the marriage broker who arranged her marriage, keeps trying to marry her off again, but she does not listen to him either. The American consul, Sharpless, comes to the house with a letter which he has received from Pinkerton which asks him to break some news to Butterfly: that Pinkerton is not coming back to Japan, but Sharpless cannot bring himself to finish it. Sharpless asks Butterfly what she would do if Pinkerton were not to return. She then reveals that she gave birth to Pinkerton's son after he had left and asks Sharpless to tell him.\nFrom the hill house, Butterfly sees Pinkerton's ship arriving in the harbour. She and Suzuki prepare for his arrival, and then they wait. Suzuki and the child fall asleep, but Butterfly stays up all night waiting for him to arrive.\nAct 3.\nSuzuki wakes up in the morning and Butterfly finally falls asleep. Sharpless and Pinkerton arrive at the house, along with Pinkerton's new American wife, Kate. They have come because Kate has agreed to raise the child. But, as Pinkerton sees how Butterfly has decorated the house for his return, he realizes he has made a huge mistake. He admits that he is a coward and cannot face her, leaving Suzuki, Sharpless, and Kate to break the news to Butterfly. Agreeing to give up her child if Pinkerton comes himself to see her, Butterfly prays before statues of her ancestral gods, says goodbye to her son, and blindfolds him. She places a small American flag in his hands and goes behind a screen, stabbing herself with her father's \"tant\u014d\". Pinkerton rushes in, but he is too late, and Butterfly dies.\n1.

Giacomo, poor thing, we never saw him because we couldn't go on the stage. We got to the end of it and I don't know how. The second act I didn't hear at all, and before the opera was over, we ran out of the theater.\nCalled \"one of the most terrible flops in Italian opera history\", the premiere was beset by several bad staging decisions, including the lack of an intermission during the second act. Worst of all was the idea to give audience plants nightingale whistles to deepen the sense of sunrise in the final scene. The audience took the noise as a cue to make their own animal noises.\nSome, such as Katherine Hu in an op-ed for \"The New York Times\", have criticized \"Madama Butterfly\" for orientalism, noting in particular the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes about East Asian hypersexuality and submissiveness. Hu argues that while doing away with classic works like \"Madama Butterfly\" would \"destroy the art form, preventing us from reshaping otherwise beautiful compositions in powerful ways,\" opera houses should serve as museums and classrooms, presenting works in a way that helps audiences be aware of their problematic histories.\nToday \"Madama Butterfly\" is the sixth most performed opera in the world and considered a masterpiece, with Puccini's orchestration praised as limpid, fluent and refined.\nAdaptations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The experiment is conducted in the test section of the wind tunnel and a complete tunnel configuration includes air ducting to and from the test section and a device for keeping the air in motion, such as a fan. Wind tunnel uses include assessing the effects of air on an aircraft in flight or a ground vehicle moving on land, and measuring the effect of wind on buildings and bridges. Wind tunnel test sections range in size from less than a foot across, to over , and with air speeds from a light breeze to hypersonic.\nThe earliest wind tunnels were invented towards the end of the 19th century, in the early days of aeronautical research, as part of the effort to develop heavier-than-air flying machines. The wind tunnel reversed the usual situation. Instead of the air standing still and an aircraft moving, an object would be held still and the air moved around it. In this way, a stationary observer could study the flying object in action, and could measure the aerodynamic forces acting on it.\nThe development of wind tunnels accompanied the development of the airplane. Large wind tunnels were built during World War II, and as supersonic aircraft were developed, supersonic wind tunnels were constructed to test them. Wind tunnel testing was considered of strategic importance during the Cold War for development of aircraft and missiles.\nAdvances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have reduced the demand for wind tunnel testing, but have not completely eliminated it. Many real-world problems can still not be modeled accurately enough by CFD to eliminate the need for wind tunnel testing. Moreover, confidence in a numerical simulation tool depends on comparing its results with experimental data, and these can be obtained, for example, from wind tunnel tests.\nOperation.\nA wind tunnel creates an outdoor environment in a controlled indoor setting which enables measurements of wind forces on a moving object to be taken while the object is stationary. This is much cheaper and more convenient than getting measurements while the object is moving.\nThe object being tested, such as a scale model of an aircraft, is placed in the test section and restrained from moving. Air is flowed around the object and the forces on the model are measured. The measurements taken from the reduced-scale model are applicable to the full-size aircraft. Testing of scale models of a new aircraft design before it flies is done to ensure the first flight will be safe with the aircraft behaving in a predictable manner. Research in wind tunnels produces accurate results and is done rapidly and economically compared to flight testing of full-scale aircraft.\nCar fuel consumption is of secondary importance to drivers when starting and driving in extreme cold and wind-driven snow. This condition is investigated in a different kind of wind tunnel, the climatic wind tunnel. The test section subjects cars to a range of extreme environmental conditions to make sure the air conditioning can make the car comfortable on very hot and very cold days and can keep windows clear of condensation in very humid and cool weather.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nEnglish mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton (1642\u20131726) displayed a forerunner to the modern wind tunnel in Proposition 36/37 of his book \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\".\nEnglish military engineer and mathematician Benjamin Robins (1707\u20131751) invented a whirling arm apparatus to determine drag and did some of the first experiments in aerodynamics.\nSir George Cayley (1773\u20131857) also used a whirling arm to measure the drag and lift of various airfoils. His whirling arm was long and attained speeds between 10 and 20 feet per second (3 to 6\u00a0m/s).\nOtto Lilienthal used a rotating arm to make measurements on wing airfoils with varying angles of attack, establishing their lift-to-drag ratio polar diagrams, but was lacking the notions of induced drag and Reynolds numbers.\nDrawbacks of whirling arm tests are that they do not produce a reliable flow of air. Centrifugal forces and the fact that the object is moving in its own wake also mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. Francis Herbert Wenham (1824\u20131908), a Council Member of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, addressed these issues by inventing, designing, and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871. Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use of this tool. Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high aspect ratio.\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky built an open-section wind tunnel with a centrifugal blower in 1897, and determined the drag coefficients of flat plates, cylinders, and spheres.\nDanish inventor Poul la Cour used wind tunnels to develop wind turbines in the early 1890s.\nCarl Rickard Nyberg used a wind tunnel to design his \"Flugan\" starting in 1897.\nThe Englishman Osborne Reynolds (1842\u20131912) of the University of Manchester demonstrated that the airflow pattern over a scale model would be the same for the full-scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases. This parameter, now known as the Reynolds number, is used in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shape of flow patterns, the effectiveness of heat transfers, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena.\nThe Wright brothers' use of a simple wind tunnel in 1901 to study the effects of airflow over various shapes while developing their Wright Flyer was in some ways revolutionary. However, they were using the accepted technology of the day, though this was not yet a common technology in America.\nIn France, Gustave Eiffel (1832\u20131923) built his first open-return wind tunnel in 1909, powered by a electric motor, at Champs-de-Mars, near the foot of the tower that bears his name.\nBetween 1909 and 1912 Eiffel ran about 4,000 tests in his wind tunnel, and his systematic experimentation set new standards for aeronautical research.\nIn 1912 Eiffel's laboratory was moved to Auteuil, a suburb of Paris, where his wind tunnel with a test section is still operational today. Eiffel significantly improved the efficiency of the open-return wind tunnel by enclosing the test section in a chamber, designing a flared inlet with a honeycomb flow straightener, and adding a diffuser between the test section and the fan located at the downstream end of the diffuser; this was an arrangement followed by a number of wind tunnels later built; in fact the open-return low-speed wind tunnel is often called the Eiffel-type wind tunnel.\nWidespread usage.\nSubsequent use of wind tunnels proliferated as the science of aerodynamics and discipline of aeronautical engineering were established and air travel and power were developed.\nThe US Navy in 1916 built one of the largest wind tunnels in the world at that time at the Washington Navy Yard. The inlet was almost in diameter and the discharge part was in diameter. A electric motor drove the paddle type fan blades.\nIn 1931 the NACA built a full-scale wind tunnel at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The tunnel was powered by a pair of fans driven by electric motors. The layout was a double-return, closed-loop format and could accommodate many full-size real aircraft as well as scale models. The tunnel was eventually closed and, even though it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1995, demolition began in 2010.\nUntil World War II, the world's largest wind tunnel, built in 1932\u20131934, was located in a suburb of Paris, Chalais-Meudon, France. It was designed to test full-size aircraft and had six large fans driven by high powered electric motors. The Chalais-Meudon wind tunnel was used by ONERA under the name S1Ch until 1976 in the development of, e.g., the Caravelle and Concorde airplanes. Today, this wind tunnel is preserved as a national monument.\nLudwig Prandtl was Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's teacher at G\u00f6ttingen University and suggested the construction of a wind tunnel for tests of airships they were designing. The vortex street of turbulence downstream of a cylinder was tested in the tunnel. When he later moved to Aachen University he recalled use of this facility:\nI remembered the wind tunnel in G\u00f6ttingen was started as a tool for studies of Zeppelin behavior, but that it had proven to be valuable for everything else from determining the direction of smoke from a ship's stack, to whether a given airplane would fly. Progress at Aachen, I felt, would be virtually impossible without a good wind tunnel.\nWhen von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n began to consult with Caltech he worked with Clark Millikan and Arthur L. Klein. He objected to their design and insisted on a return flow making the device \"independent of the fluctuations of the outside atmosphere\". It was completed in 1930 and used for Northrop Alpha testing.\nIn 1939 General Arnold asked what was required to advance the USAF, and von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n answered, \"The first step is to build the right wind tunnel.\" On the other hand, after the successes of the Bell X-2 and prospect of more advanced research, he wrote, \"I was in favor of constructing such a plane because I have never believed that you can get all the answers out of a wind tunnel.\"\nWorld War II.\nIn 1941 the US constructed one of the largest wind tunnels at that time at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. This wind tunnel starts at and narrows to in diameter. Two fans were driven by a electric motor. Large scale aircraft models could be tested at air speeds of .\nDuring WWII, Germany developed different designs of large wind tunnels to further their knowledge of aeronautics. For example, the wind tunnel at Peenem\u00fcnde was a novel wind tunnel design that allowed for high-speed airflow research, but brought several design challenges regarding constructing a high-speed wind tunnel at scale. However, it successfully used some large natural caves which were increased in size by excavation and then sealed to store large volumes of air which could then be routed through the wind tunnels. By the end of the war, Germany had at least three different supersonic wind tunnels, with one capable of Mach 4.4 heated airflows.\nA large wind tunnel under construction near Oetztal, Austria would have had two fans directly driven by two hydraulic turbines. The installation was not completed by the end of the war and the dismantled equipment was shipped to Modane, France in 1946 where it was re-erected and is still operated there by the ONERA. With its test section and airspeed up to Mach 1, it is the largest transonic wind tunnel facility in the world. Frank Wattendorf reported on this wind tunnel for a US response.\nOn 22 June 1942, Curtiss-Wright financed construction of one of the nation's largest subsonic wind tunnels in Buffalo, New York. The first concrete for building was poured on 22 June 1942 on a site that eventually would become Calspan, where the wind tunnel still operates.\nBy the end of World War II, the US had built eight new wind tunnels, including the largest one in the world at Moffett Field near Sunnyvale, California, which was designed to test full size aircraft at speeds of less than and a vertical wind tunnel at Wright Field, Ohio, where the wind stream is upwards for the testing of models in spin situations and the concepts and engineering designs for the first primitive helicopters flown in the US.\nAfter World War II.\nLater research into airflows near or above the speed of sound used a related approach. Metal pressure chambers were used to store high-pressure air which was then accelerated through a nozzle designed to provide supersonic flow. The observation or instrumentation chamber (\"test section\") was then placed at the proper location in the throat or nozzle for the desired airspeed.\nIn the United States, concern over the lagging of American research facilities compared to those built by the Germans led to the Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan Act of 1949, which authorized expenditure to construct new wind tunnels at universities and at government sites. Some German war-time wind tunnels were dismantled for shipment to the United States as part of the plan to exploit German technology developments.\nIn the United States, many wind tunnels have been decommissioned from 1990 to 2010, including some historic facilities. Pressure is brought to bear on remaining wind tunnels due to declining or erratic usage, high electricity costs, and in some cases the high value of the real estate upon which the facility sits. On the other hand, CFD validation still requires wind-tunnel data, and this is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future. Studies have been done and others are underway to assess future military and commercial wind tunnel needs, but the outcome remains uncertain. More recently an increasing use of jet-powered, instrumented unmanned vehicles, or research drones, have replaced some of the traditional uses of wind tunnels. The world's fastest wind tunnel as of 2019 is the LENS-X wind tunnel, located in Buffalo, New York.\nMeasurement of aerodynamic forces and moments.\nAir speed, direction and pressures are measured in several ways in wind tunnels.\nAir speed through the test section is determined by Bernoulli's principle. The direction of airflow around a model is shown by fluttering tufts of yarn attached to the aerodynamic surfaces. The direction of airflow approaching and leaving a surface can be seen by mounting tufts in the airflow in front of and behind the model. Smoke or bubbles of liquid can be introduced into the airflow upstream of the model, and their paths around the model recorded using photography (see particle image velocimetry).\nAerodynamic forces on the test model are measured with beam balances.\nThe pressure distribution on a test model has historically been measured by drilling small holes on the surface, and connecting them to manometers to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can be measured more conveniently using pressure-sensitive paint, in which pressure is indicated by the fluorescence of the paint. They can also be measured with very small electronic pressure sensors mounted on a flexible strip which is attached to the model.\nThe aerodynamic properties of an object can vary for a scaled model. However, by observing certain similarity rules, a very satisfactory correspondence between the aerodynamic properties of a scaled model and a full-size object can be achieved. The choice of similarity parameters depends on the purpose of the test, but the most important conditions to satisfy are usually:\nIn certain particular test cases, other similarity parameters must be satisfied, such as the Froude number.\nForce and moment measurements.\nThe model is mounted on a balance which measures forces and moments. Lift, drag, and lateral forces, as well as yaw, roll, and pitching moments are measured over a range of angle of attack. Common curves such as lift coefficient versus angle of attack are produced.\nThe model must be held stationary, and these external supports create drag and potential turbulence that will affect the measurements. The supporting structures are kept as small as possible and aerodynamically shaped to minimize turbulence.\nFlow visualization.\nBecause air is transparent, it is difficult to directly observe the air movement itself. Instead, multiple methods of both quantitative and qualitative flow visualization methods have been developed for testing in a wind tunnel.\nQualitative methods.\nHigh-speed turbulence and vortices can be difficult to see directly, but strobe lights and film cameras or high-speed digital cameras can help to capture events that are a blur to the naked eye.\nHigh-speed cameras are also required when the subject of the test is itself moving at high speed, such as an airplane propeller. The camera can capture stop-motion images of how the blade cuts through the particulate streams and how vortices are generated along the trailing edges of the moving blade.\nClassification.\nThere are many different kinds of wind tunnels. They are typically classified by the range of speeds that are achieved in the test section, as follows:\nWind tunnels are also classified by the orientation of air flow in the test section with respect to gravity. Typically they are oriented horizontally, as happens during level flight. A different class of wind tunnels are oriented vertically so that gravity can be balanced by drag instead of lift, and these have become a popular form of recreation for simulating sky-diving:\nWind tunnels are also classified based on their main use. For those used with land vehicles such as cars and trucks the type of floor aerodynamics is also important. These vary from stationary floors through to full moving floors, with smaller moving floors and some attempt at boundary level control also being important.\nAeronautical wind tunnels.\nThe main subcategories in the aeronautical wind tunnels are:\nHigh Reynolds number tunnels.\nReynolds number is one of the governing similarity parameters for the simulation of flow in a wind tunnel. For mach number less than 0.3, it is the primary parameter that governs the flow characteristics. There are three main ways to simulate high Reynolds number, since it is not practical to obtain full scale Reynolds number by use of a full scale vehicle.\nV/STOL tunnels.\nV/STOL tunnels require large cross section area, but only small velocities. Since power varies with the cube of velocity, the power required for the operation is also less. An example of a V/STOL tunnel is the NASA Langley tunnel.\nTunnels with vertical airflow.\nVertical wind tunnels have a test section with air flowing upwards. Photography is used to record free-flight spin characteristics of aircraft models. Nets are installed above and below the test section to prevent the model from moving too high and to catch it when the air stops flowing.\nAutomotive tunnels.\nAutomotive wind tunnels fall into two categories:\nWind tunnel testing of automobiles began in the 1920s, on cars such as the Rumpler Tropfenwagen, and the Chrysler Airflow. Initially, scale models were tested, then larger wind tunnels were built to test full-scale cars with the capability to measure aerodynamic drag which enables improvements to be made for reducing fuel consumption. Wunibald Kamm built the first full-scale wind tunnel for motor vehicles.\nLow speed tunnels.\nWind tunnels have been used to test sporting equipment including golf clubs, golf balls, bobsleds, bicycles, and race car helmets. Helmet aerodynamics are particularly important in open cockpit race cars such as Indycar and Formula One. Aerodynamic forces on the helmet at high speeds can cause considerable neck strain on the driver; and flow separation on the back side of the helmet can cause turbulent buffeting and thus blurred vision for the driver.\nOther problems are also studied with wind tunnels. The effects of wind on man-made structures need to be studied when buildings became tall enough to be significantly affected by the wind. Very tall buildings present large surfaces to the wind, and the resulting forces have to be resisted by the building's internal structure or else the building will collapse. Determining such forces was required before building codes could specify the required strength of such buildings and these tests continue to be used for large or unusual buildings.\nAeroacoustic tunnels.\nThese tunnels are used in the studies of noise generated by flow and its suppression.\nHigh enthalpy.\nA high enthalpy wind tunnel is intended to study flow of air around objects moving at speeds much faster than the local speed of sound (hypersonic speeds). \"Enthalpy\" is the total energy of a gas stream, composed of internal energy due to temperature, the product of pressure and volume, and the velocity of flow. Duplication of the conditions of hypersonic flight requires large volumes of high-pressure, heated air; large pressurized hot reservoirs, and electric arcs, are two techniques used.\nAquadynamic flume.\nThe aerodynamic principles of the wind tunnel work equally on watercraft, except the water is more viscous and so sets greater forces on the object being tested. A looping flume is typically used for underwater aquadynamic testing. The interaction between two different types of fluids means that pure wind tunnel testing is only partly relevant. However, a similar sort of research is done in a towing tank.\nLow-speed oversize liquid testing.\nAir is not always the best test medium for studying small-scale aerodynamic principles, due to the speed of the air flow and airfoil movement. A study of fruit fly wings designed to understand how the wings produce lift was performed using a large tank of mineral oil and wings 100 times larger than actual size, in order to slow down the wing beats and make the vortices generated by the insect wings easier to see and understand.\nEnvironmental wind tunnels.\nWind tunnel tests are used to determine wind velocities around buildings and bridges, and the wind forces on them.\nEnvironmental wind tunnels are used to simulate the boundary layer of the atmosphere in windy conditions near the earth's surface. The wind near the ground is highly turbulent. Whereas vehicle wind tunnels have features to produce steady, straight-line air approaching the test model environmental tunnels need spires followed by small cubes on the floor to make the air represent the atmosphere boundary layer as it approaches the test object. The forces caused by wind on high-rise buildings and bridges have to be understood so they can be built using a minimum of construction materials while still being safe in very high winds. Another significant application for boundary layer wind tunnel modeling is for understanding exhaust gas dispersion patterns for hospitals, laboratories, and other emitting sources. Other examples of boundary layer wind tunnel applications are assessments of pedestrian comfort and snow drifting. Wind tunnel modeling is accepted as a method for aiding in green building design. For instance, the use of boundary layer wind tunnel modeling can be used as a credit for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification through the US Green Building Council.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Puccini died in 1924, and his opera was left unfinished. The music was completed by Franco Alfano and premiered on 25 April 1926, almost a year and a half after Puccini's death.\nThe opera is set in China and follows the Prince Calaf, who falls in love with the cold-hearted Princess Turandot. In order to win her hand in marriage, a suitor must solve three riddles, with a wrong answer resulting in his execution. Calaf passes the test, but Turandot refuses to marry him. He offers her a way out: if she is able to guess his name before dawn the next day, he will accept death.\nOrigin and pronunciation of the name.\nThe title of the opera is derived from the Persian term \"Turandokht\" (, 'daughter of Turan'), a name frequently given to Central Asian princesses in Persian poetry. Turan is a region of Central Asia that was once part of the Persian Empire. \"Dokht\" is a contraction of \"dokhtar\" (daughter); the \"kh\" and \"t\" are both pronounced.\nItalian pronunciation dictionaries recommend pronouncing the final \"t\". However, according to Puccini scholar Patrick Vincent Casali, the \"t\" is silent in the name of the opera and of its title character. Soprano Rosa Raisa, who created the title role, said that neither Puccini nor Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the first performances, ever pronounced the final \"t\". Similarly, prominent Turandot Eva Turner did not pronounce the final \"t\" in television interviews. Casali maintains that the musical setting of many of Calaf's utterances of the name makes sounding the final \"t\" all but impossible.\nComposition history.\nThe beginnings of \"Turandot\" can likely be found in \"Haft Peykar\", a twelfth-century epic by the Persian poet Nizami. One of the stories in \"Haft Peykar\" features a Russian princess. In 1722, Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9tis de la Croix published his \"Les Mille et un jours\" (The Thousand and One Days), a collection of stories which were purportedly taken from Middle Eastern folklore and mythologies. One of these stories, believed to be inspired by Nizami, features a cold princess named Turandokht. However, it has been speculated that many of de la Croix's 'translated' stories were his own original creations, with no actual basis in Middle Eastern cultures. De la Croix's story was adapted into a play, \"Turandot\", by the Italian playwright Carlo Gozzi in 1762, which was then adapted by Friedrich Schiller into another play in 1801. It was Schiller's version that inspired Puccini to write the opera.\nPuccini began working on \"Turandot\" in March 1920 after meeting with librettists Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. In his impatience, he began composition in January 1921, before Adami and Simoni had produced the text for the libretto. As with \"Madama Butterfly\", Puccini strove for a semblance of authenticity by using music from the region, even commissioning a set of thirteen custom-made gongs. Baron Edoardo Fassini-Camossi, the former Italian diplomat to China, gave Puccini a music box that played 4 Chinese melodies. Puccini incorporated three of these melodies into his opera, the most memorable of which is the folk melody \"M\u00f2 Li H\u016ba (\u8309\u8389\u82b1)\" ('Jasmine Flower'). \"M\u00f2 Li H\u016ba\" serves as a leitmotif for Princess Turandot's splendor. In total, eight of the themes from \"Turandot\" appear to be based on traditional Chinese music and anthems.\nBy March 1924, Puccini had completed the opera up to the final duet. However, he was dissatisfied with the text of the final duet, and did not continue until 8 October, when he chose Adami's fourth version of the duet text. Two days later, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Puccini seems to have had some inkling of the seriousness of his condition: before leaving for Brussels for treatment, he visited Arturo Toscanini and begged him, \"Don't let my Turandot die.\" He died of a heart attack on 29 November 1924.\nCompletion of the score after Puccini's death.\nWhen Puccini died, the first two of the three acts were fully composed, including the orchestration. Puccini had composed and fully orchestrated Act Three up until Li\u00f9's death and funeral cortege. In the sense of finished music, this was the last music composed by Puccini. He left behind 36 pages of sketches on 23 sheets for the end of \"Turandot\". Some sketches were in the form of \"piano-vocal\" or \"short score\", including vocal lines with \"two to four staves of accompaniment with occasional notes on orchestration.\" These sketches provided music for some, but not all, of the final portion of the libretto.\nPuccini left instructions that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini's son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano was chosen to flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito's \"Nerone\" after the composer's death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected. Puccini's publisher Tito Ricordi II decided on Alfano because his opera \"La leggenda di Sak\u00f9ntala\" resembled \"Turandot\" in its setting and heavy orchestration. Alfano provided a first version of the ending with a few passages of his own, and even a few sentences added to the libretto, which was not considered complete even by Puccini. After the severe criticisms by Ricordi and the conductor Arturo Toscanini, he was forced to write a second, strictly censored version that followed Puccini's sketches more closely, to the point where he did not set some of Adami's text to music because Puccini had not indicated how he wanted it to sound. Ricordi's real concern was not the quality of Alfano's work; he wanted the end of \"Turandot\" to sound as if it had been written by Puccini. Of this version, about three minutes were cut for performance by Toscanini, and it is this shortened version that is usually performed today.\nPerformance history.\n\"Turandot\" premiered at the La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, on 25 April 1926, a year and five months after Puccini's death. Rosa Raisa played Turandot. Tenors Miguel Fleta and Franco Lo Giudice alternated in the role of Prince Calaf, with Fleta singing the role on opening night. It was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. In the middle of Act III, the orchestra stopped playing. Toscanini turned to the audience and announced, \"Qui finisce l'opera, perch\u00e9 a questo punto il maestro \u00e8 morto\" (\"Here the opera ends, because at this point the maestro died\"). The curtain was then lowered. A reporter for \"La Stampa\" recorded the words slightly differently: \"Qui finisce l'opera, rimasta incompiuta per la morte del povero Puccini\" (\"Here the opera ends, left incomplete by the death of the poor Puccini\"). Others have reported that Toscanini said \"Here, the Maestro laid down his pen.\" A newspaper report from 1926 states that Puccini asked Toscanini to stop the opera performance in the middle of Act III. The second and subsequent performances of the 1926 La Scala season included Alfano's ending.\nSoon after its premiere in Milan, \"Turandot\" spread to other cities.\nFor many years, the government of the People's Republic of China forbade performance of \"Turandot\" because they said it portrayed China and the Chinese unfavorably. Instead of a single nationwide decree against it, any attempts to produce it were not approved. In the late 1990s they relented, and in September 1998 the opera was performed for eight nights as \"Turandot at the Forbidden City\", complete with opulent sets and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army as extras. It was an international collaboration, with director Zhang Yimou as choreographer and Zubin Mehta as conductor. The singing roles saw Giovanna Casolla, Audrey Stottler, and Sharon Sweet as Princess Turandot; Sergej Larin and Lando Bartolini as Calaf; and Barbara Frittoli, Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s, and Barbara Hendricks as Li\u00f9.\nThe aria \"Nessun dorma\" has long been a staple of operatic recitals. Luciano Pavarotti popularized the piece beyond the opera world in the 1990s with his performance of it for the 1990 World Cup, which received a global audience. Both Pavarotti and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo released singles of the aria, with Pavarotti's reaching number 2 in the UK. The Three Tenors performed the aria at three subsequent World Cup Finals, in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. Many crossover and pop artists have performed and recorded it and the aria has been used in the soundtracks of numerous films. \"Turandot\" is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and it appears as number 17 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide.\nAlfano's and other versions.\nThe debate over which version of the ending is better is still open. Alfano's original ending to the opera was first recorded (as part of an album with Josephine Barstow singing final scenes of several operas) by John Mauceri and Scottish Opera (with Josephine Barstow and Lando Bartolini as soloists) for Decca Records in 1990 to great acclaim. However, it may have been staged in Germany in the early years, since Ricordi had commissioned a German translation of the text and a number of scores were printed in Germany with the full final scene included. Alfano's second ending has been further redacted as well: Turandot's aria \"Del primo pianto\" was performed at the premiere but cut from the first complete recording; it was eventually restored to most performances of the opera.\nFrom 1976 to 1988, the American composer Janet Maguire, convinced that the whole ending is coded in the sketches left by Puccini, composed a new ending, but this has never been performed. In 2001, Luciano Berio made a new completion sanctioned by Casa Ricordi and the Puccini estate, using Puccini's sketches but also expanding the musical language. It was subsequently performed in the Canary Islands and Amsterdam conducted by Riccardo Chailly, Los Angeles conducted by Kent Nagano, at the Salzburg Festival conducted by Valery Gergiev in August 2002. However, its reception was mixed.\nIn late 2007, Chinese composer Hao Weiya made another completion before the opening of National Centre for the Performing Arts, also resulting in a mixed reception.\nIn 2022, Deborah Burton \"realized\" a finale to Turandot that utilized several of Puccini's autograph sketches that had not been previously studied. Based on decades of analyzing Puccini's compositional style, her finale has not yet been produced, although some possible venues are in the offing. A description of her finale can be found in her article, \"Puccini's Last Act: Finishing \"Turandot\"\" (The Opera Journal, Vol. 55, No. 2, pp.\u00a01\u201360) and in her book \"The Finales of Turandot: Puccini's Last Act\" (Routledge, 2025).\nIn 2024, Washington National Opera premiered a newly commissioned ending by composer Christopher Tin and librettist Susan Soon He Stanton to very positive reviews. Michael Andor Brodeur of The Washington Post called the production 'refreshing' and declared \"Even without the new ending \u2014 and Tin\u2019s splendid musical additions, which draw sensibly from Puccini\u2019s score while applying an entirely new emotional finish \u2014 Francesca Zambello\u2019s \"Turandot\" crackles with fresh energy\". Heidi Waleson of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the new ending \"fits the opera neatly. Its sound and attitude, while contemporary, grow organically from Puccini\u2019s original, like a savvy modern addition on a historic building.\"\nIn 2024, Opera Delaware premiered a newly commissioned completion by composer Derrick Wang, which was praised as \"adept,\" \"respectful,\" and \"seamless.\"\nDaniela Kerck made another version for the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in 2024, using exclusively music by Puccini, the unfinished opera followed by his 1905 \"Requiem\" antiphone. She identified Calaf with Puccini, and other characters with people from his life, beginning and ending the story in Puccini's library with a grand piano. In this version, when Li\u00fa has taken her life and the music by Puccini ends, the Puccini on stage receives a kiss of death from Turandot and dies.\nPlace: Peking, China\nTime: Legendary times\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"In front of the imperial palace\"\nIn China, the beautiful Princess Turandot will marry only a suitor who can answer three riddles. A Mandarin announces the law of the land (Aria \u2013 \"Popolo di Pechino!\" \u2013 \"People of Peking!\"). The Prince of Persia has failed to answer the three riddles, and he is to be beheaded at the next rising moon. As the crowd surges towards the gates of the palace, the imperial guards brutally repulse them, causing a blind old man to be knocked to the ground. The old man's slave-girl, Li\u00f9, cries out for help. A young man hears her cry and recognizes that the old man is his long-lost father, Timur, the deposed king of Tartary. The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur not to speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Li\u00f9 has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince had smiled at her (Trio with chorus \u2013 The crowd, Li\u00f9, Prince of Tartary, Timur: \"Indietro, cani!\" \u2013 \"Back, dogs!\").\nThe moon rises, and the crowd's cries for blood dissolve into silence. The doomed Prince of Persia, who is on his way to be executed, is led before the crowd. The young Prince is so handsome and kind that the crowd and the Prince of Tartary decide that they want Turandot to act compassionately, and they beg Turandot to appear and spare his life (Aria \u2013 The crowd, Prince of Tartary: \"O giovinetto!\" \u2013 \"O youth!\"). She then appears, and with a single imperious gesture, orders the execution to continue. The Prince of Tartary, who has never seen Turandot before, falls immediately in love with her, and joyfully cries out Turandot's name three times, foreshadowing the riddles to come. Then the Prince of Persia cries out Turandot's name one final time, mirroring the Prince of Tartary. The crowd, horrified, screams out one final time and the Prince of Persia is beheaded.\nThe Prince of Tartary is dazzled by Turandot's beauty. He is about to rush towards the gong and to strike it three times \u2013 the symbolic gesture of whoever wishes to attempt to solve the riddles so that he can marry Turandot \u2013 when the ministers Ping, Pang, and Pong appear. They urge him cynically not to lose his head for Turandot and instead to go back to his own country (\"Fermo, che fai?\" \"Stop, what are you doing?\"). Timur urges his son to desist, and Li\u00f9, who is secretly in love with the Prince, pleads with him not to attempt to solve the riddles (\"Signore, ascolta!\" \u2013 \"Lord, hear!\"). Li\u00f9's words touch the Prince's heart. He begs Li\u00f9 to make Timur's exile more bearable by not abandoning Timur if the Prince fails to answer the riddles (\"Non piangere, Li\u00f9\" \u2013 \"Do not cry, Li\u00f9\"). The three ministers, Timur, and Li\u00f9 then try one last time to stop the Prince (\"Ah! Per l'ultima volta!\" \u2013 \"Ah! For the last time!\") from attempting to answer the riddles, but he refuses to heed their advice.\nHe calls Turandot's name three times, and each time Li\u00f9, Timur, and the ministers reply, \"Death!\" and the crowd declares, \"We're already digging your grave!\" Rushing to the gong that hangs in front of the palace, the Prince strikes it three times, declaring himself to be a suitor. From the palace balcony, Turandot accepts his challenge, as Ping, Pang, and Pong laugh at the Prince's foolishness.\nAct 2.\n\"Scene 1: A pavilion in the imperial palace. Before sunrise\"\nPing, Pang, and Pong lament their place as ministers, poring over palace documents and presiding over endless rituals. They prepare themselves for either a wedding or a funeral (Trio \u2013 Ping, Pang, Pong: \"Ola, Pang!\"). Ping suddenly longs for his country house in Honan, with its small lake surrounded by bamboo. Pong remembers his grove of forests near Tsiang, and Pang recalls his gardens near Kiu. The three share their fond memories of their lives away from the palace (Trio \u2013 Ping, Pang, Pong: \"Ho una casa nell'Honan\" \u2013 \"I have a house in Honan\"). They turn their thoughts back to how they have been accompanying young princes to their deaths. As the palace trumpet sounds, the ministers ready themselves for another spectacle as they await the entrance of their Emperor.\n\"Scene 2: The courtyard of the palace. Sunrise\"\nThe Emperor Altoum, father of Turandot, sits on his grand throne in his palace. Weary of having to judge his isolated daughter's sport, he urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge, but the Prince refuses (Aria \u2013 Altoum, the Prince: \"Un giuramento atroce\" \u2013 \"An atrocious oath\"). Turandot enters and explains (\"In questa reggia\" \u2013 \"In this palace\") that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom \"in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men\" until she was raped and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Turandot claims that Lo-u-Ling now lives in her and, out of revenge, Turandot has sworn never to let any man wed her. She warns the Prince to withdraw but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: \"Straniero, ascolta!\" \u2013 \"What is born each night and dies each dawn?\" The Prince correctly replies, \"Speranza\" \u2013 \"Hope\". The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (\"Guizza al pari di fiamma\" \u2013 \"What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?\") The Prince thinks for a moment before replying, \"Sangue\" \u2013 \"Blood\". Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot's anger. She presents her third riddle (\"Gelo che ti da foco\" \u2013 \"What is ice which gives you fire and which your fire freezes still more?\"). He proclaims, \"It is Turandot! Turandot!\"\nThe crowd cheers for the triumphant Prince. Turandot throws herself at her father's feet and pleads with him not to leave her to the Prince's mercy. The Emperor insists that an oath is sacred and that it is Turandot's duty to wed the Prince (Duet \u2013 Turandot, Altoum, the Prince: \"Figlio del cielo\"). She cries out in despair, \"Will you take me by force? (\"Mi porterai con la forza?\") The Prince stops her, saying that he has a riddle for her: \"You do not know my name. Tell me my name before sunrise, and at dawn, I will die.\" Turandot accepts. The Emperor then declares that he hopes that he will be able to call the Prince his son when the sun next rises.\nAct 3.\n\"Scene 1: The palace gardens. Night\"\nIn the distance, heralds call out Turandot's command: \"Cosi comanda Turandot\" \u2013 \"This night, none shall sleep in Peking! The penalty for all will be death if the Prince's name is not discovered by morning.\" The Prince waits for dawn and anticipates his victory: \"Nessun dorma\" \u2013 \"Let no one sleep!\"\nPing, Pong, and Pang appear and offer the Prince women and riches if he will only give up Turandot (\"Tu che guardi le stelle\"), but he refuses. A group of soldiers then drag in Timur and Li\u00f9. They have been seen speaking to the Prince, so they must know his name. Turandot enters and orders Timur and Li\u00f9 to speak. The Prince feigns ignorance, saying they know nothing. But when the guards begin to treat Timur harshly, Li\u00f9 declares that she alone knows the Prince's name, but she will not reveal it.\nPing demands the Prince's name, and when Li\u00f9 refuses to say it, she is tortured. Turandot is clearly taken aback by Li\u00f9's resolve and asks Li\u00f9 who or what gave her such a strong resolve. Li\u00f9 answers, \"Princess, love!\" (\"Principessa, amore!\"). Turandot demands that Ping tear the Prince's name from Li\u00f9, and Ping orders Li\u00f9 to be tortured even more. Li\u00f9 counters Turandot (\"Tu che di gel sei cinta\" \u2013 \"You who are encircled by ice\"), saying that Turandot too will learn the exquisite joy of being guided by caring and compassionate love. Having spoken, Li\u00f9 seizes a dagger from a soldier's belt and stabs herself. As she staggers towards the Prince and falls dead, the crowd screams for her to speak the Prince's name. Since Timur is blind, he must be told about Li\u00f9's death, and he cries out in anguish.\nWhen Timur warns that the gods will be offended by Li\u00f9's death, the crowd becomes subdued, very afraid and ashamed. The grieving Timur and the crowd follow Li\u00f9's body as it is carried away. Everybody departs, leaving the Prince and Turandot alone. He reproaches Turandot for her cruelty (Duet \u2013 The Prince, Turandot: \"Principessa di morte\" \u2013 \"Princess of death\"), then takes her in his arms and kisses her in spite of her resistance.\nThe Prince tries to persuade Turandot to love him. At first, she feels disgusted, but after he kisses her, she feels herself becoming more ardently desiring to be held and compassionately loved by him. She admits that ever since she met the Prince, she realized she both hated and loved him. She tells him to ask for nothing more and to leave, taking his mystery with him. The Prince, however, then reveals his name: \"Calaf, son of Timur \u2013 Calaf, figlio di Timur\", thereby placing his life in Turandot's hands. She can now destroy him if she wants (Duet \u2013 Turandot, Calaf: \"Del primo pianto\").\n\"Scene 2: The courtyard of the palace. Dawn\"\nTurandot and Calaf approach the Emperor's throne. She declares that she knows the Prince's name: (\"Diecimila anni al nostro Imperatore!\") \u2013 \"It is ... love!\" The crowd sings and acclaims the two lovers (\"O sole! Vita! Eternit\u00e0\").\nCritical response.\nWhile long recognised as the most tonally adventurous of Puccini's operas, \"Turandot\" has also been considered a flawed masterpiece, and some critics have been hostile toward it. Joseph Kerman states that \"Nobody would deny that dramatic potential can be found in this tale. Puccini, however, did not find it; his music does nothing to rationalize the legend or illuminate the characters.\" Kerman also wrote that while \"Turandot\" is more \"suave\" musically than Puccini's earlier opera, \"Tosca\", \"dramatically it is a good deal more depraved.\"\nSome of this criticism is possibly due to the standard Alfano ending (Alfano II), in which Li\u00f9's death is followed almost immediately by Calaf's \"rough wooing\" of Turandot, and the \"bombastic\" end to the opera. A later attempt at completing the opera was made, with the co-operation of the publishers, Ricordi, in 2002 by Luciano Berio. The Berio version is considered to overcome some of these criticisms, but critics such as Michael Tanner have failed to be wholly convinced by the new ending, noting that the criticism by the Puccini advocate Julian Budden still applies: \"Nothing in the text of the final duet suggests that Calaf's love for Turandot amounts to anything more than a physical obsession: nor can the ingenuities of Simoni and Adami's text for 'Del primo pianto' convince us that the Princess's submission is any less hormonal.\"\nAshbrook and Powers consider it was an awareness of this problem \u2013 an inadequate buildup for Turandot's change of heart, combined with an overly successful treatment of the secondary character (Li\u00f9) \u2013 which contributed to Puccini's inability to complete the opera. Another alternative ending, written by Chinese composer Hao Wei Ya, has Calaf pursue Turandot but kiss her tenderly, not forcefully; and the lines beginning \"Del primo pianto\" (Of the first tears) are expanded into an aria where Turandot tells Calaf more fully about her change of heart.\nConcerning the compelling believability of the self-sacrificial Li\u00f9 character in contrast to the two mythic protagonists, biographers note echoes in Puccini's own life. He had had a servant named Doria, whom his wife accused of sexual relations with Puccini. The accusations escalated until Doria killed herself. In \"Turandot\", Puccini lavished his attention on the familiar sufferings of Li\u00f9, as he had on his many previous suffering heroines. However, in the opinion of Father Owen Lee, Puccini was out of his element when it came to resolving the tale of his two allegorical protagonists. Finding himself completely outside his normal genre of \"verismo\", he was incapable of completely grasping and resolving the necessary elements of the mythic, unable to \"feel his way into the new, forbidding areas the myth opened up to him\" \u2013 and thus unable to finish the opera in the two years before his unexpected death.\nInstrumentation.\n\"Turandot\" is scored for three flutes (the third doubling piccolo); two oboes; one cor anglais; two clarinets in B-flat; one bass clarinet in B-flat, two bassoons; one contrabassoon; two onstage alto saxophones in E-flat; four French horns in F; three trumpets in F; three tenor trombones; one contrabass trombone; six onstage trumpets in B-flat, three onstage trombones; and one onstage bass trombone; a percussion section with timpani, cymbals, gong, one triangle, one snare drum, one bass drum, one tam-tam, one glockenspiel, one xylophone, one bass xylophone, tubular bells, and tuned Chinese gongs; one onstage wood block; one onstage large gong; one celesta; one pipe organ; two harps; and strings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

It tells a tragic love story about a nobleman (known only as the Chevalier des Grieux) and a common woman (Manon Lescaut). Their decision to live together without marriage is the start of a moral decline that also leads to gambling, fraud, theft, murder, and Manon's death as a deportee in New Orleans. \nThe story was first published in 1731 as the final volume of Pr\u00e9vost's serial novel \"Memoirs and Adventures of a Man of Quality\". In 1733, all copies for sale in Paris were seized due to the volume's morally questionable content. This effective ban contributed to an increase in popularity, prompting unauthorized reprints. In 1753, Pr\u00e9vost published \"Manon Lescaut\" as a revised standalone book, which is now the most commonly reprinted version.\nThe novel was unusual for depicting Paris's \"low life\" and for discussing the lovers' money problems in numerical detail: both choices contribute to its realism and its aura of scandal. The story is narrated retroactively by des Grieux, an early example of the French genre of the confessional \"r\u00e9cit\"\".\" Over the centuries, audiences have judged the character Manon differently. Eighteenth-century audiences saw her as an unworthy figure who inspired pity due to the sincerity of her love. Nineteenth-century responses saw her as a nearly mythological sex symbol, either a who corrupts des Grieux or a hooker with a heart of gold. Today, scholars tend to see Manon as a victim of broader social forces, who is misrepresented by des Grieux's narration of her experience.\nThe novel is regarded as a classic, and in 1991, it was the most reprinted novel in French literature, with over 250 editions over the preceding 260 years. It has frequently been adapted into plays, ballets, films, and particularly operas. The most renowned adaptations are the operas \"Manon Lescaut\" by Daniel Auber (1856), \"Manon\" by Jules Massenet (1884), and \"Manon Lescaut\" by Giacomo Puccini (1893).\nPlot summary.\nThe seventeen-year-old Chevalier des Grieux, a seminary student and the younger son of a noble family, falls in love at first sight with Manon, a common woman on her way to a convent. They immediately run away together, and spend their meagre savings living pleasurably in Paris. Manon has sex with a Monsieur de B\u2014\u2014 for money; des Grieux forgives her. M. de B\u2014\u2014 alerts des Grieux's family to his location, and des Grieux is forcibly brought home and confined to his room. Eventually, he enters St. Sulpice seminary with his friend Tiberge and spends a year as a successful student.\nManon reappears, and des Grieux abandons his plans to become a priest. Using wealth that Manon stole from M. de B\u2014\u2014, they move to Chaillot. Their house burns down, and des Grieux begins to cheat gamblers for money. Their servants rob them, and Manon agrees to become the mistress of a Monsieur G\u2014\u2014 M\u2014\u2014. After accepting substantial gifts, she leaves his house while he awaits her in his bedroom. He has Manon and des Grieux arrested. Des Grieux is sent to St. Lazare (a religious institution for genteel moral correction), and Manon to La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re (a harsh prison for \"fallen women\"). Des Grieux breaks out of his confinement, accidentally killing a porter during his escape, then bribes guards to smuggle Manon out of hers.\nThey return to Chaillot. Des Grieux borrows money from Tiberge. Manon rejects the advances of an Italian prince. They meet a young G\u2014\u2014 M\u2014\u2014, son of the G\u2014\u2014 M\u2014\u2014 whom they had earlier deceived, and decide to defraud him the same way. Manon receives his money and jewels; des Grieux hires thugs to detain him for a night; the couple eat his dinner and are about to sleep in his bed when his father arrives and has them arrested. They are imprisoned in the Petit Ch\u00e2telet; des Grieux is freed by his father's influence, and Manon is deported to New Orleans as a correction girl.\nDes Grieux accompanies Manon to America, pretending they are married. After some time living in idyllic peace, des Grieux asks the governor, \u00c9tienne Perier, to officially wed him to Manon. The Governor instead decides to give Manon to his nephew Synnelet. Des Grieux duels Synnelet and knocks him unconscious; thinking he has killed the man, the couple flee into the wilderness. Manon dies of exposure, and des Grieux buries her, digging her grave with his broken sword. Heartbroken, he is taken back to France by Tiberge and returns to his aristocratic life.\nComposition and publication.\nAntoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost was a French priest and author. In the 1710s he moved multiple times between a career in the military and a novitiate in the Jesuit priesthood. He joined the Benedictines of St Maur after an unhappy love affair, which has sometimes contributed to speculation that \"Manon Lescaut\" has autobiographical inspirations. In 1728, while a monk in Paris, he published the first two volumes of his serial novel \"Memoirs and Adventures of a Man of Quality, Who Withdrew from the World.\" He then left his abbey without permission, and his superiors gained a \"lettre de cachet\" for his arrest. He fled to England. While he was in exile, volumes three and four were published in Paris.\nIn 1730, he moved to the Netherlands and signed a contract with the Compagnie des Libraires d'Amsterdam for three more volumes of \"Memoirs and Adventures\". Pr\u00e9vost likely composed \"Manon Lescaut\" in March and April 1731. At the time, he was in Amsterdam, and was writing quickly to satisfy his contract. The story was first published in May 1731, as volume seven of \"Memoirs and Adventures\", alongside volumes five and six. Beginning in 1733, the Compagnie des Libraires d'Amsterdam also published volume seven on its own, as it proved more popular than the rest of the series.\nIn 1753, Pr\u00e9vost published a substantially revised edition of volume seven as a standalone publication. The standalone volume was titled \"The Story of the Chevalier des Grieux and of Manon Lescaut\", which was the subtitle of volume VII of \"Memoirs and Adventures\". This edition claimed on its title page to be published in Amsterdam by the Compagnie des Libraires, but was actually published in Paris by Fran\u00e7ois Didot. In this edition, Pr\u00e9vost modified some of his most sensationalist language, added a new scene where Manon resists the seduction of an Italian prince, and rewrote the ending to replace des Grieux's religious conversion with a more secular morality. \"Manon Lescaut\" is the only novel for which Pr\u00e9vost published a revised edition. The 1753 version of the novel is usually the basis of modern editions. This edition also added nine illustrations, which made the book into more of a \"luxury object\" and made it more challenging to pirate.\nStyle.\nThe narrative of \"Manon Lescaut\" is set apart from the main events of \"Memoirs and Adventures\" with a preface and a preamble, both ostensibly written by the unnamed \"man of quality\" who is the protagonist of the main novel. The preface, titled \"Note from the author\" (), explains that the story was too large to include within the main narrative. It also says the story will be a morally-instructive example for readers, who will learn not to imitate des Grieux. In the preamble, the narrator witnesses a group of prostitutes being deported. Curious about a particularly beautiful one (Manon), he speaks with the lover travelling with her (des Grieux). Two years later, he encounters des Grieux again, and asks to hear the full story of his experience in America.\nThe story is thus narrated retroactively as a long speech, delivered by des Grieux nine months after Manon's death. As such, it is an early example of the French genre of the confessional \"r\u00e9cit\"\".\" The primary verb tense is \"pass\u00e9 simple\", a past-tense form that is only used in formal written French. All events are recounted in the first person, and shaped by des Grieux's retrospective self-justifications. According to the literary scholar Lionel Gossman, the layered rhetorical structure of the narrative expresses a more general ambiguity of meaning: the narrator tells us what des Grieux told him that Manon told him she thought, and no one is able to achieve certainty about the final \"moral\" of Manon's life.\nThe novel does not use quotation marks, even when des Grieux relates what other characters have said. This blurs the boundaries between characters' speech and free indirect speech. Des Grieux's telling frequently interrupts the narrative with apostrophes to absent figures and expressions of intense emotion. When he describes Manon, he often stutters or struggles to find words. Pr\u00e9vost was praised for this informal and expressive style, which invited sympathetic emotion: according to the literary historian Sylviane Albertan-Coppola, \"[t]he words flow as the heart overflows; the flow of feelings goes hand in hand with the flow of writing\".\nMajor themes.\nTragic love.\nThe story is particularly remembered for its tragic lovers, with des Grieux and Manon being compared to Romeo and Juliet and Tristan and Iseult. The scholar Jean Sgard argues that all of Pr\u00e9vost's writing, including \"Manon Lescaut\", is ultimately about \"the impossibility of happiness, the pervasiveness of evil and the misfortune attaching to the passions\", all of which lead to \"mourning without end\". It is an early example of the emerging sentimental novel, in which love can justify anything, and important moral value is placed on strong emotion.\nScandalizing immorality.\nOn the novel's first publication, the characters and their choices were seen as shockingly immoral. Des Grieux's rejection of the priesthood in favour of a sexual relationship without marriage, and his crimes of fraud and murder, challenged readers' expectations of acceptable actions for the hero of a novel. Manon's willingness to have sex for money, and her general taste for pleasure and luxury, also seemed irreconcilable with her narrative role as a sympathetic love object. Both were sometimes seen as corrupted characters, and the novel's realistic depiction of Paris's \"low life\" was unusual and potentially threatening. The scandal was intensified by the historical setting of the novel: the story appears to be set between 1712 and 1717, so it takes place during the final years of Louis XIV's conservative and orderly reign and the start of the regency of King Louis XV, rather than fully during the 8 year long Regency, when stories of corruption would be less surprising.\nAlthough the preface claims to disavow the characters' misbehavior, this is often seen as an insincere pretense. The revised 1753 edition added an allegorical vignette on the first page which also attempted to frame the novel as a moral story. It depicts a Christian version of Hercules at the crossroads, a stock allegory for the choice between vice and virtue. The caption, \"what torments you endure in Charybdis, young man worthy of a nobler love\", aligns Manon with vice; the deadly mythological whirlpool Charybdis was a common metaphor for prostitutes who would \"ruin\" noble young men. The image thus suggests that the novel will be a story of temptation and suffering, but one in which piety will prevail. However, the effect of the novel on readers often fails to follow this moral rejection of Manon's temptations; according to the literary scholar Lionel Grossman, \"[r]eaders have always wondered whether [the story] illustrates the glory of passion or its misery ... whether the model is des Griuex in love or des Grieux apparently grown wise and repentant,\" especially since des Grieux himself is often inconsistent. The literary historian Rori Bloom declares, \"he promises moral instruction and delivers amorality.\"\nSocial rank and money.\nThe novel is unusual in the French tradition for its detailed depiction of lower-class locations and activities, especially the criminal world. Manon is considered France's first fictional heroine to be a commoner, and the gulf in social rank between her and the noble des Grieux is an obstacle to their love. Des Grieux and Manon sometimes struggle to understand each other due to their different backgrounds. For example, Manon does not understand why des Grieux is surprised and upset after she acquires money from other lovers; she sees these as practical affairs, which do not threaten her love for des Grieux. Their difference in rank is also apparent in the different punishments they receive for their transgressions. When both lovers are imprisoned for some of their crimes, des Grieux's aristocratic status shields him from the worst consequences while Manon is deported] Des Grieux often finds that even complete strangers will help him, if they share his aristocratic background. The novel thus highlights how justice is enforced unequally for different ranks of society.\nA distinct and greater challenge is their lack of money. \"Manon Lescaut\" is often highlighted as the first French novel to treat money as a major theme. Exact numbers are provided throughout the novel, an unusual choice that contributes to the novel's realism. Manon begins the novel with a dowry of 300 , which is less than a tenth of an ordinary dowry for a woman entering a convent. Des Grieux has only the 150 in his pocket, and no way to earn more. As an aristocrat, he is barred from ordinary employment; he could earn a professional income in the church, the military, or the law, but only if he still had his father's support. The literary scholar Haydn Mason describes the novel's setting as \"a harsh and sordid world, motivated almost universally by money\". Although the book depicts its protagonists as suffering due to their poverty, it is not a populist novel that advocates for social reform. Instead, the novel responds to their struggles with sadness and resignation. \nReception.\n\"Manon Lescaut\" gained popularity gradually. When first published in 1731 as part of \"Memoirs and Adventures\", des Grieux and Manon's story in volume seven was not considered a separate work from the rest of the novel. Over the next few years, it was increasingly seen as a highlight of that novel. Reviewers praised the novel as a whole, especially for its success inducing tears. \"Memoirs and Adventures\" sold well in Holland and England on its first release, and a 1732 German translation was also successful, but it was largely ignored in France until 1733. In July 1733, the release of standalone edition of \"Manon Lescaut\" prompted a review in the clandestine , which brought it to the attention of many new readers, including the famous author Voltaire. On October 5, the French censors (who needed to approve all new publications) seized the copies currently for sale due to the book's morally questionable content. This effective ban led to a sudden increase in popularity. As part of this new popularity, \"Manon Lescaut\" was printed separately from \"Memoirs and Adventures\" several more times, including in unauthorized reprints. In 1753, Pr\u00e9vost responded with a high-quality revised edition of \"Manon Lescaut\" as a self-contained novel. Both \"Memoirs and Adventures\" and the standalone \"Manon Lescaut\" were reprinted frequently, with twenty editions of the first and eight of the latter appearing between 1731 and Pr\u00e9vost's death in 1763.\nInterest in the novel waned at the start of the 19th century, followed by another dramatic increase in popularity in 1830, when it was adapted as a ballet. Many further adaptations followed, with new reprints of \"Manon Lescaut\" each year. In the late 19h century, editions were released with prefaces written by the famous French authors Alexandre Dumas \"fils\" in 1875 and Anatole France in 1878. Adaptations, especially into opera, had a major influence on the novel's legacy; according to the literary historian Alan J. Singerman, by the 20th century the operatic version was more widely known than the novel. Over time, the novel came to be regarded as a historical classic. In 1991 it was the most reprinted novel in French literature, with over 250 editions over the preceding 260 years.\nResponses to the character of Manon.\nSince the novel's first publication, substantial critical analysis has focused on the interpretation of Manon's character. Because Manon's words and actions are related through the filter of des Grieux's retrospective storytelling, readers can only speculate about her real thoughts, feelings, and intentions. In the words of the literary scholar Lionel Gossman, \"Manon is constantly reborn and reinvented in the minds of generations of readers, none of whom can claim to possess her finally or determine who she \"really\" is.\"\nThe early reviews in 1733 saw Manon as sympathetic but unexpectedly so, an unworthy \"whore\" () who was nonetheless appealing due to the sincerity of her love for des Grieux. She was both blamed and forgiven for des Grieux's corruption. The illustrations in the 1753 edition reinforced the image of Manon as someone to be loved, pitied, and forgiven for her mistakes. Eighteenth-century readers also saw Manon and des Grieux as helpless, fated to a tragic ending. The crimes of both were equally justified by their love and their financial need.\nManon's reputation began to change in the 19th century, as she became a near-mythological figure. Rather than being a simple, lighthearted girl of common birth, she was depicted as either a who destroys des Grieux, or as a hooker with a heart of gold who is redeemed through her death. In 1832, Alfred de Musset's poem \"Namouna\" described Manon as \"an astonishing sphinx, a true siren, a thrice feminine heart\". Adaptations like the popular opera \"Manon\" (1884) characterized Manon as powerfully seductive. Alexandre Dumas \"fils\", whose novel \"The Lady of the Camellias\" (1848) was heavily inspired by \"Manon Lescaut\", wrote of Manon: \"you are sensuality, you are instinct, you are pleasure, the eternal temptation of man\". The literary historian Naomi Segal summarizes this period as one in which most critics \"tend to view Manon as if she were a real woman and to heap upon her all the myths which operate within sexual politics in the non-fictional world\".\nTwentieth-century scholarly interpretations tend to see Manon as the victim, not of her own weakness, but of various social systems. For these readers, des Grieux's version of events is considered suspect, and it is important to imagine how Manon might have narrated her story differently. Feminist theorists like Nancy K. Miller and Segal see Manon as a narrative victim of patriarchy. Cultural-historical theorists see the novel as a conflict between aristocratic and bourgeois ideologies; Manon is marginalized by her class, but makes savvy decisions to strategically ensure her survival. A post-structuralist reading of the novel aligns Manon with the sign, inherently elusive in meaning. Outside of academia, modern readers sometimes find Manon underdeveloped as a character. Twenty-first century adaptations reinforced a sociological interpretation of Manon's character. Several adaptations translate the story to more recent time periods in French history, in which Manon is always a non-conformist who boldly pursues love despite disadvantaged circumstances.\nLegacy.\nAdaptations.\nStage.\nAlthough ballets and operas of \"Manon Lescaut\" became popular, only three theatrical dramas had even a modest success: \"The Virtuous Courtesan\" (1772), \"Manon Lescaut et le chevalier Desgrieux\" (1820), and \"Manon Lescaut\" (1851). \"The Virtuous Courtesan\" () was the first adaptation of \"Manon Lescaut.\" A theatrical comedy which ends with Manon surviving, it attempted to mix an emotional portrayal of the lovers with some humour, but reviewers found it far inferior to the novel. There were a small number of dramas in the 18th century and the Romantic period, followed by a larger number in the early 20th century. Relatively few of the early theatrical adaptations of \"Manon Lescaut\" have survived.\nThe literary historian Jean Sgard argues that operatic adaptations came late in the legacy of the novel because the story's mixture of genres was incompatible with the 18th century's dominant genre of serious opera characterized by Handel and Rameau. The first operatic adaptation, in 1836, was not a success. An important change in operatic precedent came after Giuseppe Verdi's highly successful 1853 opera, \"La traviata\" (\"The Fallen Woman\"). \"La traviata\" is based on the play and novel \"The Lady of the Camellias\" by Alexandre Dumas \"fils\", which are themselves heavily inspired by \"Manon Lescaut\". After 1853, six operas based on \"Manon Lescaut\" were written. These operas varied widely in how they adapted the story: it was divided into differing numbers of sections (from three to seven acts), and adaptations existed in the different operatic genres of comic opera, opera, and lyric drama. The most renowned adaptations of \"Manon Lescaut\" are the operas by Daniel Auber (1856), Jules Massenet (1884), and Giacomo Puccini (1893).\nFilm.\n\"Manon Lescaut\" was adapted several times after the invention of film. The first was a 1908 silent film adaptation of Puccini's opera, which used a device called a \"cinemofono\" to synchronize the film with a music recording. Several more silent films followed, of which nearly all are lost due to the degradation of nitrate film; the only one to survive in full is a 1927 Hollywood adaptation titled \"When a Man Loves\". According to the literary historian Alan J. Singerman, several early films alter the plot to present Manon as an innocent victim who will be more sympathetic to film audiences than an \"amoral and guilty\" figure motivated by a \"love of luxury and pleasure\". \nEarly adaptations were period films, set in the early 18th century; later film adaptations translate the novel's story to a contemporary setting. The 1949 film \"Manon\" by Henri-Georges Clouzot depicts des Grieux as a member of the French Resistance and Manon as a Nazi collaborator; he and Manon enter the black market and eventually stowaway to Palestine with a group of Jewish refugees. In \"Manon 70\" by Jean Aurel, released in 1968 and set in the near-future of 1970, des Grieux is a globetrotting radio journalist who tags along with Manon's sugar baby lifestyle; instead of ending with Manon's tragic death, this film concludes with both Manon and des Grieux hitchhiking.\nIllustrations.\nSeveral illustrated editions of \"Manon Lescaut\" have been produced, though it attracted substantially fewer illustrations than other bestsellers of the period like Voltaire's 1759 novella \"Candide.\" A 1963 catalogue identified 63 editions with original or notable illustrations, produced globally. New illustrated editions were produced most decades from 1780 to 1980. The novel also inspired a range of standalone visual interpretations (i.e., prints and paintings), though again fewer than similar 18th-century bestsellers; the visual iconography of \"Paul et Virginie\" (1788), for example, entered popular culture. \nTranslations.\nThe 1753 version of the novel is more common in modern editions. English translations of the original 1731 version of the novel include Helen Waddell's 1931 translation with a foreword by George Saintsbury. For the 1753 revision there are English translations by, among others, L. W. Tancock (Penguin, 1949\u2014which divides the 2-part novel into a number of chapters), Donald M. Frame (Signet, 1961\u2014which notes differences between the 1731 and 1753 editions), Angela Scholar (Oxford, 2004\u2014with extensive notes and commentary), and Andrew Brown (Hesperus, 2004\u2014with a foreword by Germaine Greer). There is also a 1999 edition, published by Bristol Classical Press and edited by P. Byrne, which presents the text in French with notes and commentary in English. \nHenri Valienne (1854\u20131908), a physician and author of the first novel in the constructed language Esperanto, translated \"Manon Lescaut\" into that language. His translation was published in Paris in 1908, and reissued by the British Esperanto Association in 1926.\nLiterary impact.\nAccording to the literary scholar English Showalter, Pr\u00e9vost \"set a style for the whole century\" with the novel's emphasis on regretful retrospective tales narrated from confinement: \"Dozens of fictional narrators preface their works by explaining that they hope the story of their own errors and misfortunes will serve as a guide to others.\" Showalter also says that Pr\u00e9vost's \"globetrotting characters,\" who \"dash about the world,\" inspired subsequent French novelists to depict expansive global travel.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38252", "revid": "14264656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38252", "title": "Radiohead", "text": "English rock band\nRadiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band members are Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, keyboards); the brothers Jonny Greenwood (guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, \"Pablo Honey\", in 1993. Their debut single, \"Creep\", was a worldwide hit, and their popularity and critical standing rose with \"The Bends\" in 1995. Their third album, \"OK Computer\" (1997), is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the greatest albums in popular music, with complex production and themes of modern alienation. Their fourth album, \"Kid A\" (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though \"Kid A\" divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by \"Amnesiac\" (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Radiohead's final album for EMI, \"Hail to the Thief\" (2003), blended rock and electronic music, with lyrics addressing the war on terror.\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, \"In Rainbows\" (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and commercial success. Their eighth album, \"The King of Limbs\" (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O'Brien have released solo albums. In 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK singles chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), and \"There There\" (2003). \"Creep\" and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Rolling Stone\" named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and included five of their albums in its lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\nHistory.\n1985\u20131992: formation and first years.\nThe members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, a private school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The bassist Colin Greenwood and the guitarist and singer Thom Yorke were in the same year; the guitarist Ed O'Brien was one year above, and the drummer Philip Selway was in the year above O'Brien. When O'Brien and Yorke formed a band, they asked Colin to play bass. They asked Selway to join after playing their first show with a drum machine. Colin's brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, was three years below Colin and Yorke and the last to join.\nIn 1985, the group formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. The band disliked the school's strict atmosphere\u2014the headmaster once charged them for using a rehearsal room on a Sunday\u2014and found solace in the music department. They credited their music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music.\nWhile each member contributed songs in the band's early period, Yorke emerged as the main songwriter. According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, rather than through any particular interest: \"It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool.\" They played few gigs, and focused on rehearsing in village halls. Oxford had an active independent music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive. On a Friday played their first gig in 1987 at Oxford's Jericho Tavern.\nOn the strength of an early demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records, but they decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first. They continued to rehearse on weekends and holidays, but did not perform for four years. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met Stanley Donwood, who later became Radiohead's cover artist.\nIn 1991, the band regrouped in Oxford, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road. They recorded another demo, which attracted the attention of Chris Hufford, Slowdive's producer and the co-owner of Oxford's Courtyard Studios. Hufford and his business partner, Bryce Edge, attended a concert at the Jericho Tavern; impressed, they became On a Friday's managers. According to Hufford, at this point the band had \"all of the elements of Radiohead\", but with a rougher, punkier sound and faster tempos. At Courtyard Studios, On a Friday recorded the \"Manic Hedgehog\" demo tape, named after an Oxford record shop.\nIn late 1991, Colin happened to meet the EMI A&amp;R representative Keith Wozencroft at a record shop and handed him a copy of the demo. Wozencroft was impressed and attended a performance. That November, On a Friday performed at the Jericho Tavern to an audience that included several A&amp;R representatives. It was only their eighth gig, but they had attracted interest from several record companies. A \"Melody Maker\" review praised their promise and \"astonishing intensity\", but said their name was \"terrible\". On 21 December, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI. At EMI's request, they changed their name; \"Radiohead\" was taken from the song \"Radio Head\" on the Talking Heads album \"True Stories\" (1986). Yorke said the name \"sums up all these things about receiving stuff ... It's about the way you take information in, the way you respond to the environment you're put in.\"\n1992\u20131994: \"Creep\", \"Pablo Honey\" and early success.\nRadiohead recorded their debut EP, \"Drill\", with Hufford and Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. As it was difficult for major labels such as EMI to promote bands in the UK, where independent labels dominated the indie charts, Radiohead's managers planned to have Radiohead use American producers and tour aggressively in America, then return to build a following in the UK. Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with the US bands the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., were enlisted to produce Radiohead's debut album, \"Pablo Honey,\" recorded quickly in Oxford in 1992. With the release of their debut single, \"Creep\", that September, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; \"NME\" described them as \"a lily-livered excuse for a rock band\", and \"Creep\" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 as \"too depressing\".\n\"Pablo Honey\" was released in February 1993. It reached number 22 in the UK charts. \"Creep\" and its follow-up singles \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" and \"Stop Whispering\" failed to become hits, and \"Pop Is Dead\", a non-album single, also sold poorly. O'Brien later called it \"a hideous mistake\". Some critics compared Radiohead to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them \"Nirvana-lite\", and \"Pablo Honey\" initially failed to make an impact. The members of Radiohead expressed dissatisfaction with the album in later years.\nIn early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. \"Creep\" had become a hit in Israel after it was played frequently by the influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and, in March, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first show overseas. Around the same time, \"Creep\" became a hit in America, a \"slacker anthem\" in the vein of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana and \"Loser\" by Beck. It reached number two on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock chart, number 34 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and number seven on the UK singles chart when EMI rereleased it in September. To build on the success, Radiohead embarked on a US tour supporting Belly and PJ Harvey, followed by a European tour supporting James and Tears for Fears.\n1994\u20131995: \"The Bends\", critical recognition and growing fanbase.\nRadiohead began work on their second album in 1994 with the veteran Abbey Road Studios producer John Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations to match the success of \"Creep\". To break a deadlock, Radiohead toured Asia, Australasia and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live. However, troubled by his new fame, Yorke became disillusioned with being \"at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle\" he felt he was helping to sell to the world.\nThe \"My Iron Lung\" EP and single, released in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album. It was Radiohead's first collaboration with their future producer, Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer, and the artist Stanley Donwood. Both have worked on every Radiohead album since. Though sales of \"My Iron Lung\" were low, it boosted Radiohead's credibility in alternative circles, creating commercial opportunity for their next album.\nHaving introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album, \"The Bends\", by 1995, and released it that March. It was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres, with greater use of keyboards. It received stronger reviews for its songwriting and performances. While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the Britpop scene that dominated music media at the time, they were finally successful in the UK, as the singles \"Fake Plastic Trees\", \"High and Dry\", \"Just\", and \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" became chart successes. \"High and Dry\" became a modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide success of \"Creep\". \"The Bends\" reached number 88 on the US album charts, and remains Radiohead's lowest showing there. Jonny Greenwood later said \"The Bends\" was turning point for Radiohead: \"It started appearing in people's [best-of] polls for the end of the year. That's when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band.\" In later years, \"The Bends\" appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including \"Rolling Stone's\" 2012 edition of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" at No. 111.\nIn 1995, Radiohead again toured North America and Europe, this time in support of R.E.M., one of their formative influences and at the time one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Attention from famous fans such as the R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, along with distinctive music videos for \"Just\" and \"Street Spirit\", helped sustain Radiohead's popularity outside the UK. The night before a performance in Denver, Colorado, Radiohead's tour van was stolen, and with it their musical equipment. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a stripped-down acoustic set with rented instruments and several shows were cancelled. Their first live video, \"Live at the Astoria\", was released in 1995.\n1995\u20131998: \"OK Computer\" and acclaim.\nBy late 1995, Radiohead had already recorded one song that would appear on their next record. \"Lucky\", released as a single to promote the War Child charity's \"The Help Album\", was recorded in a brief session with Nigel Godrich, the young audio engineer who had assisted on \"The Bends\". Radiohead decided to self-produce their next album with Godrich, and began work in early 1996. By July they had recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire. In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed recording not at a studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording in different rooms, and listening to the Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.\nRadiohead released their third album, \"OK Computer\", in May 1997. It found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant-garde and electronic influences, prompting \"Rolling Stone\" to call the album a \"stunning art-rock tour de force\". Radiohead denied being part of the progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd. Some compared \"OK Computer\" thematically to the 1973 Pink Floyd album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", although Yorke said the lyrics were inspired by observing the \"speed\" of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called \"end-of-the-millennium blues\" in contrast to the more personal songs of \"The Bends\". According to the journalist Alex Ross, Radiohead had become \"the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation\" as Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before. \"OK Computer\" received acclaim. Yorke said he was \"amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create.\"\n\"OK Computer\" was Radiohead's first number-one UK chart debut, and brought them commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, earning Radiohead their first Grammy Awards recognition, winning Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles, of which \"Karma Police\" was most successful internationally. \"OK Computer\" went on to become a staple of \"best-of\" British album lists. In the same year, Radiohead became one of the first bands in the world to have a website. Within a few years, there were dozens of fansites devoted to them.\n\"OK Computer\" was followed by the year-long Against Demons world tour, including Radiohead's first headline Glastonbury Festival performance in 1997. Despite technical problems that almost caused Yorke to abandon the stage, the performance was acclaimed and cemented Radiohead as a major live act. Grant Gee, the director of the \"No Surprises\" video, filmed the band on tour for the 1999 documentary \"Meeting People Is Easy\". The film portrays the band's disaffection with the music industry and press, showing their burnout over the course of the tour. \"OK Computer\" is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and the Generation X era, and one of the greatest albums in recording history.\nIn 1998, Radiohead performed at a Paris Amnesty International concert and the Tibetan Freedom Concert. In March, they and Godrich entered Abbey Road Studios to record a song for the 1998 film \"The Avengers\", \"Man of War\", but were unsatisfied with the results and it went unreleased. Yorke described the period as a \"real low point\". He and O'Brien developed depression, and the band came close to splitting up.\n1998\u20132001: \"Kid A\", \"Amnesiac\" and change in sound.\nAfter the success of \"OK Computer\", Radiohead bought a barn in Oxfordshire and converted it into a recording studio. They began work on their next album with Godrich in early 1999, working in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester before their new studio was completed. Although their success meant there was no longer pressure from their record label, tensions were high. The members had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke suffered from writer's block, influencing him toward more abstract, fragmented songwriting. O'Brien kept an online diary of their progress. After nearly 18 months, recording was completed in April 2000.\nRadiohead's fourth album, \"Kid A\", was released in October 2000. A departure from \"OK Computer\", \"Kid A\" featured a minimalist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation, including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings, and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where it became the first Radiohead album to debut atop the \"Billboard\" chart and the first US number-one album by any UK act since the Spice Girls in 1996. This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network Napster a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of \"OK Computer\". Although Radiohead released no singles from \"Kid A\", promos of \"Optimistic\" and \"Idioteque\" received radio play, and a series of \"blips\", short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released free online. Radiohead continued a 2000 tour of Europe in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted \"Kid A\" with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.\n\"Kid A\" received a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some British critics saw \"Kid A\" as a \"commercial suicide note\" and \"intentionally difficult\", and longed for a return to Radiohead's earlier style. Fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, many saw it as the band's best work. Yorke denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew expectations, saying: \"We're not trying to be difficult\u00a0... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people\u00a0... What we're doing isn't that radical.\" The album was ranked one of the best of all time by publications including \"Time\" and \"Rolling Stone;\" \"Rolling Stone\", \"Pitchfork\" and the \"Times\" named it the best album of the decade.\nRadiohead's fifth album, \"Amnesiac\", was released in May 2001. It comprised additional tracks from the \"Kid A\" sessions, including \"Life in a Glasshouse\", featuring the Humphrey Lyttelton Band. Radiohead stressed that they saw \"Amnesiac\" not as a collection of B-sides or outtakes from \"Kid A\" but an album in its own right. It topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number two in the US, and was nominated for a Grammy Award and the Mercury Music Prize. Radiohead released \"Pyramid Song\" and \"Knives Out\" as singles, their first since 1998. Radiohead began a North American tour, their first there in three years, in June 2001. With a string of sold-out dates, \"The Observer\" described it as \"the most sweeping conquest of America by a British group\" since Beatlemania, succeeding where bands such as Oasis had failed. Recordings from the \"Kid A\" and \"Amnesiac\" tours were released on \"\" in November 2001.\n2002\u20132006: \"Hail to the Thief\" and solo work.\nIn July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of new songs. For their next album, they sought to explore the tension between human and machine-generated music and capture a more immediate, live sound. They and Godrich recorded most of the material in two weeks at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles. The band described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for \"Kid A\" and \"Amnesiac\". Radiohead also composed music for \"Split Sides\", a dance piece by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, which debuted in October 2003 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\nRadiohead's sixth album, \"Hail to the Thief\", was released in June 2003. Its lyrics were influenced by what Yorke called \"the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity\" following the election of US President George W. Bush and the war on terror. \"Hail to the Thief\" debuted at number one in the UK and number three on the \"Billboard\" chart, and was certified platinum in the UK and gold in the US. The singles \"There There\", \"Go to Sleep\" and \"2 + 2 = 5\" achieved heavy circulation on modern rock radio. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Radiohead were again nominated for Best Alternative Album, and Godrich and the engineer Darrell Thorp received the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album. In May, Radiohead launched radiohead.tv, where they streamed short films, music videos and live webcasts from their studio. The material was released on the 2004 DVD \"The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time\". A compilation of \"Hail to the Thief\" B-sides, remixes and live performances, \"Com Lag (2plus2isfive)\", was released in April 2004. In May 2003, Radiohead embarked on a world tour and headlined Glastonbury Festival for the second time. The tour finished in May 2004 with a performance at the Coachella Festival in California.\n\"Hail to the Thief\" was Radiohead's final album with EMI; in 2006, \"The New York Times\" described Radiohead as \"by far the world's most popular unsigned band\". Following the \"Hail to the Thief\" tour, Radiohead went on hiatus to spend time with their families and work on solo projects. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood contributed to the Band Aid 20 charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", produced by Godrich. Greenwood composed soundtracks for the films \"Bodysong\" (2004) and \"There Will Be Blood\" (2007); the latter was the first of several collaborations with the director Paul Thomas Anderson. In July 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, \"The Eraser\", comprising mainly electronic music. He stressed it was made with the band's blessing, and that Radiohead were not breaking up. Jonny Greenwood said: \"He had to get this stuff out, and everyone was happy [for Yorke to make it] ... He'd go mad if every time he wrote a song it had to go through the Radiohead consensus.\" Selway and Jonny Greenwood appeared in the 2005 film \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" as members of the fictional band the Weird Sisters.\n2006\u20132009: departure from EMI, \"In Rainbows\", and \"pay what you want\".\nRadiohead began work on their seventh album in February 2005. Instead of involving Godrich, Radiohead hired the producer Spike Stent, but the collaboration was unsuccessful. In September 2005, Radiohead contributed \"I Want None of This\", a piano dirge, for the War Child charity album \"\". The album was sold online, with \"I Want None of This\" the most downloaded track, though it was not released as a single. In late 2006, after touring Europe and North America with new material, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich and resumed work in London, Oxford and rural Somerset, England. Recording ended in June 2007 and the recordings were mastered the following month.\nIn 2007, EMI was acquired by the private equity firm Terra Firma. Radiohead were critical of the new management, and no new deal was agreed. The \"Independent\" reported that EMI had offered Radiohead a \u00a33 million advance, but had refused to relinquish rights to the band's back catalogue. An EMI spokesman stated that Radiohead had demanded \"an extraordinary amount of money\". Radiohead's management and Yorke released statements denying that they had asked for a large advance, but had instead wanted control over their back catalogue.\nRadiohead self-released their seventh album, \"In Rainbows\", on their website on 10 October 2007 as a download, for any amount users wanted, including \u00a30. The landmark pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines worldwide and created debate about the implications for the music industry. Media reaction was positive, and Radiohead were praised for finding new ways to connect with fans. However, it drew criticism from musicians such as Lily Allen and Kim Gordon, who felt it undercut less successful acts.\n\"In Rainbows\" was downloaded an estimated 1.2\u00a0million times on the day of release. Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the \"regulated playlists\" and \"straitened formats\" of radio and TV, ensuring fans around the world could experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release. A special \"discbox\" edition of \"In Rainbows\", containing the record on vinyl, a book of artwork, and a CD of extra songs, was also sold from Radiohead's website.\nThe retail version of \"In Rainbows\" was released in the UK in late December 2007 on XL Recordings and in North America in January 2008 on TBD Records, reaching number one in the UK and in the US. The success was Radiohead's highest chart placement in the US since \"Kid A\". It became their fifth UK number-one album and sold more than three million copies in one year. The album received acclaim for its more accessible sound and personal lyrics. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and won the 2009 Grammy awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. It was nominated for five other Grammy awards, including Radiohead's third nomination for Album of the Year. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed \"15 Step\" with the University of Southern California Marching Band at the televised award show.\nThe first single from \"In Rainbows\", \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\", was released in January 2008, followed by \"Nude\" in March, which debuted at number 37 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100; it was Radiohead's first song to enter the chart since \"High and Dry\" (1995) and their first US top 40 since \"Creep\". In July, Radiohead released a digitally shot video for \"House of Cards\". Radiohead held remix competitions for \"Nude\" and \"Reckoner\", releasing the separated stems for fans to remix. In April 2008, Radiohead launched Waste Central, a social networking service for Radiohead fans. In May, VH1 broadcast \"In Rainbows \u2013 From the Basement\", a special episode of the music television show \"From the Basement\" in which Radiohead performed songs from \"In Rainbows\". It was released on iTunes in June. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote \"In Rainbows\", and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.\nDays after Radiohead signed to XL, EMI announced a box set of Radiohead material recorded before \"In Rainbows\", released in the same week as the \"In Rainbows\" special edition. Commentators including the \"Guardian\" saw the move as retaliation for the band choosing not to re-sign with EMI. In June 2008, EMI released a greatest hits album, \"\". It was made without Radiohead's involvement and contains only songs recorded under their contract with EMI. Yorke was critical of the release, calling it a \"wasted opportunity\". As social media expanded around the turn of the decade, Radiohead gradually withdrew their public presence, with no promotional interviews or tours to promote new releases. \"Pitchfork\" wrote that around this time Radiohead's \"popularity became increasingly untethered from the typical formalities of record promotion, placing them on the same level as Beyonc\u00e9 and Kanye West\".\n2009\u20132010: reissues, singles and side projects.\nIn 2009, EMI reissued the albums recorded while Radiohead was signed to them in a series of expanded \"Collector's Editions\", without Radiohead's involvement. Press reaction expressed concern that EMI was exploiting Radiohead's back catalogue. In May, Radiohead began new recording sessions with Godrich. In August, they released \"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\", a tribute song to Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in World War I, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. The song has no conventional rock instrumentation, and instead comprises Yorke's vocals and a string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood. Later that month, another new song, \"These Are My Twisted Words\", featuring krautrock-like drumming and guitars, was leaked via torrent, possibly by Radiohead. It was released as a free download on the Radiohead website the following week. Commentators saw the releases as part of Radiohead's new unpredictable release strategy, without the need for traditional marketing.\nIn 2009, Yorke formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, to perform his solo material, with musicians including Godrich and the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea. They played eight North American shows in 2010. In January 2010, Radiohead played their only full concert of the year in the Los Angeles Henry Fonda Theater as a benefit for Oxfam. Tickets were auctioned, raising over half a million US dollars for the NGO's 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. That December, a fan-made video of the performance, \"Radiohead for Haiti\", was released via YouTube and torrent with Radiohead's support and a \"pay-what-you-want\" link to donate to Oxfam. Radiohead also released the soundboard recording of their 2009 Prague performance for use in a fan-made concert video, \"Live in Praha\". The videos were described as examples of Radiohead's openness to fans and positivity toward non-commercial internet distribution.\nIn June 2010, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival, performing \"Eraser\" and Radiohead songs. Selway released his debut solo album, \"Familial\", in August. \"Pitchfork\" described it as a collection of \"hushed\" folk songs in the tradition of Nick Drake, with Selway on guitar and vocals.\n2011\u20132012: \"The King of Limbs\".\nRadiohead released their eighth album, \"The King of Limbs\", on 18 February 2011 as a download from their website. Following the protracted recording and more conventional rock instrumentation of \"In Rainbows\", Radiohead developed \"The King of Limbs\" by sampling and looping their recordings with turntables. It was followed by a retail release in March through XL, and a special \"newspaper album\" edition in May.\n\"The King of Limbs\" sold an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 copies through Radiohead's website. The retail edition debuted at number six on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and number seven on the UK Albums Chart. It was nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards. Two tracks not included on \"The King of Limbs\", \"Supercollider\" and \"The Butcher\", were released as a double A-side single for Record Store Day in April. A compilation of \"King of Limbs\" remixes by various artists, \"TKOL RMX 1234567\", was released in September.\nTo perform the rhythmically complex \"King of Limbs\" material live, Radiohead enlisted a second drummer, Clive Deamer, who had worked with Portishead and Get the Blessing. In June, Radiohead played a surprise performance on the Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, performing songs from \"The King of Limbs\" for the first time. With Deamer, Radiohead recorded \"\", released online in August 2011. It was also broadcast by international BBC channels and released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2012. The performance included two new songs, \"The Daily Mail\" and \"Staircase\", released as a double A-side download single in December 2011. In February 2012, Radiohead began their first extended North American tour in four years, including dates in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nOn 16 June 2012, an hour before gates were due to open at Toronto's Downsview Park for the final concert of Radiohead's North American tour, the roof of the venue's temporary stage collapsed, killing the drum technician Scott Johnson and injuring three other members of Radiohead's road crew. After rescheduling the tour, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson at their next concert, in N\u00eemes, France, in July. In June 2013, Live Nation Canada Inc, two other organisations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws. In September 2017, after several delays, the case was dropped under the Jordan ruling, which sets strict time limits on trials. Radiohead released a statement condemning the decision. A 2019 inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.\n2013\u20132014: side projects and move to XL.\nIn February 2013, Yorke and Godrich's band, Atoms for Peace, released an album, \"Amok\". The pair made headlines that year for their criticism of the free music streaming service Spotify. Yorke accused Spotify of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own \"direct connections\" with audiences instead.\nIn February 2014, Radiohead released an app, \"PolyFauna\", a collaboration with the British digital arts studio Universal Everything, with music and imagery from \"The King of Limbs\". In May, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, \"Subterranea\", to \"The\" \"Panic Office\", an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia. Yorke and Selway released their solo albums \"Tomorrow's Modern Boxes\" and \"Weatherhouse\" in late 2014. Jonny Greenwood scored his third Anderson film, \"Inherent Vice\"; it features a version of an unreleased Radiohead song, \"Spooks\", performed by Greenwood and members of Supergrass. \"Junun\", a collaboration between Greenwood, Godrich, the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and Indian musicians, was released in November 2015, accompanied by a documentary directed by Anderson.\nIn April 2016, Radiohead's back catalogue was acquired by XL Recordings, which had released the retail editions of \"In Rainbows\" and \"The King of Limbs\" and most of Yorke's solo work. XL reissued Radiohead's back catalogue on vinyl in May 2016.\n2015\u20132016: \"A Moon Shaped Pool\".\nRadiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014. In 2015, they resumed work in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France. The sessions were marred by the death of Godrich's father and Yorke's separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died from cancer in 2016. Work was interrupted when Radiohead were commissioned to write the theme for the 2015 James Bond film \"Spectre\". Their first submission, \"Man of War\", was rejected as it had not been written for the film. After their second submission, \"Spectre\", was also rejected, Radiohead released it on the audio streaming site SoundCloud on Christmas Day 2015.\nRadiohead's ninth studio album, \"A Moon Shaped Pool\", was released digitally in May 2016, followed by retail versions in June via XL Recordings. It was promoted with music videos for the singles \"Daydreaming\" (directed by Anderson) and \"Burn the Witch\". The album includes several songs written years earlier, including \"True Love Waits\", and strings and choral vocals performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. It became Radiohead's sixth UK number-one album and reached number three in the US. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in Mercury history, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for \"Burn the Witch\") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It appeared on several publications' lists of the best albums of the year.\nIn 2016, 2017 and 2018, Radiohead toured Europe, Japan, and North and South America, including headline shows at the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals. They were joined again by Deamer. The tours included a performance in Tel Aviv in July 2017, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. The performance was criticised by artists including Roger Waters and Ken Loach, and a petition urging Radiohead to cancel it was signed by more than 50 prominent figures. In a statement, Yorke responded: \"We don't endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.\"\n2017\u20132021: hiatus and reissues.\nFollowing the \"Moon Shaped Pool\" tour, Radiohead went on hiatus; Yorke was dealing with the death of Owen, and O'Brien said the band members felt \"disconnected and spent\". In June 2017, they released a 20th-anniversary \"OK Computer\" reissue, \"OKNOTOK 1997 2017\", comprising a remastered version of the album, B-sides, and previously unreleased material. Radiohead promoted the reissue with music videos for the bonus tracks \"I Promise\", \"Man of War\" and \"Lift\". \"OKNOTOK\" reached number two on the UK Album Chart, boosted by Radiohead's televised Glastonbury performance that week, and reached number 23 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. In August, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a benefit concert in the Marche, Italy, to help restoration efforts following the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake.\nRadiohead were nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, their first year of eligibility. They were nominated again in 2018 and inducted in March 2019. Though Jonny Greenwood and Yorke were uninterested in the event, Selway and O'Brien attended and made speeches. The singer David Byrne, one of Radiohead's formative influences, gave a speech praising Radiohead's musical and release innovations, which he said had influenced the whole industry.\nIn June 2019, several hours of recordings made by Radiohead during the \"OK Computer\" period leaked online. In response, Radiohead made them available to purchase online as \"MiniDiscs [Hacked]\", with all proceeds to the environmentalist group Extinction Rebellion. In December, Radiohead made their discography available free on YouTube. The following January, they launched the Radiohead Public Library, an online archive of their work, including music videos, live performances, artwork and the 1998 documentary \"Meeting People Is Easy\". Radiohead suspended their online content for Blackout Tuesday on 2 June, protesting racism and police brutality.\nIn 2017, Selway released his third solo work, the soundtrack to the film \"Let Me Go\". Jonny Greenwood was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his fifth collaboration with Anderson, \"Phantom Thread\" (2017), and scored his second film by Lynne Ramsay, \"You Were Never Really Here\" (2018). Yorke released his first feature film soundtrack, \"Suspiria\" (2018), and his third solo album, \"Anima\" (2019), backed by a short film directed by Anderson. In 2020, O'Brien released his debut solo album, \"Earth\", under the moniker EOB. He had been writing songs for years, but found they did not fit Radiohead. In April, to compensate for the lack of performances during the COVID-19 pandemic, Radiohead began streaming old concert films on YouTube on a weekly basis.\nRadiohead abandoned plans to tour in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November, they released \"Kid A Mnesia\", an anniversary reissue compiling \"Kid A\", \"Amnesiac\" and previously unreleased material. It was promoted with download singles and videos for the previously unreleased tracks \"If You Say the Word\" and \"Follow Me Around\". Plans for an art installation based on the albums were cancelled due to logistical problems and the pandemic. Instead, Radiohead created a free digital experience, \"Kid A Mnesia Exhibition\", for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.\n2021\u2013present: side projects, Israel controversy and return to touring.\nIn a livestream event held by Glastonbury Festival in May 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, with the drummer Tom Skinner. Greenwood said the band was a way to work with Yorke during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Smile toured internationally between 2022 and 2024, and released the albums \"A Light for Attracting Attention\" (2022), \"Wall of Eyes\" and \"Cutouts\" (both 2024). Critics interpreted the Smile as a liberating, lower-pressure project for Yorke and Greenwood, with more jazz, krautrock and progressive rock influences and a looser, wilder sound.\nColin Greenwood toured with Nick Cave between 2022 and 2024, and performed on Cave's 2024 album \"Wild God.\" He released a book of his photographs of Radiohead in October 2024. Selway released his third solo album, \"Strange Dance\", in February 2023. He also played drums and percussion on \"Versions of Us\" (2023) by Lanterns on the Lake, and joined them on tour. \"Jarak Qaribak\", an album by Jonny Greenwood and the Israeli rock musician Dudu Tassa, was released in June. Yorke released his second film soundtrack, \"Confidenza\", in April 2024, and began a solo tour, Everything, in October. Selway said in 2023 that it was healthy for the members to work with other musicians and that all the projects came under the Radiohead \"umbrella\".\nYorke reworked \"Hail to the Thief\" for a production of \"Hamlet\" by the Royal Shakespeare Company that opened at Aviva Studios, Manchester, in April 2025. \"Tall Tales\", an album by Yorke and the electronic musician Mark Pritchard, was released in May. \"This Is What You Get\", an exhibition of Yorke and Donwood's Radiohead artwork, opened at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in August. On 13 August, Radiohead released \"Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003\u20142009)\", a selection of performances of \"Hail to the Thief\" tracks. Greenwood scored his sixth film for Paul Thomas Anderson, \"One Battle After Another,\" released in September. On 4 November, Radiohead began a European tour, their first tour in seven years. Deamer was replaced by Chris Vatalaro.\nPressure for Radiohead to boycott Israel grew following the outbreak of the Gaza war in 2023. Jonny Greenwood was criticised for performing in Tel Aviv with Tassa in May 2024, and responded in a statement that Israeli artists should not be silenced. In October, Yorke temporarily left the stage after he was heckled by a pro-Palestine protester at a solo concert in Melbourne. In May 2025, two UK concerts by Jonny Greenwood and Tassa were canceled following threats to the venues and staff. Colin Greenwood described the cancellation as \"a curtailment of free speech and the possibilities of forging bonds between people with music and art\". That month, Yorke released a statement condemning the war efforts of Israel and Hamas and saying that pressuring artists to respond was not the solution. O'Brien has shown support for Palestine, and defended his bandmates: \"My brothers abhor what is going on in Gaza. Just because they aren't all over social media or using the exact wording that some feel is necessary does not mean they aren't genuinely upset and angered by what is going on.\" \"Pitchfork\" wrote that the controversy had damaged Radiohead's public perception, and questioned their \"ambiguous political position\" after releasing albums such as \"Hail to the Thief\", which was \"so evocative of the horrors of lopsided military annihilation\".\nArtistry.\nStyle.\nRadiohead's musical style has been described as art rock, alternative rock, electronica, experimental rock, progressive rock, grunge, art pop, and electronic rock. Critics found elements of grunge in their first album, \"Pablo Honey\". Their second album, \"The Bends\", is sometimes described as Britpop, though Radiohead disliked Britpop, seeing it as a \"backwards-looking\" pastiche. \nRadiohead songs often use pivot notes and pedal points, creating \"looser, roomier\" harmonies and a \"bittersweet, doomy\" feeling. Many use mixed modes and unusual or changing time signatures, such as \"You\", \"Everything in Its Right Place\", \"Morning Bell\" and \"15 Step\". O'Brien said Radiohead were hesitant to create \"epic\" music, which they felt had negative associations of stadium rock. However, he conceded that \"epic is also about beauty, like a majestic view\", and cited \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" as an example of a song that was \"obviously epic in scope\".\nJonny Greenwood said Radiohead strive to find a middle ground between their experimental influences and rock music, and were driven by a desire not to repeat themselves rather than to be \"experimental\". The drummer Clive Deamer, who joined Radiohead on tour between 2011 and 2018, said they do not see themselves as a rock band and that their methodology is closer to jazz: \"They deliberately try to avoid clich\u00e9 and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock bands don't do that. It's far more like a jazz mentality.\" Yorke dismissed accusations that Radiohead make \"depressing\" music, saying in 2004: \"Depressing music to me is just shit music. It's like air freshener \u2013 just a nasty little poison in the air.\"\nSongwriting.\nThough Yorke acts as Radiohead's director, all the members have a role in arrangement. In 2004, Yorke said that while his power was once \"absolutely unbalanced\" and he would \"subvert everybody else's power at all costs\", later albums had been more democratic. He apologised to his bandmates for his earlier \"control freak\" behaviour. O'Brien said that no member was replaceable and each was comfortable with their position.\nRadiohead songs usually begin as a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the rest of the band develop their parts. Whereas Yorke does not read sheet music, Greenwood is trained in music theory. In \"Pitchfork\", Ryan Dombal wrote that \"the duo's left brain-right brain dynamic has proven to be one of the most adventurous in rock history\". Yorke typically plays rhythm guitar, while Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts and O'Brien often creates ambient effects, making extensive use of effects units. O'Brien said Radiohead tired of songs \"with distorted guitars all the way through\" after \"Pablo Honey\", preferring separation and \"riffs and melodies that interweave at different registers\".\nThe \"Kid A\" and \"Amnesiac\" sessions brought a change in Radiohead's music and working methods. Since their shift from conventional rock instrumentation, the members have gained flexibility and often switch instruments. On \"Kid A\" and \"Amnesiac\", Yorke played keyboard and bass, Jonny Greenwood played ondes Martenot, Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway worked with drum machines and digital manipulation.\nJonny Greenwood said he saw Radiohead as \"just a kind of an arrangement to form songs using whatever technology suits the song\", be it a cello or a laptop. They often attempt several approaches to songs, and may develop them over years. For example, Radiohead first performed \"True Love Waits\" in 1995, and recorded several versions before releasing it on \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" in 2016. Selway said Radiohead had a tendency to overanalyse their work: \"You have it there and then you just try to pull it apart and then when you put it back together it doesn't look like a television set any more ... But it was there all along.\"\nInfluences.\nAmong Radiohead's earliest influences were Queen, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Elvis Costello, post-punk acts such as Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Magazine, and significantly 1980s alternative rock bands such as R.E.M., U2, the Pixies, the Smiths and Sonic Youth. Jonny Greenwood named the Magazine guitarist John McGeoch his biggest guitar influence. By the mid-1990s, Radiohead were adopting recording methods from hip-hop, inspired by the sampling work of DJ Shadow, and became interested in using computers to generate sounds. Radiohead cited 60s and 70s jazz artists such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Alice Coltrane as influences. According to Jonny Greenwood, \"We bring in our favourite jazz albums, and say: we want to do this. And we enjoy the sound of our failing!\" He likened their jazz influence to 1950s English bands imitating American blues records. Other influences include the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, 1960s rock groups such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, and Phil Spector's \"wall of sound\" production. O'Brien said Scott Walker was Radiohead's \"unifying\" influence, citing his voice, arrangements and instrumentation.\nThe electronic music of \"Kid A\" was inspired by Yorke's admiration for artists signed to the record label Warp Records, such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. In 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. \"Kid A\" also samples early computer music, and 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu! were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood cited the influence of the 20th-century classical composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen. Since the recording of \"Kid A\", Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen. While recording \"In Rainbows\", Radiohead mentioned rock, electronic, hip-hop and experimental musicians as influences, including Bj\u00f6rk, M.I.A, Liars, Modeselektor and Spank Rock.\nThemes and lyrics.\nYorke is Radiohead's lyricist. Though his early lyrics were personal, from \"Kid A\" on, he experimented with cutting up words and phrases and assembling them at random. He does not write biographically, saying he instead writes \"spasmodic\" lyrics based on imagery and taken from external sources such as television. He deliberately uses cliches, idioms and other common expressions, suggesting \"a mind consumed by meaningless data\". The \"New Republic\" writer Ryan Kearney speculated that Yorke's use of common expressions, which he described as \"Radioheadisms\", was an attempt \"to sap our common tongue of meaning and expose the vapidity of everyday discourse\".\nAccording to Yorke, many of his lyrics are motivated by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns and written as \"a constant response to doublethink\". The \"GQ\" critic Josiah Gogarty wrote of \"the uncharitable caricature that's sometimes fixed to [Radiohead's] music \u2013 Thom Yorke warbling vaguely political sentiments over fiddly drum patterns and melodies\", which he argued began with \"Hail to the Thief\" and its references to the war on terror. \"Pitchfork\" wrote that Yorke's lyrics on \"A Moon Shaped Pool\" were less cynical, conveying wonder and amazement.\nLegacy and influence.\nRadiohead are cited as one of the foremost rock bands of the 21st century. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums. Their 90s albums \"The Bends\" and \"OK Computer\" influenced a generation of British acts, including Coldplay, Keane, James Blunt and Travis. \"\" Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with expanding alternative rock.\nAccording to the \"AllMusic\" journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in the early 21st century, Radiohead became \"a touchstone for everything that is fearless and adventurous in rock\", succeeding David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Talking Heads. In 2001, Johnny Marr, the guitarist for one of Radiohead's early influences, the Smiths, said that Radiohead was the act that had \"come closest to the genuine influence of the Smiths\".\nIn 2003, the \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau wrote that Radiohead were \"the only youngish band standing that combines critical consensus with the ability to fill a venue larger than the Hammerstein Ballroom\". Gavin Haynes of \"NME\" described Radiohead in 2014 as \"our generation's Beatles\". In 2020, the academic Daphne Brooks described Radiohead as \"the blackest white rock band to emerge over the past 30 years\", citing their black jazz influences, influence on black artists, and their \"introspective other worlds\", which parallel the work of radical black artists.\nIndustry.\n\"Kid A\" is credited for pioneering the use of the internet to stream and promote music. The pay-what-you-want release for \"In Rainbows\" is credited as a major step for music distribution. \"Forbes\" wrote that it \"helped forge the template for unconventional album releases in the internet age\", ahead of artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake. Speaking at Radiohead's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, the Talking Heads singer David Byrne, an early influence on Radiohead, praised their musical and release innovations, which he said had influenced the entire music industry.\nAccolades.\nRadiohead's work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In a 2004 list composed by 55 musicians, writers and industry executives, \"Rolling Stone\" named Radiohead 73rd-greatest artist of all time. They have been listed among the greatest bands of all time by \"Spin\" (15th) and among the greatest artists by VH1 (29th). They were also named the third-best British band in history by Harry Fletcher of the \"Evening Standard\".\nRadiohead are the most nominated act for the Mercury Prize, with five nominated albums. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. In 2009, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted Radiohead the second-best artist of the 2000s, behind Green Day. In 2021, \"Pitchfork\" readers voted \"OK Computer, Kid A\" and \"In Rainbows\" among the ten greatest albums of the preceding 25 years. Jonny Greenwood and O'Brien were both included in \"Rolling Stone\"'s lists of the best guitarists and Yorke in its lists of the greatest singers.\nCollaborators.\nNigel Godrich first worked with Radiohead as an audio engineer on their second album, \"The Bends\". He has produced all their studio albums since their third album, \"OK Computer\". Godrich has been dubbed the band's \"sixth member\", an allusion to George Martin being called the \"Fifth Beatle\". In 2016, Godrich said: \"I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and knowledge of each other would have been thrown out of the window and they'd have to start again.\"\nGodrich also plays Chieftain Mews, a character who first appeared in \"The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time\" and has since appeared in Radiohead's promotional material. The journalist Mac Randall described Mews as \"a 21st-century Max Headroom\" who \"intones non-sequiturs\". Yorke credited the filmmaker Chris Bran for his creation.\nThe graphic artist Stanley Donwood met Yorke when they were art students. Together, they have produced all of Radiohead's album covers and visual artwork since 1994. Donwood works in the studio with the band as they record, allowing the music to influence the artwork. He and Yorke won a Grammy in 2002 for the special edition of \"Amnesiac\", packaged as a library book.\nSince Radiohead's formation, Andi Watson has been their lighting and stage director, designing the visuals of their live concerts. Peter \"Plank\" Clements has worked with Radiohead since before \"The Bends\", overseeing the technical management of studio recordings and live performances. Jim Warren has been Radiohead's live sound engineer since their first tour in 1992, and recorded early tracks including \"High and Dry\" and \"Pop Is Dead\". Radiohead enlisted the drummer Clive Deamer to help perform the complex rhythms of \"The King of Limbs\" for live performances; he also joined them for the \"Moon Shaped Pool\" tour. On Radiohead's 2025 tour, Deamer was replaced by Chris Vatalaro. Paul Thomas Anderson has directed several music videos for Yorke and Radiohead, and has collaborated with Jonny Greenwood on several film scores and the 2015 documentary \"Junun\".\nBusiness and song catalogue.\nRadiohead are managed by Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge of Courtyard Management, which also manages Faithless, Supergrass and Kate Nash. They recorded their first six albums under contract with Parlophone, a subsidiary of EMI. The contract ended with the release of \"Hail to the Thief\" in 2003. They did not renew the contract for their next album, \"In Rainbows\" (2007), as EMI would not give them control over their back catalogue and they did not trust the new owner, Guy Hands. Radiohead have self-released their subsequent work, with retail editions released by XL Recordings.\nIn September 2012, EMI was bought by Universal Music. The European Commission approved the deal on the condition that Universal Music divest Parlophone, which controlled the Radiohead records. In February 2013, Parlophone was bought by Warner Music Group (WMG). As a condition of the purchase, WMG made an agreement with the Merlin Network and the trade group Impala to divest 30% of the Parlophone catalogues to independent labels, with artist approval. In April 2016, WMG transferred Radiohead's back catalogue to XL. \"\" and the reissues released by EMI in 2008 without Radiohead's approval were removed from streaming services. In October 2015, Radiohead sued Parlophone for deductions made from downloads of their back catalogue.\nIn 1993, Radiohead created a limited company, Radiohead Ltd, to handle income from tours. It had a revenue of \u00a3735,765 after the release of \"The Bends\" (1995), \u00a32.1m after \"OK Computer\" (1997) and almost \u00a38m following \"Hail to the Thief\" (2003). In May 1996, Radiohead established Waste Products Ltd. to produce and sell merchandise. The band members also own half of Sandbag Limited, created in 2002 as a sister company of Waste, which handles direct-to-customer sales of albums, merchandise and other goods for Radiohead and other acts. Starting with \"In Rainbows\", Radiohead have created limited companies or limited liability partnerships for their releases, minimising risk in the event of commercial failure, lawsuits or touring accidents.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He established himself as a leading man of French cinema through his collaborations with director Luc Besson, and has worked in numerous international productions. He is a three-time C\u00e9sar Award nominee - Best Actor for \"Les Visiteurs\" (1993) and \"\" (1994), and Best Supporting Actor for \"The Big Blue\" (1988).\nReno's other notable films include \"Le Dernier Combat\" (1983), \"La Femme Nikita\" (1990), \"\" (1996), \"Ronin\" (1998), \"Godzilla\" (1998), \"Crimson Rivers\" (2000), \"Wasabi\" (2001), \"The Pink Panther\" (2006), \"The Da Vinci Code\" (2006), \"Flushed Away\" (2006), \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" (2014), \"The Promise\" (2016), and \"Da 5 Bloods\" (2020).\nEarly life.\nReno was born Juan Moreno y Herrera-Jim\u00e9nez, on 30 July 1948 in Casablanca, French Morocco. His parents were Spanish, natives of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda and Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia. They had moved to North Africa to find work and escape Francoist Spain. Reno has a younger sister named Mar\u00eda Teresa (\"Maite\"). Their father was a linotypist. Their mother died when he was a teenager. \nAt the age of 17, Reno and his family moved to France, where he studied acting at the Cours Simon School of Drama in Paris. Reno also served in the French Army, as his military service became mandatory once his family had gained French citizenship.\nReno learned Spanish from his parents, and French growing up in Morocco, and Italian from studying it as a special interest and acting in Italian films.\nCareer.\nAfter he started to get acting jobs in France, Juan adopted the French version of his name, Jean, and shortened his surname to Reno. Due to his large frame (), Reno was called on to play \"heavies\" in his early career. He later appeared in romantic comedies and action films. He began his film career in France, appearing in many films by director Luc Besson, including his early \"Le Dernier Combat\" (1983). The two have continued to work together, collaborating in films produced, written, or directed by Besson. Of their joint work, those that have achieved the most critical and commercial success include: \"La Femme Nikita\" (1990), and the English-language films \"The Big Blue\" (1988) and \"\" (1994). \nReno did the voice-over for Mufasa in the French-language version of \"The Lion King\", a role originally performed in English by James Earl Jones. Reno has starred in such high-profile American films as \"French Kiss\" (1995) with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline, \"\" (1996) with Tom Cruise, \"Ronin\" (1998) with Robert De Niro, and \"Godzilla\" (1998) with Matthew Broderick. Reno turned down the role of Agent Smith in \"The Matrix\". He also acted in French productions: \"Les Visiteurs\" (1993) (which was remade in English as \"Just Visiting\" in 2001); \"The Crimson Rivers\" (2000), and \"Jet Lag\" (\"D\u00e9calage Horaire\") by Dani\u00e8le Thompson (2002), which was also a box-office success in France.\nIn 2006, Reno had a prominent role in \"The Pink Panther\" 2006 remake and its sequel \"The Pink Panther 2\", playing Gilbert Ponton, opposite Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau. He portrayed Captain Bezu Fache in the Ron Howard film \"The Da Vinci Code\". Among his most successful films are \"Les Visiteurs\" and \"L'Enqu\u00e8te corse\".\nIn other media, Reno was involved in the production of the third installment in the popular Capcom series \"Onimusha\" (\"\"), lending his likeness to the protagonist Jacques Blanc, as well as providing the voice for the character's French dialogue. In advertising work, Reno has appeared in American television commercials for UPS and portrayed Doraemon in a series of Toyota ads in Japan, as part of the \"ReBorn\" campaign. He also starred as \"Jo\" in the 2013 English-language TV series \"Jo\".\nIn 2024, Reno released his first novel, \"Emma\".\nPersonal life.\nReno married his first wife, Genevi\u00e8ve, in 1977; they divorced in 1988. Reno married his second wife, Polish model Nathalie Dyszkiewicz, in 1995. They divorced in 2001. On 29 July 2006, Reno married for the third time, to a British model and actress of Polish descent, Zofia Borucka, at the Les Baux-de-Provence city hall. The presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy served as his best man (Reno endorsed Sarkozy for the 2007 French presidential election). Reno has six children, two from each marriage.\nReno maintains three homes in Paris, Malaysia, and Los Angeles. He is a dual citizen of France and Spain. In a 2016 interview, Reno stated \"his roots are above all Spanish, Andalusian.\"\nStage credits.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the separation of elements from naturally occurring sources such as ores using an electrolytic cell. The voltage that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the decomposition potential. The word \"lysis\" means to separate or break, so in terms, electrolysis would mean \"breakdown via electricity.\"\nEtymology.\nThe word \"electrolysis\" was introduced by Michael Faraday in 1834, using the Greek words \"amber\", which since the 17th century was associated with electrical phenomena, and \"\" meaning \"dissolution\". Nevertheless, electrolysis, as a tool to study chemical reactions and obtain pure elements, precedes the coinage of the term and formal description by Faraday.\nHistory.\nIn the early nineteenth century, William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle sought to further Volta's experiments. They attached two wires to either side of a voltaic pile and placed the other ends in a tube filled with water. They noticed when the wires were brought together that each wire produced bubbles. One type was hydrogen, the other was oxygen.\nIn 1785 a Dutch scientist named Martin van Marum created an electrostatic generator that he used to reduce tin, zinc and antimony from their salts using a process later known as electrolysis. Though he unknowingly produced electrolysis, it was not until 1800 when William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle discovered how electrolysis works.\nIn 1791 Luigi Galvani experimented with frog legs. He claimed that placing animal muscle between two dissimilar metal sheets resulted in electricity. Responding to these claims, Alessandro Volta conducted his own tests. This would give insight to Humphry Davy's ideas on electrolysis. During preliminary experiments, Humphry Davy hypothesized that when two elements combine to form a compound, electrical energy is released. Humphry Davy would go on to create Decomposition Tables from his preliminary experiments on Electrolysis. The Decomposition Tables would give insight on the energies needed to break apart certain compounds.\nIn 1817 Johan August Arfwedson determined there was another element, lithium, in some of his samples; however, he could not isolate the component. It was not until 1821 that William Thomas Brande used electrolysis to single it out. Two years later, he streamlined the process using lithium chloride and potassium chloride with electrolysis to produce lithium and lithium hydroxide.\nDuring the later years of Humphry Davy's research, Michael Faraday became his assistant. While studying the process of electrolysis under Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday discovered two laws of electrolysis.\nDuring the time of Maxwell and Faraday, concerns came about for electropositive and electronegative activities.\nIn November 1875, Paul \u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered gallium using electrolysis of gallium hydroxide, producing 3.4\u00a0mg of gallium. The following December, he presented his discovery of gallium to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in Paris.\nOn June 26, 1886, Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan finally felt comfortable performing electrolysis on anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to create a gaseous fluorine pure element. Before he used hydrogen fluoride, Henri Moissan used fluoride salts with electrolysis. Thus on June 28, 1886, he performed his experiment in front of the \"Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\" to show his discovery of the new element fluorine. While trying to find elemental fluorine through electrolysis of fluoride salts, many chemists perished including Paulin Louyet and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Nickl\u00e8s.\nIn 1886 Charles Martin Hall from America and Paul H\u00e9roult from France both filed for American patents for the electrolysis of aluminum, with H\u00e9roult submitting his in May, and Hall, in July. Hall was able to get his patent by proving through letters to his brother and family evidence that his method was discovered before the French patent was submitted. This became known as the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process which benefited many industries because aluminum's price then dropped from four dollars to thirty cents per pound.\nIn 1902 Polish engineer and inventor Stanis\u0142aw \u0141aszczy\u0144ski filed for and obtained Polish patent for the electrolysis of copper and zinc.\nOverview.\nElectrolysis is the passing of a direct electric current through an electrolyte which is producing chemical reactions at the electrodes and decomposition of the materials.\nThe main components required to achieve electrolysis are an electrolyte, electrodes, and an external power source. A partition (e.g. an ion-exchange membrane or a salt bridge) is optional to keep the products from diffusing to the vicinity of the opposite electrode.\nThe electrolyte is a chemical substance which contains free ions and carries electric current (e.g. an ion-conducting polymer, solution, or an ionic liquid compound). If the ions are not mobile, as in most solid salts, then electrolysis cannot occur. A liquid electrolyte is produced by:\nThe electrodes are immersed separated by a distance such that a current flows between them through the electrolyte and are connected to the power source which completes the electrical circuit. A direct current supplied by the power source drives the reaction causing ions in the electrolyte to be attracted toward the respective oppositely charged electrode.\nElectrodes of metal, graphite and semiconductor material are widely used. Choice of suitable electrode depends on chemical reactivity between the electrode and electrolyte and manufacturing cost. Historically, when non-reactive anodes were desired for electrolysis, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time) or platinum were chosen. They were found to be some of the least reactive materials for anodes. Platinum erodes very slowly compared to other materials, and graphite crumbles and can produce carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions but otherwise does not participate in the reaction. Cathodes may be made of the same material, or they may be made from a more reactive one since anode wear is greater due to oxidation at the anode.\nProcess of electrolysis.\nThe key process of electrolysis is the interchange of atoms and ions by the removal or addition of electrons due to the applied potential. The desired products of electrolysis are often in a different physical state from the electrolyte and can be removed by mechanical processes (e.g. by collecting gas above an electrode or precipitating a product out of the electrolyte).\nThe quantity of the products is proportional to the current, and when two or more electrolytic cells are connected in series to the same power source, the products produced in the cells are proportional to their equivalent weight. These are known as Faraday's laws of electrolysis.\nEach electrode attracts ions that are of the opposite charge. Positively charged ions (cations) move towards the electron-providing (negative) cathode. Negatively charged ions (anions) move towards the electron-extracting (positive) anode. In this process electrons are effectively introduced at the cathode as a reactant and removed at the anode as a product. In chemistry, the loss of electrons is called oxidation, while electron gain is called reduction.\nWhen neutral atoms or molecules, such as those on the surface of an electrode, gain or lose electrons they become ions and may dissolve in the electrolyte and react with other ions.\nWhen ions gain or lose electrons and become neutral, they will form compounds that separate from the electrolyte. Positive metal ions like Cu2+ deposit onto the cathode in a layer. The terms for this are electroplating, electrowinning, and electrorefining.\nWhen an ion gains or loses electrons without becoming neutral, its electronic charge is altered in the process.\nFor example, the electrolysis of brine produces hydrogen and chlorine gases which bubble from the electrolyte and are collected. The initial overall reaction is thus:\n2 NaCl + 2 H2O \u2192 2 NaOH + H2 + Cl2\nThe reaction at the anode results in chlorine gas from chlorine ions:\n2 Cl\u2212 \u2192 Cl2 + 2 e\u2212\nThe reaction at the cathode results in hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions:\n2 H2O + 2 e\u2212 \u2192 H2 + 2 OH\u2212\nWithout a partition between the electrodes, the OH\u2212 ions produced at the cathode are free to diffuse throughout the electrolyte to the anode. As the electrolyte becomes more basic due to the production of OH\u2212, less Cl2 emerges from the solution as it begins to react with the hydroxide producing hypochlorite (ClO\u2212) at the anode:\nCl2 + 2 NaOH \u2192 NaCl + NaClO + H2O\nThe more opportunity the Cl2 has to interact with NaOH in the solution, the less Cl2 emerges at the surface of the solution and the faster the production of hypochlorite progresses. This depends on factors such as solution temperature, the amount of time the Cl2 molecule is in contact with the solution, and concentration of NaOH.\nLikewise, as hypochlorite increases in concentration, chlorates are produced from them:\n 3 NaClO \u2192 NaClO3 + 2 NaCl\nOther reactions occur, such as the self-ionization of water and the decomposition of hypochlorite at the cathode, the rate of the latter depends on factors such as diffusion and the surface area of the cathode in contact with the electrolyte.\nDecomposition potential.\nDecomposition potential or decomposition voltage refers to the minimum voltage (difference in electrode potential) between anode and cathode of an electrolytic cell that is needed for electrolysis to occur.\nThe voltage at which electrolysis is thermodynamically preferred is the difference of the electrode potentials as calculated using the Nernst equation. Applying additional voltage, referred to as overpotential, can increase the rate of reaction and is often needed above the thermodynamic value. It is especially necessary for electrolysis reactions involving gases, such as oxygen, hydrogen or chlorine.\nOxidation and reduction at the electrodes.\nOxidation of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the anode. For example, it is possible to oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions at the anode:\n Fe(aq) \u2192 Fe(aq) + e\u2212 \nReduction of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the cathode. It is possible to reduce ferricyanide ions to ferrocyanide ions at the cathode:\nFe(CN) + e\u2212 \u2192 Fe(CN)\nNeutral molecules can also react at either of the electrodes. For example: \"p\"-benzoquinone can be reduced to hydroquinone at the cathode:\n + 2 e\u2212 + 2 H+ \u2192 \nIn the last example, H+ ions (hydrogen ions) also take part in the reaction and are provided by the acid in the solution, or by the solvent itself (water, methanol, etc.). Electrolysis reactions involving H+ ions are fairly common in acidic solutions. In aqueous alkaline solutions, reactions involving OH\u2212 (hydroxide ions) are common.\nSometimes the solvents themselves (usually water) are oxidized or reduced at the electrodes. It is even possible to have electrolysis involving gases, e.g. by using a gas diffusion electrode.\nEnergy changes during electrolysis.\nThe amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (in theory) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum thermodynamic efficiency equals the enthalpy change divided by the free energy change of the reaction. In most cases, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released in the form of heat. In some cases, for instance, in the electrolysis of steam into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true and heat energy is absorbed. This heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the heating value of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input.\nVariations.\nPulsating current results in products different from DC. For example, pulsing increases the ratio of ozone to oxygen produced at the anode in the electrolysis of an aqueous acidic solution such as dilute sulphuric acid. Electrolysis of ethanol with pulsed current evolves an aldehyde instead of primarily an acid.\nRelated processes.\nGalvanic cells and batteries use spontaneous, energy-releasing redox reactions to generate an electrical potential that provides useful power. When a secondary battery is charged, its redox reaction is run in reverse and the system can be considered as an electrolytic cell.\nIndustrial uses.\nThe chloralkali process is a large scale application of electrolysis. This technology supplies most of the chlorine and sodium hydroxide required by many industries. The cathode is a mixed metal oxide clad titanium anode (also called a dimensionally stable anode).\nElectrofluorination.\nMany organofluorine compounds are produced by electrofluorination. One manifestation of this technology is the Simons process, which can be described as:\nR3C\u2013H + HF \u2192 R3C\u2013F + H2\nIn the course of a typical synthesis, this reaction occurs once for each C\u2013H bond in the precursor. The cell potential is maintained near 5\u20136 V. The anode, the electrocatalyst, is nickel-plated.\nHydrodimerization of acrylonitrile.\nAcrylonitrile is converted to adiponitrile on an industrial scale via electrocatalysis.\nElectroplating and electrowinning processes.\nElectroplating, where a thin film of metal is deposited over a substrate material. Electroplating is used in many industries for either functional or decorative purposes, as in-vehicle bodies and nickel coins.\nElectrochemical machining (ECM).\nIn Electrochemical machining, an electrolytic cathode is used as a shaped tool for removing material by anodic oxidation from a workpiece. ECM is often used as a technique for deburring or for etching metal surfaces like tools or knives with a permanent mark or logo.\nCompeting half-reactions in solution electrolysis.\nUsing a cell containing inert platinum electrodes, electrolysis of aqueous solutions of some salts leads to the reduction of the cations (such as metal deposition with, for example, zinc salts) and oxidation of the anions (such as the evolution of bromine with bromides). However, with salts of some metals (such as sodium) hydrogen is evolved at the cathode, and for salts containing some anions (such as sulfate SO42\u2212) oxygen is evolved at the anode. In both cases, this is due to water being reduced to form hydrogen or oxidized to form oxygen.\nIn principle, the voltage required to electrolyze a salt solution can be derived from the standard electrode potential for the reactions at the anode and cathode. The standard electrode potential is directly related to the Gibbs free energy, \u0394\"G\", for the reactions at each electrode and refers to an electrode with no current flowing. An extract from the table of standard electrode potentials is shown below.\nIn terms of electrolysis, this table should be interpreted as follows:\nUsing the Nernst equation the electrode potential can be calculated for a specific concentration of ions, temperature and the number of electrons involved. For pure water (pH\u00a07):\nComparable figures calculated in a similar way, for 1\u00a0M zinc bromide, ZnBr2, are \u22120.76\u00a0V for the reduction to Zn metal and +1.10\u00a0V for the oxidation producing bromine.\nThe conclusion from these figures is that hydrogen should be produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode from the electrolysis of water\u2014which is at variance with the experimental observation that zinc metal is deposited and bromine is produced.\nThe explanation is that these calculated potentials only indicate the thermodynamically preferred reaction. In practice, many other factors have to be taken into account such as the kinetics of some of the reaction steps involved. These factors together mean that a higher potential is required for the reduction and oxidation of water than predicted, and these are termed overpotentials. Experimentally it is known that overpotentials depend on the design of the cell and the nature of the electrodes.\nFor the electrolysis of a neutral (pH\u00a07) sodium chloride solution, the reduction of sodium ion is thermodynamically very difficult and water is reduced evolving hydrogen leaving hydroxide ions in solution. At the anode the oxidation of chlorine is observed rather than the oxidation of water since the overpotential for the oxidation of chloride to chlorine is lower than the overpotential for the oxidation of water to oxygen. The hydroxide ions and dissolved chlorine gas react further to form hypochlorous acid. The aqueous solutions resulting from this process is called electrolyzed water and is used as a disinfectant and cleaning agent.\nResearch trends.\nElectrolysis of carbon dioxide.\nThe electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 can produce value-added chemicals such as methane, ethylene, ethanol, etc. The electrolysis of carbon dioxide gives formate or carbon monoxide, but sometimes more elaborate organic compounds such as ethylene. This technology is under research as a carbon-neutral route to organic compounds.\nElectrolysis of acidified water.\nElectrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen in a ratio of 2 to 1 respectively.\n2 H2O(l) \u2192 2 H2(g) + O2(g) \u00a0 \"E\"\u00b0 = +1.229\u00a0V\nThe energy efficiency of water electrolysis varies widely. The efficiency of an electrolyser is a measure of the enthalpy contained in the hydrogen (to undergo combustion with oxygen or some other later reaction), compared with the input electrical energy. Heat/enthalpy values for hydrogen are well published in science and engineering texts, as 144\u00a0MJ/kg (40 kWh/kg). Note that fuel cells (not electrolysers) cannot use this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology. In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolysers (50 kWh/kg); however, higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency.\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated in 2006 that 1\u00a0kg of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to 3\u00a0kg, or 4 liters, of petroleum in energy terms) could be produced by wind powered electrolysis for between US$5.55 in the near term and US$2.27 in the longer term.\nAbout 4% of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated by electrolysis, and normally used onsite. Hydrogen is used for the creation of ammonia for fertilizer via the Haber process, and converting heavy petroleum sources to lighter fractions via hydrocracking. Onsite electrolysis has been utilized to capture hydrogen for hydrogen fuel-cells in hydrogen vehicles.\nCarbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis.\nRecently, to reduce the energy input, the utilization of carbon (coal), alcohols (hydrocarbon solution), and organic solution (glycerol, formic acid, ethylene glycol, etc.) with co-electrolysis of water has been proposed as a viable option. The carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis (so-called CAWE) process for hydrogen generation would perform this operation in a single electrochemical reactor. This system energy balance can be required only around 40% electric input with 60% coming from the chemical energy of carbon or hydrocarbon. This process utilizes solid coal/carbon particles or powder as fuels dispersed in acid/alkaline electrolyte in the form of slurry and the carbon contained source co-assist in the electrolysis process as following theoretical overall reactions:\nCarbon/Coal slurry (C + 2H2O) \u2192 CO2 + 2H2 \u00a0 \"E\"\u2032 = 0.21\u00a0V (reversible voltage) / \"E\"\u2032 = 0.46\u00a0V (thermo-neutral voltage)\nor\nCarbon/Coal slurry (C + H2O) \u2192 CO + H2 \u00a0 \"E\"\u2032 = 0.52\u00a0V (reversible voltage) / \"E\"\u2032 = 0.91\u00a0V (thermo-neutral voltage)\nThus, this CAWE approach is that the actual cell overpotential can be significantly reduced to below 1.0\u00a0V as compared to 1.5\u00a0V for conventional water electrolysis.\nElectrocrystallization.\nA specialized application of electrolysis involves the growth of conductive crystals on one of the electrodes from oxidized or reduced species that are generated in situ. The technique has been used to obtain single crystals of low-dimensional electrical conductors, such as charge-transfer salts and linear chain compounds.\nElectrolysis of Iron Ore.\nThe current method of producing steel from iron ore is very carbon intensive, in part to the direct release of CO2 in the blast furnace. A study of steel making in Germany found that producing 1 ton of steel emitted 2.1 tons of CO2e with 22% of that being direct emissions from the blast furnace. As of 2022, steel production contributes 7\u20139% of global emissions. Electrolysis of iron can eliminate direct emissions and further reduce emissions if the electricity is created from green energy.\nThe small-scale electrolysis of iron has been successfully reported by dissolving it in molten oxide salts and using a platinum anode. Oxygen anions form oxygen gas and electrons at the anode. Iron cations consume electrons and form iron metal at the cathode. This method was performed a temperature of 1550\u00a0\u00b0C which presents a significant challenge to maintaining the reaction. Particularly, anode corrosion is a concern at these temperatures.\nAdditionally, the low temperature reduction of iron oxide by dissolving it in alkaline water has been reported. The temperature is much lower than traditional iron production at 114\u00a0\u00b0C. The low temperatures also tend to correlate with higher current efficiencies, with an efficiency of 95% being reported. While these methods are promising, they struggle to be cost competitive because of the large economies of scale keeping the price of blast furnace iron low.\nElectrolysis of seawater.\nA 2020 study investigated direct electrolysis of seawater, alkaline electrolysis, proton-exchange membrane electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis. Direct electrolysis of seawater follows known processes, forming an electrolysis cell in which the seawater acts as the electrolyte to allow for the reaction at the anode, and the reaction at the cathode, . The inclusion of magnesium and calcium ions in the seawater makes the production of alkali hydroxides possible that could form scales in the electrolyser cell, cutting down on lifespan and increasing the need for maintenance. The alkaline electrolysers operate with the following reactions at the anode, , and at the cathode, , and use high base solutions as electrolytes, operating at and need additional separators to ensure the gas phase hydrogen and oxygen remain separate. The electrolyte can easily get contaminated, but the alkaline electrolyser can operate under pressure to improve energy consumption. The electrodes can be made of inexpensive materials and there's no requirement for an expensive catalyst in the design.\nMany alternatives to this simple electrolyzer described exist. Micro-electrolyzer designs are able to eliminate the separator requirement by designing the internal flow to separate the gases autonomously. See for example &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00a0 (\"Device and method for large scale harvesting of solar energy through hydrogen production\") where the operating pressure is increased to the point of Chlorine liquefaction so that sea water electrolyzer can proceed in a locally alkaline electrolytic fluid. Removing separators allows operating at very high temperatures. The structural design allows for operations at upto 700 bar thereby eliminating the need for Hydrogen compressors.\nProton-exchange membrane electrolysers operate with the reactions at the anode, and cathode, , at temperatures of , using a solid polymer electrolyte and requiring higher costs of processing to allow the solid electrolyte to touch uniformly to the electrodes. Similar to the alkaline electrolyser, the proton exchange membrane electrolyser can operate at higher pressures, reducing the energy costs required to compress the hydrogen gas afterward, but the proton exchange membrane electrolyser also benefits from rapid response times to changes in power requirements or demands and not needing maintenance, at the cost of having a faster inherent degradation rate and being the most vulnerable to impurities in the water.\nSolid oxide electrolysers run the reactions at the anode and at the cathode. The solid oxide electrolysers require high temperatures () to operate, generating superheated steam. They suffer from degradation when turned off, making it a more inflexible hydrogen generation technology. In a selected series of multiple-criteria decision-analysis comparisons in which the highest priority was placed on economic operation costs followed equally by environmental and social criteria, it was found that the proton exchange membrane electrolyser offered the most suitable combination of values (e.g., investment cost, maintenance, and operation cost, resistance to impurities, specific energy for hydrogen production at sea, risk of environmental impact, etc.), followed by the alkaline electrolyser, with the alkaline electrolyser being the most economically feasible, but more hazardous in terms of safety and environmental concerns due to the need for basic electrolyte solutions as opposed to the solid polymers used in proton-exchange membranes. Due to the methods conducted in multiple-criteria decision analysis, non-objective weights are applied to the various factors, and so multiple methods of decision analysis were performed simultaneously to examine the electrolysers in a way that minimizes the effects of bias on the performance conclusions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38260", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38260", "title": "Epirus", "text": "Historical region in the Balkans\nEpirus () is a geographical and historical region in southeastern Europe, now shared between Greece and Albania. Classical Epirus roughly lay between the Pindus Mountains in the east and the Ionian Sea in the west, and between the Acroceraunian Mountains in the north and the Ambracian Gulf in the south. It is currently divided between the region of Epirus in northwestern Greece and the counties of Gjirokast\u00ebr and Vlor\u00eb in southern Albania. The largest city and seat of the Greek administrative region of Epirus is Ioannina.\nA rugged and mountainous region, in classical antiquity Epirus was the north-west area of ancient Greece. It was inhabited by the Greek tribes of the Chaonians, Molossians, and Thesprotians. It was home to the sanctuary of Dodona, the oldest oracle in ancient Greece, and the second most prestigious after Delphi. Unified into a single state in 370 BC by the Aeacidae dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of Pyrrhus of Epirus who fought the Roman Republic in a series of campaigns. Epirus subsequently became part of the Roman Republic along with the rest of Greece in 146 BC, which was followed by the Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire.\nFollowing the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade (1204), Epirus became the center of the Despotate of Epirus, one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire. In the 14th century, Epirus was brought under the rule of the restored Byzantine Empire, before being briefly conquered by the Serbian Empire. The region was then divided amongst a number of despotates and political entities, including the Despotate of Epirus, the Despotate of Arta, the Zenebishi family, and the Republic of Venice, before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. Epirus became part of the semi-independent Pashalik governed by the Ottoman Albanian ruler Ali Pasha in the early 19th century, but the Sublime Porte re-asserted its control in 1821. Following the Balkan Wars and World War I, southern Epirus became part of Greece, while northern Epirus became part of Albania.\nName and etymology.\nThe name \"Epirus\" is the Latin name of the region, derived from the (), meaning \"mainland\" or \"terra firma\". It is thought to come from an Indo-European root \"*apero-\" 'coast', and was applied by the Ancient Greeks to the territory opposite Corfu and the Ionian islands. The name first appears in the work of Hecataeus of Miletus in the 6th century BC and is one of the few Greek names from the view of an external observer with a maritime-geographical perspective. Although a foreign name, it later came to be adopted by the inhabitants of the area, and it was struck on the coinage of the unified Epirote commonwealth: \"\u0391\u03a0\u0395\u0399\u03a1\u03a9\u03a4\u0391\u039d\" (, , i.e. \"of the Epirotes\", see adjacent image).\nIn the Middle Ages, the term was used by the Despotate of Epirus, one of the Greek successor states of the Byzantine Empire following the dismemberment of the latter in 1204. By the Late Middle Ages, during the period of Humanism and the European Renaissance, the term was used as a synonym for Albania. During the Ottoman period the term was not used. Since the development of the modern Greek nationalism from the early 19th century onwards, the part of Lower Albania \u2013 the southern half of Ottoman Albania \u2013 that fell within the definition of ancient Epirus, has been called by the newly revived name by Greeks ever since. In Greece the name is used by the administrative region of Epirus. The Albanian name , which is derived from the ancient name, is used for the ancient region and not for an administrative one. Similarly, the Aromanian name is derived from the ancient one.\nBoundaries and definitions.\nHistorically, the geographical area of Epirus proper is defined within the lines drawn from Cape Gjuh\u00ebz of the Ceraunian Mountains in the north-west, to Mount Qelq\u00ebz in the north-east, to Mount Gavrovo in the south-east, to the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf in the south-west. The northern boundary of ancient Epirus is alternatively given as the Vjosa river. Epirus's eastern boundary is defined by the Pindus Mountains, that form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly. To the west, Epirus faces the Ionian Sea. The island of Corfu is situated off the Epirote coast but is not regarded as part of Epirus.\nThe definition of Epirus has changed over time, such that modern administrative boundaries do not correspond to the boundaries of ancient Epirus. The region of Epirus in Greece only comprises a fraction of classical Epirus and does not include its easternmost portions, which lie in Thessaly. In Albania, where the concept of Epirus is never used in an official context, classical Epirus comprises parts of the counties of Gjirokast\u00ebr and Vlor\u00eb.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn the Neolithic period Epirus was populated by seafarers along the coast and by shepherds and hunters from the southwestern Balkans who brought with them the Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large mounds containing shaft graves. Similar burial chambers were subsequently used by the Mycenaean civilization, suggesting that the founders of Mycenae may have come from Epirus and central Albania. Epirus itself remained culturally backward during this time, but Mycenaean remains have been found at two religious shrines of great antiquity in the region: the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the heroes of Homer's Odyssey, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona, to whom Achilles prayed in the Iliad.\nIn the Middle Bronze Age, Epirus was inhabited by the same nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle in the rest of Greece. Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes originated.\nAccording to Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev, Epirus was part of the Proto-Greek linguistic area during the Late Neolithic period. By the early 1st millennium BC, all fourteen Epirote tribes including the Chaonians in northwestern Epirus, the Molossians in the centre and the Thesprotians in the south, were speakers of a strong west Greek dialect.\nEpirus in the Classical and Hellenistic periods.\nGeographically on the edge of the Greek world, Epirus remained for the most part outside the limelight of Greek history until relatively late, much like the neighbouring Greek regions of Macedonia, Aetolia, and Acarnania, with which Epirus had political, cultural, linguistic and economic connections. Unlike most other Greeks of this time, who lived in or around city-states, the inhabitants of Epirus lived in small villages and their way of life was foreign to that of the poleis of southern Greece. Their region lay on the periphery of the Greek world and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a frontier area contested with the Illyrian peoples to the north. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than might have been expected given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at Dodona \u2013 regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at Delphi.\nThe Epirotes, speakers of a Northwest Greek dialect, different from the Doric of the Greek colonies on the Ionian islands, and bearers of mostly Greek names, as evidenced by epigraphy, seem to have been regarded with some disdain by some classical writers. The 5th-century BC Athenian historian Thucydides describes them as \"barbarians\" in his \"History of the Peloponnesian War\", as does Strabo in his \"Geography\", although the latter clearly distinguishes them from the neighboring Illyrians. Other writers, such as Herodotus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Pausanias, and Eutropius, describe them as Greeks. Similarly, Epirote tribes/states are included in the Argive and Epidaurian lists of the Greek Thearodokoi (hosts of sacred envoys). Plutarch mentions an interesting element of Epirote folklore regarding Achilles: In his biography of King Pyrrhus, he claims that Achilles \"had a divine status in Epirus and in the local dialect he was called Aspetos\" (meaning \"unspeakable\", \"unspeakably great\", in Homeric Greek).\nBeginning in 370 BC, the Molossian Aeacidae dynasty built a centralized state in Epirus and began expanding their power at the expense of rival tribes. The Aeacids allied themselves with the increasingly powerful kingdom of Macedon, in part against the common threat of Illyrian raids, and in 359 BC the Molossian princess Olympias, niece of Arybbas of Epirus, married King Philip II of Macedon. She was to become the mother of Alexander the Great.\nOn the death of Arybbas, Alexander of Epirus succeeded to the throne and the title King of Epirus in 334 BC. He invaded Italy, but was killed in battle by a Lucanian in the Battle of Pandosia against several Italic tribes 331 BC. Aeacides of Epirus, who succeeded Alexander, espoused the cause of Olympias against Cassander, but was dethroned in 313 BC. The struggle between Macedonia and Epirus involved the Illyrian Taulantii, when the Illyrian king Glaukias offered asylum to Aeacides' son, Pyrrhus, after his father was expelled from his kingdom among the Molossians. In 306 BC Glaukias invaded Epirus and established Pyrrhus on the Epirote throne, where he ruled with Illyrian help until he attended the wedding of one of his adoptive brothers (son of Glaukias) in 302 BC. In Pyrrhus' absence Molossians replaced him with Neoptolemus, another member of the Aeacides. Pyrrhus managed to murder Neoptolemus and eventually regained the throne. As king of Epirus, Pyrrhus strengthened his links with the Illyrian tribes by marriage alliances. For six years Pyrrhus fought against the Romans and Carthaginians in southern Italy and Sicily. The high cost of his victories against the Romans gave Epirus a new, but brief, importance, as well as a lasting contribution to the Greek language with the concept of a \"Pyrrhic victory\". Pyrrhus nonetheless brought great prosperity to Epirus, building the great theater of Dodona and a new suburb at Ambracia (now modern Arta), which he made his capital.\nThe Aeacid dynasty ended in 232 BC, but Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament, or \"synedrion\". However, it was faced with the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars against Macedon. The League steered an uneasy neutral course in the first two Macedonian Wars but split in the Third Macedonian War (171\u2013168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians siding with Rome. The outcome was disastrous for Epirus; Molossia fell to Rome in 167 BC and 150,000 of its inhabitants were enslaved and deported; the central part of Epirus never regained its former prosperity.\nRoman and Byzantine rule.\nEpirus as a Roman province.\nFollowing his victory over Cleopatra and Mark Antony at Actium, Emperor Augustus commemorated the triumph by founding a Roman colony at Nicopolis ('City of Victory') in 29 BC. The region of Epirus was placed under the senatorial province of Achaea in 27 BC, with the exception of its northernmost part, which remained part of the province of Macedonia. Under Emperor Trajan, sometime between 103 and 114 AD, Epirus became a separate province, under a \"procurator Augusti\". The new province extended from the Gulf of Aulon (Vlor\u00eb) and the Acroceraunian Mountains in the north to the lower course of the Acheloos River in the south, and included the northern Ionian Islands of Corfu, Lefkada, Ithaca, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos.\nLate Antiquity.\nSometime during the provincial reorganization by Diocletian (r. 284\u2013305), the western portion of the province of Macedonia along the Adriatic coast was split off into a new province, called \"New Epirus\" () which roughly corresponded to southern Illyria proper, historically inhabited by Illyrian tribes. Epirus proper thereafter became known as \"Old Epirus\" (, ).\nThe two Epirote provinces became part of the Diocese of Moesia, until it was divided in ca. 369 into the dioceses of Macedonia and Dacia, when they became part of the former. In the 4th century, Epirus was still a stronghold of paganism, and was aided by Emperor Julian (r. 361\u2013363) and his praetorian prefect Claudius Mamertinus through reduction in taxes and the rebuilding of the provincial capital, Nicopolis. According to Jordanes, in 380 the Visigoths raided the area. With the division of the Empire on the death of Theodosius I in 395, Epirus became part of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. In 395\u2013397, the Visigoths under Alaric plundered Greece. They remained in Epirus for a few years, until 401, and again in 406\u2013407, during Alaric's alliance with the Western Roman generalissimo Stilicho in order to wrest the Eastern Illyricum from the Eastern Empire.\nThe \"Synecdemus\" of Hierocles, composed in ca. 527/8 AD but probably reflecting the situation in the first half of the 5th century, reports 11 cities for Old Epirus (, ): the capital Nicopolis, Dodona, Euroea, Hadrianopolis, Appon, Phoenice, Anchiasmos, Buthrotum, Photike, Corfu Island, and Ithaca Island. New Epirus, with capital at Dyrrhachium, comprised 9 cities. From 467 on, the Ionian Islands and the coasts of Epirus became subject to raids by the Vandals, who had taken over the North African provinces and established their own kingdom centred on Carthage. The Vandals notably seized Nicopolis in 474 as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with Emperor Zeno, and plundered Zakynthos, killing many of its inhabitants and ferrying off others into slavery. Epirus Nova became a battleground in the rebellions of the Ostrogoths after 479. In 517, a raid of the Getae or Antae reached Greece, including Epirus Vetus. The claim of Procopius of Caesarea in his \"Secret History\", that under Justinian I (r. 527\u2013565) the entirety of the Balkan provinces was raided by barbarians every year, is considered rhetorical hyperbole by modern scholars; only a single Slavic raid to the environs of Dyrrhachium, in 548/9, has been documented. Procopius further reports that in 551, in an attempt to interdict the Byzantines' lines of communication with Italy during the Gothic War, the Ostrogoth king Totila sent his fleet to raid the shores of Epirus. In response to these raids, and to repair the damage done by two destructive earthquakes in 522, Justinian initiated a wide-ranging programme of reconstruction and re-fortification: Hadrianopolis was rebuilt, albeit in reduced extent, and renamed Justinianopolis, while Euroea was moved further inland (traditionally identified with the founding of Ioannina), while Procopius claims that no less than 36 smaller fortresses in Epirus Vetus\u2014most of them not identifiable today\u2014were either rebuilt or built anew.\nEpirus from the Slavic invasions until 1204.\nIn the late 6th century Epirus proper fell under the control of the Avars and their Slavic allies. This is placed by the \"Chronicle of Monemvasia\" in the year 587, and is further corroborated by evidence that several sees were abandoned by their bishops by 591. Thus in c.\u2009590 the bishop, clergy and people of Euroea fled their city, carrying with them the relics of their patron saint, St. Donatus, to Cassiope in Corfu.\nOf the various Slavic tribes, only the Baiounitai, first attested c.\u2009615, are known by name, giving their name to their region of settlement: \"Vagenetia\". Based on the density of the Slavic toponyms in Epirus, the Slavs must have settled in the region, although the extent of this settlement is unclear. Slavic toponyms occur mainly in the mountainous areas of the interior and the coasts of the Gulf of Corinth, indicative of the fact that this was the avenue used by most of the Slavs who crossed the Gulf into the Peloponnese. With the exception of some few toponyms on Corfu, the Ionian Islands seem to not have been affected by Slavic settlement. The linguistic analysis of the toponyms reveals that they date mostly to the early wave of Slavic settlement at the turn of the 6th/7th centuries. Due to scarcity of textual evidence, it is unclear how much the area was affected by the second wave of Slavic migration, which began in the middle of the 8th century due to Bulgar pressure in the northern Balkans. Slavic toponyms are nearly lacking in the mountains of Lab\u00ebria (on the Kurvelesh plateau), in the Ionian coast where today Lab Albanian villages neighbour with the Greek-speaking ones, therefore it can be assumed that the expansion of the Slavs had not reached this region. A number of Slavic toponyms in Epirus proper were acquired by Albanian in the earliest phase of contacts between the two languages (Early Middle Ages), reflecting some of the more archaic phonetic features of Slavic as well as early Albanian phonology.\nAs in eastern Greece, the restoration of Byzantine rule seems to have proceeded from the islands, chiefly Cephallonia, which was certainly under firm Imperial control in c.\u2009702, when Philippicus Bardanes was banished there. The gradual restoration of Imperial rule is evidenced further from the participation of local bishops in councils in Constantinople: whereas only the bishop of Dyrrhachium participated in the Ecumenical Councils of 680/1 and 692, a century later the bishops of Dyrrhachium, Nicopolis, Corfu, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos are attested in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. In about the middle of the 8th century, the Theme of Cephallenia was established, but at least initially it was more oriented towards restoring Byzantine control over the Ionian and Adriatic seas, combating Saracen piracy, and securing communications with the remaining Byzantine possessions in Italy, rather than any systematic effort at subduing the Epirote mainland. Nevertheless, following the onset of the Muslim conquest of Sicily in 827, the Ionian became particularly exposed to Arab raids.\nThe 9th century saw great progress in the restoration of Imperial control in the mainland, as evidenced by the participation of the bishops of Ioannina, Naupaktos, Hadrianopolis, and Vagenetia (evidently by now organized as a \"Sklavinia\" under imperial rule) in the Ecumenical Councils of 869/70 and 879/80. The Byzantine recovery resulted in an influx of Greeks from southern Italy and Asia Minor into the Greek interior, while remaining Slavs were Christianized and Hellenized. The eventual success of the Hellenization campaign also suggests a continuity of the original Greek population, and that the Slavs had settled among many Greeks, in contrast to areas further north, in what is now Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, as those areas could not be Hellenized when they were recovered by the Byzantines in the early 11th century. Following the great naval victory of admiral Nasar in 880, and the beginning of the Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in southern Italy in the 880s, the security situation improved and the Theme of Nicopolis was established, most likely after 886. As the ancient capital of Epirus had been laid waste by the Slavs, the capital of the new theme became Naupaktos further south. The extent of the new province is unclear, but probably matched the extent of the Metropolis of Naupaktos, established at about the same time, encompassing the sees of Vonditsa, Aetos, Acheloos, Rogoi, Ioannina, Hadrianopolis, Photike, and Buthrotum. Vagenetia notably no longer appears as a bishopric. As the authors of the \"Tabula Imperii Byzantini\" comment, it appears that \"the Byzantine administration had brought the strongly Slavic-settled areas in the mainland somewhat under its control, and a certain Re-Hellenization had set in\". Further north, the region around Dyrrhachium existed as the homonymous theme possibly as early as the 9th century.\nDuring the early 10th century, the themes of Cephallenia and Nicopolis appear mostly as bases for expeditions against southern Italy and Sicily, while Mardaites from both themes are listed in the large but unsuccessful expedition of 949 against the Emirate of Crete. In c.\u2009930, the Theme of Nicopolis was raided by the Bulgarians, who even occupied some parts until driven out or subjugated by the Byzantines years later. Only the extreme north of Epirus seems to have remained consistently under Bulgarian rule in the period, but under Tsar Samuel, who moved the centre of Bulgarian power south and west to Ohrid, probably all of Epirus down to the Ambracian Gulf came under Bulgarian rule. This is evidenced from the fact that the territories that were under Bulgarian rule formed part of the autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid after the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria by Emperor Basil II in 1018: thus in Epirus the sees of Chimara, Hadrianopolis, Bela, Buthrotum, Ioannina, Kozyle, and Rogoi passed under the jurisdiction of Ohrid, while the Metropolitan of Naupaktos retained only the sees of Bonditza, Aetos, and Acheloos. Basil II also established new, smaller themes in the region: Koloneia, and Dryinopolis (Hadrianopolis).\nThe region joined the uprising of Petar Delyan in 1040, and suffered in the First Norman invasion of the Balkans: Dyrrhachium was occupied by the Normans in 1081\u20131084, Arta was unsuccessfully besieged, and Ioannina was captured by Robert Guiscard. An Aromanian presence in Epirus is first mentioned in the late 11th century, while Jewish communities are attested throughout the medieval period in Arta and Ioannina.\nDespotate of Epirus.\nWhen Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the \"partitio Romaniae\" assigned Epirus to Venice, but the Venetians were largely unable to effectively establish their authority, except over Dyrrhachium (the \"Duchy of Durazzo\"). The Greek noble Michael Komnenos Doukas, who had married the daughter of a local magnate, took advantage of this, and within a few years consolidated his control over most of Epirus, first as a Venetian vassal and eventually as an independent ruler. By the time of his death in 1214/5, Michael had established a strong state, the Despotate of Epirus, with the former theme of Nicopolis at its core and Arta as its capital. Epirus, and the city of Ioannina in particular, became a haven for Greek refugees from the Latin Empire of Constantinople for the next half century.\nThe Despotate of Epirus ruled over Epirus and western Greece as far south as Naupaktos and the Gulf of Corinth, much of Albania (including Dyrrhachium), Thessaly, and the western portion of Macedonia, extending its rule briefly over central Macedonia and most of Thrace following the aggressive expansionism of Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who established the Empire of Thessalonica in 1224. During this time, the definition of Epirus came to encompass the entire coastal region from the Ambracian Gulf to Dyrrhachium, and the hinterland to the west up to the highest peaks of the Pindus mountain range. Some of the most important cities in Epirus, such as Gjirokast\u00ebr (Argyrokastron), were founded during this period. The oldest reference to Albanians in the area of Epirus proper is from a Venetian document dating to 1210, which states that \"the continent facing the island of Corfu is inhabited by Albanians\".\n14th century and Ottoman conquest.\nIn 1337, Epirus was once again brought under the rule of the restored Byzantine Empire. In 1348, taking advantage of the civil war between the Byzantine emperors John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos, the Serbian king Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an conquered Epirus, with a number of Albanian mercenaries assisting him. The Byzantine authorities in Constantinople soon re-established a measure of control by making the Despotate of Epirus a vassal state, but Albanian clans proceeded to invade and seize most of the region. Under Pjet\u00ebr Losha, the Albanian Malakasi and Mazaraki tribes defeated Nikephoros II Orsini at the Battle of Achelous in 1359, which won Pjet\u00ebr Losha the rule of Arta; Losha then founded the Despotate of Arta (1358\u20131416) with the help of the Mazaraki and Malakasi clans.\nAlthough Albanian clans gained control of most of the region by 1366/7, their continued division into rival clans meant that they could not establish a single central authority. Ioannina became a center of Greek resistance to the Albanian clans. The Greeks of Ioannina offered power to three foreign rulers during this time, beginning with Thomas II Preljubovi\u0107 (1367\u20131384), whose rule was marked by hostilities in the region, as Ioannina came under constant siege by the Mazaraki and Malakasi clans under Losha. These tribes would besiege Ioannina a second time in 1374\u20131375. A truce was signed when Pjet\u00ebr's son Gjin was betrothed to Thomas's daughter Irina, but she would soon die in the 1375 plague and hostilities would recommence. Preljubovi\u0107 attempted to pacify the Albanians of Epirus; however, under Gjin Bua Shpata, the Albanians defeated him.\nThe reign of Esau de' Buondelmonti (1385\u20131411) in Ioannina followed, and with an army that consisted of the Albanian tribes of the Mazaraki and Malakasi, he marched against the Principality of Gjirokast\u00ebr. He was defeated and captured by Albanian nobleman Gjon Zenebishi, and ransomed for 10,000 gold pieces on the intervention of the Venetian governor of Corfu. At the time the Zenebishi clan controlled the area around Gjirokast\u00ebr (1386\u20131411), while only the city of Ioannina remained under Greek control.\nCarlo I Tocco (1411\u20131429) then assumed control of Ioannina, commencing heavy conflicts with Jakob and Muriq Shpata, the Albanian leaders of the Despotate of Arta. The Shpata were originally defeated by Carlo's brother Leonardo II Tocco at Mazoma near ancient Nicopolis, but Carlo's son Torno was in turn defeated by the Albanians. After the Tocchi succeeded in capturing Rhiniasa, Leonardo tried to take Rogoi and Carlo attempted to take Arta, but Jakob and Muriq succeeded in defending their capital for the time being. Carlo withdrew to Ioannina, but soon after was able to lure Jakob to an ambush near Vobliana: Jakob was captured and immediately executed (1 October 1416). Carlo had effectively ended the rule of the Albanian clans in southernmost Epirus.\nNevertheless, internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which began with the capture of Ioannina in 1430 and continued with Arta in 1449, Angelokastro in 1460, Riniasa Castle and its environs (in what is now Preveza) in 1463, and finally Vonitsa in 1479. With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was also the end of Latin rule in mainland Greece.\nOttoman rule.\nThe Ottomans ruled Epirus for almost 500 years. Their rule in Epirus proved particularly damaging; the region was subjected to deforestation and excessive cultivation, which damaged the soil and drove many Epirotes to emigrate so as to escape the region's pervasive poverty. Nonetheless, the Ottomans did not enjoy total control of Epirus. The Himara and Zagori regions managed to successfully resist Ottoman rule and maintained a degree of independence throughout this period. The Ottomans expelled the Venetians from almost the whole area in the late 15th century.\nBetween the 16th and 19th centuries, the city of Ioannina attained great prosperity and became a major center of the modern Greek Enlightenment. Numerous schools were founded, such as the Balaneios, Maroutsaia, Kaplaneios, and Zosimaia, teaching subjects such as literature, philosophy, mathematics and physical sciences. In the 18th century, as the power of the Ottoman Empire declined, the area of Epirus became part of a \"de facto\" independent state, the Pashalik of Yanina, under the rule of Ali Pasha of Tepelena, a Muslim Albanian brigand who rose to become the provincial governor of Ioannina in 1788. At the height of his power, he and his sons controlled all southern and central Albania; most of mainland Greece, including Epirus, Thessaly, West Macedonia, western Central Macedonia, Continental Greece (excluding Attica), and the Peloponnese; and parts of southwestern North Macedonia around Ohrid and Manastir. Ali Pasha's campaign to subjugate the confederation of the settlements of Souli met with fierce resistance by the Souliot warriors of the mountainous area. After numerous failed attempts to defeat the Souliotes, his troops succeeded in conquering the area in 1803. On the other hand, Ali, who used Greek as official language, witnessed an increase of Greek cultural activity with the establishment of several educational institutions.\nWhen the Greek War of Independence broke out, the inhabitants of Epirus contributed greatly. Two of the founding members of the Filiki Eteria (the secret society of the Greek revolutionaries), Nikolaos Skoufas and Athanasios Tsakalov, came from the Arta area and the city of Ioannina, respectively. Greece's first constitutional prime minister (1844\u20131847), Ioannis Kolettis, was a native of the village of Syrrako in Epirus and was a former personal physician to Ali Pasha. Ali Pasha tried to use the war as an opportunity to make himself a fully independent ruler, but was assassinated by Ottoman agents in 1822. When Greece became independent in 1830, however, Epirus remained under Ottoman rule. In 1854, during the Crimean War, a major local rebellion broke out. Although the newly found Greek state tried tacitly to support it, the rebellion was suppressed by Ottoman forces after a few months. Another failed rebellion by local Greeks broke out in 1878. During this period, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople managed to shut down the few Albanian schools, considering teaching in Albanian a factor that would diminish its influence and lead to the creation of separate Albanian church, while publications in Albanian were banned by the Ottoman Empire. In the late 19th century, the Kingdom of Italy opened various schools in the regions of Ioannina and Preveza in order to influence the local population. These schools began to attract students from the Greek language schools, but were ultimately closed after intervention and harassment by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Throughout, the late period of Ottoman rule (from the 18th century) Greek and Aromanian population of the region suffered from Albanians raiders, that sporadically continued after Ali Pasha's death, until 1912\u20131913.\n20th-century Epirus.\nWhile the Treaty of Berlin (1878) awarded large parts of Epirus to Greece, opposition by the Ottomans and the League of Prizren resulted in only the region of Arta being ceded to Greece in 1881. It was only following the First Balkan War of 1912\u20131913 and the Treaty of London that the rest of southern Epirus, including Ioannina, was incorporated into Greece. Greece had also seized northern Epirus during the Balkan Wars, but the Treaty of Bucharest, which concluded the Second Balkan War, assigned Northern Epirus to Albania.\nThis outcome was unpopular among local Greeks, as a substantial Greek population existed on the Albanian side of the border. Among Greeks, northern Epirus was henceforth regarded as \"terra irredenta\". Local Greeks in northern Epirus revolted, declared their independence and proclaimed the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus in February 1914. After fierce guerrilla fighting, they managed to gain full autonomy under the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, signed by Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives and approved by the Great Powers. The signing of the Protocol ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local Greeks and provided self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty. The Republic, however, was short-lived, as when World War I broke out, Albania collapsed, and northern Epirus was alternately controlled by Greece, Italy and France at various intervals.\nAlthough the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded Northern Epirus to Greece, developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War and, crucially, Italian lobbying in favor of Albania meant that Greece would not keep Northern Epirus. In 1924, the area was again ceded to Albania.\nIn 1939, Italy occupied Albania, and in 1940 invaded Greece. The Italians were driven back into Albania, however, and Greek forces again took control of northern Epirus. The conflict marked the first tactical victory of the Allies in World War II. Benito Mussolini himself supervised the spring counter-offensive of his divisions in spring 1941, only to be repulsed again by the poorly equipped, but determined, Greeks. Nazi Germany then intervened in April 1941 to avert an Italian defeat. The German military performed rapid military maneuvers through Yugoslavia and forced the encircled Greek forces of the Epirus front to surrender.\nThe whole of Epirus was then placed under Italian occupation until 1943, when the Germans took over following the Italian surrender to the Allies. Due to the extensive activity of the anti-Nazi Greek resistance (mainly under EDES), the Germans carried out large scaled anti-partisan sweeps, making wide use of Nazi-collaborationist bands of Cham Albanians, who committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population. They fought fiercely against the Greek partisans of the EDES, the latter being ordered by the Allied command to push them out of Greece into Albania. The violent clashes and the reprisals that followed by the Greek guerillas resulted in the expulsion to Albania of almost the entire Cham population.\nWith the liberation of Greece and the start of the first round of the Greek Civil War at the end of 1944, the highlands of Epirus became a major theater of guerrilla warfare between the leftist Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) and the right-wing National Republican Greek League (EDES). In subsequent years (1945\u20131949), the mountains of Epirus also became the scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the second and bloodier round of the Greek Civil War. The final episode of the war took place on Mount Grammos in 1949, ending with the defeat of the Communists. Peace returned to the region in 1949, although because of official Albanian active involvement in the civil war on the side of the communists, the formal state of war between Greece and Albania remained in effect until 1987. Another reason for the continuation of the state of war until 1987 was that during the entire period of Communist rule in Albania, the Greek population of Northern Epirus experienced forced Albanisation. Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an \"official minority zone\" consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as Himara. People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public. The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country. Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece's abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries.\nGeography and ecology.\nEpirus is a predominantly rugged and mountainous region. It is largely made up of the Pindus Mountains, a series of parallel limestone ridges that are a continuation of the Dinaric Alps. The Pindus mountains form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly to the east. The ridges of the Pindus are parallel to the sea and generally so steep that the valleys between them are mostly suitable for pasture rather than large-scale agriculture. Altitude increases as one moves east, away from the coast, reaching a maximum of 2,637\u00a0m at Mount Smolikas, the highest point in Epirus. Other important ranges include Tymfi (2,496\u00a0m at Mount Gamila), Lygkos (2,249\u00a0m), to the west and east of Smolikas respectively, Gramos (2,523\u00a0m) in the northeast, Tzoumerka (2,356\u00a0m) in the southeast, Tomaros (1,976\u00a0m) in the southwest, Mitsikeli near Ioannina (1,810\u00a0m), Mourgana (1,806\u00a0m), and Nemercke/Aeoropos (2,485\u00a0m) on the border between Greece and Albania, and the Ceraunian Mountains (2,000\u00a0m) near Himara in Albania. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus, and the prevailing winds from the Ionian Sea make the region the rainiest in mainland Greece.\nSignificant lowlands are to be found only near the coast, in the southwest near Arta and Preveza, in the Acheron plain between Paramythia and Fanari, between Igoumenitsa and Sagiada, and also near Saranda. The Zagori area is a scenic upland plateau surrounded by mountain on all sides.\nThe main river flowing through Epirus is the Vjos\u00eb, which flows in a northwesterly direction from the Pindus mountains in Greece to its mouth north of the Bay of Vlor\u00eb in Albania. Other important rivers include the Acheron river, famous for its religious significance in ancient Greece and site of the Necromanteion, the Arachthos river, crossed by the historic Bridge of Arta, the Louros, the Thyamis or Kalamas, and the Voidomatis, a tributary of the Vjos\u00eb flowing through the Vikos Gorge. The Vikos Gorge, one of the deepest in the world, forms the centerpiece of the Vikos\u2013Ao\u00f6s National Park, known for its scenic beauty. The only significant lake in Epirus is Lake Pamvotis, on whose shores lies the city of Ioannina, the region's largest and traditionally most important city.\nThe climate of Epirus is Mediterranean along the coast and Alpine in the interior. Epirus is heavily forested, mainly by coniferous species. The fauna in Epirus is especially rich and features species such as bears, wolves, foxes, deer, and lynxes.\nEconomy.\nA rugged topography, poor soils, and fragmented landholdings have kept agricultural production low and have resulted in a low population density. Animal husbandry is the main industry and corn the chief crop. Oranges and olives are grown in the western lowlands, while tobacco is grown around Ioannina. Epirus has few natural resources and industries, and the population has been depleted by migration. The population is centered around Ioannina, which has the largest number of industrial establishments.\nTransportation.\nEpirus has historically been a remote and isolated region due to its location between the Pindus mountains and the sea. In antiquity, the Roman Via Egnatia passed through Epirus Nova, which linked Byzantium and Thessalonica to Dyrrachium on the Adriatic Sea. The modern \"Egnatia Odos\", the A2 motorway, which links Ioannina to the Greek province of Macedonia and terminating at Igoumenitsa, is the only highway through the Pindus mountains and has served to greatly reduce the region's isolation from the east, while the Ionia Odos highway, connecting Epirus with Western Greece, helped reducing the region's isolation from the south. Also, the Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel connects the southernmost tip of Epirus, near Preveza, with Aetolia-Acarnania in western Greece. Ferry services from Igoumenitsa to the Ionian islands and Italy exist. The only airport in Epirus is the Ioannina National Airport, while the Aktion National Airport is located just south of Preveza in Aetolia-Acarnania. There are no railroads in Epirus.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the 2023 census, the city proper has a population of 1,302,954 (about 37.2% of the country's total population) in an area of . Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nA Portuguese garrison was established in the place where today is the city of Montevideo in November 1723. The Portuguese garrison was expelled in February 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the platine region. There is no official document establishing the foundation of the city, but the \"Diario\" of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala officially mentions the date of 24 December 1726 as the foundation, corroborated by presential witnesses. The complete independence from Buenos Aires as a real city was not reached until 1 January 1730. It was also under brief British rule in 1807, but eventually the city was retaken by Spanish criollos who defeated the British invasions of the River Plate. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America's leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.\nThe 2019 Mercer's report on quality of life rated Montevideo first in Latin America, a rank the city has consistently held since 2005. As of 2010[ [update]], Montevideo was the 19th largest city economy in the continent and 9th highest income earner among major cities. In 2022, it has a projected GDP of $53.9\u00a0billion, with a per capita of $30,148. In 2018, it was classified as a beta global city ranking eighth in Latin America and 84th in the world. Montevideo hosted every match during the first FIFA World Cup in 1930. Described as a \"vibrant, eclectic place with a rich cultural life\", and \"a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture\", Montevideo ranked eighth in Latin America on the 2013 MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.\nThe city features historic European architecture, and is considered one of the cities with the most art deco influence. It is the hub of commerce and higher education in Uruguay as well as its chief port and financial hub, anchoring the metropolitan area with a population of around 2\u00a0million.\nEtymology.\nThere are several explanations for the word \"Montevideo\". All agree that \"Monte\" refers to the Cerro de Montevideo, the hill situated across the Bay of Montevideo, but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the \"video\" part.\nWhen the Portuguese invaded the Banda Oriental and annexed it as the province of Cisplatina until 1831, they called the city , and pronounced as .\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical Affiliations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEarly history.\nBetween 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of Colonia do Sacramento in the region across the bay from Buenos Aires. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.\nA Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were known as Guanches or Canarians. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.\nA census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as \"San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo\", later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted more than 100 families of Galician and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly Guaran\u00ed, as well as some trafficked slaves of Bantu origin.\nA few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R\u00edo de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.\nIn 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (\"Real Apostadero de Marina\") for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, Fernando Po, and the Falklands. Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as Ciudad Vieja.\n19th century.\nOn 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General Samuel Auchmuty and Admiral Charles Stirling occupied the city during the Battle of Montevideo (1807), but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when John Whitelocke was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the Banda Oriental\u2014roughly the same area as modern Uruguay\u2014and of Buenos Aires. After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de El\u00edo opposed the new viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and created a government Junta when the Peninsular War started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers. El\u00edo disestablished the Junta when Liniers was replaced by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros.\nDuring the May Revolution of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain. In 1811, the forces deployed by the Junta Grande of Buenos Aires and the gaucho forces led by Artigas started a siege of Montevideo, which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the Upper Peru region.\nThe Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil. It was named Imperial City by Emperor Pedro I when the city was part of the Empire of Brazil as the capital of the Cisplatina province. Juan Antonio Lavalleja and his band called the \"Treinta y Tres Orientales\" (\"Thirty-Three Orientals\") re-established the independence of the region in 1825. Uruguay was consolidated as an independent state in 1828, with Montevideo as the nation's capital. In 1829, the demolition of the city's fortifications began and plans were made for an extension beyond the Ciudad Vieja, referred to as the \"Ciudad Nueva\" (\"new city\"). Urban expansion, however, moved very slowly because of the events that followed.\nUruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between Manuel Oribe and Fructuoso Rivera, the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the Empire of Brazil under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the \"caudillo\" of their respective faction. Politics were divided between Oribe's \"Blancos\" (\"whites\"), represented by the National Party, and Rivera's \"Colorados\" (\"reds\"), represented by the Colorado Party, with each party's name taken from the color of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign from the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the Guerra Grande, which lasted until 1851.\nThe city of Montevideo suffered a siege of eight years between 1843 and 1851, during which it was supplied by sea with British and French support. By 1843 Montevideo's population of thirty thousand inhabitants was highly cosmopolitan with Uruguayans making up only a third of it. The remaining were chiefly Italian (4205), Spanish (3406), Argentine (2553), Portuguese (659), English (606) and Brazilians (492). Oribe, with the support of the then conservative Governor of Buenos Aires Province Juan Manuel de Rosas, besieged the Colorados in Montevideo, where the latter were supported by the French Legion, the Italian Legion, the Basque Legion and battalions from Brazil. Finally in 1851, with the additional support of Argentine rebels who opposed Rosas, the Colorados defeated Oribe. The fighting however resumed in 1855, when the Blancos came to power, which they maintained until 1865. Thereafter, the Colorado Party regained power, which they retained until the middle of the 20th century.\nAfter the end of hostilities, a period of growth and expansion started for the city. In 1853 a stagecoach bus line was established joining Montevideo with the newly formed settlement of Uni\u00f3n and the first natural gas street lights were inaugurated. From 1854 to 1861 the first public sanitation facilities were constructed. In 1856 the Teatro Sol\u00eds was inaugurated, 15 years after the beginning of its construction. By Decree, in December 1861 the areas of Aguada and Cord\u00f3n were incorporated to the growing \"Ciudad Nueva\" (New City). In 1866, an underwater telegraph line connected the city with Buenos Aires. The statue of Peace, \"La Paz\", was erected on a column in Plaza Cagancha and the building of the Postal Service as well as the bridge of Paso Molino were inaugurated in 1867.\nIn 1868, the horse-drawn tram company \"Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas al Paso del Molino y Cerro\" created the first lines connecting Montevideo with Uni\u00f3n, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called \"Cosmopolis\". In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company \"Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay\" was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighborhoods Col\u00f3n, Nuevo Par\u00eds and La Comercial were founded. The Sunday market of Trist\u00e1n Narvaja Street was established in Cord\u00f3n in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, \"Bulevar Circunvalaci\u00f3n\" was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, going up to the north end of the city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed Artigas Boulevard in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area \"Los Pocitos\" was incorporated into the \"Nov\u00edsima Ciudad\" (Most New City).\nThe first telephone lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took the place of the gas-operated ones in 1886. The Hip\u00f3dromo de Maro\u00f1as started operating in 1888, and the neighborhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliaci\u00f3n were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Pe\u00f1arol was founded. Other neighborhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.\n20th century.\nIn the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighborhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the Villa del Cerro, Pocitos, the Prado and Villa Col\u00f3n. The Rod\u00f3 Park and the Estadio Gran Parque Central were also established, which served as \"poles\" of urban development. During the early 20th century, Uruguay saw huge social changes with repercussions primarily in urban areas. Among these changes were the right to divorce (1907) and women's right to vote. The 1910s saw the construction of Montevideo's Rambla; strikes by tram workers, bakers and port workers; the inauguration of electric trams; the creation of the Municipal Intendencias; and the inauguration of the new port. In 1913, the city limits were extended around the entire gulf. The previously independent localities of the Villa del Cerro and La Teja were annexed to Montevideo, becoming two of its neighborhoods. During the 1920s, the equestrian statue of Artigas was installed in Plaza Independencia; the Palacio Legislativo was built; the Spanish Plus Ultra flying boat arrived (the first airplane to fly from Spain to Latin America, 1926); prominent politician and former president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez died (1929); and the ground was broken (1929) for the Estadio Centenario (completed 1930).\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, a famous incident involving the German cruiser \"Admiral Graf Spee\" took place in Punta del Este, from Montevideo. After the Battle of the River Plate with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy on 13 December 1939, the \"Graf Spee\" retreated to Montevideo's port, which was considered neutral at the time. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. The eagle figurehead of the \"Graf Spee\" was salvaged on 10 February 2006.\nPost-war era.\nUruguay began to stagnate economically in the mid-1950s; Montevideo began a decline, later exacerbated by widespread social and political violence beginning in 1968 (including the emergence of the guerrilla Movimiento de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional-Tupamaros) and by the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay (1973-1985). There were major problems with supply; the immigration cycle was reversed.\nFrom the 1960s to the end of the dictatorship in 1985, around one hundred people died or disappeared because of political violence. In 1974 another hundred Uruguayans also disappeared in Argentina. In 1980, the dictatorship proposed a new constitution. The project was submitted to a referendum and rejected in the first polls since 1971, with 58% of the votes against and 42% in favor. The result weakened the military and triggered its fall, allowing the return of democracy.\nIn the 1980s, Pope John Paul II visited the city twice. In April 1987, as head of state of Vatican, he signed a mediation agreement for the conflict of the Beagle Channel. He also held a large mass in Tres Cruces, declaring the cross located behind the altar as a monument. In 1988, he returned to the country, visiting Montevideo, Florida, Salto and Melo.\n21st century.\nThe 2002 Uruguay banking crisis affected several industries of Montevideo. In 2017, the city has maintained 15 years of economic growth, with a GDP of $44\u00a0billion, and a GDP per capita of $25,900.\nMontevideo has consistently been rated as having the highest quality of life of any city in Latin America: by 2015 it held this rank every year during the decade through 2014.\nGeography.\nMontevideo is situated on the north shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies west on the Argentine side. The Santa Luc\u00eda River forms a natural border between Montevideo and San Jos\u00e9 Department to its west. To the city's north and east is Canelones Department, with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches. The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbor, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the Southern Cone, and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams crisscross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.\nThe city has an average elevation of . Its highest elevations are two hills: the Cerro de Montevideo and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the Fortaleza del Cerro at a height of . Closest cities by road are Las Piedras to the north and the so-called Ciudad de la Costa (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to from the city center. The approximate distances to the neighboring department capitals by road are, to San Jose de Mayo (San Jose Department) and to Canelones (Canelones Department).\nClimate.\nMontevideo has a Humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) in a middle latitude, the city experiences the four seasons. It has cool winters (June to August), warm to hot summers (December to February), mild autumns (March to May) and volatile springs (September to November); The climate is characterized by having mild temperatures, without harsh cold or extreme heat. There are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around .\nWinters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. The average temperature during this season is just above . Daytime temperatures are generally between and , and night lows between and . During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city, with daytime temperatures around or below and possible night frosts. These occur few times during winter, with temperatures generally not falling below because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; a few kilometres inland, frosts are more common and colder. On the other hand, even in the middle of winter it's not uncommon to have temperatures above for a few days. Rainfall and sleet are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the World Cup, (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 Carrasco snowfall was actually a hailstorm.\nSummers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. The average temperature in this season is \n. Daytime temperatures are usually between and , while night lows between and . During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more severe summer heat of nearby cities like Buenos Aires. Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent; temperatures can rise above . These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts from the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.\nThe autumn in Montevideo is quite pleasant and not so unstable. Daytime temperatures are in general around and nights around .\nSpring average temperatures are very similar to the autumn, but the weather in that season tends to be more windy and volatile, with more dramatic changes in a short period of time.\nMontevideo has an annual average temperature of . The lowest recorded temperature is while the highest is .\nAdministrative divisions and barrios.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (\"Municipios\"), referred to with letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, \"aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance.\" The head of each \"Municipio\" is called an \"alcalde\" or (if female) \"alcaldesa\".\nOf much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 \"barrios\": neighborhoods or wards. Many of the city's \"barrios\"\u2014such as Sayago, Ituzaing\u00f3 and Pocitos\u2014were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the salt-curing works of Villa del Cerro and the tanneries in Nuevo Par\u00eds. Each \"barrio\" has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighborhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLandmarks.\nThe architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the late-modern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country. Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rod\u00f3 and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.\nThe Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the \"Edificio Panamericano\" designed by Raul Sichero, and the \"Positano\" and \"El Pilar\" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis Garc\u00eda Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighborhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle-class residents.\nPalacio Legislativo.\nThe Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, north of the city center, is the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo.\nWorld Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998. It has 22 floors and 17,100 square meters of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and of space. The World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a center of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St.\nThe Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social places. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and of space is under construction as of 2010[ [update]].\nTelecommunications Tower.\nTorre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the , 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge Company and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.\nWhen its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40\u00a0million, plus US$25\u00a0million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65\u00a0million price into US$102\u00a0million.\nCiudad Vieja (Old City).\nCiudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent \"barrio\" of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and nightclubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.\nMontevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city. Several notable buildings are located here. \nThe Sol\u00eds Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theater. It was built in 1856 and is owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theater, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theater reopened in August of that year. The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Est\u00e9vez Palace and the Executive Tower). The Artigas Mausoleum is located at the center of the plaza. Statues include that of Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, a hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honor guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.\nPalacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confiter\u00eda La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez wrote his tango \"La Cumparsita\" (1917.) Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.\nAlso of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n (or \"Plaza Matriz\"). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo\u2014the seat of colonial government\u2014and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.\nParque Batlle.\nParque Batlle (formerly: \"Parque de los Aliados\", translation: \"Park of the Allies\") is a major public central park, located south of Avenida Italia and north of Avenue Rivera. Along with Parque Prado and Parque Rod\u00f3 it is one of three large parks that dominate Montevideo. The park and surrounding area constitute one of the 62 neighborhoods (\"barrios\") of the city. The barrio of Parque Batlle is one of seven coastal barrios, the others being Buceo, Carrasco, Malvin, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Punta Gorda. The barrio of Parque Battle includes four former districts: Belgrano, Italiano, Villa Dolores and Batlle Park itself and borders the neighborhoods of La Blanqueada, Tres Cruces, Pocitos and Buceo. It has a high population density and most of its households are of medium-high- or high-income. Villa Dolores, a sub-district of Parque Batlle, took its name from the original villa of Don Alejo Rossell y Rius and of Do\u00f1a Dolores Pereira de Rossel. On their grounds, they started a private collection of animals that became a zoological garden and was passed to the city in 1919;&lt;ref name=\"montevideo.gub.uy/Zoologico\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955 the Planetarium of Montevideo was built within its premises.&lt;ref name=\"montevideo.gub.uy/planetario\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nParque Batlle is named in honor of Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. The park was originally proposed by an Act of March 1907, which also projected wide boulevards and avenues. French landscape architect, Carlos Thays, began the plantings in 1911. In 1918, the park was named \"Parque de los Aliados\", following the victory of the Allies of World War\u00a0I. On 5 May 1930, after significant expansion, it was again renamed as Parque Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, in memory of the prominent politician and president, who had died in 1929. The park was designated a National Historic Monument Park in 1975. As of 2010[ [update]], the park covers an area of and is considered the \"lung\" of the Montevideo city due to the large variety of trees planted here.\nThe Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium, opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, and later hosted several other sporting grounds of note (see \"Sports\").\nIn 1934, sculptor Jos\u00e9 Belloni's \"La Carreta\", a bronze monument on granite base, was installed on Avenida Lorenzo Merola near Estadio Centenario. One of several statues in the park, it depicts yoked oxen pulling a loaded wagon. It was designated a national monument in 1976. Another statue on the same side of the park is a bronze copy of the Discobolus of Myron.\nOn the west side of Parque Batlle, on Artigas Boulevard, the 1938 Obelisk of Montevideo is a monument dedicated to those who created the first Constitution. The work of sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1891\u20131975), it is a three-sided granite obelisk, tall, with bronze statues on its three sides, representing \"Law\", \"Liberty\", and \"Force\", respectively. It has been a National Heritage Site since 1976.\nParque Prado.\nEstablished in 1873, the largest of Montevideo's six main public parks is the Parque Prado. Located in the northern part of the city, the Miguelete Creek flows through the park and the neighborhood and of the same name. It is surrounded by the avenues Agraciada, Obes Lucas, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, Luis Alberto de Herrera and by the streets Castro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyes.\nThe most frequented areas of the park are the \"Rosedal\", a public rose garden with pergolas, the Botanical Garden, the area around the Hotel del Prado, as well as the \"Rural del Prado\", a seasonal cattle and farm animal fairground. The Rosedal contains four pergolas, eight domes, and a fountain; its 12,000 roses were imported from France in 1910. There are several jogging paths along the Miguelete river.\nThe Presidential Residence is located behind the Botanical Gardens. Established in 1930, Juan Manuel Blanes Museum is situated in the Palladian villa, a National Heritage Site since 1975, and includes a Japanese garden. The Professor Atilio Lombardo Museum and Botanical Gardens were established in 1902. The National Institute of Physical Climatology and its observatory are also in the Prado.\nParque Rod\u00f3.\nParque Rod\u00f3 is both a \"barrio\" (neighborhood) of Montevideo and a park which lies mostly outside the limits of the neighborhood itself and belongs to Punta Carretas. The name \"Rod\u00f3\" commemorates Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, an important Uruguayan writer whose monument is in the southern side of the main park. The park was conceived as a French-style city park. Apart from the main park area which is delimited by Sarmiento Avenue to the south, Parque Rod\u00f3 includes an amusement park; the Estadio Luis Franzini, belonging to Defensor Sporting; the front lawn of the Faculty of Engineering and a strip west of the Club de Golf de Punta Carretas that includes the \"Canteras\" (\"quarry\") \"del Parque Rod\u00f3\", the \"Teatro de Verano\" (\"summer theatre\") and the \"Lago\" (\"lake\") \"del Parque Rod\u00f3\".\nOn the east side of the main park area is the National Museum of Visual Arts. On this side, a street market takes place every Sunday. On the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children. An area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography. West of the park, across the coastal avenue Rambla Presidente Wilson, stretches Ramirez Beach. Directly west of the main park area, and belonging to Parque Rod\u00f3 \"barrio\", there is the former \"Parque Hotel\", now called \"Edif\u00edcio Mercosur\", the seat of the parliament of the member countries of the Mercosur. During the guerilla war the Tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.\nForts.\nThe first set of subsidiary forts was planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front-line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship \"Nossa Senhora de Oliveara\". They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.\nFortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro).\nFortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931 and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.\nPunta Brava Lighthouse.\nPunta Brava Lighthouse (\"Faro Punta Brava\"), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is high and its light reaches away, with a flash every ten seconds. In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Ingl\u00e9s Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Luc\u00eda River.\nRambla of Montevideo.\nThe Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word \"rambla\" is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as \"coastal avenue\", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have \"ramblas\" as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called \"Rambla Naciones Unidas\" (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.\nThe Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even\u2014in a special area\u2014skateboard. Its length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.\nMontevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best-known beaches are Ram\u00edrez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malv\u00edn. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.\nCemeteries.\nThere are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the \"F\u00fanebre y Necr\u00f3polis\" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.\nThe largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: \"Cementerio central\"), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 at a time when burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Juan Manuel Blanes, Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont (Isidore Ducasse), Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, and Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn.\nThe other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.\nThe British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighborhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;Montevideo is the most populous city in Uruguay, with 1,302,954 residents as of the 2023 census. The city's population in 2023 was 87.1% White, 10.7% Black, 4,6% Mixed and 0.8% Asian; 5.6% identified themselves as being of other ethnic-racial descent, noting that respondents were allowed to select more than one category. \nBy 1880, the city's population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants. Since the mid-20th century, this area has been the main destination for most immigrants arriving in the country, largely due to its port. The majority of these immigrants were Italian and Spanish, who together made up more than 70% of the foreign-born population in the country. Other significant European origins include French, German, Portuguese, Polish, Irish, Croatian, and Lithuanian. Communities of Armenians, Lebanese, and Japanese also took root, along with both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish groups. \nThere is also an Afro-Uruguayan community in the city, composed of descendants of enslaved people brought over during the colonial era, as well as Afro-Brazilian immigrants who fled to Uruguay following the country's abolition of slavery in 1842\u2014decades before Brazil did the same. \nAs in the rest of the country, Christianity is the largest religion in Montevideo, with Catholicism as the denomination with the most adherents, followed by Protestantism\u2014particularly Evangelical, Methodist, and Lutheran branches. There is also a significant proportion of irreligious and agnostic individuals.\nApproximately 20,000 Jews live in Montevideo, accounting for over 50% of Uruguay\u2019s Jewish population\u2014one of the most prominent in Latin America.\nGovernment and politics.\nIntendancy of Montevideo.\nThe Intendancy of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908. The municipality's first mayor (1909\u20131911) was Daniel Mu\u00f1oz. Municipalities were abolished by the Uruguayan Constitution of 1918, effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of Gabriel Terra, and formally restored by the 1934 Constitution. The 1952 Constitution again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.\nSince 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (\"Centro Comunal Zonal\", CCZ), which is subordinate to the Intendancy of Montevideo. The boundaries of the municipal districts of Montevideo were created on 12 July 1993, and successively amended on 19 October 1993, 6 June 1994 and 10 November 1994. In 2010, the city CCZ were abolished and eight municipalities were created instead.\nThe city government of Montevideo performs several functions, including maintaining communications with the public, promoting culture, organizing society, caring for the environment and regulating traffic. The city hall is the Palacio Municipal on 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro area of Montevideo.\nThe legislative branch of government, the Junta Departamental, or the Congress of Montevideo, governs the Department of Montevideo. The Junta, composed of 31 unsalaried elected members, is responsible for such things as the freedom of the citizens, the regulation of cultural activities, the naming of streets and public places, and the placement of monuments; it also responds to proposals of the Intendant in various circumstances. Its seat is the architecturally remarkable Casa de Francisco G\u00f3mez in Ciudad Vieja.\nA 2016 private ranking named \"Subnational Legislative Online Opening Index\" measured the data availability in official websites, scoring Montevideo as the second most open district nationally at 17.50 points.\nIntendants of Montevideo.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nIn recent years Montevideo nightlife has moved to Parque Rod\u00f3, where a large concentration of buildings cater for the recreational interests of young people during the night time. Under a presidential decree which went into effect on 1 March 2006, smoking is prohibited in any public place with roofing, and there is a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in certain businesses from 21.00 to 9.00.\nMontevideo has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Literature since December 2015.\nThe arts.\nMontevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and a number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighborhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the center of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films. There are two movie theater companies running seven cinemas, around ten independent ones and four art film cinemas in the city. The theater of Uruguay is admired inside and outside Uruguayan borders. The Sol\u00eds Theatre is the most prominent theater in Uruguay and the oldest in South America. There are several notable theatrical companies and thousands of professional actors and amateurs. Montevideo playwrights produce dozens of works each year; of major note are Mauricio Rosencof, Ana Magnabosco and Ricardo Prieto.\nVisual arts.\nThe daily newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\" sponsors the Virtual Museum of Contemporary Uruguayan Art. The director and curator of the Museum presents exhibitions in \"virtual spaces, supplemented by information, biographies, texts in English and Spanish\".\nIn the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.\nLiterature.\nThe first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father Jos\u00e9 Manuel P\u00e9rez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta. In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes. The building of the National Library of Uruguay (\"Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Uruguay\") was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of . Construction began in 1926 and it was inaugurated in 1964. Its collection amounts to 900,000 volumes.\nAuthors.\nThe city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the center of the editorial and creative activity of literature.\nIn 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hern\u00e1ndez. Montevideo was then called the \"Atenas del Plata\" or the \"Athens of the Rio de la Plata\".\nAmong the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are Juan Carlos Onetti, Antonio Larreta, Eduardo Galeano, Marosa di Giorgio and Cristina Peri Rossi.\nA new generation of writers has become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), Fernando Butazzoni (novelist), Rafael Courtoisie (poet) and Hugo Burel (short story writer and novelist).\nMusic.\nIn Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and \"vals criollo\". Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including \"El Tango supremo\", \"La Cumparsita\", \"La Milonga\", \"La Pu\u00f1alada\" and \"Desde el Alma\", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez, Pint\u00edn Castellanos and Rosita Melo. Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. 20th. century composers like three-time Grammy nominated Miguel del Aguila have taken Uruguayan tango to international classical music audiences. \"Fun Fun' Bar\", established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is \"El Farolito\", located in the old part of the city and \"Joventango\", \"Caf\u00e9 Las Musas\", \"Garufa\" and \"Vieja Viola\". The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Montevideo largely reflects that of the rest of the country, which is shaped by the strong influence of Italian and Spanish immigration. This heritage is evident in the widespread consumption of pasta, pizza, bread, and baked goods, as well as in the prominent role of grilled meats, particularly asado. Caf\u00e9s and bars are central to daily life, serving as both dining venues and social spaces rooted in the city\u2019s local tradition.\nA \"torta frita\" is a widely consumed circular pan-fried cake, typically made from wheat flour, yeast, water, and sugar or salt, with a small cut in the center to aid cooking. Since it is traditional to eat Italian gnocchi on the 29th of each month in Uruguay, this dish is specially served on that day in most of the city\u2019s restaurants. Additionally, the \"chivito\"\u2014a sandwich made with sliced beefsteak\u2014is widely popular. Equally popular is the \"\u201ca la piedra\u201d\" style pizza, baked in a wood-fired oven and served in rectangular slices. The city is home to a large number of traditional pizzerias and classic neighborhood bars.\nThe city has also several historic markets that today serve as gastronomic and cultural hubs, including the Mercado del Puerto, the Mercado de la Abundancia, and the Mercado Agr\u00edcola. While originally conceived as traditional marketplaces, these structures now operate primarily as food halls, offering both Uruguayan and international cuisines.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRecreation.\nMuseums.\nThe Centro Cultural de Espa\u00f1a, as well as Asturian and cultural centers, testify to Montevideo's considerable Spanish heritage. Montevideo also has important museums including Museo Torres Garc\u00eda, Museo Jos\u00e9 Gurvich, Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales and Museo Juan Manuel Blanes etc.\nThe Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.\nThe Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theater (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules-L\u00e9on Chifflot who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\nThe National History Museum of Montevideo is located in the historical residence of General Fructuoso Rivera. It exhibits artifacts related to the history of Uruguay. In a process begun in 1998, the National Museum of Natural History (1837) and the National Museum of Anthropology (1981), merged in 2001, becoming the National Museum of Natural History and Anthropology. In July 2009, the two institutions again became independent. The Historical Museum has annexed eight historical houses in the city, five of which are located in the Ciudad Vieja. One of them, on the same block with the main building, is the historic residence of Antonio Montero, which houses the Museo Romantico. Also nearby is the Museo Casa de Jos\u00e9 Garibaldi where Giuseppe Garibaldi lived in the 1840s while participating in the Uruguayan Civil War.\nThe Museo Torres Garc\u00eda is located in the Old Town, and exhibits Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda's unusual portraits of historical icons and cubist paintings akin to those of Picasso and Braque. The museum was established by Manolita Pi\u00f1a Torres, the widow of Torres Garcia, after his death in 1949. She also set up the Garc\u00eda Torres Foundation, a private non-profit organization that organizes the paintings, drawings, original writings, archives, objects and furniture designed by the painter as well as the photographs, magazines and publications related to him.\nThere are several other important art museums in Montevideo. The Centro de Fotograf\u00eda de Montevideo (CdF) is a museum, archive, and gallery for historic and contemporary photography with twelve outdoor exhibition spaces in various Montevideo neighborhoods as well as four galleries in its downtown headquarters. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rod\u00f3 has Uruguay's largest collection of paintings. The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930, the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay, significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes. In the back of the museum is a Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp. The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.\nThere are also other types of museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has distinctive displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and \"mate\" (tea), gourds, and \"bombillas\" (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, is located on the eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Autom\u00f3vil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando Garc\u00eda in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes old horse carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual fa\u00e7ade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.\nFestivals.\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnival which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.\nDuring carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. \"Tablados\" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include \"Desfile de las Llamadas\" (\"Parade of the Calls\"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the \"zonal beauty queens\" to appear in the carnival.\nSports.\nEstadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2. The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracan\u00e3, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.\nBetween 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabar\u00e9 Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theater using impermanent materials.\nToday the vast majority of teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n come from Montevideo, including Nacional, Pe\u00f1arol, Central Espa\u00f1ol, Cerrito, Cerro, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix, Liverpool, Wanderers, Racing, River Plate, Club Atl\u00e9tico Torque, Boston River and Rampla Juniors.\nBesides Estadio Centenario, other stadiums include Gran Parque Central, Estadio Campe\u00f3n del Siglo, Belvedere, Complejo Rentistas, Jardines del Hip\u00f3dromo, Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, \"La Bombonera\", Luis Franzini, Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli and the park stadiums of Abraham Paladino, Alfredo V\u00edctor Viera, Omar Saroldi, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Osvaldo Roberto, Maracan\u00e1 and Palermo.\nThe city has a tradition as host of major international basketball tournaments including the official 1967 FIBA World Cup and the 1988 1997 and 2017 editions of the official Americas Basketball Championship.\nThe Uruguayan Basketball League is headquartered in Montevideo and most of its teams are from the city, including Defensor Sporting, Bigu\u00e1, Atl\u00e9tico Aguada, Goes, Malv\u00edn, Uni\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica, and Trouville. Montevideo is also a center of rugby; equestrianism, which regained importance in Montevideo after the Maro\u00f1as Racecourse reopened; golf, with the Club de Punta Carretas; and yachting, with the Puerto del Buceo, an ideal place to moor yachts. The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rod\u00f3 (Fun Fair).\nReligion.\nThe religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878. Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado\u2013Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo, Tacuaremb\u00f3.\nMontevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Catholic Church in Uruguay. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n y San Felipe y Santiago. Church and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. As of 2010[ [update]], the Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.\nOther religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism, and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess \"believing in God but without religion\".\nMontevideo Metropolitan Cathedral.\nThe Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby Punta Carretas parish church were the only major buildings in the neighborhood.\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n.\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart\"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas (\"Punta Carretas Church\"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano Garc\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.\nEconomy.\n\"Main Article: Economy of Uruguay\"\nAs the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is the economic and political center of the country. Most of the largest and wealthiest businesses in Uruguay have their headquarters in the city. Since the 1990s the city has undergone rapid economic development and modernization, including two of Uruguay's most important buildings\u2014the World Trade Center Montevideo (1998), and Telecommunications Tower (2000), the headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company ANTEL, increasing the city's integration into the global marketplace.\nThe Port of Montevideo, in the northern part of Ciudad Vieja, is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the city's economy. The port has been growing rapidly and consistently at an average annual rate of 14 percent due to an increase in foreign trade. The city has received a US$20\u00a0million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to modernize the port, increase its size and efficiency, and enable lower maritime and river transportation costs.\nThe most important state-owned companies headquartered in Montevideo are: AFE (railways), ANCAP (Energy), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (telecommunications), BHU (savings and loan), BROU (bank), BSE (insurance), OSE (water &amp; sewage), UTE (electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called \"Ente Autonomo\" (\"autonomous entity\"). The government also owns part of other companies operating under private law, such as those owned wholly or partially by the CND (National Development Corporation).\nBanking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in Uruguay: the country was once dubbed \"the Switzerland of America\", mainly for its banking sector and stability, although that stability has been threatened in the 21st century by the recent global economic climate. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco Republica (BROU), based in Montevideo. 9 private banks, most of them branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There are also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galfin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Dar\u00edo Cukier, GBU, Horde\u00f1ana &amp; Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc.\nTourism.\nMontevideo is Uruguay\u2019s leading tourist destination, welcoming approximately 1 million visitors in 2024, which represents about 27% of all tourists visiting the country. The biggest share of international tourists come from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and the United States. In 2025, Montevideo was designated as a smart destination and has been recognized as an LGBTQ-friendly city, reflecting Uruguay\u2019s strong international standing in LGBTQ rights.\nTourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarand\u00ed Street and the Mercado del Puerto being its most frequented venues. On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination. Along the coast, the Fortaleza del Cerro, the \"Rambla\" (the coastal avenue), of sandy beaches, and Punta Gorda attract many tourists, as do the Barrio Sur and Palermo \"barrios\".\nThe Ministry of Tourism offers a two-and-a-half-hour city tour and the Montevideo Tourist Guide Association offers guided tours in English, Italian, Portuguese and German. Apart from these, many private companies offer organized city tours.\nMost tourists to the city come from Argentina, Brazil and Europe, with the number of visitors from elsewhere in Latin America and from the United States growing every year, thanks to an increasing number of international airline arrivals at Carrasco International Airport as well as cruises and ferries that arrive into the port of Montevideo.\nRetail.\nMontevideo is the heartland of retail, business, and real estate in Uruguay. Since the late 19th century, several department stores were established, turning the neighborhoods of Centro\u2014particularly the 18 de Julio Avenue\u2014and Ciudad Vieja into the city\u2019s main commercial areas. However, beginning in the 1980s, shopping malls started to be built in different parts of the city, significantly altering its commercial landscape. In 1985, Montevideo Shopping became the first shopping mall in the Southern Cone.\nIn addition to the commercial areas located in the city center, other important retail zones include the neighborhoods of Uni\u00f3n, Belvedere and Paso del Molino, as well as Villa Mu\u00f1oz\u2014the city's historic Jewish quarter\u2014noted for its concentration of low-cost retail establishments.\nMedia.\nOut of the 100 radio stations found in Uruguay, 40 of them are in Montevideo. The city has a vibrant artistic and literary community. The press enjoyed full freedom until the advent of the Civic-military dictatorship (1973\u20131985); this freedom returned on 1 March 1985, as part of the restoration of democracy.\nSome of the important newspapers published in the city are: \"Brecha\", \"La Rep\u00fablica\", \"El Observador\", \"El Pa\u00eds\", \"Gaceta Comercial\" and \"La Diaria\". \"El D\u00eda\" was the most prestigious paper in Uruguay, founded in 1886 by Jos\u00e9 Batlle, who would later go on to become President of Uruguay. The paper ceased production in the early 1990s. All television stations have their headquarters in Montevideo, for example: Saeta Channel 10, Teledoce, Channel 4 and National Television (Channel 5)\nTransport.\nPublic transport.\nThe city and its metropolitan area have a bus transportation network, the \"Sistema Met\"s acronym. It covers urban and interurban services within the Metropolitan Area and is administered by the municipal government together with the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. The Baltasar Brum Terminal located in Ciudad Vieja, is the main urban bus station. However, there are numerous interchanges and terminals distributed in both the city and the metropolitan area.\nTaxis.\nThe livery of most Montevideo taxis features white on the sides, along with a yellow band, as well as yellow on the top of the car. To determine the rate they use a taximeter, which will determine the price depending on the distance traveled. All taxis accept cash, although it is also common that a passenger can pay with a credit card.\nRail.\nThe State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Col\u00f3n (line to San Jose and Florida), Pe\u00f1arol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the \"barrio\" Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed. A new station, north of the old one and part of the Telecommunications Tower modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.\nThe train service is currently suspended for works related to the modernization of the railway system until mid-2023 when the work will end.\nIntercity buses.\nThe Tres Cruces bus station is the main bus terminal in Uruguay, serving long-distance buses that travel into Montevideo, from other parts of the country and abroad. Inaugurated in 1994, it serves more than 12 million passengers per year. \nCompanies operating at Tres Cruces bus station: Agencia central, Bruno, Copsa, Cromin, Cynsa, Copay, Cot, Cut, Corporacion, Cita, Cauvi, Colonia Express, El Condor, El Norte\u00f1o, Ega, Expreso Chago, Expreso Minuano, Intertur, Nossar, Nu\u00f1ez, Rutas del sol, TTL, Turil, Turismar, etc.\nAviation.\nMontevideo is served by the Carrasco International Airport (), which is located in the north of Ciudad de la Costa, in Canelones Department, from the city center. It handles over 1,5 million passengers per year, and has been cited as one of the most efficient and traveler-friendly airports in Latin America.\n\u00c1ngel S. Adami Airport is a private airport operated by minor charter companies and in which there is also a flight school.\nPort.\nMontevideo is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port with Buenos Aires. More than 2.2\u00a0million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus. One of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about .The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbor entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires.\nThe main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja Refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.\nThe port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.\nEvery year more than one hundred cruises arrive, bringing tourists to Montevideo by public or private tours.\nCycling.\nThe city has bicycle circuits in Ciudad Vieja, Artigas Boulevard and Centro as well as with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and bike racks throughout the city. In 2013 the \"South Bicicircuito\" was also inaugurated, which connects several of the dependent faculties of the University of the Republic. There are more than 100 bike stations in the city. In 2014, a bicycle sharing system called \"Movete\" was launched.\nEducation.\nPublic education.\nThe University of the Republic is the country's largest and most important university, with a student body of 81,774, according to the census of 2007. It was founded on 18 July 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its Rector is Dr. Rodrigo Arocena. The university houses 14 faculties (departments) and various institutes and schools. Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Jos\u00e9 Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste\nThe process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator D\u00e1maso Antonio Larra\u00f1aga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay at that time.\nPrivate education.\nThe largest private university in Uruguay, is also located in Montevideo. ORT Uruguay was first established as a non-profit organization in 1942, and was officially certified as a private university in September 1996, becoming the first private educational institution in the country to achieve that status. It is a member of World ORT, an international educational network founded in 1880 by the Jewish community in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nThe university has about 8,000 students, distributed among 5 faculties and institutes, mainly geared towards the sciences and technology/engineering. Its rector as of 2010[ [update]] is Dr. Jorge A. Gr\u00fcnberg.\nAnother private university in Uruguay is the University of Montevideo (Spanish: Universidad de Montevideo, short: UM). It opened in 1986 and obtained the right to be legally named a university in 1997. With its seven schools the UM has facilities all over Montevideo. The Universidad de Montevideo also holds more than 250 partnerships with other universities in 47 countries. Since 2019 is the university ranked in the Top 500 in the world by the QS World University Rankings (QSWUR).\nThe Montevideo Crandon Institute is an American School of missionary origin and the main Methodist educational institution in Uruguay. Founded in 1879 and supported by the Women's Society of the Methodist Church of the United States, it is one of the most traditional and emblematic institutions in the city inculcating John Wesley's values. Its alumni include presidents, senators, ambassadors and Nobel Prize winners, along with musicians, scientists, and others. The Montevideo Crandon Institute boasts of being the first academic institution in South America where a home economics course was taught.\nThe Christian Brothers of Ireland Stella Maris College is a private, co-educational, not-for-profit Catholic school located in the wealthy residential southeastern neighborhood of Carrasco. Established in 1955, it is regarded as one of the best high schools in the country, blending a rigorous curriculum with strong extracurricular activities. The school's headmaster, history professor Juan Pedro Toni, is a member of the Stella Maris Board of Governors and the school is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO). Its long list of distinguished former pupils includes economists, engineers, architects, lawyers, politicians and even F1 champions. The school has also played an important part in the development of rugby union in Uruguay, with the creation of Old Christians Club, the school's alumni club.\nAlso in Carrasco is The British Schools of Montevideo, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1908 with \"the object of giving children a complete education, both intellectual and moral, based upon the ideas and principles of the best schools in The British Isles\". The School is governed by the Board of Governors, elected by the British Schools Society in Uruguay, whose honorary president is the British Ambassador to Uruguay. Prominent alumni include president Luis Lacalle Pou and former government ministers Pedro Bordaberry and Gabriel Gurm\u00e9ndez Armand-Ugon.\nLocated in Cordon, St.Brendan's school, previously named St.Catherine's is a non-profit civil association, which has a solid institutional culture with a clear vision of the future. It is known for being one of the best schools in the country, joining students from the wealthiest parts of Montevideo, such as, Punta Carretas, Pocitos, Malvin and Carrasco.\nSt. Brendan's School is a bilingual, non-denominational school that promotes a pedagogical constructivist approach focused on the child as a whole. In this approach, understanding is built from the connections children make between their own prior knowledge and the learning experiences, thus developing critical thinking skills. It is also the only school in the country implementing the three International Baccalaureate Programmes. These are:\nOther educational institutions of note include Colegio Ingles, John XXIII Institute, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Montevideo, Ivy Thomas, German School of Montevideo and Colegio Preuniversitario Ciudad de San Felipe.\nHealthcare.\nIn Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatorios. The term \"hospital\" is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while \"sanatorio\" is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.\nPublic hospitals.\nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Dr. Manuel Quintela\" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928\u20131929 and has a surface area of on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.\nHospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaran\u00ed and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of Jos\u00e9 Toribio (son of Tom\u00e1s Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaran\u00ed street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaran\u00ed and 25 de Mayo) and Juli\u00e1n Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Est\u00e9vez in 1798.\nHospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell. It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well. Later, the hospital received a donation from Dr. Enrique Pouey for a radiotherapy unit.\nHospital Vilardeb\u00f3 is the only psychiatric hospital in Montevideo. Named after the physician and naturalist Teodoro Vilardeb\u00f3, it opened 21 May 1880. The hospital was originally one of the best of Latin America and in 1915 grew to 1,500 inpatients. Today the hospital is very deteriorated, with broken walls and floors, lack of medicines, beds, and rooms for the personnel. It has an emergency service, outpatient, clinic and inpatient rooms and employs approximately 610 staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, administrators, guards, among others. The average patient age is 30 years; more than half of the patients arrive by court order; 42% suffer from schizophrenia, 18% from depression and mania, and there are also a high percentage of drug addicted patients.\nOther public polyclinics and hospitals of note include the Hospital Saint Bois, founded 18 November 1928, which consists of a General Hospital and Eye Hospital; the Pasteur Hospital in La Uni\u00f3n neighborhood; the Hospital Espa\u00f1ol, which was founded in 1886, passed to the private sector in the 20th century, closed in 2004 and was restored and re-inaugurated in 2007 as the municipal Juan Jose Crottogini Polyclinic; the National Cancer Institute; and the National Institute of Trauma and Orthopedics.\nPrivate healthcare.\nPrivate healthcare is offered by many private health insurance companies, each of which has one or more polyclinics and owns or is associated with one or more hospitals. Private medical facilities of note include the Hospital Brit\u00e1nico, the Italian Hospital of Montevideo, Mutualista CASMU's Sanatoria I, II, III and IV, the Evangelical Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Sanatorio de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Sanatorios del C\u00edrculo Cat\u00f3lico, Sanatorio Casa de Galicia and Sanatorio GREMCA.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister relations.\nMontevideo is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMontevideo is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities since 12 October 1982.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38262", "revid": "40412648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38262", "title": "Max Perutz", "text": "Austrian-born British molecular biologist (1914\u20132002)\nMax Ferdinand Perutz (19 May 1914 \u2013 6 February 2002) was an Austrian-born British molecular biologist, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with John Kendrew, for their studies of the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin. He went on to win the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971 and the Copley Medal in 1979. At Cambridge he founded and chaired (1962\u201379) The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), fourteen of whose scientists have won Nobel Prizes.\nEarly life and education.\nPerutz was born in Vienna, the son of Adele \"Dely\" (Goldschmidt) and Hugo Perutz, a textile manufacturer. His parents were Jewish by ancestry, but had baptised Perutz in the Catholic religion. Although Perutz rejected religion and was an atheist in his later years, he was against offending others for their religious beliefs.\nHis parents hoped that he would become a lawyer, but he became interested in chemistry while at school. Overcoming his parents' objections he enrolled as a chemistry undergraduate at the University of Vienna and completed his degree in 1936. Made aware by lecturer Fritz von Wessely of the advances being undertaken at the University of Cambridge into biochemistry by a team led by Gowland Hopkins, he asked Professor Mark, who was soon to visit Cambridge, to make inquiries of Hopkins about whether there would be a place for him. Mark forgot, but had visited J.D. Bernal, who was looking for a research student to assist him with studies into X-ray crystallography. Perutz was dismayed as he knew nothing about the subject. Mark countered by saying that he would soon learn. Bernal accepted him as a research student in his crystallography research group at the Cavendish Laboratory. His father had deposited \u00a3500 with his London agent to support him. He learnt quickly. Bernal encouraged him to use the X-ray diffraction method to study the structure of proteins. As protein crystals were difficult to obtain, he used horse haemoglobin crystals, and began his doctoral thesis on its structure. Haemoglobin was a subject which was to occupy him for most of his professional career. He completed his Ph.D. under Lawrence Bragg in 1940.\nHe applied to Kings and St. John's colleges, and became a member of Peterhouse, on the basis that it served the best food. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse in 1962. He took a keen interest in the Junior Members, and was a regular and popular speaker at the Kelvin Club, the college's scientific society.\nWorld War II.\nWhen Hitler took over Austria in 1938, Perutz's parents managed to escape to Switzerland, but they had lost all of their money. As a result, Perutz lost their financial support. With his ability to ski, experience in mountaineering since childhood and his knowledge of crystals, Perutz was accepted as a member of a three-man team to study the conversion of snow into ice in Swiss glaciers in the summer of 1938. His resulting article for the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" made him known as an expert on glaciers.\nLawrence Bragg, who was Professor of Experimental Physics at the Cavendish, thought that Perutz's research into haemoglobin had promise and encouraged him to apply for a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to continue his research. The application was accepted in January 1939 and with the money Perutz was able to bring his parents from Switzerland to England in March 1939.\nOn the outbreak of World War II, Perutz was rounded up along with other persons of German or Austrian background, and sent to Newfoundland (on orders from Winston Churchill). After being interned for several months he returned to Cambridge. \nBecause of his pre-War research into the changes in the arrangement of the crystals in the layers of a glacier, he was asked for advice on whether if a battalion of commandos were landed in Norway, could they be hidden in shelters under glaciers. His knowledge on the subject of ice then led to him being recruited for Project Habakkuk in 1942. This was a secret project to build an ice platform in the mid-Atlantic, which could be used to refuel aircraft. To that end he investigated the recently invented mixture of ice and woodpulp known as pykrete. He carried out early experiments on pykrete in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London.\nEstablishment of the Molecular Biology Unit.\nAfter the War he returned briefly to glaciology, demonstrating how glaciers flow.\nIn 1947, Perutz, with the support of Professor Bragg, was successful in obtaining support from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to undertake research into the molecular structure of biological systems. This financial support allowed him to establish the Molecular Biology Unit at the Cavendish Laboratory. Perutz's new unit attracted researchers who realised that the field of molecular biology had great promise; among them were Francis Crick in 1949 and James D. Watson in 1951.\nIn 1953, Perutz showed that diffracted X-rays from protein crystals could be phased by comparing the patterns from crystals of the protein with and without heavy atoms attached. In 1959 he employed this method to determine the molecular structure of the protein haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood. This work resulted in his sharing with John Kendrew the 1962 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Fifty years later, in 2013, 9,500 molecular structures of proteins were determined by X-ray crystallography.\nAfter 1959, Perutz and his colleagues went on to determine the structure of oxy- and deoxy- haemoglobin at high resolution. As a result, in 1970, he was at last able to suggest how it works as a molecular machine: how it switches between its deoxygenated and its oxygenated states, in turn triggering the uptake of oxygen and then its release to the muscles and other organs. Further work over the next two decades refined and corroborated the proposed mechanism. In addition Perutz studied the structural changes in a number of haemoglobin diseases and how these might affect oxygen binding. He hoped that the molecule could be made to function as a drug receptor and that it would be possible to inhibit or reverse the genetic errors such as those that occur in sickle cell anaemia. A further interest was the variation of the haemoglobin molecule from species to species to suit differing habitats and patterns of behaviour. In his final years Perutz turned to the study of changes in protein structures implicated in Huntington and other neurodegenerative diseases. He demonstrated that the onset of Huntington disease is related to the number of glutamine repeats as they bind to form what he called a \"polar zipper\".\nDNA structure and Rosalind Franklin.\nDuring the early 1950s, while Watson and Crick were trying to determine the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), they were given by Perutz an unpublished 1952 progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall. This report contained X-ray diffraction images taken by Rosalind Franklin that proved to be crucial in coming to the double-helix structure.\nPerutz did this without Franklin's knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to publish a detailed analysis of the content of her unpublished progress report. Later this action was criticised by Randall and others, in view of the results and the honours resulting from this \"gift\".\nIn an effort to clarify this issue, Perutz later published the report, arguing that it included nothing that Franklin had not said in a talk she gave in late 1951, which Watson had attended. Perutz also added that the report was addressed to an MRC committee created to \"establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council\". Randall's and Perutz's labs were both funded by the MRC.\nThe author.\nIn his later years, Perutz was a regular reviewer/essayist for \"The New York Review of Books\" on biomedical subjects. Many of these essays are reprinted in his 1998 book, \"I wish I had made you angry earlier\".\nIn August 1985, \"The New Yorker\" published his account of his experiences as an internee during World War II, titled \"That Was the War: Enemy Alien\".\nPerutz won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science in 1997.\nA collection of Perutz's correspondence was published posthumously in 2009, titled \"What a Time I Am Having: Selected Letters of Max Perutz\".\nThe scientist-citizen.\nPerutz attacked the theories of philosophers Sir Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn and biologist Richard Dawkins in a lecture given at Cambridge on 'Living Molecules' in 1994. He criticised Popper's notion that science progresses through a process of hypothesis formation and refutation, saying that hypotheses are not necessarily the basis of scientific research and, in molecular biology at least, they are not necessarily subject to revision either. For Perutz, Kuhn's notion that science advances in paradigm shifts that are subject to social and cultural pressures is an unfair representation of modern science.\nThese criticisms extended to scientists who attack religion, in particular to Dawkins. Statements which offend people's religious faith were for Perutz tactless and simply damage the reputation of science, though he did not criticize scientists opposing \"demonstrably false\" theories such as creationism. He concluded that \"even if we do not believe in God, we should try to live as though we did.\"\nWithin days of the 11 September attacks in 2001, Perutz wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, appealing to him to not respond with military force: \"I am alarmed by the American cries for vengeance and concerned that President Bush's retaliation will lead to the death of thousands more innocent people, driving us into a world of escalating terror and counter-terror. I do hope that you can use your restraining influence to prevent this happening.\"\nHonours and awards.\nPerutz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. In addition to the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1962, which he shared with John Kendrew for their respective studies of the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin, Max Perutz received a number of other important honours: he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1963, elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year, received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art in 1967, was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1968, elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1970, received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971, appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1975, received the Copley Medal in 1979 and became a Member of the Order of Merit in 1988.\nPerutz was made a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1964, received an Honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna (1965) and received the Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1967. He was elected to EMBO Membership in 1964.\nThe European Crystallographic Association established the Max Perutz Prize, named in his honour.\nLectures.\nIn 1980, Perutz was invited to deliver one of the six lectures for the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on \"The Chicken, the Egg and the Molecules\".\nPersonal life.\nIn 1942, Perutz married Gisela Clara Mathilde Peiser (1915\u20132005), a medical photographer. They had two children, Vivien (b. 1944), an art historian; and Robin (b. 1949), a professor of chemistry at the University of York. Gisela was a refugee from Germany (she was a Protestant whose own father had been born Jewish).\nHe died on 6 February 2002 and his ashes were interred with his parents Hugo Perutz and Dely Perutz in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge. Gisela died on 17 December 2005 and her ashes were interred in the same grave.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38264", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38264", "title": "Granada", "text": "Granada ( ; ) is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. Ascribed to the Vega de Granada \"comarca\", the city sits at an average elevation of above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. With a population of 233,532 as of 2024, it is the 20th-largest city in Spain.\nNearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Granada-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe area was settled since ancient times by Iberians, Romans, and Visigoths. The current settlement became a major city of Al-Andalus in the 11th century during the Zirid Taifa of Granada. In the 13th century it became the capital of the Emirate of Granada under Nasrid rule, the last Muslim-ruled state in the Iberian Peninsula. Granada was conquered in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs and progressively transformed into a Christian city over the course of the 16th century.\nThe Alhambra, a medieval Nasrid citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the most visited tourist sites in Spain. Islamic-period influence and Moorish architecture are also preserved in the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood and other medieval monuments in the city. The 16th century also saw a flourishing of Mud\u00e9jar architecture and Renaissance architecture, followed later by Baroque and Churrigueresque styles. The University of Granada has an estimated 47,000 undergraduate students spread over five different campuses in the city. The pomegranate () is the heraldic device of Granada.\nEtymology.\nGranada's historical name in the Arabic language was (\"\"). Both the name's meaning and origin are uncertain and have been debated. The toponym definitely existed prior to the Zirid period in the 11th century. It probably first appeared in the 9th century and it is found in Arabic sources from the 10th century.\nThe word \"G\u00e1rnata\" (or \"Karnata\") possibly meant \"hill of strangers\". Another meaning might be \"hill of pilgrims\". It could even have been of Berber origin. Another theory is that it derived from Latin (or its plural ), meaning \"seed\", \"beads\", or a \"scarlet color\", which would have been adapted into Arabic as ' or '. The Arab chronicler Al-Maqqari believed that it came from the Latin word for pomegranate, . In either case, the Latin word may have been used not in its primary sense, but in the more derived sense of \"red\", referring to the color of the area's soil and its buildings. This would also mirror the etymology of the name of the Alhambra.\nHistory.\nPre-Umayyad history.\nThe region surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least 5500BC. Archeological artifacts found in the city indicate that the site of the city, including the area around the present-day avenue of \"Gran V\u00eda de Col\u00f3n\", was inhabited since the Bronze Age. The most ancient ruins found in the area belong to an oppidum called \"Ilturir\", founded by the Iberian Bastetani tribe around 650BC. The name Elibyrge is also attested in reference to this area. This settlement became later known as \"Iliberri\" or \"Iliberis\". In 44BC \"Iliberis\" became a Roman colony and in 27BC it became a Roman \"municipium\" named \"Florentia Iliberritana\" ('Flourishing Iliberri').\nThe identification of present-day Granada with the Roman-era \"Iliberis\" and the historical continuity between the two settlements has long been debated by scholars. Modern archeological digs on the Albaic\u00edn hill have uncovered finds demonstrating the presence of a significant Roman town on that site. Little is known, however, about the history of the city in the period between the end of the Roman era and the 11th century. An important Christian synod circa 300 AD, the Synod of Elvira, took place near this area (the name \"Elvira\" being derived from the name \"Iliberri\"), but there is no concrete archeological or documentary evidence establishing the exact location of the meeting. It may have taken place in the former Roman town or it may have taken place somewhere in the surrounding region, which was known as Elvira.\nFounding and early history.\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in 711AD, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. The earliest Arabic historical sources mention that a town named \"Qasht\u012bliya\", later known as \"Mad\u012bnat Ilb\u012bra\" (Elvira), was located on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Elvira mountains (near present-day Atarfe) and became the most important settlement in the area. A smaller settlement and fortress (\"\u1e25i\u1e63n\") named \"\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da\" (also transliterated as \"Gharn\u0101\u1e6da)\" existed on the south side of the Darro River or on the site of the current Albaic\u00edn neighbourhood. The latter had a mainly Jewish population and thus was also known as \"Gharn\u0101\u1e6dat al-Yah\u016bd\" (\"\"Gharn\u0101\u1e6da\" of the Jews\"). The district around the city was known as \"K\u016brat Ilb\u012bra\" (roughly \"Province of Elvira\"). After 743 the town of \"Ilb\u012bra\" was settled by soldiers from the region of Syria who played a role in supporting Abd al-Rahman I, the founder of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba and a new Umayyad dynasty. In the late 9th century, during the reign of Abdallah (r. 844\u2013912), the city and its surrounding district were the site of conflict between \"muwallads\" (Muslim converts) who were loyal to the central government and Arabs, led by Saww\u0101r ibn \u1e24amd\u016bn, who resented them.\nAt the beginning of the 11th century, the area became dominated by the Zirids, a Sanhaja Berber group and offshoot of the Zirids who ruled parts of North Africa. This group became an important contingent in the army of \u02bfAbd al-Malik al-Mu\u1e93affar, the prime minister of Caliph Hisham II (r. 976\u20131009) and successor to Ibn Abi \u02bfAmir al-Mansur (Almanzor) as \"de facto\" ruler of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. For their service, the Zirids were granted control of the province of Elvira. When the Caliphate collapsed after 1009 and the Fitna (civil war) began, the Zirid leader Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. Arab sources such as al-Idrisi consider him to be the founder of the city of Granada. His great-grandnephew's surviving \"memoirs,\" known as the \"Tibyan\" \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. Because \"Mad\u012bnat Ilb\u012bra\" was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of \"\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da\". According to Arabic sources \"Ilb\u012bra\" was razed during the Fitna, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead \"\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da\", the former Jewish town, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus. Until the 11th century it had a mixed population of Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\nThe Zirids built their citadel and palace, known as the \"al-Qa\u1e63aba al-Qad\u012bma\" (\"Old Citadel\"), on the hill now occupied by the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood. It was connected to two smaller fortresses on the Sabika hill (site of the future Alhambra) and Mauror hill to the south. The city around it grew during the 11th century to include the Albaic\u00edn, the Sabika, the Mauror, and a part of the surrounding plains. The city was fortified with walls encompassing an area of approximately 75 hectares. The northern part of these walls, near the Albaicin citadel, have survived to the present day, along with two of its gates: \"B\u0101b al-Unaydar\" (now called \"Puerta Monaita\" in Spanish) and \"B\u0101b al-Ziy\u0101da\" (now known as \"Arco de las Pesas\" or \"Puerta Nueva\"). The city and its residences were supplied with water through an extensive network of underground cisterns and pipes. On the Darro River, along the wall connecting the Zirid citadel with the Sabika hill, was a sluice gate called \"B\u0101b al-Dif\u0101f\" (\"Gate of the Tambourines\"), which could be closed or opened to control the flow of the river and retain water if necessary. The nearby Ba\u00f1uelo, a former hammam (bathhouse), also likely dates from this time, as does the former minaret of a mosque in the Albaic\u00edn, now part of the Church of San Jos\u00e9.\nUnder the Zirid kings Habbus ibn Maksan and Badis, the most powerful figure was the Jewish administrator known as Samuel ha-Nagid (in Hebrew) or Isma'il ibn Nagrilla (in Arabic). Samuel was a highly educated member of the former elites of Cordoba, who fled that city after the outbreak of the Fitna. He eventually found his way to Granada, where Habbus ibn Maksan appointed him his secretary in 1020 and entrusted him with many important responsibilities, including tax collection. Under Badis, he even took charge of the army. During this period, the Muslim king was looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. Granada was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship. According to Daniel Eisenberg:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army. [...] It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula. All of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nAfter Samuel's death, his son Joseph took over after his position but proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 Granada massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain.\nFrom the late 11th century to the early 13th century, Al-Andalus was dominated by two successive North African Berber empires. The Almoravids ruled Granada from 1090 and the Almohads from 1166. Granada also served as an administrative capital of Almoravid rule in al-Andalus. Evidence from the artistic and archeological remains of this period suggest that the city thrived under the Almoravids but declined under the Almohads. Remnants of the Almohad period in the city include the Alc\u00e1zar Genil, built in 1218\u20131219 (but later redecorated under the Nasrids), and possibly the former minaret attached to the present-day Church of San Juan de los Reyes in the Albaicin.\nNasrid Emirate of Granada.\nIn 1228 Idris al-Ma'mun, the last effective Almohad ruler in al-Andalus, left the Iberian Peninsula. As Almohad rule collapsed local leaders and factions emerged across the region. With the \"Reconquista\" in full swing, the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon \u2013 under kings Ferdinand III and James I, respectively \u2013 made major conquests across al-Andalus. Castile captured Cordoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. Meanwhile, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar (Muhammad I) established what became the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids, who ruled the Emirate of Granada. On multiple occasions Ibn al-Ahmar aligned himself with Ferdinand III, eventually agreeing to become his vassal in 1246. Granada thereafter became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. The political history of the emirate was turbulent and intertwined with that of its neighbours. The Nasrids sometimes provided refuge or military aid to Castilian kings and noblemen, even against other Muslim states, while in turn the Castilians provided refuge and aid to some Nasrid emirs against other Nasrid rivals. On other occasions the Nasrids attempted to leverage the aid of the North African Marinids to ward off Castile, although Marinid interventions in the Peninsula ended after Battle of Rio Salado (1340).\nThe population of the emirate was also swollen by Muslim refugees from the territories newly conquered by Castile and Aragon, resulting in a small yet densely populated territory which was more uniformly Muslim and Arabic-speaking than before. The city itself expanded and new neighbourhoods grew around the Albaic\u00edn (named after refugees from Baeza) and in Antequeruela (named after refugees from Antequera after 1410). A new set of walls was constructed further north during the 13th\u201314th centuries, with \"Bab Ilbirah\" (present-day \"Puerta de Elvira\") as its western entrance. A major Muslim cemetery existed outside this gate. The city's heart was its Great Mosque (on the site of the present-day Granada Cathedral) and the commercial district known as the \"qaysariyya\" (the Alcaicer\u00eda). Next to this was the only major madrasa built in al-Andalus, the \"Madrasa al-Yusufiyya\" (known today as the Palacio de la Madraza), founded in 1349. Other monuments from this era include the \"al-Funduq al-Jadida\" (\"New Inn\" or caravanserai, now known as the Corral del Carb\u00f3n), built in the early 14th century, the Maristan (hospital), built in 1365\u20131367 and demolished in 1843, and the main mosque of the Albaic\u00edn, dating from the 13th century.\nWhen Ibn Al-Ahmar established himself in the city he moved the royal palace from the old Zirid citadel on the Albaic\u00edn hill to the Sabika hill, beginning construction on what became the present Alhambra. The Alhambra acted as a self-contained palace-city, with its own mosque, hammams, fortress, and residential quarters for workers and servants. The most celebrated palaces that survive today, such as the Comares Palace and the Palace of the Lions, generally date from the reigns of YusufI (r. 1333\u20131354) and his son MuhammadV (r. 1354\u20131391, with interruptions). Some smaller examples of Nasrid palace architecture in the city have survived in the Cuarto Real de Santo Domingo (late 13th century) and the Dar al-Horra (15th century).Partly due to the heavy tributary payments to Castile, Granada's economy specialized in the trade of high-value goods. Integrated within the European mercantile network, the ports of the kingdom fostered intense trading relations with the Genoese, but also with the Catalans, and to a lesser extent, with the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Portuguese. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area.\nDespite its frontier position, Granada was also an important Islamic intellectual and cultural center, especially in the time of MuhammadV, with figures such as Ibn Khaldun and Ibn al-Khatib serving in the Nasrid court. Ibn Battuta, a famous traveller and historian, visited the Emirate of Granada in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called Granada the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"\nEnd of Muslim rule and 16th-century changes.\nOn 2 January 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile), after the last episode of the Granada War.\nThe 1492 capitulation of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history. It brought the demise of the last Muslim-controlled polity in the Iberian Peninsula. The terms of the surrender, outlined in the Treaty of Granada at the end of 1491, explicitly allowed the Muslim inhabitants, known as \"mud\u00e9jares\", to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. This had been a traditional practice during Castilian (and Aragonese) conquests of Muslim cities since the takeover of Toledo in the 11th century. The terms of the surrender pressured Jewish inhabitants (then numbering 110 households) to convert or leave within three years, but this provision was quickly superseded by the Alhambra Decree, issued only a few months later on 31 March, which instead forced all Jews in Spain to convert or be expelled within four months. Those who converted became known as \"conversos\" (converts). This move, along with the progressive erosion of other guarantees provided by the surrender treaty, raised tensions and fears within the remaining Muslim community during the 1490s. Many of the city's affluent Muslims and its traditional ruling classes emigrated to North Africa in the early years after the conquest, but these early emigrants numbered only a few thousand, with the rest of the population unable to afford leaving.\nBy 1499, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians and undertook a program of forced baptisms, creating the \"converso\" class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new strategy, which was a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southeast of the city. The rebellion lasted until 1500 in Granada and continued until 1501 in the Alpujarras. Responding to the rebellion of 1501, the Crown of Castile rescinded the Treaty of Granada, and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Many of the remaining Muslim elites subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's \"mud\u00e9jares\" converted (becoming the so-called \"moriscos\" or Moorish) so that they could stay. Both populations of converts were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy (the so-called \"marranos\" in the case of the \"conversos\" accused of the charge of crypto-Judaism).\nOver the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants arrived from other regions of Castile, lured by the promise of economic opportunities in the newly conquered city. At the time of the city's surrender in 1492 it had a population of 50,000 which included only a handful of Christians (mostly captives), but by 1561 (the year of the first royal census of the city) the population was composed of over 30,000 Christian immigrants and approximately 15,000 \"moriscos\". After 1492 the city's first churches had been installed in some converted mosques. The vast majority of the city's remaining mosques were subsequently converted into churches during and after the mass conversions of 1500. In 1531, Charles V founded the University of Granada on the site of the former madrasa built by Yusuf I.\nGranada's Town Council did not fully establish until almost nine years after the Castilian conquest, upon the concession of the so-called 'Constitutive Charter' of the Ayuntamiento of Granada on 23 September 1500. From then on, the municipal institution became a crucible for the \"Old Christian\" and the converted \"morisco\" elites, resulting in strong factionalism, particularly after 1508. The new period also saw the creation of a number of other new institutions such as the Cathedral Cabildo, the Captaincy\u2013General, the Royal Chapel and the Royal Chancellery. For the rest of the 16th century the Granadan ruling oligarchy featured roughly a 40% of (Jewish) \"conversos\" and about a 31% of \"hidalgos\". From the 1520s onward, the mosque structures themselves began to be replaced with new church buildings, a process which continued for most of the century. In December 1568, during a period of renewed persecution against \"moriscos\", the Second Morisco Rebellion broke out in the Alpujarras. Although the city's \"morisco\" population played little role in the rebellion, King Philip II ordered the expulsion of the vast majority of the \"morisco\" population from the Kingdom of Granada, with the exception of those artisans and professionals judged essential to the economy. The expelled population was redistributed to other cities throughout the Crown of Castile. The final expulsion of all \"moriscos\" from Castile and Aragon was carried out between 1609 and 1614.\nLater history and present day.\nDuring the 17th century, despite the importance of immigration, the population of the city stagnated at about 55,000, contrary to the trend of population increase experienced in the rural areas of the Kingdom of Granada, where the hammer of depopulation caused by the expulsion of the \"moriscos\" had taken a far greater toll in the previous century. The 17th-century demographic stagnation in the city and overall steady population increase in the wider kingdom went in line with the demographic disaster experienced throughout the century in the rest of the Crown of Castile. The city was overshadowed in importance by other cities including Seville and the capital, Madrid.\nBetween 1810 and 1812 Granada was occupied by Napoleon's army during the Peninsular War. The French troops occupied the Alhambra as a fortified position and caused significant damage to the monument. Upon evacuating the city, they attempted to dynamite the whole complex, successfully blowing up eight towers before the remaining fuses were disabled by Spanish soldier Jos\u00e9 Garcia, thus saving what remains today. In 1830 Washington Irving lived in Granada and wrote his \"Tales of the Alhambra\", which revived some international interest in southern Spain and in its Islamic-era monuments.\nIn the 1930s the tensions that eventually divided Spain were evident in Granada, with frequent riots and friction between landowners and peasants. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Granada was one of the cities that joined the Nationalist uprising. There was local resistance against the Nationalists, particularly from the working classes in the Albaic\u00edn, which was violently repressed. During the 1950s and 1960s, under the Franco regime, the province of Granada was one of the poorest areas in Spain. In recent decades tourism has become a major industry in the city.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe city of Granada sits on the Vega de Granada, one of the depressions or plains located within the Baetic mountain ranges, continued to the west by those of Archidona and Antequera and to the East by those of Guadix, Baza and Hu\u00e9scar.\nThe fertile soil of the Vega, apt for agriculture, is irrigated by the water streams originated in Sierra Nevada, as well as minor secondary ranges, all drained by the catchment basin of the Genil River, that cuts across the city centre following an east to west direction. The Monachil, a left-bank tributary of the former, also passes through the city, discharging into the Genil to the west of the city centre.\nClimate.\nGranada has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\") close to a cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\"). Summers are hot and dry with daily temperatures averaging in the hottest month (July); however, temperatures reaching over are not uncommon in the summer months. Winters are cool and damp, with most of the rainfall concentrated from November through to January. The coldest month is January with daytime temperatures hovering at and dropping to around during the night. Frost is common as temperatures usually reach below-freezing in the early morning. Snow is rare and occurs once every few years. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm. Early summer in 2017 confronted the city with two massive heat waves that broke long-standing record temperatures starting on 13 June 2017, with a new maximum high for the month at 40.6\u00a0\u00b0C (old record 40.0), which was topped three times within the span of four days at 40.9\u00a0\u00b0C on 14 June, 41.3 (15 June) and, eventually, 41.5 (17 June). The second extreme surge in temperatures followed roughly a month later when readings soared to 45.7 and 45.3\u00a0\u00b0C on 12 and 13 July, respectively, surpassing the old July record by almost 3 degrees.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;As of 2024, the municipality of Granada has a population of 233,532, of which 46.2% are male and 53.8% are female. Since 1991, there has been a slight decrease in the population of Granada, in favor of smaller towns in the greater area.\nAs per the population pyramid:\nForeign population.\n32,135 people living in Granada are of foreign nationality, representing 13.8% of total population, a rate lower than the national average. Resident foreigners come mainly from Latin America, with the top 5 most numerous being from Morocco (6,476), Colombia (2,753), Argentina (1,829), Venezuela (1,749), and Bolivia (1,681).\nUrban areas.\nIn the municipality of Granada there are five urban areas: Granada city, Alquer\u00eda del Fargue, Bobadilla, Cerrillo de Maracena and Lancha del Genil. Due to the expansion of Granada city, Cerrillo de Maracena has been integrated into it.\nPolitics.\nMetropolitan area of Granada.\nGranada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\nCapital of Granada Province.\nThe city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of Spain has a sub-delegation in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\nJudicial administration.\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows:\nMunicipal organization.\nIts political administration is carried out through a City Council, of democratic management, whose components are chosen every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Granada over 18 years of age, of Spanish nationality and of the other member countries of the European Union. According to the provisions of the General Electoral Regime Law, which establishes the number of eligible councilors according to the population of the municipality, the Municipal Corporation of Granada is made up of 27 councilors.\nIn the municipal elections held in 2019 the constitution of the City Council was eleven councilors belonging to the Popular Party, eight to the Socialist Party, four belonging to Citizens Party, three to Vamos, Granada and one to the United Left-Socialist Alternative-For the People. Luis Salvador, leader of Citizens, became mayor with support from the PP and Vox. Salvador resigned in 2021, having lost the support of the PP. He was succeeded by the Socialist Francisco Cuenca who had previously served as mayor from 2016-2019. In the 2023 Spanish local elections Cuenca was ousted by Marifr\u00e1n Carazo of the PP. Carazo increased the PP's number of seats from 7 to 14, gaining her a slim majority and making her the first female mayor of the city.\nMunicipal districts and neighborhoods.\nThe municipality of Granada consists of eight districts whose population is distributed in the attached chart according to the 2009 census of the City of Granada. These districts formed a set of 36 neighborhoods. All boundaries of districts and neighborhoods were modified in February 2013.\nMunicipal service areas.\nThe municipal government team has organized the distribution of management responsibilities, structuring itself in the following service areas: \"Weddings and Palaces, Equal opportunities, Economy, Education, Communication office, Unified license management, Youth, Environment, Municipal Office of Consumer Information, Citizen Participation, Group of Civil Protection Volunteers, Local Police\".\nDistricts.\nRealejo.\nRealejo has been described as a Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada. Today, the district is made up of many villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called \"Los C\u00e1rmenes\".\nCartuja.\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of Granada.\nBib-Rambla.\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when Granada was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar, the \"Alcaicer\u00eda\", is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral.\nSacromonte.\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the \"Zambra Gitana\", an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the \"Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte\", a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\nZaid\u00edn.\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other bits and bobs.\nEconomy.\nGranada produces agricultural products such as barley, wheat, sugarcane and tobacco. Besides these crops, olive trees as well as oranges, lemons, figs, almonds, and pomegranates are also commonly grown. For manufacturing, sugar refining is also made in the city. Vineyards and wines are also a significant contributor to the city and region. In 2020, Granada exported a total of $1.3 billion products.\nSocial welfare.\nEducation.\nUniversity.\nThe University of Granada (UGR), founded in 1531 by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, meant the continuation of higher studies in La Madraza, when the city was the capital of the last Nasrid Kingdom. The university has become internationally recognised in many university fields: teaching, research, cultural and services to its members and its surroundings. It is therefore one of the destinations that receives more exchange students from the Erasmus Program13 and the fourth Spanish university in number of students, after the Complutense University of Madrid, and the University of Seville. The university has around 47,000 undergraduate students.\nObligatory education.\nIn the city there are a total of 69 compulsory secondary education centers. Infant and primary education is taught in 104 centers, distributed among private, concerted and public centers. There are also five adult education centers.\nHealth.\nIts public health system is the exclusive competence of the autonomous community, which provides two types of attention: primary, which constitutes the first level of access to the system; and the specialized one. Health centers and offices constitute the offer of primary care, differing from each other in the level of care they provide.\nHospital network.\nIts hospital network is basically composed of public hospitals managed by the Andalusian Health Service and other smaller private management centers. This network covers the needs of the city and its Metropolitan Area. In total there are 2047 beds.\nHealth centers.\nThe local primary care network currently consists of eight health centers distributed by the different districts of the city and are the following: Zaid\u00edn Sur, Zaid\u00edn Centro-Este, Realejo, Las Flores, La Caleta, G\u00f3ngora, Doctores, Cartuja and Albayc\u00edn.\nMunicipal competitions.\nArticle 42 of the General Health Law provides that municipalities, without prejudice to the powers of other public administrations, will have the following minimum responsibilities in matters related to health.\nCitizen security.\nThe coordination between the state security forces (National Police, Civil Guard, Local Police and Autonomous Police) and the City of Granada is carried out by the local Citizen Security Board. This body allows for proper communication of the security forces in matters of security within its competence, the prevention of crime, road safety and proper procedure.\nThe daily citizen security is in charge of the state and local security forces and bodies (Spain) according to the powers that each estate has, trying to act in a coordinated and collaborative way in the prosecution and resolution of all types of crimes.\nSocial services.\nThe City of Granada has the Social Services Area to provide the necessary help and advice that the most disadvantaged and needy groups and people may need. For this reason, the Social Welfare Delegation of the City of Granada has several municipal community social services centers, one for each local district, coordinated by Los Mondragones Municipal Administration located on the Fuerzas Armadas Avenue. In its internal organization the services provided are organized around each municipal center and therefore of each municipal district but also around groups.\nTransport.\nMetro.\nConstruction of a light rail network, the Granada metro, began in 2007, but was greatly delayed by the Spanish economic crisis. Service finally started on 21 September 2017. The single line crosses Granada and covers the towns of Albolote, Maracena and Armilla.\nBus.\nThe main company operating bus transport in Granada is Transportes Rober. There is also bus transportation to and from the airport with the company Alsa.\nRail.\nGranada railway station has rail connections with many cities in Spain. There are several types of train service to and from Granada\nTaxi.\nGranada has a wide network of taxis to help travellers reach their destinations. Official Granada taxis are white with a green stripe.\nAirport.\nThe nearest civil airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca Airport, about west of Granada. The Armilla Air Base was the first civil airport serving the city and its surroundings but it was replaced by the former airport in the 1970s and repurposed for military uses.\nGranada Public Transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Granada, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 42 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 10 min, while 8% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 2.7\u00a0km, while 0% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nCulture.\nHeritage and monuments.\nAlhambra.\nThe Alhambra is a fortified palace complex located on the Sabika hill, an outcrop of the Sierra Nevada which overlooks the city of Granada. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the best-preserved palaces of the historic Islamic world, in addition to containing notable examples of Spanish Renaissance architecture. It is one of Spain's major tourist attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984.\nThe complex was begun in 1238 by MuhammadI Ibn al-Ahmar, the first Nasrid emir, on the site of earlier fortresses and of the 11th-century palace of vizier Samuel ibn Naghrillah. Later Nasrid rulers continuously modified the site, most notably during the reigns of YusufI and MuhammadV in the 14th century. During this era, the Alhambra was a self-contained city separate from the rest of Granada below. It contained most of the amenities of a Muslim city such as a Friday mosque, hammams (public baths), roads, houses, artisan workshops, a tannery, and a sophisticated water supply system. As a royal city and citadel, it contained at least six major palaces, most of them located along the northern edge where they commanded views over the Albaic\u00edn quarter. The most famous and best-preserved are the Mexuar, the Comares Palace, the Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace, which form the main attraction to visitors today. The other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations. At the Alhambra's western tip is the Alcazaba fortress, the centerpiece of its defensive system. The architecture of the Nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of Moorish architecture developed over previous centuries. Decoration is focused on the inside of the building and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls. Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and Arabic calligraphy were the main types of decorative motifs. Additionally, \"stalactite\"-like sculpting, known as \"muqarnas\", was used for three-dimensional features like vaulted ceilings.\nAfter the conclusion of the \"Reconquista\" in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered. In 1526, Charles V commissioned a new Renaissance-style palace, now known as the Palace of Charles V, in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid palaces, but it was left uncompleted in the early 17th century. Other notable Renaissance additions from the reign of CharlesV include the Emperor's Chambers and the \"Peinador de la Reina\" ('Queen's Robing Room'), which are connected to the former Nasrid Palaces.\nIn the 18th century the Alhambra fell into severe neglect and parts of it were demolished by French troops in 1812. Through the course of the 19th century, the Alhambra was \"rediscovered\" by British, American, and other European Romantic travelers and intellectuals. The most influential of them was Washington Irving, whose \"Tales of the Alhambra\" (1832) brought international attention to the site. The Alhambra became one of the first Islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the subject of numerous restorations since the 19th century, a process which continues today.\nGeneralife.\nThe Generalife is a Nasrid-era country estate or summer palace located just east of the Alhambra, on a sloping site above it. It was first built by Muhammad II and Muhammad III in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. This palace features several rectangular garden courtyards with decorated pavilions at either end and it was originally linked to the Alhambra by a walled corridor that crosses the valley between the two. It underwent modifications and redecoration under multiple later Nasrid rulers.\nThe Generalife also underwent major alterations by Christian Spanish builders in the 16th century, which imparted Renaissance elements on the palace. In the 20th century a large area of modern landscaped gardens, known as the \"Jardines Nuevos\" ('New Gardens'), were added to the south of the Nasrid palace and form the main approach to it today. These date in large part to the work of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s and Francisco Prieto Moreno, between 1931 and 1951, who incorporated both Italian and Moorish influences in their design. An open-air auditorium was also added in 1952. Along with the Alhambra, the Generalife is a major tourist attraction and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.\nCathedral.\nThe cathedral of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.\nThe architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\nRoyal Chapel.\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated 13 September 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (\"Juana la Loca\") and her husband Felipe I (\"Felipe el Hermoso\"). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on 19 May 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\nAlbayz\u00edn.\nThe historic neighbourhood, located on the hillsides north of the Alhambra, still retains much of its medieval street plan dating back to the Nasrid period, although it has undergone physical and demographic changes since then. Archeological evidence indicates that Iberians inhabited the main hill of the present-day Albaicin towards the 7th centuryBC and that a significant town was located here during the Roman period. During the early Islamic period, up to the 10th century, the location hosted only the small settlement of \"Gharn\u0101\u1e6da\" (Granada), until in the 11th century the creation of the Zirid Taifa kingdom transformed the location into one of the most important cities in Al-Andalus. During this period, the city's main citadel and palace, the \"al-Qa\u1e63aba al-Qad\u012bma\" (\"Old Citadel\"), was located on the top of this hill. During the Nasrid period, the citadel was moved to the Alhambra and the old district became known as (), from which its present name derives. Among the various Nasrid-period houses and other structures, one notable establishment was the Maristan, a type of historic hospital (bimaristan) which also took care of the mentally ill.\nThrough the course of the 16th century, after the surrender of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, the district underwent some of the some changes that occurred throughout the city. Mosques were replaced with new parish churches, particularly after 1501. These new churches were often built in a mix of Mud\u00e9jar and Renaissance styles, such as the Church of Santa Ana, the Church of San Crist\u00f3bal, and the Church of San Miguel Bajo, among others. Some, like the churches of San Salvador, San Jos\u00e9, and San Juan de los Reyes, preserve parts of former mosques. New civic institutions were also built in this area, such as the Royal Chancellery (\"Real Chanciller\u00eda\"), which overlooks Plaza Nueva, a wide public square expanded during the 16th century.\nDuring the 16th century most of the city's \"morisco\" population was concentrated in the Albaic\u00edn, but after the 1568 rebellion and their subsequent expulsion, the district was depopulated. As a result, many of the remaining Christian residents expanded their residences to form \"carmen\"s, traditional semi-rural houses with gardens or orchards, many examples of which survive today. Some of these houses and mansions, such as Casa de Zafra and the Dar al-Horra, date back to the Nasrid period. In 1994 the UNESCO World Heritage Site encompassing the Alhambra was extended to incorporate the Albaic\u00edn as well. In addition to its historic houses and mansions, churches, and the Royal Chancellery, the district also preserves sections of the 11th-century Zirid city walls (part of the former Zirid citadel), the 14th-century Nasrid walls, the Ba\u00f1uelo (a former Islamic-era bathhouse), and numerous cisterns from the Islamic period that were part of a water supply system providing water to most of the city's houses.\nSacromonte.\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco \"cantes\" and \"quej\u00edos\", so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.\nThe abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the \"Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o\", an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\nCharterhouse.\nThe Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called \"Aynadamar\" (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of Granada.\nThe street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods, and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.\nMosque of Granada.\nThe new mosque was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (\"Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a\") hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\nPalace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar.\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of \"El de la Haza\u00f1as\" [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (\"El Gran Capit\u00e1n\" [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with of floor space on two floors and of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\nOther museums and monuments.\nSince 1988, there is in Granada a monument honoring Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon.\nCuisine.\nThe gastronomy of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the \"traditional cuisine of Granada\", says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from Granada. Subsequently, there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables, meats and sausages, and fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauteed before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land.\nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the \"pesti\u00f1os\" of V\u00e9lez or those of the \"Encarnaci\u00f3n\", the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the ovos moles of San Ant\u00f3n, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, \"cocas\", \"roscos\" from Santo Tomas and \"mantecados\". Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called , as well as fig bread, Moorish \"roscos\" and an almond cake called \"soy\u00e1\" are all of Arabic heritage.\nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada \"tapas\" (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (\"Ir de tapas\") and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.\nLeisure and entertainment.\nIn Granada there is a wide program of leisure and entertainment, which covers a large number of fields, available to both visitors and citizens themselves. Of the leisure activities carried out, the following can be highlighted:\nParks and gardens.\nThe city of Granada has a significant number of parks and gardens, including: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports.\nGranada has a football team:\nGranada has a basketball team:\nSkiing:\nBullfighting:\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nGranada is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was restored in 1739 until the independence movement suspended it again in 1810. The territory corresponding to Panama was incorporated in 1739. The provinces of Venezuela were separated from the Viceroyalty and assigned to the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777. \nIn addition to those core areas, the territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada included Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, southwestern Suriname, parts of northwestern Brazil, and northern Peru. A strip along the Atlantic Ocean in Mosquito Coast was added by the Royal Decree of 20 November 1803, but the British battled for administrative control.\nColonial history.\nTwo centuries after the establishment of the New Kingdom of Granada in the 16th century, whose governor was dependent upon the Viceroy of Peru at Lima, and an \"audiencia\" at Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1, today capital of the republic of Colombia, in 1717 the slowness of communications between the two capitals led to the creation of an independent Viceroyalty of New Granada. It was reestablished in 1739 after a short interruption. \nOther provinces corresponding to modern Ecuador, the eastern and southern parts of today's Venezuela, and Panama came together in a political unit under the jurisdiction of Bogot\u00e1, confirming that city as one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with Lima and Mexico City. Sporadic attempts at reform were directed at increasing efficiency and centralizing authority, but control from Spain was never very effective.\nThe rough and diverse geography of northern South America and the limited range of proper roads made travel and communications within the viceroyalty difficult. The establishment of an autonomous Captaincy General in Caracas in 1777 and the preservation of the older Audiencia of Quito, nominally subject to the Viceroy but for most purposes independent, was a response to the necessities of effectively governing the peripheral regions. Some analysts also consider that these measures reflected a degree of local traditions that eventually contributed to the differing political and national differences among these territories once they became independent in the nineteenth century and which the unifying efforts of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar could not overcome.\nGuajira rebellion.\nThe Spanish had never subjugated the Wayuu. The two groups were in a more or less permanent state of war. There had been rebellions in 1701 (when they destroyed a Capuchin mission), 1727 (when more than 2,000 Wayuus attacked the Spanish), 1741, 1757, 1761 and 1768. In 1718, Governor Soto de Herrera called them \"barbarians, horse thieves, worthy of death, without God, without law, and without a king.\" Of all the Indians in the territory of Colombia, the Wayuu were unique in having learned the use of firearms and horses.\nIn 1769 the Spanish took 22 Wayuus captive, in order to put them to work building the fortifications of Cartagena. The reaction of the Wayuus was unexpected. On 2 May 1769, at El Rinc\u00f3n, near Riohacha, they set their village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it. They also captured the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rinc\u00f3n to capture the Wayuus. At the head of this force was Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed.\nThis success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at the peak, there were 20,000 Wayuus under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. This enabled the rebels to take nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others were taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels.\nThe Spaniards took refuge in Riohacha and sent urgent messages to Maracaibo, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Cartagena, the latter responding by sending 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death. A battle between the two groups of Wayuus was fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements caused the rebellion to fade away, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory.\nAdministrative divisions.\nNew Kingdom of Granada \"\".\nThe Real Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 was established in 1549, but became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. It was re-incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Peru from 1723 to 1739. It met in the city of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 until it was disestablished in 1810. It was briefly re-established between 1816 and 1819. It had the following provinces under its authority:\nIndependent history.\nThe retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful independence struggle led mainly by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and Francisco de Paula Santander in neighboring Venezuela. Bol\u00edvar returned to New Granada only in 1819 after establishing himself as leader of the pro-independence forces in the Venezuelan \"llanos\". From there Bolivar led an army over the Andes and captured New Granada after a quick campaign that ended at the Battle of Boyac\u00e1, on 7 August 1819, finally proclaimed independence in 1821. The pro-Spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.\nThe territories of the viceroyalty gained full de facto independence from Spain between 1819 and 1822 after a series of military and political struggles, uniting in a republic now known as Gran Colombia.\nWith the dissolution of Gran Colombia, the states of Ecuador, Venezuela, and the Republic of New Granada were created. The Republic of New Granada, with its capital at Bogot\u00e1, lasted from 1831 to 1856. The name \"Colombia\" reappeared in the \"United States of Colombia\"; the new name for the country having been introduced by a liberal government after a civil war. The use of the term \"New Granada\" survived in conservative circles, such as among ecclesiastics.\nDemographics.\nIn the 1778 census, New Granada had a population of around 1,280,000. Around 40% of the population were Indians, with around 500,000 people. The next largest group were free Mestizos and Africans, at around 400,000. Whites had close to 300,000. The smallest group, at around 70,000 people, were slaves. In the current territory of Colombia, it was estimated that the population was 826,550.\nIn 1810, New Granada was estimated to have 2,150,000 inhabitants.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is sometimes called Hamel dimension (after Georg Hamel) or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other types of dimension.\nFor every vector space there exists a basis, and all bases of a vector space have equal cardinality; as a result, the dimension of a vector space is uniquely defined. We say formula_1 is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;finite-dimensional if the dimension of formula_1 is finite, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;infinite-dimensional if its dimension is infinite.\nThe dimension of the vector space formula_1 over the field formula_4 can be written as formula_5 or as formula_6 read \"dimension of formula_1 over formula_4\". When formula_4 can be inferred from context, formula_10 is typically written.\nExamples.\nThe vector space formula_11 has\nformula_12\nas a standard basis, and therefore formula_13 More generally, formula_14 and even more generally, formula_15 for any field formula_16 \nThe complex numbers formula_17 are both a real and complex vector space; we have formula_18 and formula_19 So the dimension depends on the base field.\nThe only vector space with dimension formula_20 is formula_21 the vector space consisting only of its zero element.\nProperties.\nIf formula_22 is a linear subspace of formula_1 then formula_24\nTo show that two finite-dimensional vector spaces are equal, the following criterion can be used: if formula_1 is a finite-dimensional vector space and formula_22 is a linear subspace of formula_1 with formula_28 then formula_29 \nThe space formula_30 has the standard basis formula_31 where formula_32 is the formula_33-th column of the corresponding identity matrix. Therefore, formula_30 has dimension formula_35\nAny two finite dimensional vector spaces over formula_4 with the same dimension are isomorphic. Any bijective map between their bases can be uniquely extended to a bijective linear map between the vector spaces. If formula_37 is some set, a vector space with dimension formula_38 over formula_4 can be constructed as follows: take the set formula_40 of all functions formula_41 such that formula_42 for all but finitely many formula_43 in formula_44 These functions can be added and multiplied with elements of formula_4 to obtain the desired formula_4-vector space.\nAn important result about dimensions is given by the rank\u2013nullity theorem for linear maps.\nIf formula_47 is a field extension, then formula_4 is in particular a vector space over formula_49 Furthermore, every formula_4-vector space formula_1 is also a formula_52-vector space. The dimensions are related by the formula\nformula_53\nIn particular, every complex vector space of dimension formula_54 is a real vector space of dimension formula_55\nSome formulae relate the dimension of a vector space with the cardinality of the base field and the cardinality of the space itself.\nIf formula_1 is a vector space over a field formula_4 and if the dimension of formula_1 is denoted by formula_59 then:\nIf dim formula_1 is finite then formula_61\nIf dim formula_1 is infinite then formula_63\nGeneralizations.\nA vector space can be seen as a particular case of a matroid, and in the latter there is a well-defined notion of dimension. The length of a module and the rank of an abelian group both have several properties similar to the dimension of vector spaces.\nThe Krull dimension of a commutative ring, named after Wolfgang Krull (1899\u20131971), is defined to be the maximal number of strict inclusions in an increasing chain of prime ideals in the ring.\nTrace.\nThe dimension of a vector space may alternatively be characterized as the trace of the identity operator. For instance, \nformula_64 \nThis appears to be a circular definition, but it allows useful generalizations.\nFirstly, it allows for a definition of a notion of dimension when one has a trace but no natural sense of basis. For example, one may have an algebra formula_65 with maps formula_66 (the inclusion of scalars, called the \"unit\") and a map formula_67 (corresponding to trace, called the \"counit\"). The composition formula_68 is a scalar (being a linear operator on a 1-dimensional space) corresponds to \"trace of identity\", and gives a notion of dimension for an abstract algebra. In practice, in bialgebras, this map is required to be the identity, which can be obtained by normalizing the counit by dividing by dimension (formula_69), so in these cases the normalizing constant corresponds to dimension.\nAlternatively, it may be possible to take the trace of operators on an infinite-dimensional space; in this case a (finite) trace is defined, even though no (finite) dimension exists, and gives a notion of \"dimension of the operator\". These fall under the rubric of \"trace class operators\" on a Hilbert space, or more generally nuclear operators on a Banach space.\nA subtler generalization is to consider the trace of a \"family\" of operators as a kind of \"twisted\" dimension. This occurs significantly in representation theory, where the character of a representation is the trace of the representation, hence a scalar-valued function on a group formula_70 whose value on the identity formula_71 is the dimension of the representation, as a representation sends the identity in the group to the identity matrix: formula_72 The other values formula_73 of the character can be viewed as \"twisted\" dimensions, and find analogs or generalizations of statements about dimensions to statements about characters or representations. A sophisticated example of this occurs in the theory of monstrous moonshine: the formula_74-invariant is the graded dimension of an infinite-dimensional graded representation of the monster group, and replacing the dimension with the character gives the McKay\u2013Thompson series for each element of the Monster group.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to extraction from tobacco, it is synthesized. Nicotine is used recreationally for its stimulant and anxiolytic effects. In tobacco leaves, nicotine constitutes about 0.6\u20133.0% of the dry weight, and smaller, trace quantities occur in other Solanaceae crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants. In pure form, nicotine is a colorless to yellowish, oily liquid that readily penetrates biological membranes and acts as a potent neurotoxin in insects, where it serves as a antiherbivore toxin. Historically, it was widely used as an insecticide, and its structure provided the basis for synthetic neonicotinoid pesticides.\nIn humans, nicotine acts primarily as a stimulant by binding to and activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. This results in the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine, producing effects including increased alertness, reduced anxiety, and mild euphoria. Nicotine is typically consumed through tobacco smoking, vaping, or other nicotine delivery systems. An average cigarette yields about 2\u00a0mg of absorbed nicotine, a dose sufficient to produce reinforcement and dependence while remaining far below toxic levels.\nNicotine is highly addictive, and nicotine dependence is characterized by tolerance, physical dependence, psychological dependence, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, including gums, patches, and lozenges, deliver the compound in slower, lower doses that are less addictive and are used medically to help people quit smoking. Synthetic derivatives of nicotine, such as varenicline, act as partial agonists at nicotinic receptors and are also used as smoking cessation aids.\nAlthough nicotine itself is not classified as a carcinogen by either the International Agency for Research on Cancer or the Surgeon General of the United States, high doses can cause nicotine poisoning and respiratory paralysis. Chronic exposure may also affect the immune, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Nicotine is also a known teratogen, associated with adverse developmental effects during pregnancy, and may impair adolescent neurodevelopment, though the extent of this effect in humans remains debated.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUses.\nMedical.\nThe primary therapeutic use of nicotine is treating nicotine dependence to eliminate smoking and the damage it does to health. Nicotine itself is not a standalone cessation tool; its efficacy in smoking cessation relies on nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) delivery systems, which vary formulations (e.g., transdermal patches and lozenges for steady release versus oral gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays for acute relief) to control and modify how much nicotine is delivered and absorbed, and to mimic tobacco pharmacokinetics without harmful byproducts.\nA 2018 Cochrane Collaboration review found high-quality evidence that all current forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, patch, lozenges, inhaler, and nasal spray) increase the chances of successfully quitting smoking by 50\u201360%, regardless of setting.\nCombining nicotine patch use with a faster acting nicotine replacement, like gum or spray, improves the odds of treatment success.\nIn contrast to recreational nicotine products, which have been designed to maximize the likelihood of addiction, nicotine replacement products (NRTs) are designed to minimize addictiveness. The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk.\nPesticide.\nNicotine has been used as an insecticide since at least 1690, in the form of tobacco extracts or as pure nicotine sulfate (although other components of tobacco also seem to have pesticide effects). It acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and gave the receptor its name. Nicotine is in IRAC group 4B. Nicotine insecticides have been banned in the US since 2014, including use on organic crops, and caution is recommended for small gardeners. Nicotine pesticides have been banned in the EU since 2009. Foods are imported from countries in which nicotine pesticides are allowed, such as China, but foods may not exceed maximum nicotine levels. Neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, which are derived from and structurally similar to nicotine, are widely used as agricultural and veterinary pesticides as of 2016.\nPerformance.\nNicotine-containing products are sometimes used for the performance-enhancing effects of nicotine on cognition. A 2010 meta-analysis of 41\u00a0double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concluded that nicotine or smoking had significant positive effects on aspects of fine motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. A 2015 review noted that stimulation of the \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor is responsible for certain improvements in attentional performance; among the nicotinic receptor subtypes, nicotine has the highest binding affinity at the \u03b14\u03b22 receptor (ki=1\u00a0nM), which is also the biological target that mediates nicotine's addictive properties. Nicotine has potential beneficial effects, but it also has paradoxical effects, which may be due to the inverted U-shape of the dose-response curve or pharmacokinetic features.\nRecreational.\nNicotine is used as a recreational drug. It is widely used, highly addictive and hard to discontinue. Nicotine is often used compulsively, and dependence can develop within days. Recreational drug users commonly use nicotine for its mood-altering effects. Recreational nicotine products include chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, snuff, pipe tobacco, snus, and nicotine pouches.\nAlcohol infused with nicotine is called nicotini.\nContraindications.\nNicotine use for tobacco cessation has few contraindications.\nIt is not known whether nicotine replacement therapy is effective for smoking cessation in adolescents, as of 2014. It is therefore not recommended to adolescents. It is not safe to use nicotine during pregnancy or breastfeeding, although it is safer than smoking. The desirability of NRT use in pregnancy is therefore debated.\nRandomized trials and observational studies of nicotine replacement therapy in cardiovascular patients show no increase in adverse cardiovascular events compared to those treated with placebo. Using nicotine products during cancer treatment may be contraindicated, as nicotine may promote tumour growth, but temporary use of NRTs to quit smoking may be advised for harm reduction.\nNicotine gum is contraindicated in individuals with temporomandibular joint disease. People with chronic nasal disorders and severe reactive airway disease require additional precautions when using nicotine nasal sprays. Nicotine in any form is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to nicotine.\nAdverse effects.\nNicotine is classified as a poison, and it is \"extremely hazardous\". The CDC says it is \"toxic to developing fetuses and is a health danger for pregnant women.\" It can harm brain development up to age twenty-five, and early use of nicotine can predispose young people to smoking and drug use. However, at doses typically used by consumers, it presents little if any hazard to adult users. Although at low amounts nicotine has a mild analgesic effect, at sufficiently high doses nicotine may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, bradycardia, and possibly seizures, hypoventilation, and death.\nSleep.\nNicotine reduces the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and total sleep time in healthy nonsmokers given nicotine via a transdermal patch, and the reduction is dose-dependent. Acute nicotine intoxication has been found to significantly reduce total sleep time and increase REM latency, sleep onset latency, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep time. Depressive non-smokers experience mood and sleep improvements under nicotine administration; however, subsequent nicotine withdrawal has a negative effect on both mood and sleep.\nCardiovascular system.\nNicotine exerts several significant effects on the cardiovascular system. Primarily, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of catecholamines. This activation results in an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as enhanced myocardial contractility, which raises the workload on the heart. Additionally, nicotine causes systemic vasoconstriction, including constriction of coronary arteries, which can reduce blood flow to the heart. Long-term exposure to nicotine may impair endothelial function, potentially contributing to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, nicotine has been associated with the development of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in individuals who already have underlying heart disease.\nThe effects of nicotine can be differentiated between short-term and long-term use. Short-term nicotine use, such as that associated with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation, appears to pose little cardiovascular risk, even for patients with known cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, longer-term nicotine use may not accelerate atherosclerosis but could contribute to acute cardiovascular events in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Many severe cardiovascular effects traditionally associated with smoking may not be solely attributable to nicotine itself. Cigarette smoke contains numerous other potentially cardiotoxic substances, including carbon monoxide and oxidant gases.\nA 2016 review of the cardiovascular toxicity of nicotine concluded, \"Based on current knowledge, we believe that the cardiovascular risks of nicotine from e-cigarette use in people without cardiovascular disease are quite low. We have concerns that nicotine from e-cigarettes could pose some risk for users with cardiovascular disease.\"\nA 2018 Cochrane review found that, in rare cases, nicotine replacement therapy can cause non-ischemic chest pain (i.e., chest pain that is unrelated to a heart attack) and heart palpitations, but does not increase the incidence of serious cardiac adverse events (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death) relative to controls.\nBlood pressure.\nIn the short term, nicotine causes a transient increase in blood pressure. Long term, epidemiological studies generally show increased blood pressure and hypertension among nicotine users.\nReinforcement disorders.\nNicotine is highly addictive but paradoxically has quite weak reinforcing property compared to other drugs of abuse in various animals. Its addictiveness depends on how it is administered and also depends upon form in which nicotine is used. Animal research suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors, acetaldehyde and other constituents in tobacco smoke may enhance its addictiveness. Nicotine dependence involves aspects of both psychological dependence and physical dependence, since discontinuation of extended use has been shown to produce both affective (e.g., anxiety, irritability, craving, anhedonia) and somatic (mild motor dysfunctions such as tremor) withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms peak in one to three days and can persist for several weeks. Even though other drugs of dependence can have withdrawal states lasting 6 months or longer, this does not appear to occur with cigarette withdrawal.\nNormal between-cigarettes discontinuation, in unrestricted smokers, causes mild but measurable nicotine withdrawal symptoms. These include mildly worse mood, stress, anxiety, cognition, and sleep, all of which briefly return to normal with the next cigarette. Smokers have a worse mood than they typically would have if they were not nicotine-dependent; they experience normal moods only immediately after smoking. Nicotine dependence is associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration among smokers.\nIn dependent smokers, withdrawal causes impairments in memory and attention, and smoking during withdrawal returns these cognitive abilities to pre-withdrawal levels. The temporarily increased cognitive levels of smokers after inhaling smoke are offset by periods of cognitive decline during nicotine withdrawal. Therefore, the overall daily cognitive levels of smokers and non-smokers are roughly similar.\nNicotine activates the mesolimbic pathway and induces long-term \u0394FosB expression (i.e., produces phosphorylated \u0394FosB isoforms) in the nucleus accumbens when inhaled or injected frequently or at high doses, but not necessarily when ingested. Consequently, high daily exposure (possibly excluding oral route) to nicotine can cause \u0394FosB overexpression in the nucleus accumbens, resulting in nicotine addiction.\nCancer.\nContrary to popular belief, nicotine itself does not cause cancer in humans, although it is unclear whether it functions as a tumor promoter as of 2012[ [update]]. A 2018 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concludes, \"\u2060[w]hile it is biologically plausible that nicotine can act as a tumor promoter, the existing body of evidence indicates this is unlikely to translate into increased risk of human cancer.\"\nAlthough nicotine is classified as a non-carcinogenic substance, it can still theoretically promote tumor growth and metastasis as evidenced from alterations. Nicotine induces several processes, some of them via nicotine's effects on immune function, that contribute to cancer progression in both smoking-related and non-smoking-related cancers, including cell cycle progression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis. These effects are primarily mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the \u03b17 subtype, and to a lesser extent, \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs). Activation of these receptors triggers several signaling cascades crucial in cancer biology, notably the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling.\nNicotine potentially promotes lung cancer development by enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) via nAChRs, which are present in lung cancer cells. Additionally, nicotine-induced EMT contributes to drug resistance in cancer cells.\nNicotine in tobacco can form carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines through a nitrosation reaction. This occurs mostly in the curing and processing of tobacco. However, nicotine in the mouth and stomach can react to form N-nitrosonornicotine, a known type 1 carcinogen, suggesting that consumption of non-tobacco forms of nicotine may still play a role in carcinogenesis.\nGenotoxicity.\nNicotine causes DNA damage in several types of human cells as judged by assays for genotoxicity such as the comet assay, cytokinesis-block micronucleus test and chromosome aberrations test. In humans, this damage can happen in primary parotid gland cells, lymphocytes, and respiratory tract cells.\nPregnancy and breastfeeding.\nNicotine has been shown to produce birth defects in some animal species, but not others; consequently, it is considered to be a possible teratogen in humans. In animal studies that resulted in birth defects, researchers found that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes; the negative effects on early brain development are associated with abnormalities in brain metabolism and neurotransmitter system function. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke.\nNicotine exposure \"in utero\" is responsible for several complications of pregnancy and birth: pregnant women who smoke are at greater risk for both miscarriage and stillbirth and infants exposed to nicotine \"in utero\" tend to have lower birth weights. A McMaster University research group observed in 2010 that rats exposed to nicotine in the womb (via parenteral infusion) later in life had conditions including type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility.\nOverdose.\nIt is unlikely that a person would overdose on nicotine through smoking alone. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2013 that there are no significant safety concerns associated with the use of more than one form of over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy at the same time, or using OTC NRT at the same time as another nicotine-containing product, like cigarettes. The median lethal dose of nicotine in humans is unknown. Nevertheless, nicotine has a relatively high toxicity in comparison to many other alkaloids such as caffeine, which has an LD50 of 127\u00a0mg/kg when administered to mice. At sufficiently high doses, it is associated with nicotine poisoning, which, while common in children (in whom poisonous and lethal levels occur at lower doses per kilogram of body weight) rarely results in significant morbidity or death. The estimated lower dose limit for fatal outcomes is 500\u20131,000\u00a0mg of ingested nicotine for an adult (6.5\u201313\u00a0mg/kg).\nThe initial symptoms of a nicotine overdose typically include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), tachypnea (rapid breathing), headache, dizziness, pallor (pale skin), auditory or visual disturbances, and perspiration, followed shortly after by marked bradycardia (slow heart rate), bradypnea (slow breathing), and hypotension (low blood pressure). An increased respiratory rate (i.e., tachypnea) is one of the primary signs of nicotine poisoning. At sufficiently high doses, somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness), confusion, syncope (loss of consciousness from fainting), shortness of breath, marked weakness, seizures, and coma may occur. Lethal nicotine poisoning rapidly produces seizures, and death\u00a0\u2013 which may occur within minutes\u00a0\u2013 is believed to be due to respiratory paralysis.\nToxicity.\nToday nicotine is less commonly used in agricultural insecticides, which was a main source of poisoning. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS), accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products, or ingestion of nicotine-containing plants. People who harvest or cultivate tobacco may experience GTS, a type of nicotine poisoning caused by dermal exposure to wet tobacco leaves. This occurs most commonly in young, inexperienced tobacco harvesters who do not consume tobacco. People can be exposed to nicotine in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nicotine exposure in the workplace as 0.5\u00a0mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5\u00a0mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At environmental levels of 5\u00a0mg/m3, nicotine is immediately dangerous to life and health.\nDrug interactions.\nPharmacokinetic.\nNicotine and cigarette smoke both induce the expression of liver enzymes (e.g., certain cytochrome P450 proteins) which metabolize drugs, leading to the potential for alterations in drug metabolism.\nPharmacology.\nPharmacodynamics.\nNicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChR\u03b19 and nAChR\u03b110) where it acts as a receptor antagonist. Such antagonism results in mild analgesia.\nThe stereochemistry of nicotine is crucial to its biological effects. Due to the chiral nature of its receptors in the body, the (S)-enantiomer is substantially more active. For this reason, nearly all pharmacological and toxicological data is based on studies of (S)-nicotine. (S)-Nicotine is 4\u201328 times more potent than (R)-nicotine in standard nicotinic receptor binding and functional assays and elicits stronger nasal irritation, stinging, and mucosal responses at lower detection thresholds\u2014yet smokers rated it as more pleasant in the only human sensory study. The pharmacological, metabolic, and toxicological effects of (R)-nicotine and of racemic (R)/(S)-nicotine mixtures in humans remain poorly understood, with data largely limited to animal studies.\nCentral nervous system.\nAcute effects on CNS.\nBy binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, nicotine elicits its psychoactive effects and increases the levels of several neurotransmitters in various brain structures\u00a0\u2013 acting as a sort of \"volume control\". Nicotine has a higher affinity for nicotinic receptors in the brain than those in skeletal muscle, though at toxic doses it can induce contractions and respiratory paralysis. Nicotine's selectivity is thought to be due to a particular amino acid difference on these receptor subtypes. Nicotine is unusual in comparison to most drugs, as its profile changes from stimulant to sedative with increasing dosages, a phenomenon known as \"Nesbitt's paradox\" after the doctor who first described it in 1969. At very high doses it dampens neuronal activity. Nicotine induces both behavioral stimulation and anxiety in animals. Research into nicotine's most predominant metabolite, cotinine, suggests that some of nicotine's psychoactive effects are mediated by cotinine.\nNicotine activates nicotinic receptors (particularly \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptors, but also \u03b15 nAChRs) on neurons that innervate the ventral tegmental area and within the mesolimbic pathway where it appears to cause the release of dopamine. This nicotine-induced dopamine release occurs at least partially through activation of the cholinergic\u2013dopaminergic reward link in the ventral tegmental area. Nicotine can modulate the firing rate of the ventral tegmental area neurons. These actions are largely responsible for the strongly reinforcing effects of nicotine, which often occur in the absence of euphoria; however, mild euphoria from nicotine use can occur in some individuals. \nLong-term effects on CNS.\nChronic exposure to nicotine induces several molecular changes in neuronal systems, particularly within the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and associated circuits. These adaptations include desensitization and upregulation of nAChRs and downregulation of related enzymes (e.g. class I and II histone deacetylases in the striatum), alterations in transcription factors, and modifications to dopamine synthesis and release.\nNicotine binds to presynaptic and postsynaptic nAChRs, leading to initial activation followed by desensitization\u2014a conformational shift rendering receptors temporarily unresponsive. Chronic nicotine exposure promotes upregulation of nAChRs in brain regions like the ventral tegmental area and striatum, with increased receptor density observed within 1\u20137 days and peaking after 10\u201314 days in rodent models. Human imaging studies show this upregulation is temporary and returns to baseline levels in nonsmokers by approximately 21 days after smoking cessation but full recovery taking 6-12 weeks.\nChronic nicotine use also leads to accumulation of the transcription factor \u0394FosB in dopamine D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens, a process implicated in sustained reward pathway modifications. This elevation is longer-lasting and persists \"for weeks and months even when substance use has ceased.\"\nAdditionally, positron emission tomography (PET) studies indicate reduced presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum of chronic smokers, as measured by 18F-DOPA uptake. This deficit, approximately 15\u201320% lower than in nonsmokers, normalizes after about 3 months of abstinence.\nA 2016 study found that nicotine exposure creates long-lasting malleable circuits 7 months after the initial exposure to nicotine and 6 months after stopping its administration. Other studies suggest broader neuronal recovery, such as normalization of dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in reward centers, may extend up to 12\u201314 months in some cases of substance dependence affecting dopamine levels, though specific data for nicotine are limited.\nSympathetic nervous system.\nNicotine also activates the sympathetic nervous system, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulating the release of epinephrine. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream.\nAdrenal medulla.\nBy binding to ganglion type nicotinic receptors in the adrenal medulla, nicotine increases flow of adrenaline (epinephrine), a stimulating hormone and neurotransmitter. By binding to the receptors, it causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and thus the release of epinephrine (and norepinephrine) into the bloodstream. The release of epinephrine (adrenaline) causes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and respiration, as well as higher blood glucose levels.\nPharmacokinetics.\nAs nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier reaching the brain within 10\u201320 seconds after inhalation. The elimination half-life of nicotine in the body is around two hours. Nicotine is primarily excreted in urine and urinary concentrations vary depending upon urine flow rate and urine pH.\nThe amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking can depend on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. However, it has been found that the nicotine yield of individual products has only a small effect (4.4%) on the blood concentration of nicotine, suggesting \"the assumed health advantage of switching to lower-tar and lower-nicotine cigarettes may be largely offset by the tendency of smokers to compensate by increasing inhalation\".\nCotinine is an active metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood with a half-life of 18\u201320\u00a0hours, making it easier to analyze due to longer half-life than that of nicotine itself.\nNicotine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6, and also by CYP2B6) and FMO3, which selectively metabolizes (\"S\")-nicotine. A major metabolite is cotinine. Other primary metabolites include nicotine \"N\"-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide. Under some conditions, other substances may be formed such as myosmine.\nGlucuronidation and oxidative metabolism of nicotine to cotinine are both inhibited by menthol, an additive to mentholated cigarettes, thus increasing the half-life of nicotine \"in vivo\".\nInfluence of ionization state.\nNicotine's absorption is modulated by its ionization state, governed by pH relative to pKa values (8.10 for pyrrolidine nitrogen, 3.41 for pyridine). At physiological pH (~7.4), it's mostly monoprotonated (cationic); above pH 8, it becomes unprotonated free-base, which is lipophilic and volatile. The distribution of nicotine among its free-base and protonated forms in aerosolised nicotine affects inhalability; it has been manipulated in tobacco smoke and now in electronic cigarettes by the use of acids to de-freebase nicotine and form 'nicotine salts'. Pod mod electronic cigarettes use nicotine in the form of a protonated nicotine, rather than free-base nicotine found in earlier generations.\nFree-base nicotine enables rapid membrane diffusion and higher bioavailability in early tobacco/oral studies. Yet, recent e-cigarette research contradicts this: protonated salts (e.g., nicotine benzoate, lactate, levulinate from acid addition) yield higher Cmax and faster onset than equivalent free-base. For example, 2% benzoate salt produced 3x higher Cmax in human puffing trials. Notably, Cmax of protonated nicotine salts appears independent of the composition and identity of the counter anions (e.g., benzoate, lactate, levulinate) forming the salts for higher administered nicotine formulations.\nThese effects stem from aerosol dynamics\u2014salts form low-volatility submicron particles for deeper lung deposition and less exhalation loss, versus free-base's superficial deposition. Sensorily, free-base delivers a harsh throat hit, while salts allow smoother high-dose inhalation, boosting appeal and intake.\nMetabolism.\nNicotine decreases hunger and as a consequence food consumption, alongside increasing energy expenditure. The majority of research shows that nicotine reduces body weight, but some researchers have found that nicotine may result in weight gain under specific types of eating habits in animal models. Nicotine effect on weight appears to result from nicotine's stimulation of \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR receptors located in the POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus and subsequently the melanocortin system, especially the melanocortin-4 receptors on second-order neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, thus modulating feeding inhibition. POMC neurons are a precursor of the melanocortin system, a critical regulator of body weight and peripheral tissue such as skin and hair.\nChemistry.\nNicotine is a very hygroscopic, colorless to pale yellow, oily liquid that gradually turns brown on exposure to air or light. It develops a characteristic pungent, fishy odor of pyridine and has an acrid burning taste. It is very soluble in alcohol, chloroform, ether, light petroleum, kerosene, or oils. It is miscible with water in its neutral amine base form between 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 210\u00a0\u00b0C. It is a dibasic nitrogenous base, having Kb1=1\u00d710\u22126, Kb2=1\u00d710\u221211. It readily forms ammonium salts with acids that are usually solid and water-soluble. Its flash point is 95\u00a0\u00b0C, and its auto-ignition temperature is 244\u00a0\u00b0C. Nicotine is volatile (vapor pressure 5.5 Pa at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) On exposure to ultraviolet light or various oxidizing agents, nicotine is converted to nicotine oxide, nicotinic acid (niacin, a B3 vitamer), and methylamine.\nAnabasine is a structural isomer of nicotine, as both compounds have the molecular formula .\nStereochemistry.\nNicotine has a chiral center at the C2' position of the pyrrolidine ring, and therefore exists as two enantiomers: (S)-nicotine and (R)-nicotine.\nThe salts of (S)-nicotine are usually dextrorotatory; this conversion between levorotatory and dextrorotatory upon protonation is common among alkaloids. The hydrochloride and sulfate salts become optically inactive if heated in a closed vessel above 180\u00a0\u00b0C. \nThe most common chemistry synthetic methods for generating nicotine yield a product that is approximately equal proportions of the S- and R-enantiomers. Tobacco-derived nicotine (&gt;99% (S)-enantiomer) is distinguishable from synthetic nicotine (typically racemic, 50:50 (S)/(R)) by enantiomeric ratio analysis, although strategies exist for adjusting the relative levels of the enantiomers or performing a synthesis that only leads to the pure S-enantiomer. Synthetic stereospecific (S)-nicotine has become available on the market to consumers of electronic cigarette products. Nicotine enantiomers differ in their biological effects on animals. \nPreparation.\nThe first laboratory preparation of nicotine (as its racemate) was described in 1904.\nThe starting material was an N-substituted pyrrole derivative, which was heated to convert it by a [1,5] sigmatropic shift to the isomer with a carbon bond between the pyrrole and pyridine rings, followed by methylation and selective reduction of the pyrrole ring using tin and hydrochloric acid. Many other syntheses of nicotine, in both racemic and chiral forms have since been published.\nBiosynthesis.\nThe biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that comprise nicotine. Metabolic studies show that the pyridine ring of nicotine is derived from nicotinic acid, while the pyrrolidine is derived from \"N\"-methyl-\u03941-pyrrollidium cation. Biosynthesis of the two component structures proceeds via two independent syntheses, the NAD pathway for nicotinic acid and the tropane pathway for \"N\"-methyl-\u03941-pyrrollidium cation.\nThe NAD pathway in the genus \"Nicotiana\" begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into \u03b1-amino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce nicotinic acid via the conversion of nicotinamide by the enzyme nicotinamidase.\nThe \"N\"-methyl-\u03941-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with decarboxylation of ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce putrescine. Putrescine is then converted into \"N\"-methyl putrescine via methylation by SAM catalyzed by putrescine \"N\"-methyltransferase (PMT). \"N\"-methyl putrescine then undergoes deamination into 4-methylaminobutanal by the \"N\"-methyl putrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into \"N\"-methyl-\u03941-pyrrollidium cation.\nThe final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between \"N\"-methyl-\u03941-pyrrollidium cation and nicotinic acid. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of nicotinic acid into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with \"N\"-methyl-\u03941-pyrrollidium cation to form enantiomerically pure (\u2212)-nicotine.\nDetection in body fluids.\nNicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids. Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs.\nMethods for analysis of enantiomers.\nMethods for measuring the two enantiomers are straightforward and include normal-phase liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography with a chiral column. However, since methods can be used to alter the two enantiomers, it may not be possible to distinguish tobacco-derived from synthetic nicotine simply by measuring the levels of the two enantiomers. A new approach uses hydrogen and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance to distinguish tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine based on differences the substrates used in the natural synthetic pathway performed in the tobacco plant and the substrates most used in synthesis. Another approach measures the carbon-14 content which also differs between natural and laboratory-based tobacco. These methods remain to be fully evaluated and validated using a wide range of samples.\nAnalogues and derivatives.\nAnalogues and derivatives of nicotine are known. These compounds, often structurally similar and sharing affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, have applications in pharmacology (e.g., smoking cessation), pest control, and neuroscience research (e.g., multiple domain cognitive enhancement, neuroprotection).\nNatural analogues.\nNatural analogues of nicotine, often found in plants or other biological sources, include anabasine (from Anabasis aphylla), anatabine (from tobacco), arecoline (from betel nut), cotinine (major metabolite of nicotine), cytisine (from Laburnum species), and epibatidine (from frog skin), among others.\nSynthetic analogues.\nSynthetic analogues and derivatives, typically developed for research or therapeutic purposes, include altinicline, 6-chloronicotine, dianicline, levamisole, RJR-2429, TC-1698, UB-165, GTS-21, and varenicline, among others.\nNatural occurrence.\nNicotine is a secondary metabolite produced in a variety of plants in the family Solanaceae, most notably in tobacco \"Nicotiana tabacum\", where it can be found at high concentrations of 0.5 to 7.5%. Nicotine is also present in other tobacco species, such as \"Nicotiana rustica\" (in amounts of 2\u201314%). Nicotine production is strongly induced in response to wounding as part of a jasmonate-dependent reaction. Specialist insects on tobacco, such as the tobacco hornworm (\"Manduca sexta\"), have a number of adaptations to the detoxification and even adaptive re-purposing of nicotine. Nicotine is also found at low concentrations in the nectar of tobacco plants, where it may promote outcrossing by affecting the behavior of hummingbird pollinators.\nNicotine occurs in smaller amounts (varying from 2\u20137\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, or 20\u201370 millionths of a percent wet weight) in other Solanaceaeous plants, including some crop species such as potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers, as well as non-crop species such as \"Duboisia hopwoodii\". The amounts of nicotine in tomatoes lowers substantially as the fruit ripens. A 1999 report found \"In some papers it is suggested that the contribution of dietary nicotine intake is significant when compared with exposure to ETS [environmental tobacco smoke] or by active smoking of small numbers of cigarettes. Others consider the dietary intake to be negligible unless inordinately large amounts of specific vegetables are consumed.\" The amount of nicotine eaten per day is roughly around 1.4 and 2.25\u00a0\u03bcg/day at the 95th percentile. These numbers may be low due to insufficient food intake data. The concentrations of nicotine in vegetables are difficult to measure accurately, since they are very low (parts per billion range). Pure nicotine tastes \"terrible\".\nHistory.\nNicotine was originally isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by chemists Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and Karl Ludwig Reimann from Germany, who believed it was a poison. Its chemical empirical formula was described by Melsens in 1843, its structure was discovered by Adolf Pinner and Richard Wolffenstein in 1893, and it was first synthesized by Am\u00e9 Pictet and A. Rotschy in 1904.\nNicotine is named after the tobacco plant \"Nicotiana tabacum,\" which in turn is named after the French ambassador in Portugal, Jean Nicot de Villemain, who sent tobacco and seeds to Paris in 1560, presented to the French King, and who promoted their medicinal use. Smoking was believed to protect against illness, particularly the plague. However, the \"holy herb\", tobacco, had first reached Europe by the early 1530s, brought by Spanish explorers.\nFollowing its introduction, tobacco rapidly gained popularity in Europe for its stimulating effects, fueled by nicotine's addictive and pharmacological properties and tobacco's widespread embrace as a cure-all. By the early 17th century, this allure fueled its mercilessly laborious cultivation as a cash crop in the Virginia colonies, where John Rolfe's introduction in 1612 rescued Jamestown from economic collapse and famine, transforming it into a prosperous export hub with over 20,000 pounds shipped by 1619 and laying the groundwork for transatlantic trade. From the 17th century onward, tobacco smoking became virtually central to European social, economic, and cultural history and beyond, entrenching itself in daily rituals, trade networks, and even international conflicts.\nBy the late 17th century, tobacco was used not only for smoking but also as an insecticide. After World War II, over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to mammals.\nThe nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has increased over time, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005.\nAlthough methods of production of synthetic nicotine have existed for decades, it was believed that the cost of making nicotine by laboratory synthesis was cost prohibitive compared to extracting nicotine from tobacco. However, recently synthetic nicotine started to be found in different brands of e-cigarettes and oral pouches and marketed as \"tobacco-free\".\nSociety and culture.\nRegulation.\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates nicotine as a tobacco product under the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The FDA is tasked with reviewing tobacco products such as e-cigarettes and determining which can be authorized for sale. \nIn March 2022, the US Congress passed a law (the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022) that expanded FDA's tobacco regulatory authority to include tobacco products containing nicotine from any source, thereby including products made with synthetic nicotine.\nOn January 17, 2025, the FDA proposed a strongly endorsed rule to reduce nicotine in cigarettes and certain combusted tobacco products to minimally or non-addictive levels, capping nicotine yield at 0.7 mg per gram of tobacco, approximately a 95% reduction from current commercial levels.\nIn the European Union, the Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU) regulates the manufacture, presentation, and sale of tobacco and related products.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 implemented the European directive 2014/40/EU, amended by Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. Additionally other regulations limit advertising, sale and display of tobacco products and other products containing nicotine for human consumption. The Sunak government proposed banning disposable vapes to limit their appeal and affordability for children and to reduce the amount of waste generated.\nAge limits on purchase.\nIn the United States, over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy products are only available to people aged 18 and above, and it is not for sale in vending machines or from any source where proof of age cannot be verified. The minimum age to purchase tobacco products in the US is 21 at the federal level.\nIn the European Union, the minimum age to purchase nicotine products is 18 in all member states except Latvia, where it is 20. However, there is no minimum age requirement to use tobacco or nicotine products.\nIn the United Kingdom, the minimum age to purchase tobacco products is 18.\nIn media.\nThe public's lack of understanding regarding nicotine's biological effects frequently results in inaccurate claims disseminated by the media and general public.\nIn some anti-smoking literature, the harm that tobacco smoking and nicotine addiction does is personified as Nick O'Teen, represented as a humanoid with some aspect of a cigarette or cigarette butt about him or his clothes and hat. Nick O'Teen was a villain that was created for the Health Education Council. The character was featured in three animated anti-smoking public service announcements in which he tries to get kids addicted to cigarettes before being foiled by the DC Comics character Superman.\nNicotine was often compared to caffeine in advertisements in the 1980s by the tobacco industry, and later in the 2010s by the electronic cigarettes industry, in an effort to reduce the stigmatization and the public perception of the risks associated with nicotine use.\nResearch.\nCentral nervous system.\nWhile acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of neuronal nicotinic receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitization of those receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with early research showing low dose nicotine patches could be an effective treatment of major depressive disorder in non-smokers. Nicotine anti-depressant effects have been documented in murine research.\nThough tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, there is evidence that nicotine itself has the potential to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.\nSmoking is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease; however, it is unknown whether this is due to people with healthier brain dopaminergic reward centers (the area of the brain affected by Parkinson's) being more likely to enjoy smoking and thus pick up the habit, nicotine directly acting as a neuroprotective agent, or other compounds in cigarette smoke acting as neuroprotective agents.\nNicotine may partly attenuate sensory gating and attentional deficits associated with schizophrenia. Short-term use of transdermal nicotine was found to improve subjects' reaction time and alertness in given tasks. Nicotine was not found to improve negative, positive, or other cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.\nNicotine dependence pathophysiology in heavy smokers suggests less efficient network architecture in the brain and disruptions in the topological organization of brain networks, with the altered brain network metrics correlated with the duration of cigarette use and the severity of nicotine dependence.\nSome long-term effects of nicotine may be irreversible because \"it is entirely possible that doses of nicotine achieved in the brains of human smokers can damage or kill mHb [medial habenula] neurons that regulate nicotine avoidance behaviors\", but more studies are needed to elucidate this underlying mechanism of nicotine-induced degeneration of the mHb-IPn circuit . \nImmune system.\nImmune cells of both the innate immune system and adaptive immune systems frequently express the \u03b12, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b17, \u03b19, and \u03b110 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Evidence suggests that nicotinic receptors which contain these subunits are involved in the regulation of immune function.\nAlthough some of its effects are pro-inflammatory (e.g., inducing prostaglandin E2 production), nicotine effects are mostly anti-inflammatory. Nicotine suppresses the innate and adaptive immune response by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22), reducing proliferation and activation of T-cells, and suppressing the activation of dendritic cells. As a result, cell-mediated immunity against infection and neoplastic diseases is downregulated. In vitro and animal studies also showed that nicotine reduces T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and suppresses the production and secretion of antibodies.\nNicotine effects on immune system function can aggravate tumors (growth and metastases) in cancer patients and is found to have many positive effects in the treating autoimmune disease (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease/ulcerative colitis, arthritis), requiring further studies.\nOptopharmacology.\nA photoactivatable form of nicotine, which releases nicotine when exposed to ultraviolet light with certain conditions, has been developed for studying nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in brain tissue.\nOral health.\nMany studies have shown the pro-inflammatory effect of nicotine on oral diseases. Nicotine promotes and aggravates some diseases such as periodontitis and gingivitis, especially when there are harmful microorganisms in the oral cavity, however, the data are insufficient, especially \"in vivo\". Understanding the potential role of nicotine in oral health has become increasingly important given the recent introduction of novel nicotine products and their potential role in helping smokers quit.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38273", "revid": "96647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38273", "title": "Turbo Pascal", "text": "Computer programming language\nTurbo Pascal is a software development system that includes a compiler and an integrated development environment (IDE) for the programming language Pascal running on the operating systems CP/M, CP/M-86, and MS-DOS. It was originally developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Borland, and was notable for its very fast compiling. Turbo Pascal, and the later but similar Turbo C, made Borland a leader in PC-based development tools.\nFor versions 6 and 7 (the last two versions), both a lower-priced Turbo Pascal and more expensive Borland Pascal were produced; Borland Pascal was oriented more toward professional software development, with more libraries and standard library source code. The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland's dialect of the language Pascal, significantly different from Standard Pascal.\nBorland has released three old versions of Turbo Pascal free of charge because of their historical interest: the original Turbo Pascal (now known as 1.0), and versions 3.02 and 5.5 for DOS, while Borland's French office released version 7.01 on its FTP. \nHistory.\nPhilippe Kahn first saw an opportunity for Borland, his newly formed software company, in the field of programming tools. Historically, the vast majority of programmers saw their workflow in terms of the edit/compile/link cycle, with separate tools dedicated to each task. Programmers wrote source code using a text editor; the source code was then compiled into object code (often requiring multiple passes), and a linker combined object code with runtime libraries to produce an executable program.\nIn the early IBM PC market (1981\u20131983) the major programming tool vendors all made compilers that worked in a similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system consisted of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for secondary storage, even though programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later integrated development environment (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like profilers ran into the hundreds of dollars.\nKahn's idea was to package all these functions in an integrated programming toolkit designed to have much better performance and resource utilization than the usual professional development tools, and charge a low price for a package integrating a custom text editor, compiler, and all functionality needed to produce executable programs. The program was sold by direct mail order for US$, without going through established sales channels (retailers or resellers).\nThe Turbo Pascal compiler was based on the Blue Label Pascal compiler originally produced for the NasSys cassette-based operating system of the Nascom microcomputer in 1981 by Anders Hejlsberg. Borland licensed Hejlsberg's \"PolyPascal\" compiler core (\"Poly Data\" was the name of Hejlsberg's company in Denmark), and added the user interface and editor. Anders Hejlsberg joined the company as an employee and was the architect for all versions of the Turbo Pascal compiler and the first three versions of Borland Delphi.\nThe compiler was first released as Compas Pascal for CP/M, and then released on 20 November 1983 as Turbo Pascal for CP/M (including the Apple II fitted with a Z-80 SoftCard, effectively converting the 6502-based Apple into a CP/M machine, the Commodore 64 with CP/M cartridge, and the later DEC Rainbow), CP/M-86, and DOS machines. On its launch in the United States market, Turbo Pascal retailed for US$, a very low price for a compiler at the time. The integrated Pascal compiler was of good quality compared to other Pascal products of the time.\nThe Turbo name alluded to the speed of compiling and of the executables produced. The edit/compile/run cycle was fast compared to other Pascal implementations because everything related to building the program was stored in RAM, and because it was a one-pass compiler written in assembly language. Compiling was much faster than compilers for other languages (even Borland's own later compilers for C), and other Pascal compilers, and programmer time was also saved since the program could be compiled and run from the IDE. The execution speed of these COM-format programs was a revelation for developers whose only prior experience programming microcomputers was with interpreted BASIC or UCSD Pascal, which compiled to p-code which was then interpreted at runtime.\nUnlike some other development tools, Turbo Pascal disks had no copy protection. Turbo Pascal came with the \"Book License\": \"You must treat this software \"just like a book\" ... [it] may be used by any number of people ... may be freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one location while it's being used at another.\"\nReception.\nBorland sold about 250,000 copies of Turbo Pascal in two years, which Bruce F. Webster of \"Byte\" described as \"an amazing figure for a computer language\". He reported six months later that the figure had risen to \"more than 400,000 copies in a marketplace that had been estimated as having only 30,000 potential buyers\".\nJerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine in February 1984 that Turbo Pascal \"comes close to what I think the computer industry is headed for: well documented, standard, plenty of good features, and a reasonable price\". He disliked the requirement to buy another license to distribute binaries, but noted that \"it turns out not to be a lot more. Borland only wants another $\" atop the $ base price, and that \"my first impression of Turbo is that it's probably worth $. It looks to do everything MT+ \"with the Speed Programming Package\" does, and maybe even do it faster and better\". Pournelle reported in July that Turbo 2.0's overlays \"[allow] you to write big programs\". According to Kahn, IBM had refused to resell Turbo Pascal unless the price was at least $; Pournelle noted that \"Turbo is much better than the Pascal IBM sells\", and unlike the latter was compatible with the IBM PCjr. Three \"Byte\" reviewers praised Turbo Pascal in the same issue. One reviewer said that because of dialect differences \"Turbo is not really Pascal. But it's very useful\". While cautioning that it was not suitable for developing very large applications, he concluded that Turbo Pascal \"is well written, fun to use at times, and fast enough to make up for its few shortcomings ... it is a bargain that shouldn't be passed up\". A second called the DOS version \"without doubt, the best software value I have ever purchased\", while a third said that Borland \"deserves praise for\" the \"high-value\" CP/M version.\nAlso in July 1984, \"Creative Computing\" favorably compared Turbo Pascal to what the reviewer described as mediocre and expensive Pascals from UCSD, IBM, and Microsoft. He reported converting code written in IBM Pascal in less than 30 minutes, and that \"under IBM Pascal, the average program took two weeks to write. With Turbo Pascal, the average is now two days\". While noting the .COM and 64 KB limitations, the reviewer approved of Turbo's close adherence to the Jensen and Wirth language standard. The documentation was, he wrote, of \"above average readability\" and superior to IBM Pascal's. \"My only fear\", the review concluded, was that \"it is grossly underpriced, and I worry that people might fail to take it seriously\". \"Turbo Pascal is the Pascal to acquire\", \"Computer Language\" in September said of version 2.0. Praising its speed, extensions including PC graphics and sound, documentation, ease of using overlays, and \"highly standard syntax\", the magazine recommended Turbo to both new and experienced programmers. \"PC Magazine\" was similarly complimentary in November, stating that \"nothing like Turbo Pascal has ever existed for PC-DOS before\". It praised 2.0's low price, speed, stability, ease of implementing overlays, and unusually good documentation for a compiler, and noted the existence of many utilities for Turbo Pascal from other companies. The review stated that the IDE that simplified the edit-compile-run-debug loop made Turbo Pascal accessible, like BASIC, to new programmers. \nPournelle in August 1985 called version 3.0 \"a distinct improvement on the already impressive version 2\" and said that the new book license \"seems quite fair to me\". He said that \"Turbo Pascal has got to be the best value in languages on the market today\", and that Borland led the industry in \"delivering excellent products at reasonable costs\". Webster also praised 3.0, stating in August 1985 that Turbo Pascal \"is best known for its small size, incredible compile speeds, and fast execution times\". He noted that the software's quality and low price was especially surprising after the \"JRT Pascal fiasco\", and stated that even at the new higher $ price, it was \"probably still the best software deal on the market\". Despite finding what the magazine called \"a serious bug\" in 3.0, and decreased compatibility with PC clones, \"Byte\" in February 1986 stated that \"it is hard to avoid recommending Turbo to anyone who wants to program in Pascal\", citing improved speed and graphic routines. When reviewing four other Pascal compilers in December 1986, the magazine described Turbo Pascal 3.0 as \"practical and attractive to programmers at all levels of expertise\".\nBesides allowing applications larger than 64 KB, \"Byte\" in 1988 reported substantially faster compiling and executing for version 4.0, and that although it did not maintain previous versions' \"almost total\" backward compatibility, conversion was fast and easy. The reviewer concluded, \"I highly recommend Turbo Pascal 4.0 as an addition to any programmer's software repertoire\".\n\"Byte\" in 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the Byte Awards. Citing their user interface and continued emphasis on speed, the magazine stated that \"for rapid prototyping there's not much better\". In the same issue Pournelle again praised version 4.0 and 5.0 of Turbo Pascal. Citing \"Anacreon\" as \"a good example of how complex a program you can write in Pascal\", and the many libraries from Borland and other developers, he wrote \"I think it may well be the language for the rest of us\".\nScott MacGregor of Microsoft said that Bill Gates \"couldn't understand why our stuff was so slow\" compared to Turbo Pascal. \"He would bring in poor Greg Whitten [programming director of Microsoft languages] and yell at him for half an hour\" because their company was unable to defeat Kahn's small startup, MacGregor recalled.\nSuccessors.\nBy 1995 Borland had dropped Turbo/Borland Pascal and replaced it with the rapid application development (RAD) environment Borland Delphi, based on Object Pascal. The 32- and 64-bit Delphi versions still support the more portable Pascal enhancements of the earlier products (i.e., those not specific to 16-bit code) including the earlier static object model. This language backwards compatibility means much old Turbo Pascal code can still be compiled and run in a modern environment today.\nOther suppliers have produced software development tools compatible with Turbo Pascal. The best-known are Free Pascal and Virtual Pascal.\nFeatures.\nAssembly language.\nWhile all versions of Turbo Pascal could include inline machine code, starting with version 6 it was possible to integrate assembly language within Pascal source code.\nSupport for the various x86 memory models was provided by inline assembly, compiler options, and language extensions such as the \"absolute\" keyword. The Turbo Assembler, TASM, a standard x86 assembler independent of TP, and source-compatible with the widely used Microsoft Macro Assembler MASM, was supplied with the enhanced \"Borland Pascal\" versions.\nDebugging and profiling.\nThe IDE provided several debugging facilities, including single stepping, examination and changing of variables, and conditional breakpoints. In later versions assembly-language blocks could be stepped through. The user could add breakpoints on variables and registers in an IDE window. Programs using IBM PC graphics mode could flip between graphics and text mode automatically or manually, or display both on two screens. For cases where the relatively simple debugging facilities of the IDE were insufficient, Turbopower Software produced a more powerful debugger, T-Debug. The same company produced Turbo Analyst and Overlay Manager for Turbo Pascal. T-Debug was later updated for Turbo Pascal 4, but discontinued with the release of Borland's Turbo Debugger (TD), which also allowed some hardware intervention on computers equipped with the new 80386 processor.\nTD was usually supplied in conjunction with the Turbo Assembler and the Turbo Profiler, a code profiler that reported on the time spent in each part of the program to assist program optimisation by finding bottlenecks. The books included with Borland Pascal had detailed descriptions of the Intel assembler language, including the number of clock cycles required by each instruction. Development and debugging could be carried out entirely within the IDE unless the advanced debugging facilities of Turbopower T-Debug, and later TD, were required.\nLater versions also supported remote debugging via an RS-232 communication cable.\nUnits.\nOver the years, Borland enhanced not only the IDE, but also extended the programming language. A development system based on ISO standard Pascal requires implementation-specific extensions for the development of real-world applications on the platforms they target. Standard Pascal is designed to be platform-independent, so prescribes no low-level access to hardware- or operating system-dependent facilities. Standard Pascal also does not prescribe how a large program should be split into separate compiling units. From version 4, Turbo Pascal adopted the concept of \"units\" from UCSD Pascal. Units were used as external function libraries, like the object files used in other languages such as FORTRAN or C.\nFor example, the line codice_1 in a program included the unit called crt; the codice_2 is the mechanism for using other compiling units. codice_3 and codice_4 were the keywords used to specify, within the unit, what was (and what was not) visible outside the unit. This is similar to the codice_5 and codice_6 keywords in other languages such as C++ and Java.\nUnits in Borland's Pascal were similar to Modula-2's separate compiling system. In 1987, when Turbo Pascal 4 was released, Modula-2 was making inroads as an educational language which could replace Pascal. Borland, in fact, had a Turbo Modula-2 compiler, but only released it on CP/M (its user interface was almost identical to that of Turbo Pascal 1\u20133) with little marketing. A much improved DOS version was developed, but as Borland was unwilling to publish the results, the authors including Niels Jensen bought the rights and formed Jensen &amp; Partners International to publish it as JPI TopSpeed Modula-2. Instead Borland chose to implement separate compiling in their established Pascal product.\nSeparate compiling was not part of the standard Pascal language, but was already available in UCSD Pascal, which was very popular on 8-bit machines. Turbo Pascal syntax for units appears to have been borrowed from UCSD Pascal. Earlier versions of Turbo Pascal, designed for computers with limited resources, supported a \"chain and execute\" system of dynamic linking for separately compiled objects, similar to the system widely used in BASIC. Also, the language had a statement to include separate source code in a program when necessary, and overlaying was supported from TP3, but, as with overlays, chained objects had to fit into the original (limited) program memory space. As computing and storage facilities advanced, the ability to generate large EXE files was added to Turbo Pascal, with the ability to statically link and collectively load separately compiled objects.\nThe .TPU files output by compiling a Turbo Pascal unit are tightly linked to the internal structures of the compiler, rather than standard .OBJ linkable files. This improved compiling and linking times, but meant that .TPU files could not be linked with the output of other languages or even used with different releases of Turbo Pascal unless recompiled from source.\nObject-oriented programming.\nFrom version 5.5 some object-oriented programming features were introduced: classes, inheritance, constructors and destructors. The IDE was already augmented with an object browser interface showing relations between objects and methods and allowing programmers to navigate the modules easily. Borland called its language \"Object Pascal\", which was greatly extended to become the language underlying Delphi (which has two separate OOP systems).\nThe name \"Object Pascal\" originated with the Pascal extensions developed by Apple Computer to program its Lisa and Macintosh computers. Pascal originator Niklaus Wirth consulted in developing these extensions, which built upon the record type already present in Pascal.\nIssue with CRT unit on fast processors.\nSeveral versions of Turbo Pascal, including the last version 7, include a unit named CRT, which was used by many fullscreen text-mode applications on a CRT. This unit contains code in its initialization section to determine the CPU speed and calibrate delay loops. This code fails on processors with a speed greater than about 200\u00a0MHz and aborts immediately with a \"Runtime Error 200\" message. (the error code 200 had nothing to do with the CPU speed 200\u00a0MHz). This is caused because a loop runs to count the number of times it can iterate in a fixed time, as measured by the real-time clock. When Turbo Pascal was developed it ran on machines with CPUs running at 2.5 to 8\u00a0MHz, and little thought was given to the possibility of vastly higher speeds, so from about 200\u00a0MHz enough iterations can be run to overflow the 16-bit counter. A patch was produced when machines became too fast for the original method, but failed as processor speeds increased yet further, and was superseded by others.\nPrograms subject to this error can be recompiled from source code with a compiler patched to eliminate the error (using a TURBO.TPL compiled with a corrected CRT unit) or, if source code is unavailable, executables can be patched by a tool named TPPATCH or equivalent, or by loading a terminate-and-stay-resident program before running the faulty program.\nThere are also patches to the TP7 compiler, thus if the Pascal source is available, a new compiling's code will work without the compiled code needing a patch. If the source code is available, porting to libraries without CPU clock speed dependency is a solution too.\nFloating-point arithmetic.\nThere were several floating point types, including codice_7 (the 4-byte [IEEE 754] representation) codice_8 (the 8-byte IEEE 754 representation), codice_9 (a 10-byte IEEE 754 representation used mostly internally by numeric coprocessors) and codice_10 (a 6-byte representation).\nIn the early days, codice_10 was the most popular. Most PCs of the era did not have a floating-point coprocessor so all floating-point arithmetic had to be done in software. Borland's own floating-point algorithms on codice_10 were quicker than using the other types, though its library also emulated the other types in software.\nVersions.\nCP/M and DOS versions.\nVersion 1.\nVersion 1, released on 20 November 1983, was a basic all-in-one system, working in memory and producing .COM executable files for DOS and CP/M, and equivalent .CMD executables for CP/M-86 (totally different from .CMD batch files later used in 32-bit Microsoft Windows). Source code files were limited to 64\u00a0KB to simplify the IDE, and DOS .COM files were limited to 64\u00a0KB each of code, stack and global (static) variables. Program source code could be extended by using the include facility if the source code exceeded the memory limit of the editor.\nThere were different versions of Turbo Pascal for computers running DOS, CP/M, or CP/M-86 with 64\u00a0KB of memory and at least one floppy disk drive. The CP/M version could run on the many CP/M machines of the time with Z80 processors, or an Apple II with Z80 card. The DOS and CP/M-86 versions ran on the many 8086 and 8088 machines which became available, including the IBM PC. The installer, lister, and compiler with its IDE, and the source code for a simple spreadsheet program called MicroCalc written by Philippe Kahn as a demonstration, would fit on a single floppy disc. A disc copy without MicroCalc would accommodate the source code and compiled executable of a reasonable-sized program\u2014as it was common at the time for users to have only a single floppy drive as mass storage, it was a great convenience to be able to fit both the compiler and the program being written on a single disc, avoiding endless disc swapping.\nThe architecture of the various machines running MS-DOS additionally limited the maximum user memory to under 1\u00a0MB (e.g., machines hardware-compatible with the IBM PC were limited to 640\u00a0KB).\nThe Turbo Pascal IDE was very advanced for its day. It was able to perform well and compile very fast with the amount of RAM on a typical home computer. The IDE was simple and intuitive to use, and had a well-organized system of menus. Early versions of the editor used WordStar key functions, which was the de facto standard at the time. Later versions of the IDE, designed for PCs with more disk space and memory, could display the definitions of the keywords of the language by putting the cursor over a keyword and pressing the F1 key (conventionally used to display help). Many definitions included example code.\nIn addition to standard executable programs, the compiler could generate terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, small utilities that stayed in memory and let the computer do other tasks\u2014running several programs at the same time, multitasking, was not otherwise available. Borland produced a small application suite called Sidekick that was a TSR letting the user keep a diary, notes, and so forth.\nVersion 2.\nVersion 2, released a few months later on 17 April 1984, was an incremental improvement to the original Turbo Pascal, to the point that the reference manual was at first identical to version 1's, down to having 1983 as the copyright date on some of the compiler's sample output, but had a separate \"Addendum to Reference Manual: Version 2.0 and 8087 Supplement\" manual with separate page numbering. Additions included an overlay system, where separate overlay procedures would be automatically swapped from disk into a reserved space in memory. This memory was part of the 64kB RAM used by the program's code, and was automatically the size of the largest overlay procedure. Overlay procedures could include overlay sections themselves, but unless a RAM disk was used, the resulting disk swapping could be slow. 2.0 also added the Dispose procedure to manage the heap, allowing individual dynamic variables to be freed, as an alternative to the more primitive 'Mark/Release' system and increased compatibility with WordStar commands plus use of the numeric keypad on the IBM PC and compatibles. Such PCs also had new text window and CGA graphics mode commands as well as being able to use the PC's speaker for tones. Finally, DOS and CP/M-86 machines with an 8087 maths coprocessor (or later compatible) had an alternative TURBO-87 compiler available to purchase. It supported the 8087's \"long real\" data types with a range of 1.67E-307 to 1.67E+308 to 14 significant figure precision but with a much greater processing speed. The manual notes that although source code for the Turbo Pascal's software real data types offering a range of 1E-63 to 1E+63 to 11 significant figures, these were incompatible at a binary level: as well as having a much larger range, the software reals took six bytes in memory and the 8087 ones were eight.\nVersion 2 for CP/M-80 only runs on Z80-based CP/M machines.\nVersion 3.\nVersion 3 was released on 17 September 1986. Turbo Pascal 3 supported turtle graphics. In addition to the default software real numbers and 8087 edition of the compiler, Borland also offered a binary-coded decimal (BCD) version (TURBOBCD) which offered the same numeric range as real data types but to 18 significant figures.\nDOS versions.\nVersion 4.\nReleased on 20 November 1987, Version 4 was a total rewrite, with both look and feel and internal operation much changed. The compiler generated executables in .EXE format under DOS, rather than the simpler but more restricted .COM executables. The by-then obsolete CP/M and CP/M-86 operating system versions were dropped when Turbo Pascal was rewritten. Version 4 introduced units, and a full-screen text user interface with pull-down menus; earlier versions had a text-based menu screen and a separate full-screen editor. (Microsoft Windows was still very experimental when the first version was released, and even mice were rare.) An add-on package, the Turbo Pascal Graphix Toolbox, was available for Turbo Pascal V4.\nVersion 5.0.\nColour displays were replacing monochrome; Turbo Pascal version 5.0, released 24 August 1988, introduced blue as the editor's default background color, used by Borland's DOS compilers until the end of this product line in the mid-1990s. It also added debugger support for breakpoints and watches. Later versions came in two packages with the same version number: a less expensive \"Turbo\" package, and a \"Borland\" package with enhanced capabilities and more add-ons.\nVersion 5.5.\nThis version, released on 2 May 1989, introduced object-oriented programming features for the Pascal language, including concept of classes, static and dynamic objects, constructors and destructors and inheritance, which would become the basis for the Object Pascal found in Borland Delphi. The IDE uses the default blue colour scheme that would also be used on later Borland Turbo products. Other changes to IDE include the addition context-sensitive help with description of all built-in functions, and the ability to copy code fragments from the help to edit window.\nVersion 6.0.\nVersion 6 was released on 23 October 1990. Changes from 5.5 include: the addition of inline assembly, the addition of the Turbo Vision library, mouse support, clipboard for text manipulations, multiple document interface supporting up to nine edit windows.\nVersion 7.0.\nVersion 7 was released on 27 October 1992. Changes from 6.0 include support for the creation of DOS and Windows executables and Windows DLLs, and syntax highlighting.\nTurbo Pascal for Windows.\nTwo versions named \"Turbo Pascal for Windows\" (TPW), for Windows 3.x, were released: TPW 1.0, based on Turbo Pascal 6 but released about 2 years later, and 1.5, released after Turbo Pascal 7; they were succeeded by Borland Pascal 7, which had Windows support. The Windows compiler in Pascal 7 was titled \"Borland Pascal for Windows\".\nBoth versions built Windows-compatible programs, and featured a Windows-based IDE, as opposed to the DOS-based IDE in Turbo Pascal. The IDE and editor commands conformed to the Microsoft Windows user interface guidelines instead of the classic TP user interface. The support for Windows programs required the Object Windows Library (OWL), similar but not identical to that for the first release of Borland C++, and radically different from the earlier DOS Turbo Vision environment. Turbo Pascal was superseded for the Windows platform by Delphi; the Delphi compiler can produce console programs and graphical user interface (GUI) applications, so that using Turbo and Borland Pascal became unnecessary.\nTurbo Pascal for Macintosh.\nBorland released \"Turbo Pascal for Macintosh\" in 1986. Much like versions 1 to 3 for other operating systems, it was written in compact assembly language and had a very powerful IDE, but no good debugger. Borland did not support this product very well, although they issued a version 1.1, patched to run on the 32-bit Macintosh II. Macintosh support was dropped soon after.\nFreeware releases.\nBorland released several versions of Turbo Pascal as freeware after they became \"antique software\", with 1.0 for DOS on 1 February 2000, 3.02 on 10 February 2000, 5.5 on 21 February 2002, Turbo Pascal 7.01 French version in year 2000. Most of the downloads are still available on the successor website of Embarcadero Technologies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton South West for the Conservative Party from 1950 to February 1974 and the MP for South Down for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from October 1974 to 1987. He was Minister of Health from 1960 to 1963 in the second Macmillan ministry and was Shadow Secretary of State for Defence from 1965 to 1968 in the Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath. \nBefore entering politics, Powell was a classical scholar; in 1937 he was appointed Professor of Greek at the University of Sydney, aged only 25. He served in the British Army during the Second World War, reaching the rank of brigadier. He wrote both poetry and books on classical and political subjects. He is remembered particularly for his views on immigration and demographic change. In 1968 Powell attracted attention nationwide for his \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, in which he criticised immigration to Britain, especially the rapid influx from the Commonwealth of Nations (former colonies of the British Empire) in the post-war era. He opposed the Race Relations Bill, a major anti-discrimination bill which ultimately became law. His speech was criticised by some of his own party members and \"The Times\" as racialist. Heath, who was then the leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of the Opposition, dismissed Powell from the Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech. In the aftermath several polls suggested that between 67 and 82 per cent of the British population agreed with Powell. \nPowell turned his back on the Conservatives and endorsed a vote for the Labour Party, which returned as a minority government at the February 1974 general election. Powell was returned to the House of Commons in October 1974 as the Ulster Unionist Party MP for the constituency of South Down in Northern Ireland. He represented it until he was defeated at the 1987 general election. Powell died in 1998 aged 85 and remains a divisive and controversial figure in Britain.\nEarly years.\nJohn Enoch Powell was born on 16 June 1912 in Stechford, within the city of Birmingham, and was baptised at the St Nicholas's Church in Newport, Shropshire, where his parents had married in 1909. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell, a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary Ellen (who was the daughter of Henry Breese, a Liverpool policeman, and his wife Eliza, who had been a teacher). His mother did not like his name and as a child he was known as \"Jack\". At the age of three, Powell was nicknamed \"the Professor\" because he used to stand on a chair and describe the stuffed birds that his grandfather had shot, which were displayed in his parents' home. In 1918 the family moved to Kings Norton, where Powell remained until he went up to the University of Cambridge in 1930.\nThe Powells were of Welsh descent and from Radnorshire (a Welsh border county), having moved to the developing Black Country during the early 19th century. Enoch's great-grandfather was a coal-miner and his grandfather had been in the iron trade.\nPowell read avidly from a young age; as early as three, he could \"read reasonably well\". Though not wealthy, the Powells were financially comfortable and their home included a library. By the age of six, Powell loved to read. Every Sunday he would give lectures to his parents on the books that he had read and also conducted evensong and preached a sermon. Once he was old enough to go out on his own, Powell would walk around rural Worcestershire with the aid of Ordnance Survey maps, which instilled in him a love for landscape and cartography.\nEducation.\nPowell attended a dame school until he was eleven. He was then a pupil for three years at King's Norton Grammar School for Boys before he won a scholarship to King Edward's School in Birmingham in 1925, aged 13. The legacy of the First World War loomed large for Powell; almost all his teachers had fought in the war. He formed the view that Britain and Germany would fight again.\nPowell's mother began teaching him Greek in the two weeks of Christmas break in 1925. By the time he started the next term, he had attained a level in Greek that most pupils would reach after two years. Within two terms, Powell was top of the classics form.\nPrecociously, Powell won all three of the school's classics prizes and would win more later in his school career. In the fifth form he began to translate Herodotus's \"Histories\". He entered the sixth form two years before his classmates and was remembered as a hard-working student. Powell also won a medal in gymnastics and gained a proficiency in the clarinet. He contemplated studying at the Royal Academy of Music, but his parents persuaded him to try for a scholarship at Cambridge.\nIt was during his time in the sixth form that Powell learned German. He was influenced by reading James George Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\" and Thomas Carlyle's \"Sartor Resartus\", which led him towards the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche.\nAged 17 Powell sat the classics scholarship paper at Trinity College, Cambridge, and won the top award. \nPowell studied at Trinity from 1930 to 1933. He became almost a recluse and devoted his time to studying. The British literary magazine Granta called him \"The Hermit of Trinity\". At the age of 18 his first paper to a classical journal was published (in German) in the \"Philologische Wochenschrift\", on a line of Herodotus. While studying at Cambridge, Powell became aware that there was another classicist who signed his name as \"John U. Powell\". Powell decided to use his middle name and began referring to himself as \"Enoch Powell\". Powell won the Craven scholarship at the beginning of his second term in 1931. It was at Cambridge that Powell fell under the influence of the poet A. E. Housman, then Professor of Latin at the university.\nAt Cambridge, Powell won a number of prizes, including the Percy Pemberton Prize, the Porson Prize, the Yeats Prize and the Lees Knowles, the Members' prize for Latin prose, the Browne Medal, the First Chancellor's Classical Medal and the Cromer Greek essay prize of the British Academy.\nPowell took a course in Urdu at the School of Oriental Studies (now SOAS, University of London), because he felt that his long-cherished ambition of becoming Viceroy of India would be unattainable without knowledge of an Indian language. Later, during his political career, he would speak to his Indian-born constituents in Urdu. Powell went on to learn other languages, such as Welsh, modern Greek and Portuguese.\nAcademic career.\nAfter graduating from Cambridge, Powell stayed on at Trinity College as a fellow, spending much of his time studying ancient manuscripts in Latin and producing academic works in Greek and Welsh. He won the Craven travelling scholarship, which he used to fund travels to Italy, where he researched Greek manuscripts. He also learned Italian. Powell was still convinced of the inevitability of war with Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933: he told his father in 1934, \"I want to be in the army from the first day that Britain goes to war\". He suffered a spiritual crisis when he heard of the Night of the Long Knives in July 1934, which shattered his vision of German culture.\nPowell spent his time at Trinity teaching and supervising undergraduates and worked on a lexicon of Herodotus. Since 1932, Powell had been working on the Egyptian manuscripts of J. Rendel Harris and his translation from Greek into English was published in 1937.\nPowell published the collection \"First Poems\" in 1937, which was influenced by Housman. His second volume of poems, \"Casting Off, and Other Poems\", was printed in 1939. A further collection of poems, \"Dancer's End\" and \"The Wedding Gift\", were published in 1951. A full collection of poems was published in one volume in 1990.\nIn 1937 he was appointed Professor of Greek at the University of Sydney, aged 25, (failing in his aim of beating Nietzsche's record of becoming a professor at 24). He was the youngest professor in the British Empire. He revised Henry Stuart Jones's edition of Thucydides' \"Historiae\" for the Oxford University Press in 1938. His most lasting contribution to classical scholarship was his \"Lexicon to Herodotus\", published by Cambridge University Press the same year, which was well received by critics.\nSoon after his arrival in Australia, he was appointed Curator of the Nicholson Museum at the University of Sydney. He informed the vice-chancellor that war would soon begin in Europe and that when it did, he would be heading home to enlist in the army. In his inaugural lecture as professor of Greek in May 1938, he condemned Britain's policy of appeasement. At the outbreak of war, Powell immediately returned to England.\nMilitary service.\nIn October 1939 Powell enlisted as a private in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He had trouble enlisting, as during the \"Phoney War\" the War Office did not want men with no military training. Rather than waiting to be called up, he claimed to be Australian, as Australians (many of whom had travelled to Britain to join up) were allowed to enlist straight away. He was promoted from private to lance-corporal and completed officer training. He told colleagues that he expected to be at least a major-general by the end of the war.\nOn 18 May 1940 Powell was commissioned as a second lieutenant onto the General List. He was transferred to the Intelligence Corps and later promoted to captain, posted as GSO3 (Intelligence) to the 1st (later 9th) Armoured Division. During this time, he taught himself Russian; as insufficient Russian-speaking officers were available at the War Office, his knowledge of Russian and his textual analysis skills were used to translate a Russian parachute training manual; he was convinced that the Soviet Union must eventually enter the war on the Allied side.\nIn October 1941 Powell was posted to Cairo in the Kingdom of Egypt and then transferred back to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was promoted to major in May 1942 and then to lieutenant colonel in August 1942. In that role he helped to plan the Second Battle of El Alamein, having previously helped to plan the attack on Erwin Rommel's supply lines. The following year, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his military service. During his time in Algiers, Powell began to distrust the United States' position. Powell's suspicion of the anti-British Empire nature of the US federal government's foreign policy continued for the remainder of the war and into his subsequent post-war political career.\nFollowing the Axis defeat at the Second Battle of El Alamein, Powell's attention increasingly moved to the Far East theatre, where the Allies were fighting the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). He wished to be assigned to the Chindits units operating in Burma. He secured a posting to the British Indian Army in Delhi as a lieutenant-colonel in military intelligence in August 1943. Powell was appointed Secretary to the Joint Intelligence Committee for India and Lord Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command, involved in planning an amphibious offensive against Akyab.\nPowell had continued to learn Urdu. He had an ambition of eventually becoming Viceroy of India, and when Mountbatten transferred his staff to Kandy, Ceylon, Powell chose to remain in Delhi. He was promoted to full colonel at the end of March 1944, as assistant director of military intelligence in India, giving intelligence support to the Burma campaign of Field Marshall William Slim. Powell ended the war as a brigadier, for a while, the youngest in the British Army. He told a colleague that he expected to be head of all military intelligence in \"the next war\". Powell never experienced combat and felt guilty for having survived, writing that soldiers who did so carried \"a sort of shame with them to the grave\".\nEntry into politics.\nPowell voted for the Labour Party in their 1945 landslide victory because he wanted to punish the Conservative Party for the Munich Agreement. After the war he joined the Conservatives and worked for the Conservative Research Department (CRD) under Rab Butler, where his colleagues included Iain Macleod and Reginald Maudling.\nPowell's ambition to be Viceroy of India crumbled in February 1947 when the prime minister, Clement Attlee, announced that Indian independence was imminent. Powell was so shocked by the change of policy that he spent the whole night after it was announced walking the streets of London. He came to terms with it by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone, the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later indifference to the Suez Crisis, his contempt for the Commonwealth and his urging that Britain should end any remaining pretence that it was a world power.\nAfter unsuccessfully contesting the Labour Party's safe seat of Normanton at a by-election in 1947 (when the Labour majority was 62 per cent), he was elected the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West at the 1950 general election.\nFirst years as a backbencher.\nOn 16 March 1950 Powell made his maiden speech in the House of Commons. For the rest of his life he regarded this speech as the finest he ever delivered (rather than the much more well-known 1968 anti-immigration speech). On 3 March 1953 he spoke against the Royal Titles Bill in the Commons.\nIn mid-November 1953, Powell secured a place on the 1922 Committee's executive at the third attempt. Butler also invited him onto the committee that reviewed party policy for the general election, which he attended until 1955. Powell was a member of the Suez Group of MPs who were against the removal of British troops from the Suez Canal, because such a move would demonstrate, Powell argued, that Britain could no longer maintain a position there and that any claim to the Suez Canal would, therefore, be illogical. However, after the troops had left in June 1956 and the Egyptians nationalised the Canal a month later, Powell opposed the attempt to retake the canal in the Suez Crisis because he thought the British no longer had the resources to be a world power.\nIn and out of office.\nJunior Housing Minister.\nOn 21 December 1955 Powell was appointed parliamentary secretary to Duncan Sandys at the Ministry of Housing. In early 1956 he spoke for the Housing Subsidies Bill in the Commons and argued for the rejection of an amendment that would have hindered slum clearances. He also spoke in support of the Slum Clearances Bill, which provided entitlement for full compensation for those who purchased a house after August 1939 and still occupied it in December 1955 if this property would be compulsorily purchased by the government if it was deemed unfit for human habitation. In early 1956 Powell attended a subcommittee on immigration control as a housing minister and advocated immigration controls.\nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury.\nWhen Macmillan succeeded Eden as prime minister, Powell was offered the office of Financial Secretary to the Treasury on 14 January 1957. This office was the Chancellor of the Exchequer's deputy and the most important job outside the Cabinet.\nIn January 1958 Powell resigned, along with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft and his Treasury colleague Nigel Birch, in protest of government plans for increased expenditure; he was a staunch advocate of disinflation or, in modern terms, a monetarist and a believer in market forces. Powell was also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society. The by-product of this expenditure was the printing of extra money to pay for it all, which Powell believed to be the cause of inflation and, in effect, a form of taxation as the holders of money find their money is worth less. Retail price index inflation was between 3.7 and 3 per cent at the time of his resignation.\nDuring the late 1950s Powell promoted control of the money supply to prevent inflation and, during the 1960s, was an advocate of free market policies, which at the time were seen as extreme, unworkable and unpopular. Powell advocated the privatisation of the Post Office and the telephone network as early as 1964. He both scorned the idea of \"consensus politics\" and wanted the Conservative Party to become a modern business-like party, freed from its old aristocratic and \"old boy network\" associations. In his 1958 resignation over public spending and what he saw as an inflationary economic policy, he anticipated almost exactly the views that during the 1980s came to be described as \"monetarism\".\nHola Massacre speech.\nOn 27 July 1959 Powell delivered a speech in the Commons about the Hola Camp in Kenya, where eleven Mau Mau were killed after refusing work in the camp. Powell noted that some MPs had described the eleven as \"sub-human\", but Powell responded by saying: \"In general, I would say that it is a fearful doctrine, which must recoil upon the heads of those who pronounce it, to stand in judgement on a fellow human being and to say, 'Because he was such-and-such, therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow'.\" Powell also disagreed with the notion that because it was in Africa, different methods were acceptable:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDenis Healey, a member of Parliament from 1952 to 1992, later said this speech was \"the greatest parliamentary speech I ever heard\u00a0... it had all the moral passion and rhetorical force of Demosthenes\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" report of the speech said that \"as Mr Powell sat down, he put his hand across his eyes. His emotion was justified, for he had made a great and sincere speech\".\nMinister of Health.\nPowell returned to the government in July 1960, when he was appointed Minister of Health, although he did not become a member of the Cabinet until the 1962 reshuffle. During a meeting with parents of babies that had been born with deformities caused by the drug thalidomide, he refused to meet any babies affected by the drug. Powell also refused to launch a public inquiry and resisted calls to issue a warning against any left-over thalidomide pills that might remain in people's medicine cabinets (as US President John F. Kennedy had done).\nIn December 1961 Powell, as Minister of Health, announced that the birth control pill Conovid could be prescribed to women through the National Health Service (NHS) at a subsidised price of 2 shillings per month.\nAs health minister he developed the 1962 Hospital Plan. He began a debate on the neglect of psychiatric institutions, calling for them to be replaced by wards in general hospitals. The speech catalysed debate. It was one of several strands that led to the Care in the Community initiative of the 1980s. In 1993, however, Powell stated that the criminally insane should have never been released and that the problem was one of funding. He said the new way of caring for the mentally ill cost more, not less, than the old way because community care was decentralised and intimate as well as being \"more human\"; and his successors had not, Powell stated, provided the money for local authorities to spend on mental health care. Institutional care had therefore been neglected and there was not investment in community care.\nAfter his speech on immigration in 1968, Powell's political opponents sometimes alleged that he had, when Minister of Health, recruited immigrants from the Commonwealth into the NHS. However, the Minister of Health was not responsible for recruitment (this was left to health authorities) Powell did welcome immigrant nurses and doctors, under the condition that they were to be temporary workers training in Britain and would then return to their native countries as qualified doctors or nurses. Shortly after becoming Minister of Health, Powell asked Rab Butler (the Home Secretary) whether he could be appointed to a ministerial committee that monitored immigration. Powell was worried about the strain caused by NHS immigrants, and papers show that he wanted a stronger restriction on Commonwealth immigration than that which was passed in 1961.\n1960s.\nLeadership elections.\nIn October 1963, along with Iain Macleod, Reginald Maudling and Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone, Powell tried in vain to persuade Butler not to serve under the Earl of Home (soon to be known as Alec Douglas-Home), in the belief that the latter would be unable to form a government. Powell commented that they had given Butler a revolver, which he had refused to use in case it made a noise or hurt anyone. Macleod and Powell refused to serve in Lord Home's Cabinet. This refusal is not usually attributed to personal antipathy to Douglas-Home but rather to anger at what Macleod and Powell saw as Macmillan's underhand manipulation of colleagues during the process of choosing a new leader. However, at the meeting at his house on the evening of 17 October, Powell, who still enjoyed a liberal reputation on racial issues after his Hola Massacre Speech, reportedly said of Lord Home: \"How can I serve under a man whose views on Africa are positively Portuguese?\"\nDuring the 1964 general election, Powell said in his election address, \"it was essential, for the sake not only of our own people but of the immigrants themselves, to introduce control over the numbers allowed in. I am convinced that strict control must continue if we are to avoid the evils of a 'colour question' in this country, for ourselves and for our children\". Norman Fowler, then a reporter for \"The Times\", interviewed Powell during the election and asked him what the biggest issue was: \"I expected to be told something about the cost of living but not a bit of it. 'Immigration,' replied Powell. I duly phoned in my piece but it was never used. After all, who in 1964 had ever heard of a former Conservative cabinet minister thinking that immigration was an important political issue?\"\nFollowing the Conservatives' defeat in the election, he agreed to return to the front bench as Transport Spokesman. In July 1965 he stood in the first-ever Conservative Party leadership election, but came a distant third to Edward Heath, obtaining only 15 votes, just below the result Hugh Fraser would gain in the 1975 contest. Heath appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Powell said that he had \"left his visiting card\", i.e. demonstrated himself to be a potential future leader, but the immediate effect was to demonstrate his limited support in the Parliamentary Party, enabling Heath to feel more comfortable calling his bluff.\nShadow Defence Secretary.\nIn his first speech to the Conservative Party Conference as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence on 14 October 1965, Powell outlined a fresh defence policy, jettisoning what he saw as outdated global military commitments left over from Britain's imperial past and stressing that Britain was a European power and therefore an alliance with Western European states from possible attack from the East was central to Britain's safety. He defended Britain's nuclear weapons and argued that it was \"the merest casuistry to argue that if the weapon and the means of using it are purchased in part, or even altogether, from another nation, therefore the independent right to use it has no reality. With a weapon so catastrophic, it is possession and the right to use which count\". Also, Powell called into question Western military commitments East of Suez:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;However much we may do to safeguard and reassure the new independent countries in Asia and Africa, the eventual limits of Russian and Chinese advance in those directions will be fixed by a balance of forces which will itself be Asiatic and African. The two Communist empires are already in a state of mutual antagonism; but every advance or threat of advance by one or the other calls into existence countervailing forces, sometimes nationalist in character, sometimes expansionist, which will ultimately check it. We have to reckon with the harsh fact that the attainment of this eventual equilibrium of forces may at some point be delayed rather than hastened by Western military presence.\nThe \"Daily Telegraph\" journalist David Howell remarked to Andrew Alexander that Powell had \"just withdrawn us from East of Suez, and received an enormous ovation because no-one understood what he was talking about\". However, the Americans were worried by Powell's speech as they wanted British military commitments in South-East Asia as they were still fighting in Vietnam. A transcript of the speech was sent to Washington and the American embassy requested to talk to Heath about the \"Powell doctrine\". \"The New York Times\" said Powell's speech was \"a potential declaration of independence from American policy\". During the election campaign of 1966, Powell claimed that the British government had contingency plans to send at least a token British force to Vietnam and that, under Labour, \"Britain has behaved perfectly clearly and perfectly recognisably as an American satellite\".\nIt transpired that US President Lyndon B. Johnson had indeed asked Wilson to send British forces for Vietnam. Powell learned later that Washington realised that public reaction to Powell's allegations made Wilson realise that any UK involvement in Vietnam would be deeply unpopular. After Wilson refused to join the USA's war, Powell responded: \"The greatest service I have performed for my country, if that is so\". Labour was returned to power with a large majority; Heath retained Powell as Shadow Defence Secretary as he believed him \"was too dangerous to leave out\".\nIn a speech on 26 May 1967, Powell criticised the UK's post-war world role:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In our imagination the vanishing last vestiges\u00a0... of Britain's once vast Indian Empire have transformed themselves into a peacekeeping role on which the sun never sets. Under God's good providence and in partnership with the United States, we keep the peace of the world and rush hither and thither containing Communism, putting out brush fires and coping with subversion. It is difficult to describe, without using terms derived from psychiatry, a notion having so few points of contact with reality.\nIn 1967 Powell spoke of his opposition to the immigration of Kenyan Asians to Britain after its leader Jomo Kenyatta's discriminatory policies led to the flight of Asians from that country.\nThe biggest argument Powell and Heath had during Powell's time in the Shadow Cabinet was over a dispute over the role of Black Rod, who would go to the Commons to summon them to the Lords to hear the Royal Assent of Bills. In November 1967 Black Rod arrived during a debate on the EEC and was met with cries of \"Shame\" to \"'Op it\". At the next Shadow Cabinet meeting Heath said this \"nonsense\" must be stopped. Powell suggested that Heath did not mean it should be ended. He asked whether Heath realised that the words Black Rod used went back to the 1307 Parliament of Carlisle and were ancient even then. Heath reacted furiously, saying that the British people \"were tired of this nonsense and ceremonial and mummery. He would not stand for the perpetuation of this ridiculous business etc [\"sic\"]\".\nNational figure.\n1968 \"Rivers of Blood\" speech.\nAfter the Birmingham-based television company ATV saw an advance copy of the speech on the Saturday morning, its news editor ordered a television crew to go to the venue, where they filmed sections of the speech. Earlier in the week, Powell said to his friend Clement 'Clem' Jones, a journalist and then editor at the Wolverhampton \"Express &amp; Star\", \"I'm going to make a speech at the weekend and it's going to go up 'fizz' like a rocket; but whereas all rockets fall to the earth, this one is going to stay up.\"\nPowell was renowned for his oratorical skills and his maverick nature. On 20 April 1968, he gave a speech in Birmingham in which he warned his audience of what he believed would be the consequences of continued unchecked mass immigration from the Commonwealth to Britain. Above all, it is an allusion to the ancient Roman poet Virgil towards the end of the speech which has been remembered, giving the speech its colloquial name:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see 'the River Tiber foaming with much blood'. That tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic but which there is interwoven with the history and existence of the States itself, is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect. Indeed, it has all but come. In numerical terms, it will be of American proportions long before the end of the 20th century. Only resolute and urgent action will avert it even now. Whether there will be the public will to demand and obtain that action, I do not know. All I know is that to see, and not to speak, would be the great betrayal.\n\"The Times\" declared it \"an evil speech\", stating, \"This is the first time that a serious British politician has appealed to racial hatred in this direct way in our postwar history.\"\nThe main political issue addressed by the speech was not immigration as such, however. It was the introduction of the Race Relations Act 1968 (by the Labour government at the time), which Powell found offensive and immoral. The Act would prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race in certain areas of British life, particularly housing, where many local authorities had been refusing to provide houses for immigrant families until they had lived in the country for a certain number of years.\nOne feature of his speech was the extensive quotation of a letter he received detailing the experiences of one of his constituents in Wolverhampton. The writer described the fate of an elderly woman who was supposedly the last White person living in her street. She had repeatedly refused applications from non-Whites requiring rooms-to-let, which resulted in her being called a \"racialist\" outside her home and receiving \"excreta\" through her letterbox. Powell's critics suspected him of fabricating some of his stories, and days after the speech Ann Dummett said she'd recently heard a story in which \"almost every circumstantial detail was the same\" as Powell's, except the widow was in London. More recent research has identified incorrect details within the story.\nWhen Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to tell her that he was going to sack Powell, she responded: \"I really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis\". Heath sacked Powell from his Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech, and Powell never held another senior political office again. Powell received almost 120,000 (predominantly positive) letters and a Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 74 per cent of those asked agreed with his speech and only 15 per cent disagreed, with 11 per cent unsure. One poll concluded that between 61 and 73 per cent disagreed with Heath sacking Powell. According to George L. Bernstein, many British people felt that Powell \"was the first British politician who was actually listening to them\". Appearing on Desert Island Discs (with Sue Lawley) in 1989, Powell said that Heath was objecting only to the tone of the speech, since the content was pure Tory immigration policy. Powell then added that Heath was a musician who understood \"tone\".\nAfter \"The Sunday Times\" branded his speeches \"racialist\", Powell sued them for libel, but withdrew when he was required to provide the letters he had quoted from because he had promised anonymity for the writer, who refused to waive it.\nFollowing the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, Powell was transformed into a national public figure and won huge support across Britain. Three days after the speech, on 23 April, as the Race Relations Bill was being debated in the Commons, 1,000 dockers marched on Westminster protesting against the \"victimisation\" of Powell, with slogans such as \"we want Enoch Powell!\" and \"Enoch here, Enoch there, we want Enoch everywhere\". The next day, 400 meat porters from Smithfield market handed in a 92-page petition in support of Powell, amidst other mass demonstrations of working-class support, much of it from trade unionists, in London and Wolverhampton.\nThe Conservative politician Michael Heseltine (the future deputy prime minister under John Major) stated that in the aftermath of the speech that if Powell had stood for leadership of the Conservative Party he would have won \"by a landslide\" and if he had stood to be prime minister he would have won by a \"national landslide\".\n'Morecambe Budget'.\nPowell made a speech in the town of Morecambe on 11 October 1968 on the economy, setting out alternative, radical free-market policies that would later be called the 'Morecambe Budget'. Powell used the financial year of 1968\u201369 to show how income tax could be halved from 8s\u00a03d to 4s\u00a03d in the pound (basic rate cut from 41 to 21 per cent) and how capital gains tax and Selective Employment Tax could be abolished without reducing expenditure on defence or the social services. These tax reductions required a saving of \u00a32,855,000,000 and this would be funded by eradicating losses in the nationalised industries and privatising the profit-making state concerns; ending all housing subsidies except for those who could not afford their own housing; ending all foreign aid; ending all grants and subsidies in agriculture; ending all assistance to development areas; ending all investment grants; and abolishing the National Economic Development Council and the Prices and Incomes Board. The cuts in taxation would also allow the state to borrow from the public to spend on capital projects such as hospitals and roads and spend on \"the firm and humane treatment of criminals\".\nHouse of Lords reform.\nIn mid-1968 Powell's book \"The House of Lords in the Middle Ages\" was published after twenty years' work. At the press conference for its publication, Powell said if the government introduced a Bill to reform the House of Lords he would be its \"resolute enemy\". Later in 1968, when the Labour government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath's acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative Iain Macleod and Labour's Richard Crossman to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; ensuring the government of the day usually passed its laws; weakening the Lords' powers to delay new laws; and abolishing the power to refuse subordinate legislation if it had been passed by the Commons. Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were \"unnecessary and undesirable\" and that there was no weight in the claim that the Lords could \"check or frustrate the firm intentions\" of the Commons.\nPowell said that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected, it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: \"How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?\" Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath. Powell asked: \"what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere dummies, automatic parts of a voting machine?\" He also stated that the inclusion in the proposals of thirty crossbenchers was \"a grand absurdity\", because they would have been chosen \"upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed\".\nPowell said the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: \"It has long been so, and it works\". He then added that there was not any widespread desire for reform: he indicated a recent survey of working-class voters that showed that only one-third of them wanted to reform or abolish the House of Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an \"intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain\". Powell deduced from this, \"As so often, the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever people\u2014the underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive\".\nFollowing more speeches against the bill during early 1969, and faced with the fact that a bloc of left-wing Labour members were also against reforming the Lords as they desired its abolition altogether, Wilson announced on 17 April that the bill was being withdrawn. Wilson's statement was brief and Powell intervened, \"Don't eat them too quickly\", which provoked much laughter in the chamber. Later that day Powell said in a speech to the Primrose League:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There was an instinct, inarticulate but deep and sound, that the traditional, prescriptive House of Lords posed no threat and injured no interests, but might yet, for all its illogicalities and anomalies, make itself felt on occasion to useful purpose. The same sound instinct was repelled by the idea of a new-fashioned second chamber, artificially constructed by power, party, and patronage, to function in a particular way. Not for the first time, the common people of this country proved the surest defenders of their traditional institutions.\nThe biographer Simon Heffer described the defeat of Lords reform as \"perhaps the greatest triumph of Powell's political career\".\nIn 1969, when it was first suggested that Britain should join the European Economic Community, Powell publicly opposed it.\nDeparture from the Conservative Party.\nA Gallup poll in February 1969 showed Powell to be the \"most admired person\" in British public opinion.\nIn a defence debate in March 1970 Powell said that \"the whole theory of the tactical nuclear weapon, or the tactical use of nuclear weapons, is an unmitigated absurdity\" and that it was \"remotely improbable\" that any group of nations engaged in war would \"decide upon general and mutual suicide\", and advocated enlargement of the UK's conventional forces. However, when his fellow Conservative Julian Amery later in the debate criticised Powell for his anti-nuclear pronouncements, Powell responded: \"I have always regarded the possession of the nuclear capability as a protection against nuclear blackmail. It is a protection against being threatened with nuclear weapons. What it is not a protection against is war\".\nThe 1970 general election took place on 18 June and was unexpectedly won by the Conservatives, with a late surge in their support. Powell's supporters claim that he contributed to this surprise victory. In \"exhaustive research\" on the election, the American pollster Douglas Schoen and University of Oxford academic R. W. Johnson believed it \"beyond dispute\" that Powell had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives, but the Conservative vote had increased by only 1.7 million since 1966. However, the Conservative victory was reportedly not to Powell's advantage, who, according to friends, \"sat in his head in his hands\" for many days afterwards.\nPowell had voted against the Schuman Declaration in 1950 and had supported entry into the European Coal and Steel Community only because he believed that it was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969 he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was the UK's very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of middle-class Conservatives and others, and as much as anything else it made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European; but there was already enmity between the two.\nDuring 1970 Powell gave speeches about the EEC in Lyon (in French), Frankfurt (in German), Turin (in Italian) and The Hague.\nThe Conservatives had promised at the 1970 general election in relation to the Common Market, \"Our sole commitment is to negotiate; no more, no less.\" The second reading of the Bill to put the Treaty into law was passed by just eight votes and Powell declared his hostility to his party's line. He voted against the government on every one of the 104 divisions in the course of the European Communities Bill. When Britain finally entered the EEC in January 1973, after three years of campaigning on the question, he decided he could no longer sit in a parliament that he believed was no longer sovereign.\nA \"Daily Express\" opinion poll in 1972 showed Powell to be the most popular politician in the country. In mid-1972 he prepared to resign the Conservative whip and changed his mind only because of fears of a renewed wave of immigration from Uganda after the accession of Idi Amin, who had expelled Uganda's Asian residents. He decided to remain in parliament and in the Conservative Party, and was expected to support the party in Wolverhampton at the snap general election of February 1974 called by Edward Heath. However, on 23 February 1974, with the election only five days away, Powell dramatically turned his back on his party, giving as the reasons that it had taken the United Kingdom into the EEC without having a mandate to do so, and that it had abandoned other manifesto commitments, so that he could no longer support it at the election. The monetarist economist Milton Friedman sent Powell a letter praising him as principled, and notably, there was a breakaway faction of the Conservative Party in Gloucester which selected a candidate who stood under the party name of \"Powell Conservative\", securing 366 votes, 0.7 per cent of the overall vote share in the constituency. There was also a candidate listed in the neighbouring constituency of Stroud who obtained 470 votes, 0.8 per cent of the overall vote share in the constituency.\nPowell had arranged for his friend Andrew Alexander to talk to Joe Haines, the press secretary of the Labour leader Harold Wilson, about the timing of Powell's speeches against Heath. Powell had been talking to Wilson irregularly since June 1973 during chance meetings in the gentlemen's lavatories of the \"aye\" lobby in the House of Commons. Wilson and Haines had ensured that Powell would dominate the newspapers of the Sunday and Monday before election day by having no Labour frontbencher give a major speech on 23 February, the day of Powell's speech. Powell gave this speech at the Mecca Dance Hall in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, to an audience of 1,500, with some press reports estimating that 7,000 more had to be turned away. Powell said the issue of British membership of the EEC was one where \"if there be a conflict between the call of country and that of party, the call of country must come first\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPowell went on to criticise the Conservative government for obtaining British membership despite the party having promised at the general election of 1970 that it would \"negotiate: no more, no less\" and that \"the full-hearted consent of Parliament and people\" would be needed if the UK were to join. He also denounced Heath for accusing his political opponents of lacking respect for Parliament while also being \"the first Prime Minister in three hundred years who entertained, let alone executed, the intention of depriving Parliament of its sole right to make the laws and impose the taxes of this country\". He then advocated a vote for the Labour Party:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis call to vote Labour surprised some of Powell's supporters who were more concerned with beating socialism than the supposed loss of national independence. On 25 February he made another speech at Shipley, again urging a vote for Labour, saying he did not believe the claim that Wilson would renege on his commitment to renegotiation, which Powell believed was ironic because of Heath's premiership: \"In acrobatics Harold Wilson, for all his nimbleness and skill, is simply no match for the breathtaking, thoroughgoing efficiency of the present Prime Minister\". At this moment a heckler shouted \"Judas!\" Powell responded: \"Judas was paid! Judas was paid! I am making a sacrifice!\" Later in the speech Powell said, \"I was born a Tory, am a Tory and shall die a Tory. It is part of me\u00a0... it is something I cannot alter\". Later in life, in 1987, Powell said there was no contradiction between urging people to vote Labour while proclaiming to be a Tory: \"Many Labour members are quite good Tories\".\nPowell, in an interview on 26 February, said he would be voting for Helene Middleweek, the Labour candidate, rather than the Conservative Nicholas Budgen. Powell did not stay up on election night to watch the results on television. When on 1 March he saw the headline in \"'The Times\" \"Mr Heath's general election gamble fails\", he reacted by singing the \"Te Deum\". He later said: \"I had had my revenge on the man who had destroyed the self-government of the United Kingdom\". The election result was a hung parliament. Although the Conservatives had won the most votes, Labour finished five seats ahead of them. The national swing to Labour was 1 per cent; 4 per cent in Powell's heartland, the West Midlands conurbation; and 16 per cent in his old constituency (although Budgen won the seat). According to Powell biographer Simon Heffer, both Powell and Heath believed that Powell had been responsible for the Conservatives' losing the election.\nUlster Unionist.\n1974\u20131979.\nIn a sudden general election in October 1974, Powell returned to Parliament as Ulster Unionist (UUP) MP for South Down, having rejected an offer to stand as a candidate for the far-right National Front, formed seven years earlier and fiercely opposed to non-white immigration. He repeated his call to vote Labour because of their policy on the EEC.\nSince 1968 Powell had been an increasingly frequent visitor to Northern Ireland and, in keeping with his general British nationalist viewpoint, sided strongly with the Ulster Unionists in their desire to remain a constituent part of the United Kingdom. From early 1971 he opposed, with increasing vehemence, Heath's approach to Northern Ireland, the greatest breach with his party coming over the imposition of direct rule in 1972. He strongly believed that it would survive only if the Unionists strove to integrate completely with the United Kingdom by abandoning devolved rule in Northern Ireland. He refused to join the Orange Order, the first Ulster Unionist MP at Westminster never to be a member (and, to date, one of only four, the others being Ken Maginnis, Danny Kinahan and Lady Hermon), and he was an outspoken opponent of the more extremist loyalism espoused by Ian Paisley and his supporters.\nIn the aftermath of the Birmingham pub bombings by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) on 21 November 1974, the government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). During its second reading, Powell warned of passing legislation \"in haste and under the immediate pressure of indignation on matters which touch the fundamental liberties of the subject; for both haste and anger are ill counsellors, especially when one is legislating for the rights of the subject\". He said terrorism was a form of warfare that could not be prevented by laws and punishments but by the aggressor's certainty that the war was impossible to win.\nWhen Heath called a leadership election at the end of 1974, Powell claimed they would have to find someone who was not a member of the Cabinet that \"without a single resignation or public dissent, not merely swallowed but advocated every single reversal of election pledge or party principle\". During February 1975, after winning the leadership election, Margaret Thatcher refused to offer Powell a Shadow Cabinet place because \"he turned his back on his own people\" by leaving the Conservative Party exactly 12 months earlier and telling the public to vote Labour. Powell replied she was correct to exclude him: \"In the first place I am not a member of the Conservative Party and secondly, until the Conservative Party has worked its passage a very long way it will not be rejoining me\". Powell also attributed Thatcher's success to luck, saying that she was faced with \"supremely unattractive opponents at the time\".\nDuring the 1975 referendum on British membership of the EEC, Powell campaigned for a 'No' vote. Powell was one of the few prominent supporters of the 'No' camp, with Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Peter Shore and Barbara Castle. The electorate voted 'Yes' by a margin of more than two to one.\nOn 23 March 1977, in a vote of confidence against the minority Labour government, Powell, along with a few other Ulster Unionists, abstained. The government won by 322 votes to 298 and remained in power for another two years.\nPowell said that the only way to stop the Provisional Irish Republican Army was for Northern Ireland to be an integral part of Britain, treated the same as any other of its constituent parts. He said the ambiguous nature of the region's status, with its own parliament and prime minister, gave hope to the IRA that it could be detached from the rest of Britain:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every word or act which holds out the prospect that their unity with the rest of the United Kingdom might be negotiable is itself, consciously or unconsciously, a contributory cause to the continuation of violence in Northern Ireland.\nNonetheless, in the 1987 general election that he lost, Powell campaigned in Bangor for Jim Kilfedder, the devolutionist North Down Ulster Popular Unionist Party MP, and against Bob McCartney, who was standing as a Real Unionist on a policy of integration and equal citizenship for Northern Ireland.\nIn Powell's later career as an Ulster Unionist MP, he continued to criticise the United States and stated that the Americans were trying to persuade the British to surrender Northern Ireland into an all-Ireland state because the condition for the Republic of Ireland's membership of NATO, Powell said, was Northern Ireland. The Americans wanted to close the 'yawning gap' in NATO defence that was the Republic of Ireland's coast to northern Spain. Powell had a copy of a US State Department Policy Statement from 15 August 1950, in which the American federal government said that the \"agitation\" caused by partition in Ireland \"lessens the usefulness of Ireland in international organisations and complicates strategic planning for Europe\". \"It is desirable\", the document continued, \"that Ireland should be integrated into the defence planning of the North Atlantic area, for its strategic position and present lack of defensive capacity are matters of significance.\"\nThough he voted with the Conservatives in a vote of confidence that brought down the Labour government on 28 March, Powell did not welcome Thatcher's victory in the 1979 general election. \"Grim\" was Powell's response when he was asked what he thought of it, because he believed she would renege like Heath did in 1972. During the election campaign Thatcher, when questioned, again repeated her vow that there would be no position for Powell in her Cabinet if the Conservatives won. In the days following the election Powell wrote to James Callaghan to commiserate on his defeat, pay tribute to his premiership and to wish him well.\n1979\u20131982.\nFollowing a riot in Bristol in 1980, Powell stated that the media were ignoring similar events in south London and Birmingham: \"Far less than the foreseeable New Commonwealth and Pakistan ethnic proportion would be sufficient to constitute a dominant political force in the United Kingdom able to extract from a government and the main parties terms calculated to render its influence still more impregnable. Far less than this proportion would provide the bases and citadels for urban terrorism, which would in turn reinforce the overt political leverage of simple numbers\". He criticised \"the false nostrums and promises of those who apparently monopolise the channels of communication. Who then is likely to listen, let alone to respond, to the proof that nothing short of major movements of population can shift the lines along which we are being carried towards disaster?\"\nIn the 1980s Powell began espousing the policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. In a debate on the nuclear deterrent on 3 March 1981 Powell claimed that the debate was now more political than military; that Britain did not possess an independent deterrent and that through NATO, Britain was tied to the nuclear deterrence theory of the US. In the debate on the address shortly after the general election of 1983, Powell picked up on Thatcher's willingness, when asked, to use nuclear weapons as a \"last resort\". Powell presented a scenario of what he thought the last resort would be, namely that the Soviet Union would be ready to invade Britain and had used a nuclear weapon on somewhere such as Rockall to demonstrate their willingness to use it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What would the United Kingdom do? Would it discharge Polaris, Trident or whatever against the main centres of population of the Continent of Europe or in European Russia? If so, what would be the consequence? The consequence would not be that we should survive, that we should repel our antagonist\u2014nor would it be that we should escape defeat. The consequence would be that we would make certain, as far as is humanly possible, the virtual destruction and elimination of the hope of the future in these islands.\u00a0... I would much sooner that the power to use it was not in the hands of any individual in this country at all.\nPowell went on to say that if the Soviet invasion had already begun and Britain resorted to a retaliatory strike, the results would be the same: \"We should be condemning, not merely to death, but as near as may be the non-existence of our population\". To Powell, an invasion would take place with or without Britain's nuclear weapons and therefore there was no point in retaining them. He said that after years of consideration, he had come to the conclusion that there were no \"rational grounds on which the deformation of our defence preparations in the United Kingdom by our determination to maintain a current independent nuclear deterrent can be justified\".\nJohn Casey records an exchange between Powell and Thatcher during a meeting of the Conservative Philosophy Group:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Edward Norman (then Dean of Peterhouse) had attempted to mount a Christian argument for nuclear weapons. The discussion moved on to \"Western values\". Mrs Thatcher said (in effect) that Norman had shown that the Bomb was necessary for the defence of our values. Powell: \"No, we do not fight for values. I would fight for this country even if it had a communist government.\" Thatcher (it was just before the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands): \"Nonsense, Enoch. If I send British troops abroad, it will be to defend our values.\" \"No, Prime Minister, values exist in a transcendental realm, beyond space and time. They can neither be fought for, nor destroyed.\" Mrs Thatcher looked utterly baffled. She had just been presented with the difference between Toryism and American Republicanism.\nOn 28 March 1981 Powell gave a speech to Ashton-under-Lyne Young Conservatives where he criticised the \"conspiracy of silence\" between the government and the opposition over the prospective growth through births of the immigration population: \"'We have seen nothing yet' is a phrase that we could with advantage repeat to ourselves whenever we try to form a picture of that future\". He also criticised those who believed it was \"too late to do anything\" and that \"there lies the certainty of violence on a scale which can only adequately be described as civil war\". He also said that the solution was \"a reduction in prospective numbers as would represent re-emigration hardly less massive than the immigration which occurred in the first place\". The Shadow Home Secretary, Labour MP Roy Hattersley, criticised Powell for using \"Munich beer-hall language\". On 11 April there was a riot in Brixton, and when on 13 April an interviewer quoted to Thatcher Powell's remark that \"We have seen nothing yet\", she replied: \"I heard him say that and I thought it was a very very alarming remark. And I hope with all my heart that it isn't true\".\nIn July a riot took place in Toxteth, Liverpool. On 16 July 1981 Powell gave a speech in the Commons in which he said the riots could not be understood unless one takes into consideration the fact that in some large cities, between a quarter and a half of those under 25 were immigrants or descended from immigrants. He read out a letter he had received from a member of the public about immigration that included the line: \"As they continue to multiply and as we can't retreat further there must be conflict\". The Labour MP Martin Flannery intervened, saying Powell was making \"a National Front speech\". Powell predicted \"inner London becoming ungovernable or violence which could only effectively be described as civil war\", and Flannery intervened again to ask what he knew about inner cities.\nPowell replied: \"I was a Member for Wolverhampton for a quarter of a century. What I saw in those early years of the development of this problem in Wolverhampton has made it impossible for me ever to dissociate myself from this gigantic and tragic problem\". He also criticised the view that the causes of the riots were economic: \"Are we seriously saying that so long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our cities will be torn to pieces, that the police in them will be the objects of attack and that we shall destroy our own environment? Of course not\". Dame Judith Hart attacked his speech as \"an evil incitement to riot\". Powell replied: \"I am within the judgment of the House, as I am within the judgment of the people of this country, and I am content to stand before either tribunal\".\nAfter the Scarman Report on the riots was published, Powell gave a speech on 10 December in the Commons. Powell disagreed with Scarman, as the report stated that the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged. Powell instead argued that the black community was alienated because it was alien. He said tensions would worsen because the non-white population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25 per cent, of those of secondary school age it was 40 per cent. Powell said that the government should be honest to the people by telling them that in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.\nFalklands conflict.\nWhen the Falkland Islands were invaded by Argentina in April 1982, Powell was given secret briefings on Privy Counsellor terms on behalf of his party. On 3 April Powell said in the Commons that the time for inquests on the government's failure to protect the Falklands would come later and that although it was right to put the issue before the United Nations, Britain should not wait upon that organisation to deliberate but use forceful action now. He then turned to face Thatcher: \"The Prime Minister, shortly after she came into office, received a soubriquet as the \"Iron Lady\". It arose in the context of remarks which she made about defence against the Soviet Union and its allies; but there was no reason to suppose that the right hon. Lady did not welcome and, indeed, take pride in that description. In the next week or two this House, the nation and the right hon. Lady herself will learn of what metal she is made.\" According to Thatcher's friends this had a \"devastating impact\" on her and encouraged her resolve.\nOn 14 April, in the Commons, Powell said: \"it is difficult to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken\". He added: \"We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and the wishes of the inhabitants of the Falkland Islands\u00a0... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.\u00a0... I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people\".\nPowell also criticised the United Nations Security Council's resolution calling for a \"peaceful solution\". He said that while he wanted a peaceful solution, the resolution's meaning \"seems to be of a negotiated settlement or compromise between two incompatible positions\u2014between the position which exists in international law, that the Falkland Islands and their dependencies are British sovereign territory and some other position altogether\u00a0... It cannot be meant that one country has only to seize the territory of another country for the nations of the world to say that some middle position must be found.\u00a0... If that were the meaning of the resolution of the Security Council, the charter of the United Nations would not be a charter of peace; it would be a pirates' charter. It would mean that any claim anywhere in the world had only to be pursued by force and points would immediately be gained and a bargaining position established by the aggressor\".\nOn 28 April Powell spoke in the Commons against the Northern Ireland Secretary's (Jim Prior) plans for devolution to a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland: \"We assured the people of the Falkland Islands that there should be no change in their status without their agreement. Yet at the very same time that those assurances were being repeated, the actions of the Government and their representatives elsewhere were belying or contradicting those assurances and showing that part at any rate of the Government was looking to a very different outcome that could not be approved by the people of the islands. Essentially, exactly the same has happened over the years to Northern Ireland\". He further said that power-sharing was a negation of democracy.\nThe next day Powell disagreed with the Labour Party leader Michael Foot's claim that the British government was acting under the authority of the United Nations: \"The right of self-defence\u2014to repel aggression and to expel an invader from one's territory and one's people whom he has occupied and taken captive\u2014is, as the Government have said, an inherent right. It is one which existed before the United Nations was dreamt of\".\nOn 13 May Powell said the task force was sent \"to repossess the Falkland Islands, to restore British administration of the islands and to ensure that the decisive factor in the future of the islands should be the wishes of the inhabitants\" but the Foreign Secretary (Francis Pym) desired an \"interim agreement\": \"So far as I understand that interim agreement, it is in breach, if not in contradiction, of each of the three objects with which the task force was dispatched to the South Atlantic. There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces\u00a0... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. We have a right to be there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and we have the right to sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands\".\nAfter British forces successfully recaptured the Falklands, Powell asked Thatcher in the Commons on 17 June, recalling his statement to her of 3 April: \"Is the right hon. Lady aware that the report has now been received from the public analyst on a certain substance recently subjected to analysis and that I have obtained a copy of the report? It shows that the substance under test consisted of ferrous matter of the highest quality, that it is of exceptional tensile strength, is highly resistant to wear and tear and to stress, and may be used with advantage for all national purposes?\" She replied, \"I think that I am very grateful indeed to the right hon. Gentleman. I agree with every word that he said\". Their mutual friend Ian Gow printed and framed this and the original question and presented it to Thatcher, who hung it in her office.\nPowell wrote an article for \"The Times\" on 29 June in which he said: \"The Falklands have brought to the surface of the British mind our latent perception of ourselves as a sea animal.\u00a0... No assault on a landward possession would have evoked the same automatic defiance, tinged with a touch of that self sufficiency which belongs to all nations\". The United States' response was \"very different but just as deep an instinctual reaction\u00a0... the United States have an almost neurotic sense of vulnerability\u00a0... its two coastlines, its two theatres, its two navies are separated by the entire length of the New World\u00a0... she lives with\u00a0... the nightmare of having one day to fight a decisive sea battle without the benefit of concentration, the perpetual spectre of naval 'war on two fronts'.\" Powell added: \"The Panama Canal from 1914 onwards could never quite exorcise the spectre.\u00a0... It was the position of the Falkland Islands in relation to that route which gave and gives them their significance\u2014for the United States above all. The British people have become uneasily aware that their American allies would prefer the Falkland Islands to pass out of Britain's possession into hands which, if not wholly American, might be amenable to American control. In fact, the American struggle to wrest the islands from Britain has only commenced in earnest now that the fighting is over\". Powell then said there was \"the Hispanic factor\": \"If we could gather together all the anxieties for the future which in Britain cluster around race relations\u00a0... and then attribute them, translated into Hispanic terms, to the Americans, we would have something of the phobias which haunt the United States and addressed itself to the aftermath of the Falklands campaign\".\nWriting in \"The Guardian\" on 18 October, Powell said that due to the Falklands War, \"Britain no longer looked upon itself and the world through American spectacles\" and the view was \"more rational; and it was more congenial; for, after all, it was our own view\". He quoted an observation that Americans thought their country was \"a unique society\u00a0... where God has put together all nationalities, races and interests of the globe for one purpose\u2014to show the rest of the world how to live\". He denounced the \"manic exaltation of the American illusion\" and compared it to the \"American nightmare\". Powell also disliked the American belief that \"they are authorised, possibly by the deity, to intervene, openly or covertly, in the internal affairs of other countries anywhere in the world\". The UK should dissociate herself from American intervention in the Lebanon: \"It is not in Britain's self-interest alone that Britain should once again assert her own position. A world in which the American myth and the American nightmare go unchallenged by question or by contradiction is not a world as safe or as peaceable as human reason, prudence and realism can make it\".\nSpeaking to the Aldershot and North Hants Conservative Association on 4 February 1983, Powell blamed the United Nations for the Falklands War by the General Assembly resolution of December 1967 that stated \"its gratitude for the continuous efforts made by the Government of Argentina to facilitate the process of decolonisation\" and further called on the UK and Argentina to negotiate. Powell said that \"it would be difficult to imagine a more cynically wicked or criminally absurd or insultingly provocative action\". As 102 had voted for this resolution, with only the UK voting against it (with 32 abstentions), he said it was not surprising that Argentina had continually threatened the UK until this threatening turned into aggression: \"It is with the United Nations that the guilt lies for the breach of the peace and the bloodshed\". The UN knew that no international forum had ruled against British possession of the Falklands but had voted its gratitude to Argentina who wanted to annexe the Islands from their rightful owners. It was therefore \"disgraceful\" for Britain to belong to such a body that engaged in \"pure spite for spite's sake against the United Kingdom\": \"We were, and are, the victims of our own insincerity. For over thirty years we have sanctimoniously and dishonestly pretended respect, if not awe, for an organisation which all the time we knew was a monstrous and farcical humbug.\u00a0... The moral is to cease to engage in humbug, which almost all have happily and self-righteously engaged in for a generation\".\n1983 general election.\nIn an article for the \"Sunday Telegraph\" on 3 April, Powell expressed his opposition to the Labour Party's manifesto pledge to outlaw fox hunting. He claimed that angling was much crueller and that it was just as logical to ban the boiling of live lobsters or eating live oysters. The ceremonial part of fox hunting was \"a side of our national character which is deeply antipathetic to the Labour party\". At the 1983 general election Powell had to face a DUP candidate in his constituency and Ian Paisley denounced Powell as \"a foreigner and an Anglo-Catholic\".\nOn 31 May Powell gave a speech at Downpatrick against nuclear weapons. Powell said that war could not be banished because \"War is implicit in the human condition\". The \"true case against the nuclear weapon is the nightmarish unreality and criminal levity of the grounds upon which its acquisition and multiplication are advocated and defended\". Thatcher had claimed nuclear weapons were our defence \"of last resort\". Powell said he supposed this to mean \"that the Soviet Union, which seems always to be assumed to be the enemy in question, proved so victorious in a war of aggression in Europe as to stand upon the verge of invading these islands.\u00a0... Suppose further, because this is necessary to the alleged case for our nuclear weapon as the defence of last resort, that, as in 1940, the United States was standing aloof from the contest but that, in contrast with 1940, Britain and the Warsaw Pact respectively possessed the nuclear weaponry which they do today. Such must surely be the sort of scene in which the Prime Minister is asserting that Britain would be saved by possession of her present nuclear armament. I can only say: 'One must be mad to think it'.\" Powell pointed out that the UK's nuclear weaponry \"is negligible in comparison with that of Russia: if we could destroy 16 Russian cities she could destroy practically every vestige of life on these islands several times over. For us to use the weapon would, therefore, be equivalent to more than suicide: it would be genocide\u2014the extinction of our race\u2014in the literal and precise meaning of that much abused expression. Would anybody in their senses contemplate that this ought to be our choice or would be our choice?\"\nPowell further stated that the continental nations held the nuclear weapon in such esteem that they had conventional forces \"manifestly inadequate to impose more than brief delay upon an assault from the East. The theory of nuclear deterrence states that, should Warsaw Pact forces score substantial military successes or make substantial advances this side of the Iron Curtain, the United States would initiate the suicidal duel of strategic nuclear exchanges with the Soviet Union. One can only greet this idea with an even more emphatic 'One must be mad to think of it'. That a nation staring ultimate military defeat in the face would choose self-extermination is unbelievable enough; but that the United States, separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean, would regard the loss of the first pawn in the long game as necessitating harakiri is not describable by the ordinary resources of language\". The reason why governments, including in the US, supported nuclear weapons was that \"enormous economic and financial interests are vested in the continuation and elaboration of nuclear armaments. I believe, however, that the crucial explanation lies in another direction: the nuclear hypothesis provides governments with an excuse for not doing what they have no intention of doing anyhow, but for reasons which they find it inconvenient to specify\".\nOn 2 June Powell spoke against the stationing of American cruise missiles in Britain and asserted that the US had an obsessive sense of mission and a hallucinatory view of international relations: \"The American nation, as we have watched their proceedings during these last 25 years, will not, when another Atlantic crisis, another Middle East crisis or another European crisis comes, wait upon the deliberations of the British Cabinet, whose point of view and appreciation of the situation will be so different from their own\".\nIn 1983 his local agent was Jeffrey Donaldson, later an Ulster Unionist MP before defecting to the DUP.\n1983\u20131987.\nIn 1984 Powell alleged that the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had murdered Lord Mountbatten and that the assassinations of the MPs Airey Neave and Robert Bradford were carried out at the direction of elements of the US federal government with the strategic objective of preventing Neave's policy of integration of Northern Ireland fully into the United Kingdom. In 1986 Powell stated that the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) had not killed Neave but that \"MI6 and their friends\" were responsible: Powell cited as his sources information that had been disclosed to him from within the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).\nIn 1985 race riots between the black community and the police broke out in London and in Birmingham, leading Powell to repeat his warning that ethnic civil conflict would be the ultimate outcome of mass immigration into the Great Britain and re-issue his call for a government-sponsored programme of repatriation.\nPowell later came into conflict with Thatcher in November 1985 over her support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement. On the day it was signed, 14 November, Powell asked her in the Commons: \"Does the Right Hon. Lady understand \u2014 if she does not yet understand she soon will \u2014 that the penalty for treachery is to fall into public contempt?\", the prime minister replying that she found his remarks \"deeply offensive\".\nAlong with other Unionist MPs, Powell resigned his seat in protest and then narrowly regained it at the ensuing by-election.\nIn 1986 the former Irish schoolteacher Seamus Mallon was a new entrant to the Commons. During his maiden speech Mallon quoted the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, saying, \"Peace is not an absence of war. It is \u2026 a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.\" Powell, sitting close to Mallon, hissed an objection. When Mallon enquired why, Powell said that he had misquoted Spinoza. Mallon stated he had not and, to reconcile the standoff between them, they both proceeded to the library to verify the quote. Mallon was found to have been correct.\nIn 1987 Thatcher visited the Soviet Union, which signified to Powell a \"radical transformation which is in progress in both the foreign policy and the defence policy of the United Kingdom\". In a speech in the Commons on 7 April Powell said the nuclear hypothesis had been shaken by two events. The first was the Strategic Defense Initiative or \"Star Wars\": \"Star wars raised the terrible prospect that there might be an effective means of neutralising the inter-continental ballistic missile, whereby the two great giants who held what had become to be seen as the balance of terror would contract out of the game altogether: the deterrent would be switched off by the invulnerability of the two providers of the mutual terror\".\nAmerica's \"European allies were brought along to acquiesce in the United States engaging in the rational activity of discovering whether there was after all some defence against nuclear attack\u00a0... by the apparent assurance obtained from the United States that it was only engaged in experiment and research, and that, if there were any danger of effective protection being devised, of course the United States would not avail itself of that protection without the agreement of its European allies. That was the first recent event which shook to its foundations the nuclear deterrent with which we had lived these last 30 years\".\nThe second event was Mikhail Gorbachev's offer of both the Soviet Union and the United States agreeing to abolish intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Powell said that Thatcher's \"most significant point was when she went on to say that we must aim at a conventional forces balance. So, after all our journeys of the last 30 or 40 years, the disappearance of the intermediate range ballistic missile revived the old question of the supposed conventional imbalance between the Russian alliance and the North Atlantic Alliance\".\nPowell further said that even if nuclear weapons had not existed, the Russians would still not have invaded Western Europe: \"What has prevented that from happening was\u00a0... the fact that the Soviet Union knew\u00a0... that such an action on its part would have led to a third world war\u2014a long war, bitterly fought, a war which in the end the Soviet Union would have been likely to lose on the same basis and in the same way as the corresponding war was lost by Napoleon, by the Emperor Wilhelm and by Adolf Hitler. It was that fear, that caution, that understanding, that perception on the part of Russia and its leaders that was the real deterrent against Russia committing the utterly irrational and suicidal act of plunging into a third world war in which the Soviet Union would be likely to find itself confronting a combination of the greatest industrial and economic powers in the world\".\nPowell said, \"In the minds of the Russians the inevitable commitment of the United States in such a war would have come not directly or necessarily from the stationing of American marines in Germany, but, as it came in the previous two struggles, from the ultimate involvement of the United States in any war determining the future of Europe\". Thatcher's belief in the nuclear hypothesis \"in the context of the use of American bases in Britain to launch an aggressive attack on Libya, that it was 'inconceivable' that we could have refused a demand placed upon this country by the United States. The Prime Minister supplied the reason why: she said it was because we depend for our liberty and freedom upon the United States. Once let the nuclear hypothesis be questioned or destroyed, once allow it to break down, and from that moment the American imperative in this country's policies disappears with it\".\nAt the start of the 1987 general election Powell claimed the Conservatives' prospects did not look good: \"I have the feeling of 1945\". During the final weekend of the election campaign Powell gave a speech in London reiterating his opposition to the nuclear hypothesis, calling it \"barmy\", and advocating a vote for the Labour Party, which had unilateral nuclear disarmament as a policy. He claimed that Chernobyl had strengthened \"a growing impulse to escape from the nightmare of peace being dependent upon the contemplation of horrific and mutual carnage. Events have now so developed that this aspiration can at last be rationally, logically and\u2014I dare to add\u2014patriotically seized by the people of the United Kingdom if they will use their votes to do so\".\nHowever, Powell lost his seat in the election by 731 votes to the SDLP's Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before. The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign for the number of MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion for the rest of the United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held in by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, \"For the rest of my life when I look back on the 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart\". He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he said the words Edmund Burke used on the death of the candidate Richard Coombe: \"What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue\". When a BBC reporter asked Powell to explain his defeat, he replied: \"My opponent polled more votes than me\".\nHe was offered a life peerage, which was regarded as his right as a former Cabinet minister, but he declined it. He argued that as he had opposed the Life Peerages Act 1958, it would be hypocritical for him to take one.\nPost-parliamentary life.\n1987\u20131992.\nPowell was critical of the Special Air Service (SAS) shootings of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar in March 1988. Powell claimed in an article for \"The Guardian\" on 7 December 1988 that the new Western-friendly foreign policy of Russia under Mikhail Gorbachev heralded \"the death and burial of the American empire\". Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany had decided to visit Moscow to negotiate German reunification, signalling to Powell that the last gasp of American power in Europe to be replaced by a new balance of power not resting on military force but on the \"recognition of the restraints which the ultimate certainty of failure places upon the ambitions of the respective national states\".\nIn an interview for the \"Sunday People\" in December 1988, Powell said the Conservative Party was \"rejoining Enoch\" on the European Community but repeated his warning of civil war as the consequence of immigration: \"I still cannot forsee how a country can be peaceably governed in which the composition of the population is progressively going to change. I am talking about violence on a scale which can only be described as civil war. I cannot see there can be any other outcome\". It would not be a race war but \"about people who revolt against being trapped in a situation where they feel at the mercy of a built-in racial majority, whatever its colour\" and claimed that the government had made contingency plans for such an event. The solution, he said, was repatriation on a large scale and the cost of doing this in welfare payments and pensions was well worth paying.\nIn early 1989 he made a programme (broadcast in July) on his visit to Russia and his impressions on that country. The BBC originally wanted him to do a programme on India, but the Indian High Commission in London refused him a visa. When he visited Russia, Powell went to the graves of 600,000 people who died during the Siege of Leningrad, saying that he could not believe a people who had suffered so much would willingly start another war. He also went to a veterans' parade (wearing his own medals) and talked with Russian soldiers with the aid of an interpreter. However, the programme was criticised by those who believed that Powell had dismissed the Soviet Union's threat to the West since 1945 and that he had been too impressed with Russia's sense of national identity. When German reunification was on the agenda in mid-1989, Powell said that Britain urgently needed to create an alliance with the Soviet Union in view of Germany's effect on the balance of power in Europe.\nFollowing Thatcher's Bruges speech in September 1988 and her increasing hostility to a European currency in the last years of her premiership, Powell made many speeches publicly supporting her attitude to Europe. When Heath criticised Thatcher's speech in May 1989, Powell called him \"the old virtuoso of the U-turn\". When inflation crept up that year, he condemned Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy of printing money so sterling would shadow the Deutsche Mark and said that it was for Britain to join the European Monetary System (EMS).\nIn early September 1989 a collection of Powell's speeches on Europe was published, titled \"Enoch Powell on 1992\" (1992 being the year set for the creation of the Single Market by the Single European Act of 1986). In a speech at Chatham House for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom. At the Conservative Party Conference in October, he told a fringe meeting, \"I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years\". After Thatcher resisted further European integration at a meeting at Strasbourg in November, Powell asked her parliamentary private secretary, Mark Lennox-Boyd, to pass to her \"my respectful congratulations on her stand\u00a0... she both spoke for Britain and gave a lead to Europe\u2014in the line of succession of Winston Churchill and William Pitt. Those who lead are always out in front, alone\". Thatcher replied, \"I am deeply touched by your words. They give me the greatest possible encouragement\".\nOn 5 January 1990, addressing Conservatives in Liverpool, Powell said that if the Conservatives played the \"British card\" at the next general election, they could win; the new mood in Britain for \"self-determination\" had given the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe a \"beacon\", adding that Britain should stand alone, if necessary, for European freedom, adding: \"We are taunted\u2014by the French, by the Italians, by the Spaniards\u2014for refusing to worship at the shrine of a common government superimposed upon them all\u00a0... where were the European unity merchants in 1940? I will tell you. They were either writhing under a hideous oppression or they were aiding and abetting that oppression. Lucky for Europe that Britain was alone in 1940\".\nThe Conservative Party would have to ask, preferably at the next election: \"Do you intend still to control the laws which you obey, the taxes you pay and the policies of your government?\" Five days after this speech, in an interview for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Thatcher praised Powell: \"I have always read Enoch Powell's speeches and articles very carefully.\u00a0... I always think it was a tragedy that he left. He is a very, very able politician. I say that even though he has sometimes said vitriolic things against me\". On the day of the Mid-Staffordshire by-election, Powell said that the government should admit that the community charge was \"a disaster\" and that what mattered most to the people of Mid-Staffordshire was the question of who should govern Britain and that only the Conservative Party was advocating that the British should govern themselves. Thatcher had been labelled \"dictatorial\" for wanting to \"go it alone\" in Europe: \"Well, I do not mind somebody being dictatorial in defending my own rights and those of my fellow countrymen\u00a0... lose self-government, and I have lost everything, and for good\". This was the first election since 1970 in which Powell was advocating a vote for the Conservative Party.\nAfter Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Powell said that since Britain was not an ally of Kuwait in the \"formal sense\" and because the balance of power in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war. Powell said that \"Saddam Hussein has a long way to go yet before his troops come storming up the beaches of Kent or Sussex\". On 21 October he wrote, \"The world is full of evil men engaged in doing evil things. That does not make us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that we are to be his jailers and his judges?\u00a0... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state. I sometimes wonder if, when we shed our power, we omitted to shed our arrogance\".\nWhen Thatcher was challenged by Michael Heseltine for the leadership of the Conservative Party during November 1990, Powell said he would rejoin the party, which he had left in February 1974 over the issue of Europe, if Thatcher won, and would urge the public to support both her and, in Powell's view, national independence. He wrote to Thatcher's supporter Norman Tebbit on 16 November, telling him Thatcher was entitled to use his name and his support in any way she saw fit. Since she resigned on 22 November, Powell never rejoined the Conservatives. Powell wrote the following Sunday: \"Good news is seldom so good, nor bad news so bad, as at first sight it appears. Her downfall was due to having so few like-minded people on European integration amongst her colleagues, and as she had adopted a line that would improve her party's popularity, it was foolish of them to force her out.\" He added, \"The battle has been lost, but not the war. The fact abides that, outside the magic circle at the top, a deep-rooted opposition has been disclosed in the UK to surrendering to others the right to make our laws, fix our taxes, or decide our policies. Running deep beneath the overlay of years of indifference is still the attachment of the British public to their tradition of democracy. Their resentment on learning that their own decisions can be overruled from outside remains as obstinate as ever\". Thatcher had relit the flame of independence and \"what has happened once can happen again\u00a0... sooner or later those who aspire to govern\u00a0... will have to listen\".\nIn December 1991 Powell said that \"Whether Yugoslavia dissolves into two states or half a dozen states or does not dissolve at all makes no difference to the safety and well being of the United Kingdom\". The UK's national interests determined that the country should have \"a foreign policy which befits the sole insular and oceanic state in Europe\". During the 1992 general election Powell spoke for Nicholas Budgen in his old seat of Wolverhampton South West. He praised Budgen for his opposition to the Maastricht Treaty and condemned the rest of the Conservative Party for supporting it.\nFinal years.\nIn late 1992, aged 80, Powell was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In 1994, he published \"The Evolution of the Gospel: A New Translation of the First Gospel with Commentary and Introductory Essay\". On 5 November the \"European\" printed an article by Powell in which he said he did not expect the European Communities Act 1972 to be amended or repealed but added, \"Still, something has happened. There has been an explosion. Politicians, political parties, the public itself have looked into the abyss\u00a0... the British people, somehow or other, will not be parted from their right to govern themselves in parliament\".\nIn 1993, the 25-year anniversary of Powell's \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, Powell wrote an article for \"The Times\" in which he claimed the concentration of immigrant communities in inner cities would lead to \"communalism\", which would have grave effects on the electoral system: \"communalism and democracy, as the experience of India demonstrates, are incompatible\". In May he spoke for Alan Sked of the Anti-Federalist League (the forerunner of the UK Independence Party) who was standing at the Newbury by-election. Sked went on to lose his deposit at the by-election, polling only 601 votes (1.0 per cent). At Michael Portillo's 40th birthday party the same month, Thatcher greeted him enthusiastically and asked him: \"Enoch, I haven't seen you since your eightieth-birthday dinner. How are you?\" Powell replied, \"I'm eighty-one\". Powell's opinion of Thatcher had declined after she endorsed John Major at the 1992 general election, which he believed to be a repudiation of her fight against European integration following the Bruges speech.\nOn 16 May 1994 Powell spoke at the Bruges Group and said Europe had \"destroyed one Prime Minister and will destroy another Prime Minister yet\" and demanded that powers surrendered to the European Court of Justice to be repatriated. In June 1994 he wrote an article for the \"Daily Mail\" in which he stated that \"Britain is waking from the nightmare of being part of the continental bloc, to rediscover that these offshore islands belong to the outside world and lie open to its oceans\". Innovations in contemporary society did not worry him: \"When exploration has run its course, we shall revert to the normal type of living to which nature and instinct predispose us. The decline will not have been permanent. The deterioration will not have been irreversible\".\nIn his book \"The Evolution of the Gospel\", published in August 1994, Powell said he had arrived at the view that Jesus was not crucified but stoned to death by the Jews. Bishop John Austin Baker commented \"He is a great classicist, but theology is out of his academic field.\"\nFollowing Powell's death his friend Richard Ritchie recorded in 1998 that, \"during one of the habitual coal crises of recent years he told me that he had no objection to supporting the coal industry, either through the restriction of cheap coal imports or subsidy, if it were the country's wish to preserve local coal communities\".\nIn the 1990s Powell endorsed three UKIP candidates in parliamentary elections. He also turned down two invitations to stand for the party in elections, citing retirement.\nIn April 1995 he said in an interview that for the Conservatives \"defeat [at the next election] would help. It helps one to change one's tune\". The party was just \"slithering around\". The same month, he took part at a debate on Europe at the Cambridge Union and won.\nIn July 1995 there was a leadership election for the Conservative Party, in which Major resigned as leader of the party and stood in the election. Powell wrote, \"He says to the Sovereign: I no longer am leader of the majority party in the House of Commons; but I am carrying on as your Prime Minister. Now I don't think anybody can say that\u2014at least without inflicting damage on the constitution\". To seek to offer advice to the Queen while unable to feel they could command a majority in the Commons was \"tantamount to treating the monarch herself with disrespect and denying the very principle in which our parliamentary democracy is founded\". After Major's challenger, John Redwood, was defeated, Powell wrote to him, \"Dear Redwood, you will never regret the events of the last week or two. Patience will evidently have to be exercised\u2014and patience is the greatest of the political virtues\u2014by those of us who want to keep Britain independent and self-governed\".\nDuring the final years of his life, he managed occasional pieces of journalism and co-operated in a BBC documentary about his life in 1995 (\"Odd Man Out\" was broadcast on 11 November). In April 1996 he wrote an article for the \"Daily Express\" in which he said: \"Those who consented to the surrender made in 1972 will have to think again. Thinking again means that activity most unthinkable for politicians\u2014unsaying what has been said. The surrender\u00a0... we have made is not irrevocable. Parliament still has the power (thank God) to reclaim what has been surrendered by treaty. It is time we told the other European nations what we mean by being self-governed\". In October, he gave his last interview, to Matthew d'Ancona in the \"Sunday Telegraph\".\nHe said: \"I have lived into an age in which my ideas are now part of common intuition, part of a common fashion. It has been a great experience, having given up so much to find that there is now this range of opinion in all classes, that an agreement with the EEC is totally incompatible with normal parliamentary government.\u00a0... The nation has returned to haunt us\". When Labour won the 1997 general election, Powell told his wife, Pamela Wilson, \"They have voted to break up the United Kingdom.\" She rejoined the Conservative Party the next day, but he did not. By then, Powell had been hospitalised several times as a result of multiple falls.\nDeath.\nA few hours following Powell's final admission to King Edward VII's Hospital in London, he asked where his lunch was. On being told that he was being fed intravenously, he remarked, \"I don't call that much of a lunch.\" These were his last recorded words. He died there on 8 February 1998 at the age of 85. He was survived by his widow and two daughters. His study of the Gospel of John remained unfinished.\nDressed in his brigadier's uniform, Powell's body was buried in his regiment's plot in Warwick Cemetery, Warwickshire, ten days after a family funeral service at Westminster Abbey and public services at St Margaret's, Westminster, and the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick.\nFollowing Powell's death many politicians, including his rivals, paid tribute to him. Prime Minister Tony Blair said, \"However controversial his views, he was one of the great figures of 20th-century British politics, gifted with a brilliant mind. However much we disagreed with many of his views, there was no doubting the strength of his convictions or their sincerity, or his tenacity in pursuing them, regardless of his own political self-interest.\" Thatcher said, \"There will never be anybody else so compelling as Enoch Powell. He was magnetic. Listening to his speeches was an unforgettable privilege. He was one of those rare people who made a difference and whose moral compass led us in the right direction.\" Over 1,000 people attended Powell's funeral. During the ceremony he was hailed as a man of prophecy, political sacrifice and as a great parliamentarian. During the service Lord Biffen said that Powell's nationalism \"certainly did not bear the stamp of racial superiority or xenophobia\". Other mourners at the service included the socialist Labour MP Tony Benn, who, despite criticising the Rivers of Blood speech, maintained a close relationship with Powell. Asked why he had attended the funeral, Benn responded: \"he was my friend.\"\nPersonal life.\nPowell spoke German, French, Italian, Modern Greek and Hindi/Urdu, and had a reading knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Welsh. Among classical languages, he knew Ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic.\nCanon Eric James, a former Trinity College chaplain, revealed in a letter to \"The Times\" on 10 February 1998 that in his old age Powell confessed to him that he had been in love with a fellow male undergraduate at Cambridge (whom Michael Bloch believes was \"probably Edward Curtis of Clare College\") and that this infatuation had inspired love verses published in his \"First Poems\". Following his appointment as Professor of Greek at the University of Sydney in 1937, he wrote to his parents that he was repelled by his female students, while feeling \"an instant and instinctive affection\" for young Australian males. This, he added, might be \"deplored, but it cannot be altered\", and it therefore had to be \"endured \u2013 and (alas!) camouflaged.\" The letters are now in the Churchill College Archives.\nDespite his earlier atheism, Powell became a devout member of the Church of England. He subsequently became a church warden of St. Margaret's, Westminster.\nOn 2 January 1952 the 39-year-old Powell married 26-year-old Margaret Pamela Wilson, a former colleague from the Conservative Central Office. Their first daughter, Susan, was born in January 1954 and their second daughter, Jennifer, in October 1956. In Robert Shepherd's biography of Powell, it is noted that General Walter Cawthorn \"became almost a second father\" to him.\nPowell was an anti-Stratfordian who firmly believed that William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon was not the writer of the plays and poems of Shakespeare. He appeared on an episode of \"Frontline\", \"The Shakespeare Mystery,\" 19 April 1989, in which he said, \"My astonishment was to discover that these were the works of someone who'd 'been in the kitchen.' They are written by someone who has lived the life, who has been part of a life of politics and power, who knows what people feel when they are near to the centre of power. Near to the heat of the kitchen.\" He called the traditional biography a \"Stratfordian fantasy.\"\nIn his younger years, Powell published four collections of poems: \"First Poems\"; \"Casting Off\"; \"Dancer's End\"; and \"The Wedding Gift\". His \"Collected Poems\" appeared in 1990. As a young scholar he translated Herodotus' \"Histories\" and published many other works of classical scholarship. He also wrote a biography of Joseph Chamberlain in 1977. His political publications were often as critical of the Conservatives as they were of Labour, making fun of what he saw as logical fallacies in reasoning or action. His book \"Freedom &amp; Reality\" contained many quotations from Labour party manifestos or by Harold Wilson that he regarded as nonsensical.\nIn March 2015 \"The Independent\" reported that Powell was one of the MPs whose activities had been investigated as part of Operation Fernbridge. His name had been passed to police by Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, after allegations of Powell's involvement in historic child abuse in the Elm Guest House had been made by one individual in the 1980s to the then Bishop of Monmouth, Dominic Walker. The allegations referred purely to alleged membership of \"satanic cults\", the Church said. According to the police, no prominent person had ever been conclusively identified as having abused a child there.\nPolitical beliefs.\nPowell delivered his Rivers of Blood speech on 20 April 1968. A poll which was taken after the speech reported that 74 per cent of Britons agreed with Powell's opinions on mass immigration. In \"The Trial of Enoch Powell\", a Channel 4 television programme broadcast in April 1998, on the thirtieth anniversary of his Rivers of Blood speech (and two months after his death), 64 per cent of the studio audience voted that Powell was not a racist. Some in the Church of England, of which Powell was a member, took a different view. Upon Powell's death, black Barbados-born Wilfred Wood, then Bishop of Croydon, said \"Enoch Powell gave a certificate of respectability to white racist views which otherwise decent people were ashamed to acknowledge\".\nConservative commentator Bruce Anderson has claimed that the Rivers of Blood speech would have come as a complete surprise to anyone who had studied Powell's record: he had been a West Midlands MP for 18 years but had said hardly anything about immigration. On this view, the speech was merely part of a badly miscalculated strategy to become party leader if Heath fell. Anderson adds that the speech had no effect on immigration, except to make it more difficult for the subject to be discussed rationally in polite society.\nPowell's opponents claimed he was far-right, fascist and racist. His supporters claim that the first two charges clash with his voting record on most social issues, such as homosexual law reform (he was in fact a co-sponsor of a bill on this issue in May 1965 and opposed the death penalty, both reforms unpopular among Conservatives at the time; however, he kept a low profile to his stance on these non-party \"issues of conscience\"). Powell voted against the reinstitution of the death penalty several times between 1969 and 1987.\nBy the early 1960s, Powell was in support of the campaign for immigration controls. The earliest and only statement from then by Powell on immigration was in August 1956, when, in Wolverhampton, Powell said that \"a fundamental change in the law is necessary\" in the UK's citizenship law. However, he explained that a change was not needed at that time but did not rule out the possibility of a future change. In the late 1950s, when other Conservatives were advocating a campaign for immigration control following race riots, Powell declined to join them, remarking that it was no good discussing the details when the \"real issue\" of the citizenship laws had remained unchanged. In November 1960, Powell became one of nine members of the ministerial committee which wanted to introduce controls of Commonwealth immigration; he submitted a letter in April 1961 which said \"if we desire to limitations or conditions on the entry of coloured British subjects into this country\" a change in the existing legal definition of a \"British subject\" was needed, since the British Nationality Act 1948 considered all those from independent Commonwealth countries listed under Britain's nationality law to be British subjects.\nIn February 1967 Powell wrote an article for the \"Daily Telegraph\" titled \"Facing up to Britain's Race Problem\" in which he wrote that, long before the immigrant population had reached 5% of the overall proportion of the United Kingdom, a \"proportion would have filtered into the general population, mingled with it in occupation, residence, habits and intermarriage\" compared to the other proportion which would be \"more separated than now in habits, occupation and way of life\".\nConcerns raised about the effects of coloured immigration in communities in his constituency played a part in his commentary. In March 1968 the month before the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, he made his first public references to them in a speech in Walsall, when he described the concern of an anonymous constituent whose daughter was the only white child in her primary school class and suffered bullying from non-white pupils. When \"Wolverhampton Express and Star\" journalists failed to find the child or the class, the paper's editor and a then personal friend, Clement Jones, challenged him, stating Jones himself had similar anonymous complaints that were traced to members of the National Front (NF). Powell would not accept the explanation and told Jones he had received \"bags of supporting mail\" as a result of the Walsall speech.\nDuring an interview with the \"Birmingham Post\", a fortnight after Powell's \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, he was asked whether or not he was a racialist. He replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What I would take racialist to mean is a person who believes in the inherent inferiority of one race of mankind to another, and who acts and speaks in that belief. So the answer to your question of whether I am a racialist is 'No' \u2013 unless perhaps, in reverse. I regard many of the peoples in India as being superior in many respects \u2013 intellectually, for example, and in other respects \u2013 to Europeans. Perhaps that is over-reacting.\nPowell accepted an invitation to appear on David Frost's evening television programme on 3 January 1969. Frost asked Powell whether or not he was a racialist, to which Powell replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It depends on how you define the word \"racialist\". If you mean being conscious of the differences between men and nations, and from that, races, then we are all racialists. However, if you mean a man who despises a human being because he belongs to another race, or a man who believes that one race is inherently superior to another, then the answer is emphatically \"No\".\nDuring the 1970 election, Tony Benn declared in a speech that Powell's approach to immigration was \"evil\": \"The flag of racialism which has been hoisted in Wolverhampton is beginning to look like the one that fluttered over Dachau and Belsen.\" In response, when a television reporter told Powell at a meeting of Benn's comments, Powell snatched the microphone and replied: \"All I will say is that for myself, in 1939 I voluntarily returned from Australia to this country, to serve as a private soldier against Germany and Nazism. I am the same man today.\" Similarly, Powell responded to student hecklers at a speech in Cardiff: \"I hope those who shouted 'Fascist' and 'Nazi' are aware that before they were born I was fighting against Fascism and Nazism.\"\nIn November 1968 Powell also suggested that the problems that would be caused if there were a large influx of Germans or Russians into Britain \"would be as serious \u2013 and in some respects more serious \u2013 than could follow from the introduction of a similar number of West Indies or Pakistanis\".\nPowell said his views were neither genetic nor eugenic and that he never arranged his fellow men on a merit according to their origins.\nPowell said in a 1964 speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have and always will set my face like flint against making any difference between one citizen of this country and another on grounds of his origins.\nIn a speech in November 1968, he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The West Indian or Asian does not, by being born in England, become an Englishman. In law he becomes a United Kingdom citizen by birth; in fact he is a West Indian or an Asian still.\nIn 1944, when Powell was visiting Poona with another member of the Joint Intelligence Committee, an Indian, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Field Marshal) K. M. Cariappa, he refused to stay at the Byculla Club once it became clear that Cariappa, as an Indian, would not be allowed to stay there. Close friends also recall that Powell took great pleasure in speaking Urdu when dining at Indian restaurants.\nNevertheless, Powell's nationalism and accusations of racialism sometimes trod a fine line. In 1996 the BBC journalist Michael Cockerell asked him about the language he used in the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, arguing that it could be used by self-proclaimed racialists against non-whites. In defence of the language he used in the speech, Powell replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What's wrong with racism? Racism is the basis of a nationality. Nations are, upon the whole, united by identity with one another, the self-identification of our citizens, and that's normally due to similarities which are regarded as racial differences.\nPowell further went on to say that \"it's not impossible but it's difficult, for a non-white person to be British.\"\nVictoria Honeyman, Lecturer in Politics at the University of Leeds in England, wrote of Powell's beliefs on immigration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Enoch Powell was, like other politicians such as Keith Joseph, an intellectual in the true sense of the word. He would follow the logic of an intellectual argument to its conclusion, regardless of how unpalatable that conclusion was, and then present it and often expect others to appreciate his process.\u00a0... Powell is usually viewed as being a racist, but that is too simplistic. Powell was interested in what he saw as being best for Britain.\u00a0... While it is easy to label him a racist, if you view his argument as an intellectual argument, he simply delivered what he considered the reasoned conclusion to it. It was not a reflection on Indian and Pakistani people, only a comment on what immigration from these countries might do to Britain.\nPowell's speeches and television interviews throughout his political life displayed a suspicion towards \"the Establishment\" in general, and by the 1980s there was a regular expectation that he would make some sort of speech or act in a way designed to upset the government and ensure he would not be offered a life peerage (and thus be transferred to the House of Lords). Some believe he had no intention of accepting a peerage as long as Heath sat in the Commons (which he did until after Powell's death.) Powell had opposed the Life Peerages Act and felt it would be hypocritical to accept one himself since no prime minister had ever offered him a hereditary peerage.\nLegacy.\nPowell sat for the sculptor Alan Thornhill for a portrait in clay. The correspondence file relating to the Powell portrait bust is held as part of the Thornhill Papers (2006:56) in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation's Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist. The English photographer Allan Warren produced many portraits of Powell.\nThere are 24 images of Powell in the National Portrait Gallery Collection including work by Alexander Bassano's studios, Anne-Katrin Purkiss, and a 1971 cartoon by Gerald Scarfe.\nPowell's \"Rivers of Blood\" speech was subject of the play \"What Shadows\" by Chris Hannan, staged in Birmingham from 27 October to 12 November 2016, with Powell portrayed by the Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid and Clem Jones by George Costigan. Powell appears briefly as a character in James Graham's 2021 play \"Best of Enemies\".\nIn August 2002 Powell appeared 55th in the list of \"100 Greatest Britons\" of all time (voted for by the public in a BBC nationwide poll).\nKeir Starmer's \"Island of strangers\" speech in 2025 received comparisons to Powell's \"Rivers of Blood\" speech. The Prime Minister's Office rejected comparisons to Powell and defended use of the phrase, saying that Starmer was \"using his own words to rightly both recognise the contribution migrants have made over generations and to make the point that uncontrolled migration has been too high\". Starmer later said that using the phrase was a mistake, saying it \"wasn't right. I'll give you the honest truth: I deeply regret using it\".\nElections contested.\nUK Parliament elections\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Previously, Tru64 UNIX was a product of Compaq, and before that, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), where it was known as Digital UNIX (originally DEC OSF/1 AXP).\nAs its original name suggests, Tru64 UNIX is based on the OSF/1 operating system. DEC's previous UNIX product was known as Ultrix and was based on BSD.\nIt is unusual among commercial UNIX implementations, as it is built on top of the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University. (Other UNIX and UNIX-like implementations built on top of the Mach kernel are GNU Hurd, NeXTSTEP, MkLinux, and Darwin.)\nTru64 UNIX required the SRM boot firmware found on Alpha-based computer systems.\nDEC OSF/1 AXP.\nIn 1988, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) joined with IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and others to form the Open Software Foundation (OSF). A primary aim was to develop a version of Unix, named OSF/1, to compete with System V Release 4 from AT&amp;T Corporation and Sun Microsystems. After DEC's first release (OSF/1 Release 1.0) in January 1992 for their line of MIPS-based DECstation workstations, DEC ported OSF/1 to their new Alpha AXP platform (as DEC OSF/1 AXP), and this was the first version (Release 1.2) of what is most commonly referred to as OSF/1. DEC OSF/1 AXP Release 1.2 was shipped in March 1993. OSF/1 AXP was a full 64-bit operating system and the native UNIX implementation for the Alpha architecture. After OSF/1 AXP V2.0 onwards, UNIX System V compatibility was also integrated into the system.\nDigital UNIX.\nIn 1995, starting with release 3.2, DEC renamed OSF/1 AXP to Digital UNIX to reflect its conformance with the X/Open Single UNIX Specification.\nTru64 UNIX.\nAfter Compaq's purchase of DEC in early 1998, with the release of version 4.0F, Digital UNIX was renamed to Tru64 UNIX to emphasise its 64-bit-clean nature and de-emphasise the Digital brand.\nIn April 1999, Compaq announced that Tru64 UNIX 5.0 successfully ran on Intel's IA-64 simulator. However, this port was cancelled a few months later.\nA Chinese version of Tru64 UNIX named COSIX was jointly developed by Compaq and China National Computer Software &amp; Technology Service Corporation (CS&amp;S). It was released in 1999.\nTruCluster Server.\nFrom release V5.0 Tru64 UNIX offered a clustering facility named TruCluster Server. TruCluster utilised a cluster-wide filesystem visible to each cluster member, plus member specific storage and an optional quorum disk. Member specific files paths were enhanced symbolic links incorporating the member id of the owning member. Each member had one or zero votes, which, combined with a possible quorum disk, implemented a cluster formation algorithm similar to that found in OpenVMS.\nEnd of Life.\nWith their purchase of Compaq in 2002, HP announced their intention to migrate many of Tru64 UNIX's more innovative features (including its AdvFS, TruCluster, and LSM) to HP-UX. In December 2004, HP announced a change of plan: they would instead use the Veritas File System and abandon the Tru64 advanced features. In the process, many of the remaining Tru64 developers were laid off.\nThe last maintenance release, 5.1B-6 was released in October 2010.\nIn October 2010, HP stated that they would continue to support Tru64 UNIX until 31 December 2012.\nIn 2008, HP contributed the AdvFS filesystem to the open-source community.\nVersions.\nThese versions were released for Alpha AXP platforms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Introduced in 1964, shipped since 1965, it was the first to use their Flip-Chip technology. With a cost of US$, it was cheap but powerful by the standards of the time. The PDP-7 is the third of Digital's 18-bit machines, with essentially the same instruction set architecture as the PDP-4 and the PDP-9.\nHardware.\nThe PDP-7 was the first wire-wrapped PDP computer. The computer has a memory cycle time of 1.75 \u00b5s and an add time of 4 \u00b5s. Input/output (I/O) includes a keyboard, printer, punched tape and dual transport DECtape drives (type 555). The standard core memory capacity is 4K words (9 KB) but expandable up to 64K words (144 KB).\nThe PDP-7 weighs about .\nSoftware.\nDECsys, the first operating system for DEC's 18-bit computer family (and DEC's first operating system for a computer smaller than its 36-bit timesharing systems), was introduced in 1965. It provides an interactive, single user, program development environment for Fortran and assembly language programs.\nIn 1969, Ken Thompson wrote the first UNIX system, then named Unics as a pun on Multics despite only using two design elements from Multics, in assembly language on a PDP-7, as the operating system for \"Space Travel\", a game which requires graphics to depict the motion of the planets. A PDP-7 was also the development system used during the development of MUMPS at MGH in Boston a few years earlier.\nSales.\nThe PDP-7 was described as \"highly successful.\" A combined total of 120 of the PDP-7 and PDP-7A were sold. A DEC publication states that the first units shipped to customers in November 1964.\nEleven systems were shipped to the UK.\nRestorations.\nAt least four PDP-7s were confirmed to still exist as of 2011 and a fifth was discovered in 2017.\nA PDP-7A (serial number 115) was under restoration in Oslo, Norway; a second PDP-7A (serial number 113) previously located at the University of Oregon in its Nuclear Physics laboratory was at the Living Computer Museum in Seattle, Washington and is completely restored to running condition after being disassembled for transport; Another PDP-7 (serial number 47) is known to be in the collection of Max Burnet near Sydney, Australia, a fourth PDP-7 (serial number 33) is in storage at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California and a fifth PDP-7 (serial number 129) belonging to Fred Yerian is also located at the Museum, and has been demonstrated running Unix version 0 and compiling a B program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bell Labs was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, due to the 1956 Consent Decree AT&amp;T was not permitted to conduct business in any other field hence couldn't sell the software, though it was required, paradoxically, to license its inventions, such as Unix and the transistor. Western Electric, another AT&amp;T subsidiary, administered the licensing. From 1977, with the v7 &amp; later licenses, AT&amp;T forbade code commentaries for teaching and allowed only one copy of the Lions Commentary, printed, per license.\nThe UNIX User's group, USENIX's newsletter, \"UNIX News\", of March 1977, announced the availability of the book to UNIX licensees.\nDifficulty in keeping pace with the book's popularity, meant that by 1978 it was available only from AT&amp;T Bell Labs.\nWhen AT&amp;T announced UNIX Version 7 at USENIX in June 1979, the academic/research license no longer automatically permitted classroom use. However, thousands of computer science students around the world spread photocopies. As they were not being taught it in class, they would sometimes meet after hours to discuss the book. Many pioneers of UNIX and open source had a treasured multiple-generation photocopy.\nOther follow-on effects of the license change included Andrew S. Tanenbaum creating Minix. As Tanenbaum wrote in \"Operating Systems\" (1987):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When AT&amp;T released Version 7, it began to realize that UNIX was a valuable commercial product, so it issued Version 7 with a license that prohibited the source code from being studied in courses, in order to avoid endangering its status as a trade secret. Many universities complied by simply dropping the study of UNIX, and teaching only theory.\nVarious UNIX people, particularly Peter H. Salus, Dennis Ritchie and Berny Goodheart, lobbied Unix's various owners (AT&amp;T, Novell, the Santa Cruz Operation) for many years to allow the book to be published officially. In 1996, the Santa Cruz Operation finally authorised the release of the twenty-year-old 6th Edition source code (along with the source code of other versions of \"Ancient UNIX\"), and the full code plus the 1977 version of the commentary was published by Peer-To-Peer Communications (). The reissue includes commentary from Michael Tilson (SCO), Peter Salus, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Peter Collinson, Greg Rose, Mike O'Dell, Berny Goodheart and Peter Reintjes.\nContents.\n\"UNIX Operating System Source Code Level Six\" is the kernel source code, lightly edited by Lions to better separate the functionality\u00a0\u2014 system initialization and process management, interrupts and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. All procedures and symbols are listed alphabetically with a cross reference.\nThe code as presented will run on a PDP-11/40 with RK05 disk drive, LP11 line printer interface, PCL11 paper tape writer and KL11 terminal interface, or a suitable PDP-11 emulator, such as SIMH.\n\"A Commentary on the UNIX Operating System\" starts with notes on UNIX and other useful documentation (the UNIX manual pages, DEC hardware manuals and so on), a section on the architecture of the PDP-11 and a chapter on how to read C programs. The source commentary follows, divided into the same sections as the code. The book ends with suggested exercises for the student.\nAs Lions explains, this commentary supplements the comments in the source. It is possible to understand the code without the extra commentary, and the reader is advised to do so and only read the notes as needed. The commentary also remarks on how the code might be improved.\n\"You are not expected to understand this\".\nThe infamous program comment \"You are not expected to understand this\" occurs on line 2238 of the source code (\"Lions' Commentary\", p.\u00a022) at the end of a comment explaining the process exchange mechanism. It refers to line 325 of the file slp.c. The source code reads:\n /*\n * If the new process paused because it was\n * swapped out, set the stack level to the last call\n * to savu(u_ssav). This means that the return\n * which is executed immediately after the call to aretu\n * actually returns from the last routine which did\n * the savu.\n * You are not expected to understand this.\n if(rp-&gt;p_flag&amp;SSWAP) {\n rp-&gt;p_flag =&amp; ~SSWAP;\n aretu(u.u_ssav);\nA major reason why this piece of code was hard to understand was that it depended on a quirk of the way the C compiler for the PDP-11 saved registers in procedure calls. This code failed when ported to other machines and had to be redesigned in Version 7 UNIX. Dennis Ritchie later explained the meaning of this remark:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You are not expected to understand this\" was intended as a remark in the spirit of \"This won't be on the exam\", rather than as an impudent challenge.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38282", "revid": "50596857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38282", "title": "NOFX", "text": "American punk rock band\nNOFX () was an American punk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. Bassist/lead vocalist Fat Mike, rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin and drummer Erik Sandin were original founding and longest-serving members of the band, who have appeared on every release by the band, although Sandin had departed briefly in 1985, only to rejoin the following year. El Hefe joined the band in 1991 to play lead guitar and trumpet, rounding out the best-known iteration of the lineup.\nNOFX's mainstream success coincided with increased interest in punk rock during the 1990s; unlike many of their contemporaries, however, they had never been signed to a major label. NOFX released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays and a number of 7\" singles over a career spanning more than four decades. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album \"Punk in Drublic\" (1994), which is their only release to receive a gold certification by the RIAA. Their fifteenth and final studio album, \"Double Album\", was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent bands ever. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on Fuse entitled \"NOFX: Backstage Passport\". The band retired in October 2024 after a farewell tour.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1983\u20131987).\nIn 1983, guitarist Eric Melvin met bassist/vocalist Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and started the band under the name NO-FX, after a Boston hardcore punk band called Negative FX. At this time, they were joined by drummer Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin. NOFX's first recording was a demo from 1984, entitled \"Thalidomide Child\", produced by Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell many copies, and Fat Mike once claimed that no copies existed. The demo would be re-released in 2012. The group released its self-titled debut extended play \"NOFX\" on Mystic Records in 1985; it was later re-released in 1992 as part of the \"Maximum Rocknroll\" CD.\nThe band's line-up underwent numerous changes prior to 1991. For a year, Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released the extended play \"So What If We're on Mystic!\". Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play \"The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This\", attacking the PMRC's campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&amp;M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of \"Liberal Animation\", a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the \"NOFX\" and \"So What If We're on Mystic!\" extended plays, and only around 1,000 copies were pressed. The album's cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the \"NOFX\" extended play.\nFirst four albums and signing to Epitaph (1988\u20131993).\nNOFX recorded their debut studio album \"Liberal Animation\" in 1988 with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some of the album's lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after writing the \"Liberal Animation\" album. The album was reissued in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph Records. Casillas left the band shortly after the recording of \"Liberal Animation\" and was replaced by Steve Kidwiler. The band released its second studio album, \"S&amp;M Airlines\", through Epitaph in 1989.\nIn 1991, NOFX released its third studio album, \"Ribbed\". Shortly after the album was released, Steve Kidwiler left the band, and Aaron Abeyta (a.k.a. \"El Hefe\") joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play \"The Longest Line\", followed by the studio album \"White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean\", released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX's former label Mystic Records released \"Maximum Rocknroll\", which compiles early singles and demo songs, and is a reissue of their 1989 long-out-of-print compilation tape \"E Is for Everything\". Despite being referred to as an \"official\" release, Fat Mike has been quoted as saying that he did not know that the album existed until he saw a copy of it \"in a store.\"\nRise to popularity (1994\u20131999).\nIn the wake of the 1990s punk rock revival revolution (dominated by Green Day, the Offspring, Bad Religion and Rancid), NOFX released their fifth studio album \"Punk in Drublic\" in July 1994. It is one of the band's most successful albums, peaking at number twelve on \"Billboard\"'s Heatseekers chart, and obtaining gold status six years after its release. Although one of the album's singles \"Leave It Alone\" got airplay on active rock radio stations, the most notable being KROQ, its music video never received airplay on MTV. Fat Mike has been quoted saying, \"We made the 'Leave It Alone' video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn't want to be a part of that machine, of that 'punk wave.'\" \"Punk in Drublic\" is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike.\nDue to the success of \"Punk in Drublic\", NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. In 1995, the band released its first live album, \"I Heard They Suck Live!!\". In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating \"We've been doing fine all these years without you so leave us alone!\" \n\"Punk in Drublic\" was followed by 1996's \"Heavy Petting Zoo\", whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name \"Eating Lamb\". The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a 69 position with the sheep. The \"Eating Lamb\" version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the \"Billboard\" charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: \"Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium.\"\nIn 1997, the band released \"So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes\", a return to faster punk, as exemplified by the frenetic opening track, \"It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite.\"\nNOFX released \"The Decline\", an 18-minute single-track extended play, which served as a fiery and cynical social commentary, in 1999. \"The Decline\", clocking in at 18:23, is the second-longest punk song ever recorded (behind Crass' 20-minute song \"Taking Sides\").\nMove from Epitaph to Fat Wreck Chords (2000\u20132008).\nNOFX released its eighth studio album, \"Pump Up the Valuum\", in 2000. It was the band's final album released through Epitaph, as the band decided to sign to Fat Mike's own label, Fat Wreck Chords.\nIn 2002, the band recorded \"BYO Split Series Volume III\", a split album with Rancid, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.\nNOFX released its ninth studio album, \"The War on Errorism\", in 2003, an album of political songs. It became the start of its anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping \"Rock Against Bush\" albums, and started a Rock Against Bush U.S. tour. The song \"Separation of Church and Skate\" from the album was featured in the game \"Tony Hawk's Underground\". In 2004, a previously unreleased demo version of their song \"Concerns of a GOP Neo-Phyte\" was contributed to the compilation album \"Take Action! Vol. 4\".\nIn February 2005, the band launched the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service, which saw the release of one new extended play almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3,000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the extended plays.\nOn March 14, 2006, the EP \"Never Trust a Hippy\" was released. It was followed on April 18 by the studio album \"Wolves in Wolves' Clothing\". On September 12, 2006, the video game \"EA Sports\" \"NHL 07\" was released, featuring \"Wolves in Wolves' Clothing\" on its soundtrack, produced by Bill Stevenson and Fat Mike. NOFX's song \"Kill All the White Man\" was played briefly in the action movie \"Crank\" in 2006, and was credited as such in the film's soundtrack.\nIn January 2007, the band recorded three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, \"They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!\", released November 20, 2007. The live album is described on the press release as \"their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever ... and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album \"I Heard They Suck Live!!\".\"\nNOFX launched a world tour in September 2007, which was the basis for a documentary, \"NOFX: Backstage Passport\", which aired on Fuse TV about its worldwide tour. The show was entitled \"NOFX: Backstage Passport\".\n\"Coaster\", \"Cokie the Clown\" and \"Self-Entitled\" (2009\u20132014).\nIn February 2009, NOFX reunited with former members Steve Kidwiler and Dave Casillas for its 25th-anniversary special performances. They played three sold-out shows, one in San Diego, one in Hollywood, and one in S.F. NOFX released a new album, \"Coaster\", on April 28, 2009. The band worked with the same co-producer, Bill Stevenson, who produced its previous album, \"Wolves in Wolves' Clothing\". NOFX was also added to the lineup for the Warped Tour 2009. They also toured Australia and New Zealand in late 2009 with Bad Religion.\nNOFX released a new extended play on November 24, 2009, titled \"Cokie the Clown\". It was released on one CD or two seven-inch vinyl records, which are called \"Cokie the Clown\" and \"My Orphan Year\". The extended play consists of outtakes from the \"Coaster\" sessions. NOFX started its spring 2010 \"Fermented and Flailing\" tour on April 21. This was the official tour for its album \"Coaster\".\nDuring this time period, Fat Mike would occasionally adopt the Cokie the Clown persona (as seen on the extended play's cover and the \"Cokie the Clown\" music video) during live performances. Fat Mike performed a solo acoustic performance on March 20, 2010, at the SXSW Festival as Cokie, which was described as \"strange, emotional, and intimate.\" At the end of the concert, after debuting a new song called \"Drinking Pee\", a video that was played for the audience suggested that a number of festival participants unknowingly drank Fat Mike's urine. The stunt resulted in Fat Mike getting banned from the Austin, Texas, venue, Emo's. In May 2010, NOFX posted a video online that showed Fat Mike urinating into a bottle of Patr\u00f3n as was previously announced, but then switching the bottle before going on stage to a bottle not containing any urine. Months later in an interview, Mike stated that he had \"always wanted to be banned from somewhere.\"\nOn June 21, 2010, NOFX announced that they were going to release a compilation album titled \"The Longest EP,\" a compilation of selected songs from its extended plays from 1987 to 2009. It was released on August 17, 2010.\nOn November 23, 2010, Fat Wreck Chords released \"NOFX / The Spits\", a split EP with the Seattle, Washington, band the Spits. It contained two new songs from each band.\nIn a January 2011 interview with The Daily Times, Fat Mike revealed that a new NOFX album was in production, saying \"There are some really good songs on \"Coaster\", but after having written 300 songs, I feel lucky I came up with them. That's why there are songs on there about Iron Maiden and Tegan and Sara. I'm reaching, man. Sometimes I grab stuff just to grab stuff, and I'm going in a lot of different directions.\" In December 2011, Fat Mike revealed to \"Phoenix New Times\" that he has begun work on a new NOFX album and a soundtrack to a \"fetish film\" called \"Rubber Bordello\".\nIn June 2011, NOFX began their Great White North Tour, which would have them traveling across Canada. The tour kicked off in St. John's, Newfoundland, on June 14. It was the first time the band had been to Newfoundland.\nAlong with a self-titled 10\" of 1980s hardcore punk cover songs, the band also planned to re-release their first recordings in the summer of 2011. The 10\" features covers from the Necros and D.O.A. and songs such as \"Police Brutality\" and \"Race Riot.\" The album was released on a vinyl record and has been distributed to independent record companies around the U.S., Great Britain, and elsewhere.\nOn February 14, 2012, in an article on \"Rolling Stone\"'s website, Fat Mike said that a new album was on the way. \"We're recording in April, and it should be out in the fall. I've got 12 songs, but I don't have a name for it, and only a few of the songs are finished,\" he says. \"We're demo-ing it right now.\"\nA 7\" single, \"My Stepdad's a Cop and My Stepmom's a Domme\", featuring new songs recorded prior to the sessions for \"Self Entitled\", was released in June 2012.\nNOFX released their twelfth studio album, \"Self Entitled\", on September 11, 2012. NOFX also released \"X'mas Has Been X'd\" on January 15, 2013, and their 30th anniversary LP box set on February 19, 2013.\nNOFX toured in Australia starting November 5, 2014. They performed in Sydney, Newcastle, New South Wales, Wollongong, Brisbane, Darwin, Northern Territory, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Geelong, and Gold Coast, Queensland.\n\"First Ditch Effort\" and singles (2015\u20132020).\nNOFX toured the United States in the summer of 2015 celebrating the 25th anniversary of Fat Wreck Chords. Supporting acts for this tour were Lagwagon, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Strung Out, Propagandhi, Swingin' Utters, Bracket, ToyGuitar, the Flatliners, Masked Intruder and Bad Cop/Bad Cop. Guitarist El Hefe said that NOFX was going to work on new music after the Fat Wreck Chords 25th anniversary tour. On their tour to Europe, NOFX stated their new album would be out in September 2016. On July 19, 2016, the band's thirteenth studio album, \"First Ditch Effort\", was announced, to be released on October 7; the lead single \"Six Years on Dope\" was released the same day. On April 17, 2016, they released their autobiography, called \"NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories.\" During the tour, named the Hepatitis Bathtub Tour, they did book signings on some dates. On December 16 a special hard-covered edition with a seven-inch four-song vinyl (titled \"Hepatitis Bathtub\") and a bath towel was also released.\nIn March 2018, NOFX released a new single \"There's No 'Too Soon' if Time Is Relative\", in tribute to physicist Stephen Hawking, who had died days earlier. The track had been recorded a month prior to its release. Several days later, they announced the first annual \"Camp Punk in Drublic Festival\" in Legend Valley in Thornville, Ohio. The three-day event was to feature NOFX alongside Rancid, Pennywise, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. In a May 2018 interview, Fat Mike hinted that NOFX was working on new material.\nIn February 2019, Fat Mike announced the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a new subscription-based service scheduled for the release of 12 new extended plays almost monthly. As with the previous 2005 installment, the cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries.\nOn August 16, 2019, NOFX released a new single, \"Fish in a Gun Barrel\". The song was written in response to mass shootings in America, with proceeds from the single going to anti-gun-violence charity Moms Demand Action.\nOn March 23, 2020, NOFX released a video for another new song, \"PRBOD\". A few days later, the band released a video for \"another new song that didn't make it on the new album\" called \"The Oddition\".\nFinal recordings, retirement and post-retirement releases (2021\u2013present).\nOn January 12, 2021, NOFX announced that they would release their first studio album in nearly five years, \"Single Album\", on February 26.\nOn September 1, 2022, Fat Mike confirmed in a reply to a comment in an Instagram post that NOFX would be disbanding in 2023, the year of the band's 40th anniversary, and suggested that their final show may take place in their hometown of Los Angeles, California.\nOn September 27, 2022, NOFX announced their next album, \"Double Album\", would come out on December 2, 2022. They released the single \"Darby Crashing,\" a reworked version of a song from their 2019-2020 \"7 inch of the Month Club\", on the same day.\nNOFX also announced three in-progress albums: \"Half Album\", \"Everybody Else Is Insane\", and \"NOFX: A\u2013Z\". On March 6, 2024, \"Half Album\" was revealed to be an EP, which was released on April 19, 2024, and the band released the single \"I'm a Rat\".\nNOFX played their final ever live shows after 41 years of performing live from October 4\u20136, 2024 in San Pedro, California. During their final show on October 6, NOFX played a new song that they had never performed live before or even released, \"We Did It Our Way\", as their penultimate song in the show. Fat Mike described it as their \"thank you\" to fans and everyone onstage.\nOn July 9, 2025, a NOFX single titled \"Barcelona\" was released on streaming services. Although the song dates back to 2013, it \"is the newest and last NOFX song written and recorded post-NOFX's final shows\", and will be featured on the band's upcoming compilation album \"A-H\", to be released on December 19, 2025.\nMusical style and influences.\nNOFX's music is characterized by \"hooky tunes and a snarky sense of humor\", according to John Bush of AllMusic. Critics have labeled the band's style as primarily punk rock, melodic hardcore, skate punk, ska punk, and pop-punk. Fat Mike, in a 2021 \"Spin\" interview, identified NOFX as a melodic hardcore band, rejecting critics' labeling of the band's style as pop-punk.\nThe band cites its influences as Bad Religion, Rich Kids on LSD, D.I., SNFU, Operation Ivy, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Dead Milkmen, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Adrenalin O.D., Minor Threat, Germs, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, the Adolescents, Misfits, and Subhumans.\nControversy.\nIn 2018, the band attracted significant controversy after statements by Fat Mike and rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin during a concert in Las Vegas on May 30, 2018. Referencing the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Melvin stated \"I guess you only get shot in Vegas if you're in a country band,\" and Mike replied with \u201cYou know, that [massacre] sucked, but least they were country fans and not punk rock fans.\" The lead sponsor of the Punk in Drublic festival, Stone Brewing Co., pulled support from the festival as well as from NOFX's line of craft beer. NOFX and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were subsequently removed from the festival's lineup.\nThe band later apologized, stating, \"What we said in Vegas was shitty and insensitive and we are all embarrassed by our remarks.\" In June 2018 the band stated that all of their U.S. concerts had been canceled and they had been \"effectively banned\" from playing in the United States due to the comments. However, Fat Mike later clarified otherwise, stating that \"Our promoter canceled \u2014 my partner [not the venues].\"\nBand members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38283", "revid": "50872924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38283", "title": "Glam rock", "text": "Genre of rock music\nGlam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was primarily defined by the hairstyles, makeup, and flamboyant clothing of its musicians, particularly platform shoes and glitter. Glam artists drew on diverse sources, ranging from bubblegum pop and 1950s rock and roll to cabaret, science fiction, and complex art rock. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous and have been described as playing with other gender roles.\nThe UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975. The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC's music show \"Top of the Pops\"\u2014performing \"Hot Love\"\u2014wearing glitter and satins, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists included David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music, Alvin Stardust, Wizzard and Gary Glitter. In the United States, the scene was much less prevalent, but US artists such as New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Lou Reed and Jobriath achieved success in the UK and/or US. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including punk rock, post-punk, gothic rock and glam metal. The new romantic movement, which began as an underground fashion subculture movement in nightclubs in the late 1970s before becoming mainstream in the early 1980s, was also inspired by the visuals of the glam rock era.\nCharacteristics.\nGlam rock can be seen as a fashion as well as musical subgenre. When it emerged in the 1970s, it was primarily defined by the flamboyant clothing, makeup, and hairstyles of its musicians, particularly platform shoes and glitter. Glam artists rejected the revolutionary rhetoric of the late 1960s rock scene, instead glorifying decadence, superficiality, and the simple structures of earlier pop music. In response to these characteristics, scholars such as I.Taylor and D. Wall characterised glam rock as \"offensive, commercial, and cultural emasculation\".\nArtists drew on such musical influences as bubblegum pop, the brash guitar riffs of hard rock, stomping rhythms, and 1950s rock and roll, filtering them through the recording innovations of the late 1960s. Ultimately, it became very diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art pop of Roxy Music. In its beginning, it was a youth-orientated reaction to the creeping dominance of progressive rock and concept albums \u2013 what \"Bomp!\" called the \"overall denim dullness\" of \"a deadly boring, prematurely matured music scene\".\nVisually, it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamour, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles, science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. Glam rock is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics.\nIt was prefigured by the flamboyant English composer No\u00ebl Coward, especially his 1931 song \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\", with music writer Daryl Easlea stating, \"No\u00ebl Coward's influence on people like Bowie, Roxy Music and Cockney Rebel was absolutely immense. It suggested style, artifice and surface were equally as important as depth and substance. \"Time\" magazine noted Coward's 'sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise'. It reads like a glam manifesto.\" Showmanship and gender identity manipulation acts included the Cockettes and Alice Cooper, the latter of which combined glam with shock rock.\nHistory.\nGlam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of, and a reaction against, those trends. Its origins are associated with Marc Bolan, who had renamed his acoustic duo T. Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Bolan was, in the words of music critic Ken Barnes, \"the man who started it all\". Often cited as the moment of inception is Bolan's appearance on the BBC music show \"Top of the Pops\" in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), \"Hot Love\". \"The Independent\" states that Bolan's appearance on \"Top of the Pops\" \"permitted a generation of teeny-boppers to begin playing with the idea of androgyny\". Glitter rock was briefly the original name for the genre, but then \"glam rock\" overtook the previous term in popularity; \"glitter rock\" came to be associated with a more extreme version of glam rock. T. Rex's 1971 album \"Electric Warrior\" received critical acclaim as a pioneering glam rock album. In 1973, a few months after the release of the album \"Tanx\", Bolan captured the front cover of \"Melody Maker\" magazine with the declaration \"Glam rock is dead!\"\nFrom late 1971, already a minor star, David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional makeup, mime and performance into his act. Bowie, in a 1972 interview in which he noted that other artists described as glam rock were doing different work, said \"I think glam rock is a lovely way to categorize me and it's even nicer to be one of the leaders of it\". Bolan and Bowie were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, Sweet, Slade, Mott the Hoople, Mud and Alvin Stardust. The popularity of glam rock in the UK was such that three glam rock bands had major UK Christmas hit singles; \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" by Slade, \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\" by Wizzard and \"Lonely This Christmas\" by Mud, all of which have remained hugely popular. Glam was not only a highly successful trend in UK popular music, it became dominant in other aspects of British popular culture during the 1970s.\nA heavier variant of glam rock, emphasising guitar riff centric songs, driving rhythms and live performance with audience participation, were represented by bands like Slade and Mott the Hoople, with later followers such as Def Leppard, Cheap Trick, Poison, Kiss, and Quiet Riot, some of which either covered Slade compositions (such as \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\") or composed new songs based on Slade templates. While highly successful in the single charts in the UK (Slade for example had six number one singles), very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the US; David Bowie was the major exception, becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, New York Dolls and Jobriath, often known as \"glitter rock\" and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.\nIn the UK, the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and the independent band with whom he often performed known as the Glitter Band. The Glitter Band and Gary Glitter had between them eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1975. A second wave of glam rock acts, including Suzi Quatro, Roy Wood's Wizzard and Sparks, had hits on the British single charts in 1973 and 1974. Quatro and T.Rex directly inspired the pioneering Los Angeles based all-girl group the Runaways. Existing acts, some not usually considered central to the genre, also adopted glam styles, including Rod Stewart, Elton John, Queen and, for a time, the Rolling Stones. After seeing Marc Bolan wearing Zandra Rhodes-designed outfits, Freddie Mercury enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next Queen tour in 1974. Punk rock, in part a reaction to the artifice of glam rock, but using some elements of the genre, including makeup and involving cover versions of glam rock records, helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976.\nInfluence and legacy.\nWhile glam rock was exclusively a British cultural phenomenon, with Steven Wells in \"The Guardian\" writing \"Americans only got glam second hand via the posh Bowie version\", covers of British glam rock classics are now piped-muzak staples at US sporting events. Glam rock was a background influence for Richard O'Brien, writer of the 1973 London musical \"The Rocky Horror Show\". Although glam rock went into a steep decline in popularity in the UK in the second half of the 1970s, it had a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later, including Kiss and American glam metal acts like Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Twisted Sister, Bon Jovi, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Ratt.\nNew Romantic acts in the UK such as Adam and the Ants and A Flock of Seagulls extended glam, and its androgyny and sexual politics were picked up by acts including Culture Club, Bronski Beat and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Gothic rock was largely informed by the makeup, clothes, theatricality and sound of glam, and punk rock adopted some of the performance and persona-creating tendencies of glam, as well as the genre's emphasis on pop-art qualities and simple but powerful instrumentation.\nGlam rock has been influential around the world. In Japan in the 1980s, visual kei was strongly influenced by glam rock aesthetics. Glam rock has since enjoyed continued influence and sporadic modest revivals in R&amp;B crossover act Prince, bands such as Marilyn Manson, Suede, Placebo, Chainsaw Kittens, Spacehog and the Darkness, and has inspired pop artists such as Lady Gaga.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Its self-conscious embrace of fame and ego continues to reverberate through pop music decades after the death of its prototypical superstar, Marc Bolan of T. Rex, in 1977. As an elastic concept rather than a fixed stratosphere of '70s personalities, it is even equipped to survive the loss of its most enduring artist, David Bowie.\u2014\u200a\nRelationship to the LGBT community.\nThe glam rock scene that emerged in early 1970s London included numerous openly bisexual musicians, including Queen's Freddie Mercury, Elton John, and David Bowie. Medium's Claudia Perry felt that \"Glam rock was a queer paradise of sorts. Watching Mick Ronson and Bowie frolic onstage gave hope to every queer kid in the world. John's flamboyancy was also of great comfort. Marc Bolan of T. Rex is still the subject of speculation (a friend who worked at Creem remembers him coming on to just about everyone when he came through Detroit, but this clearly isn't definitive).\" Glam rock also helped to normalise androgynous fashion. Jobriath, the rock scene's first openly gay star, was also part of the glam rock scene.\nGlam rock hits \"Walk on the Wild Side\" by Lou Reed and \"Rebel Rebel\" by David Bowie also brought attention to non-heteronormative situations in the world of rock. When discussing \"Rebel Rebel\", Tim Bowers of \"The New York Times\" recalls that \"glam's vocals had a fruity theatricality, supporting lyrics that presented as a boast: 'Your mother can't tell if you're a boy or a girl.' Glam was butch and femme at once: bisexuality in sound.\"\n\"The Rocky Horror Show\", soundtracked by primarily glam rock, was a keystone of LGBTQ media in the 1970s. A song from the show, \"Sweet Transvestite\", was noted as \"the first big, glam rock aria of the musical\" and that glam rock \"was a queering (or camping) of the genre of rock music\" in the book \"Trans Representations in Contemporary, Popular Cinema\". The musical \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" (1998) also used glam rock to tell the story of a gender-affirming surgery gone awry. In discussing why glam rock was used for Hedwig, the article goes on to say \"by showcasing a more fluid approach to gender expression, glam rock artists like David Bowie, Marc Bolan, and Freddie Mercury became icons for the LGBTQ+ community. They helped pave the way for greater acceptance and understanding.\"\nFilm.\nMovies that reflect glam rock aesthetics include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the United States Employment Service, \"musician\" is a general term used to designate a person who follows music as a profession. Musicians include songwriters, who write both music and lyrics for songs; conductors, who direct a musical performance; and performers, who perform for an audience. A music performer is generally either a singer (also known as a vocalist), who provides vocals, or an instrumentalist, who plays a musical instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra.\nMusicians may specialize in a musical genre, although many perform across a variety of styles and often blend or cross genres. Their musical output is influenced by a range of factors, including culture, skill set, life experience, education, and creative preferences. A musician who records and releases music is often referred to as a recording artist; while a musician who primarily writes and records art music, media soundtracks , and scores\u2014including for films, theatrical stage productions, and video games\u2014or classical music is usually called a composer.

{"id": "38286", "revid": "50905373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38286", "title": "Inflation", "text": "Devaluation of money's purchasing power\nIn economics, inflation is an increase in the average price of goods and services in terms of money. This increase is measured using a price index, typically a consumer price index (CPI). When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of CPI inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index.\nChanges in inflation are widely attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy), changes in available supplies such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or changes in inflation expectations, which may be self-fulfilling. Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money; uncertainty over future inflation, which may discourage investment and savings; and, if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation.\nToday, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy while avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to central banks that control monetary policy, normally through the setting of interest rates and by carrying out open market operations.\nTerminology.\nThe term originates from the Latin \"inflare\" (to blow into or inflate). Conceptually, inflation refers to the general trend of prices, not changes in any specific price. For example, if people choose to buy more cucumbers than tomatoes, cucumbers consequently become more expensive and tomatoes less expensive. These changes are not related to inflation; they reflect a shift in tastes. Inflation is related to the value of currency itself. When currency was linked with gold, if new gold deposits were found, the price of gold and the value of currency would fall, and consequently, the prices of all other goods would become higher.\nClassical economics.\nBy the nineteenth century, economists categorised three separate factors that cause a rise or fall in the price of goods: a change in the \"value\" or production costs of the good, a change in the \"price of money\" which then was usually a fluctuation in the commodity price of the metallic content in the currency, and \"currency depreciation\" resulting from an increased supply of currency relative to the quantity of redeemable metal backing the currency. Following the proliferation of private banknote currency printed during the American Civil War, the term \"inflation\" started to appear as a direct reference to the \"currency depreciation\" that occurred as the quantity of redeemable banknotes outstripped the quantity of metal available for their redemption. At that time, the term inflation referred to the devaluation of the currency, and not to a rise in the price of goods. This relationship between the over-supply of banknotes and a resulting depreciation in their value was noted by earlier classical economists such as David Hume and David Ricardo, who would go on to examine and debate what effect a currency devaluation has on the price of goods.\nRelated concepts.\nOther economic concepts related to inflation include: deflation\u00a0\u2013 a fall in the general price level; disinflation\u00a0\u2013 a decrease in the rate of inflation; hyperinflation\u00a0\u2013 an out-of-control inflationary spiral; stagflation\u00a0\u2013 a combination of inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment; reflation\u00a0\u2013 an attempt to raise the general level of prices to counteract deflationary pressures; asset price inflation\u00a0\u2013 a general rise in the prices of financial assets without a corresponding increase in the prices of goods or services; and agflation\u00a0\u2013 an advanced increase in the price for food and industrial agricultural crops when compared with the general rise in prices.\nMore specific forms of inflation refer to sectors whose prices vary semi-independently from the general trend. \"House price inflation\" applies to changes in the house price index while \"energy inflation\" is dominated by the costs of oil and gas.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nInflation has been a feature of history during the entire period when money has been used as a means of payment. One of the earliest documented inflations occurred in Alexander the Great's empire 330 BC. Historically, when commodity money was used, periods of inflation and deflation would alternate depending on the condition of the economy. However, when large, prolonged infusions of gold or silver into an economy occurred, this could lead to long periods of inflation.\nThe adoption of fiat currency by many countries, from the 18th century onwards, made much larger variations in the supply of money possible. Rapid increases in the money supply have taken place a number of times in countries experiencing political crises, producing hyperinflations\u00a0\u2013 episodes of extreme inflation rates much higher than those observed in earlier periods of commodity money. The hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic of Germany is a notable example. The hyperinflation in Venezuela is the highest in the world, with an annual inflation rate of 833,997% as of October 2018.\nHistorically, inflations of varying magnitudes have occurred, interspersed with corresponding deflationary periods, from the price revolution of the 16th century, which was driven by the flood of gold and particularly silver seized and mined by the Spaniards in Latin America, to the largest paper money inflation of all time in Hungary after World War II.\nHowever, since the 1980s, inflation has been held low and stable in countries with independent central banks. This has led to a moderation of the business cycle and a reduction in variation in most macroeconomic indicators\u00a0\u2013 an event known as the Great Moderation.\nAncient Europe.\nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in 330 BC was followed by one of the earliest documented inflation periods in the ancient world. Rapid increases in the quantity of money or in the overall money supply have occurred in many different societies throughout history, changing with different forms of money used. For instance, when silver was used as currency, the government could collect silver coins, melt them down, mix them with other, less valuable metals such as copper or lead and reissue them at the same nominal value, a process known as debasement. At the ascent of Nero as Roman emperor in AD 54, the denarius contained more than 90% silver, but by the 270s hardly any silver was left. By diluting the silver with other metals, the government could issue more coins without increasing the amount of silver used to make them. When the cost of each coin is lowered in this way, the government profits from an increase in seigniorage. This practice would increase the money supply but at the same time the relative value of each coin would be lowered. As the relative value of the coins becomes lower, consumers would need to give more coins in exchange for the same goods and services as before. These goods and services would experience a price increase as the value of each coin is reduced. Again at the end of the third century AD during the reign of Diocletian, the Roman Empire experienced rapid inflation.\nAncient China.\nSong dynasty China introduced the practice of printing paper money to create fiat currency. During the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the government spent a great deal of money fighting costly wars, and reacted by printing more money, leading to inflation. Fearing the inflation that plagued the Yuan dynasty, the Ming dynasty initially rejected the use of paper money, and reverted to using copper coins.\nMedieval Egypt.\nDuring the Malian king Mansa Musa's hajj to Mecca in 1324, he was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels. When he passed through Cairo, he spent or gave away so much gold that it depressed its price in Egypt for over a decade, reducing its purchasing power. A contemporary Arab historian remarked about Mansa Musa's visit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gold was at a high price in Egypt until they came in that year. The mithqal did not go below 25 dirhams and was generally above, but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now. The mithqal does not exceed 22 dirhams or less. This has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into Egypt and spent there [...].\u2014\u200a\nMedieval age and \"price revolution\" in Western Europe.\nThere is no reliable evidence of inflation in Europe for the thousand years that followed the fall of the Roman Empire, but from the Middle Ages onwards reliable data do exist. Mostly, the medieval inflation episodes were modest, and there was a tendency for inflationary periods were followed by deflationary periods.\nFrom the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, Western Europe experienced a major inflationary cycle referred to as the \"price revolution\", with prices on average rising perhaps sixfold over 150 years. This is often attributed to the influx of gold and silver from the New World into Habsburg Spain, with wider availability of silver in previously cash-starved Europe causing widespread inflation. European population rebound from the Black Death began before the arrival of New World metal, and may have begun a process of inflation that New World silver compounded later in the 16th century.\nAfter 1700.\nA pattern of intermittent inflation and deflation periods persisted for centuries until the Great Depression in the 1930s, which was characterized by major deflation. Since the Great Depression, however, there has been a general tendency for prices to rise every year. In the 1970s and early 1980s, annual inflation in most industrialized countries reached two digits (ten percent or more). The double-digit inflation era was of short duration, however, inflation by the mid-1980s returned to more modest levels. Amid this, general trends there have been spectacular high-inflation episodes in individual countries in interwar Europe, towards the end of the Nationalist Chinese government in 1948\u20131949, and later in some Latin American countries, in Israel, and in Zimbabwe. Some of these episodes are considered hyperinflation periods, normally designating inflation rates that surpass 50 percent monthly.\nMeasures.\nGiven that there are many possible measures of the price level, there are many possible measures of price inflation. Most frequently, the term \"inflation\" refers to a rise in a broad price index representing the overall price level for goods and services in the economy. The consumer price index (CPI), the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI) and the GDP deflator are some examples of broad price indices. However, \"inflation\" may also be used to describe a rising price level within a narrower set of assets, goods or services within the economy, such as commodities (including food, fuel, metals), tangible assets (such as real estate), services (such as entertainment and health care), or labor. Although the values of capital assets are often casually said to \"inflate,\" this should not be confused with inflation as a defined term; a more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is appreciation. The FBI (CCI), the producer price index, and employment cost index (ECI) are examples of narrow price indices used to measure price inflation in particular sectors of the economy. Core inflation is a measure of inflation for a subset of consumer prices that excludes food and energy prices, which rise and fall more than other prices in the short term. The Federal Reserve Board pays particular attention to the core inflation rate to get a better estimate of long-term future inflation trends overall.\nThe inflation rate is most widely calculated by determining the movement or change in a price index, typically the consumer price index. \nThe inflation rate is the percentage change of a price index over time. The Retail Prices Index is also a measure of inflation that is commonly used in the United Kingdom. It is broader than the CPI and contains a larger basket of goods and services. Inflation is politically driven, and policy can directly influence the trend of inflation.\nThe RPI is indicative of the experiences of a wide range of household types, particularly low-income households.\nTo illustrate the method of calculation, in January 2007, the U.S. Consumer Price Index was 202.416, and in January 2008 it was 211.080. The formula for calculating the annual percentage rate inflation in the CPI over the course of the year is: formula_1\nThe resulting inflation rate for the CPI in this one-year period is 4.28%, meaning the general level of prices for typical U.S. consumers rose by approximately four percent in 2007.\nOther widely used price indices for calculating price inflation include the following:\nOther common measures of inflation are:\n\u2234 formula_2\nIn some cases, the measures are meant to be more humorous or to reflect a single place. This includes:\nIssues in measuring.\nMeasuring inflation in an economy requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on a common set of goods and services, and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume, quality, or performance. For example, if the price of a can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 over the course of a year, with no change in quality, then this price difference represents inflation. This single price change would not, however, represent general inflation in an overall economy. Overall inflation is measured as the price change of a large \"basket\" of representative goods and services. This is the purpose of a price index, which is the combined price of a \"basket\" of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the \"basket\". A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is necessary to measure the effect of individual unit price changes on the economy's overall inflation. The consumer price index, for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer's overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly. Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a \"base year\" price and assign it a value of 100. Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price. While comparing inflation measures for various periods one has to take into consideration the base effect as well.\nInflation measures are often modified over time, either for the relative weight of goods in the basket, or in the way in which goods and services from the present are compared with goods and services from the past. Basket weights are updated regularly, usually every year, to adapt to changes in consumer behavior. Sudden changes in consumer behavior can still introduce a weighting bias in inflation measurement. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic it has been shown that the basket of goods and services was no longer representative of consumption during the crisis, as numerous goods and services could no longer be consumed due to government containment measures (\"lock-downs\").\nOver time, adjustments are also made to the type of goods and services selected to reflect changes in the sorts of goods and services purchased by 'typical consumers'. New products may be introduced, older products disappear, the quality of existing products may change, and consumer preferences can shift. Different segments of the population may naturally consume different \"baskets\" of goods and services and may even experience different inflation rates. It is argued that companies have put more innovation into bringing down prices for wealthy families than for poor families.\nInflation numbers are often seasonally adjusted to differentiate expected cyclical cost shifts. For example, home heating costs are expected to rise in colder months, and seasonal adjustments are often used when measuring inflation to compensate for cyclical energy or fuel demand spikes. Inflation numbers may be averaged or otherwise subjected to statistical techniques to remove statistical noise and volatility of individual prices.\nWhen looking at inflation, economic institutions may focus only on certain kinds of prices, or \"special indices\", such as the core inflation index which is used by central banks to formulate monetary policy.\nMost inflation indices are calculated from weighted averages of selected price changes. This necessarily introduces distortion, and can lead to legitimate disputes about what the true inflation rate is. This problem can be overcome by including all available price changes in the calculation, and then choosing the median value. In some other cases, governments may intentionally report false inflation rates; for instance, during the presidency of Cristina Kirchner (2007\u20132015) the government of Argentina was criticised for manipulating economic data, such as inflation and GDP figures, for political gain and to reduce payments on its inflation-indexed debt.\nOfficial vs. true vs. perceived inflation.\nThe true inflation is one percentage point lower than the official one, according to research. Therefore, the 2% inflation target is needed to prevent the true inflation being close to zero or even deflation. The reasons are the following:\nNevertheless, people overestimate the inflation even vs. the measured inflation. This is because they focus more on commonly-bought items than on durable goods, and more on price increases than on price decreases. On the other hand, different people have different shopping baskets and hence face different inflation rates.\nCumulative inflation due to the compound effect can impact the perception of inflation.\nInflation expectations.\nInflation expectations or expected inflation is the rate of inflation that is anticipated for some time in the foreseeable future. There are two major approaches to modeling the formation of inflation expectations. Adaptive expectations models them as a weighted average of what was expected one period earlier and the actual rate of inflation that most recently occurred. Rational expectations models them as unbiased, in the sense that the expected inflation rate is not systematically above or systematically below the inflation rate that actually occurs.\nA long-standing survey of inflation expectations is the University of Michigan survey.\nInflation expectations affect the economy in several ways. They are more or less built into nominal interest rates, so that a rise (or fall) in the expected inflation rate will typically result in a rise (or fall) in nominal interest rates, giving a smaller effect if any on real interest rates. In addition, higher expected inflation tends to be built into the rate of wage increases, giving a smaller effect if any on the changes in real wages. Moreover, the response of inflationary expectations to monetary policy can influence the division of the effects of policy between inflation and unemployment (see monetary policy credibility).\nCauses.\nHistorical approaches.\nTheories of the origin and causes of inflation have existed since at least the 16th century. Two competing theories, the quantity theory of money and the real bills doctrine, appeared in various guises during century-long debates on recommended central bank behaviour. In the 20th century, Keynesian, monetarist and new classical (also known as rational expectations) views on inflation dominated post-World War II macroeconomics discussions, which were often heated intellectual debates, until some kind of synthesis of the various theories was reached by the end of the century.\nBefore 1936.\nThe price revolution from ca. 1550\u20131700 caused several thinkers to present what is now considered to be early formulations of the quantity theory of money (QTM). Other contemporary authors attributed rising price levels to the debasement of national coinages. Later research has shown that also growing output of Central European silver mines and an increase in the velocity of money because of innovations in the payment technology, in particular the increased use of bills of exchange, contributed to the price revolution.\nAn alternative theory, the real bills doctrine (RBD), originated in the 17th and 18th century, receiving its first authoritative exposition in Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\". It asserts that banks should issue their money in exchange for short-term real bills of adequate value. As long as banks only issue a dollar in exchange for assets worth at least a dollar, the issuing bank's assets will naturally move in step with its issuance of money, and the money will hold its value. Should the bank fail to get or maintain assets of adequate value, then the bank's money will lose value, just as any financial security will lose value if its asset backing diminishes. The real bills doctrine (also known as the backing theory) thus asserts that inflation results when money outruns its issuer's assets. The quantity theory of money, in contrast, claims that inflation results when money outruns the economy's production of goods.\nDuring the 19th century, three different schools debated these questions: The British Currency School upheld a quantity theory view, believing that the Bank of England's issues of bank notes should vary one-for-one with the bank's gold reserves. In contrast to this, the British Banking School followed the real bills doctrine, recommending that the bank's operations should be governed by the needs of trade: Banks should be able to issue currency against bills of trading, i.e. \"real bills\" that they buy from merchants. A third group, the Free Banking School, held that competitive private banks would not overissue, even though a monopolist central bank could be believed to do it.\nThe debate between currency, or quantity theory, and banking schools during the 19th century prefigures current questions about the credibility of money in the present. In the 19th century, the banking schools had greater influence in policy in the United States and Great Britain, while the currency schools had more influence \"on the continent\", that is in non-British countries, particularly in the Latin Monetary Union and the Scandinavian Monetary Union.\nDuring the Bullionist Controversy during the Napoleonic Wars, David Ricardo argued that the Bank of England had engaged in over-issue of bank notes, leading to commodity price increases. In the late 19th century, supporters of the quantity theory of money led by Irving Fisher debated with supporters of bimetallism. Later, Knut Wicksell sought to explain price movements as the result of real shocks rather than movements in money supply, resounding statements from the real bills doctrine.\nIn 2019, monetary historians Thomas M. Humphrey and Richard Timberlake published \"Gold, the Real Bills Doctrine, and the Fed: Sources of Monetary Disorder 1922\u20131938\".\nKeynes and the early Keynesians.\nJohn Maynard Keynes in his 1936 main work \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" emphasized that wages and prices were sticky in the short run, but gradually responded to aggregate demand shocks. These could arise from many different sources, e.g. autonomous movements in investment or fluctuations in private wealth or interest rates. Economic policy could also affect demand, monetary policy by affecting interest rates and fiscal policy either directly through the level of government final consumption expenditure or indirectly by changing disposable income via tax changes.\nThe various sources of variations in aggregate demand will cause cycles in both output and price levels. Initially, a demand change will primarily affect output because of the price stickiness, but eventually prices and wages will adjust to reflect the change in demand. Consequently, movements in real output and prices will be positively, but not strongly, correlated.\nKeynes' propositions formed the basis of Keynesian economics which came to dominate macroeconomic research and economic policy in the first decades after World War II. Other Keynesian economists developed and reformed several of Keynes' ideas. Importantly, Alban William Phillips in 1958 published indirect evidence of a negative relation between inflation and unemployment, confirming the Keynesian emphasis on a positive correlation between increases in real output (normally accompanied by a fall in unemployment) and rising prices, i.e. inflation. Phillips' findings were confirmed by other empirical analyses and became known as a Phillips curve. It quickly became central to macroeconomic thinking, apparently offering a stable trade-off between price stability and employment. The curve was interpreted to imply that a country could achieve low unemployment if it were willing to tolerate a higher inflation rate or vice versa.\nThe Phillips curve model described the U.S. experience well in the 1960s but failed to describe the stagflation experienced in the 1970s.\nMonetarism.\nDuring the 1960s the Keynesian view of inflation and macroeconomic policy altogether were challenged by monetarist theories, led by Milton Friedman. Friedman famously stated that:\"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\"He revived the quantity theory of money by Irving Fisher and others, making it into a central tenet of monetarist thinking, arguing that the most significant factor influencing inflation or deflation is how fast the money supply grows or shrinks.\nThe quantity theory of money, simply stated, says that any change in the amount of money in a system will change the price level. This theory begins with the equation of exchange:\nformula_3\nwhere\nformula_4 is the nominal quantity of money;\nformula_5 is the velocity of money in final expenditures;\nformula_6 is the general price level;\nformula_7 is an index of the real value of final expenditures.\nIn this formula, the general price level is related to the level of real economic activity (\"Q\"), the quantity of money (\"M\") and the velocity of money (\"V\"). The formula itself is simply an uncontroversial accounting identity because the velocity of money (\"V\") is defined residually from the equation to be the ratio of final nominal expenditure (formula_8) to the quantity of money (\"M\").\nMonetarists assumed additionally that the velocity of money is unaffected by monetary policy (at least in the long run), that the real value of output is also exogenous in the long run, its long-run value being determined independently by the productive capacity of the economy, and that money supply is exogenous and can be controlled by the monetary authorities. Under these assumptions, the primary driver of the change in the general price level is changes in the quantity of money. Consequently, monetarists contended that monetary policy, not fiscal policy, was the most potent instrument to influence aggregate demand, real output and eventually inflation. This was contrary to Keynesian thinking which in principle recognized a role for monetary policy, but in practice believed that the effect from interest rate changes to the real economy was slight, making monetary policy an ineffective instrument, preferring fiscal policy. Conversely, monetarists considered fiscal policy, or government spending and taxation, as ineffective in controlling inflation.\nFriedman also took issue with the traditional Keynesian view concerning the Phillips curve. He, together with Edmund Phelps, contended that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment implied by the Phillips curve was only temporary, but not permanent. If politicians tried to exploit it, it would eventually disappear because higher inflation would over time be built into the economic expectations of households and firms. This line of thinking led to the concept of potential output (sometimes called the \"natural gross domestic product\"), a level of GDP where the economy is stable in the sense that inflation will neither decrease nor increase. This level may itself change over time when institutional or natural constraints change. It corresponds to the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment, NAIRU, or the \"natural\" rate of unemployment (sometimes called the \"structural\" level of unemployment). If GDP exceeds its potential (and unemployment consequently is below the NAIRU), the theory says that inflation will \"accelerate\" as suppliers increase their prices. If GDP falls below its potential level (and unemployment is above the NAIRU), inflation will \"decelerate\" as suppliers attempt to fill excess capacity, cutting prices and undermining inflation.\nRational expectations theory.\nIn the early 1970s, rational expectations theory led by economists like Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent and Robert Barro transformed macroeconomic thinking radically. They held that economic actors look rationally into the future when trying to maximize their well-being, and do not respond solely to immediate opportunity costs and pressures. In this view, future expectations and strategies are important for inflation as well. One implication was that agents would anticipate the likely behaviour of central banks and base their own actions on these expectations. A central bank having a reputation of being \"soft\" on inflation will generate high inflation expectations, which again will be self-fulfilling when all agents build expectations of future high inflation into their nominal contracts like wage agreements. On the other hand, if the central bank has a reputation of being \"tough\" on inflation, then such a policy announcement will be believed and inflationary expectations will come down rapidly, thus allowing inflation itself to come down rapidly with minimal economic disruption. The implication is that credibility becomes very important for central banks in fighting inflation.\nNew Keynesians.\nEvents during the 1970s proved Milton Friedman and other critics of the traditional Phillips curve right: The relation between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate broke down. Eventually, a consensus was established that the break-down was due to agents changing their inflation expectations, confirming Friedman's theory. As a consequence, the notion of a natural rate of unemployment (alternatively called the structural rate of unemployment) was accepted by most economists, meaning that there is a specific level of unemployment that is compatible with stable inflation. Stabilization policy must therefore try to steer economic activity so that the actual unemployment rate converges towards that level. The trade-off between the unemployment rate and inflation implied by Phillips thus holds in the short term, but not in the long term. Also the oil crises of the 1970s causing at the same time rising unemployment and rising inflation (i.e. stagflation) led to a broad recognition by economists that supply shocks could independently affect inflation.\nDuring the 1980s a group of researchers named new Keynesians emerged who accepted many originally non-Keynesian concepts like the importance of monetary policy, the existence of a natural level of unemployment and the incorporation of rational expectations formation as a reasonable benchmark. At the same time they believed, like Keynes did, that various market imperfections in different markets like labour markets and financial markets were also important to study to understand both inflation generation and business cycles. During the 1980s and 1990s, there were often heated intellectual debates between new Keynesians and new classicals, but by the 2000s, a synthesis gradually emerged. The result has been called the \"new Keynesian model\", the \"new neoclassical synthesis\" or simply the \"new consensus\" model.\nView post-2000 to present.\nA common view beginning around the year 2000 and holding through to the present time on inflation and its causes can be illustrated by a modern Phillips curve including a role for supply shocks and inflation expectations beside the original role of aggregate demand (determining employment and unemployment fluctuations) in influencing the inflation rate. Consequently, demand shocks, supply shocks and inflation expectations are all potentially important determinants of inflation, confirming the basis of the older triangle model by Robert J. Gordon:\nThe important role of rational expectations is recognized by the emphasis on credibility on the part of central banks and other policy-makers. The monetarist assertion that monetary policy alone could successfully control inflation formed part of the new consensus which recognized that both monetary and fiscal policy are important tools for influencing aggregate demand. Indeed, monetary policy is under normal circumstances considered to be the preferable instrument to contain inflation. At the same time, most central banks have abandoned trying to target money growth as originally advocated by the monetarists. Instead, most central banks in developed countries focus on adjusting interest rates to achieve an explicit inflation target. The reason for central bank reluctance in following money growth targets is that the money stock measures that central banks can control tightly, e.g. the monetary base, are not very closely linked to aggregate demand, whereas conversely money supply measures like M2, which are in some cases more closely correlated with aggregate demand, are difficult to control for the central bank. Also, in many countries the relationship between aggregate demand and all money stock measures have broken down in recent decades, weakening further the case for monetary policy rules focusing on the money supply.\nHowever, while more disputed in the 1970s, surveys of members of the American Economic Association (AEA) since the 1990s have shown that most professional American economists generally agree with the statement \"Inflation is caused primarily by too much growth in the money supply\", while the same surveys have shown a lack of consensus by AEA members since the 1990s that \"In the short run, a reduction in unemployment causes the rate of inflation to increase\" has developed despite more agreement with the statement in the 1970s.\nHousing shortages, immigration and climate change have been cited as significant drivers of inflation in the 21st century.\n2021\u20132022 inflation spike.\nIn 2021\u20132022, most countries experienced a considerable increase in inflation, peaking in 2022 and declining in 2023. The causes are believed to be a mixture of demand and supply shocks, whereas inflation expectations generally seem to remain anchored (as per May 2023). Possible causes on the demand side include expansionary fiscal and monetary policy in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, whereas supply shocks include supply chain problems also caused by the pandemic and exacerbated by energy price rises following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \nThe term sellers' inflation was coined during this period to describe the effect of corporate profits as a possible cause of inflation: Price inelasticity can contribute to inflation when firms consolidate, tending to support monopoly or monopsony conditions anywhere along the supply chain for goods or services. When this occurs, firms can provide greater shareholder value by taking a larger proportion of profits than by investing in providing greater volumes of their outputs. Shortly after initial energy price shocks caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine had subsided, oil companies found that supply chain constrictions, already exacerbated by the ongoing global pandemic, supported price inelasticity, i.e., they began lowering prices to match the price of oil when it fell much more slowly than they had increased their prices when costs rose.\nThe quantity theory of money has long been popular with libertarian-conservative critics of the Federal Reserve. During the COVID pandemic and its immediate aftermath, the M2 money supply increased at the fastest rate in decades, leading some to link the growth to the 2021-2023 inflation surge. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in December 2021 that the once-strong link between the money supply and inflation \"ended about 40 years ago,\" due to financial innovations and deregulation. Previous Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, had previously concurred with this position. The broadest measure of money supply, M2, increased about 45% from 2010 through 2015, far faster than GDP growth, yet the inflation rate declined during that period \u2014 the opposite of what monetarism would have predicted. A lower velocity of money than was historically the case was also cited for a diminished effect of growth in the money supply on inflation.\nHeterodox views.\nAdditionally, there are theories about inflation accepted by economists outside of the mainstream. The Austrian School stresses that inflation is not uniform over all assets, goods, and services. Inflation depends on differences in markets and on where newly created money and credit enter the economy. Ludwig von Mises said that inflation should refer to an increase in the quantity of money, that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money, and that price inflation will necessarily follow, always leaving a poorer nation.\nEffects of inflation.\nGeneral effect.\nInflation is the decrease in the purchasing power of a currency. That is, when the general level of prices rise, each monetary unit can buy fewer goods and services in aggregate. The effect of inflation differs on different sectors of the economy, with some sectors being adversely affected while others benefitting. For example, with inflation, those segments in society which own physical assets, such as property, stock etc., benefit from the price/value of their holdings going up, when those who seek to acquire them will need to pay more for them. Their ability to do so will depend on the degree to which their income is fixed. For example, increases in payments to workers and pensioners often lag behind inflation, and for some people income is fixed. Also, individuals or institutions with cash assets will experience a decline in the purchasing power of the cash. Increases in the price level (inflation) erode the real value of money (the functional currency) and other items with an underlying monetary nature.\nDebtors who have debts with a fixed nominal rate of interest will see a reduction in the \"real\" interest rate as the inflation rate rises. The real interest on a loan is the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. The formula \"R = N-I\" approximates the correct answer as long as both the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate are small. The correct equation is \"r = n/i\" where \"r\", \"n\" and \"i\" are expressed as ratios (e.g. 1.2 for +20%, 0.8 for \u221220%). As an example, when the inflation rate is 3%, a loan with a nominal interest rate of 5% would have a real interest rate of approximately 2% (in fact, it's 1.94%). Any unexpected increase in the inflation rate would decrease the real interest rate. Banks and other lenders adjust for this inflation risk either by including an inflation risk premium to fixed interest rate loans or lending at an adjustable rate.\nNegative.\nHigh or unpredictable inflation rates are regarded as harmful to an overall economy. They add inefficiencies in the market and make it difficult for companies to budget or plan long-term. Inflation can act as a drag on productivity as companies are forced to shift resources away from products and services to focus on profit and losses from currency inflation. Uncertainty about the future purchasing power of money discourages investment and saving. Inflation hurts asset prices such as stock performance in the short-run, as it erodes non-energy corporates' profit margins and leads to central banks' policy tightening measures. Inflation can also impose hidden tax increases. For instance, inflated earnings push taxpayers into higher income tax rates unless the tax brackets are indexed to inflation.\nWith high inflation, purchasing power is redistributed from those on fixed nominal incomes, such as some pensioners whose pensions are not indexed to the price level, towards those with variable incomes whose earnings may better keep pace with the inflation. This redistribution of purchasing power will also occur between international trading partners. Where fixed exchange rates are imposed, higher inflation in one economy than another will cause the first economy's exports to become more expensive and affect the balance of trade. There can also be negative effects to trade from an increased instability in currency exchange prices caused by unpredictable inflation.\n With high inflation, firms must change their prices often to keep up with economy-wide changes. But often changing prices is itself a costly activity whether explicitly, as with the need to print new menus, or implicitly, as with the extra time and effort needed to change prices constantly.\nCost-of-living allowance.\nThe real purchasing power of fixed payments is eroded by inflation unless they are inflation-adjusted to keep their real values constant. In many countries, employment contracts, pension benefits, and government entitlements (such as social security) are tied to a cost-of-living index, typically to the consumer price index. A \"cost-of-living adjustment\" (COLA) adjusts salaries based on changes in a cost-of-living index. It does not control inflation, but rather seeks to mitigate the consequences of inflation for those on fixed incomes. Salaries are typically adjusted annually in low inflation economies. During hyperinflation they are adjusted more often. They may also be tied to a cost-of-living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves.\nAnnual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index. These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost-of-living adjustments (\"COLAs\") or cost-of-living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes.\nControl of inflation.\nMonetary policy is the policy enacted by the monetary authorities (most frequently the central bank of a nation) to accomplish their objectives. Among these, keeping inflation at a low and stable level is often a prominent objective, either directly via inflation targeting or indirectly, e.g. via a fixed exchange rate against a low-inflation currency area.\nHistorical approaches to inflation control.\nHistorically, central banks and governments have followed various policies to achieve low inflation, employing various nominal anchors. Before World War I, the gold standard was prevalent, but was eventually found to be detrimental to economic stability and employment, not least during the Great Depression in the 1930s. For the first decades after World War II, the Bretton Woods system initiated a fixed exchange rate system for most developed countries, tying their currencies to the US dollar, which again was directly convertible to gold. The system disintegrated in the 1970s, however, after which the major currencies started floating against each other. During the 1970s many central banks turned to a money supply target recommended by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, aiming for a stable growth rate of money to control inflation. However, it was found to be impractical because of the unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables, and was eventually abandoned by all major economies. In 1990, New Zealand as the first country ever adopted an official inflation target as the basis of its monetary policy, continually adjusting interest rates to steer the country's inflation rate towards its official target. The strategy was generally considered to work well, and central banks in most developed countries have over the years adapted a similar strategy. As of 2023, the central banks of all G7 member countries can be said to follow an inflation target, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, who have adopted the main elements of inflation targeting without officially calling themselves inflation targeters. In emerging countries fixed exchange rate regimes are still the most common monetary policy.\nFixed exchange rates.\nUnder a fixed exchange rate currency regime, a country's currency is tied in value to another single currency or to a basket of other currencies. A fixed exchange rate is usually used to stabilize the value of a currency, vis-a-vis the currency it is pegged to. It can also be used as a means to control inflation if the currency area tied to itself maintains low and stable inflation. However, as the value of the reference currency rises and falls, so does the currency pegged to it. This essentially means that the inflation rate in the fixed exchange rate country is determined by the inflation rate of the country the currency is pegged to. In addition, a fixed exchange rate prevents a government from using domestic monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic stability.\nAs of 2023, Denmark is the only OECD country which maintains a fixed exchange rate (against the euro), but it is frequently used as a monetary policy strategy in developing countries.\nGold standard.\nThe gold standard is a monetary system in which a region's common medium of exchange is paper notes (or other monetary token) that are normally freely convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold. The standard specifies how the gold backing would be implemented, including the amount of specie per currency unit. The currency itself has no \"innate value\" but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed for the equivalent value of the commodity (specie). A U.S. silver certificate, for example, could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver.\nUnder a gold standard, the long term rate of inflation (or deflation) would be determined by the growth rate of the supply of gold relative to total output. Critics argue that this will cause arbitrary fluctuations in the inflation rate, and that monetary policy would essentially be determined by an intersection of however much new gold was produced by mining and changing demand for gold for practical uses. The gold standard was historically found to make it more difficult to stabilize employment levels and avoid recessions and was eventually abandoned everywhere.\nDemurrage currency.\nFreiwirtschaft economists theorize that demurrage currency could eliminate both inflation and deflation. There tends to be some interest cost that is built into the goods and services that consumers tend to purchase,4 so if demurrage currency eliminates interest rates, then prices are less likely to increase. Demurrage would also naturally cause the money supply to decrease, thus causing deflation. If a central bank issues and monitors demurrage currency as Gesell originally proposed, then it could replace all the money that disappears due to demurrage by printing money at a similar rate. The money printing could create just enough inflation to cancel out the natural deflation of demurrage, thus achieving an inflation target of 0%.\nWage and price controls.\nAnother method attempted in the past have been wage and price controls (\"incomes policies\"). Temporary price controls may be used as a complement to other policies to fight inflation; price controls may make disinflation faster, while reducing the need for unemployment to reduce inflation. If price controls are used during a recession, the kinds of distortions that price controls cause may be lessened. However, economists generally advise against the imposition of price controls.\nWage and price controls, in combination with rationing, have been used successfully in wartime environments. However, their use in other contexts is far more mixed. Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon. More successful examples include the Prices and Incomes Accord in Australia and the Wassenaar Agreement in the Netherlands.\nIn general, wage and price controls are regarded as a temporary and exceptional measures, only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce the underlying causes of inflation during the wage and price control regime, for example, winning the war being fought.\nInflation targeting.\nFrom its first inception in New Zealand in 1990, direct inflation targeting as a monetary policy strategy has spread to become prevalent among developed countries. The basic idea is that the central bank perpetually adjusts the bank rate to influence the country's inflation rate towards its official target. Changes in interest rates affect aggregate demand, aggregate supply and inflation in various ways, also called the monetary transmission mechanism. The relation between unemployment and inflation is known as the Phillips curve.\nCitizens show generally a high aversion to inflation. In most OECD countries, the inflation target is about 2%.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a result of taking on such clients, he garnered criticism from members of the public, including intellectuals Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy and Alain Finkielkraut, political activist Gerry Gable and Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.\nVerg\u00e8s attracted widespread public attention in the 1950s for his use of trials as a forum for expressing views against French colonial rule in Algeria, questioning the authority of the prosecution and causing chaos in proceedings \u2013 a method he promoted as \"rupture defense\" in his book \"De la strat\u00e9gie judiciaire\". He was imprisoned for his activism in 1960 and temporarily lost his license to officially practice law. He was a supporter of the Palestinian fedayeen in the 1960s. He would later disappear from 1970 to 1978, without ever explaining his whereabouts during that period. An outspoken anti-imperialist, he continued his vocal political activism in the 2000s, including opposing the war on terror. The media sensationalized his activities with the sobriquet \"the Devil's advocate\", and Verg\u00e8s himself contributed to his \"notorious\" public persona by such acts as titling his autobiography \"The Brilliant Bastard\" and giving provocative replies in interviews, such as \"I'd even defend Bush! But only if he agrees to plead guilty.\"\nBiography.\nBorn on 5 March 1925 in Ubon Ratchathani, Siam, and brought up on the island of R\u00e9union with his twin brother Paul Verg\u00e8s, Jacques Verg\u00e8s was the son of Raymond Verg\u00e8s, a French doctor from R\u00e9union, and a Vietnamese teacher named Pham Thi Khang. In 1942, with his father's encouragement, he sailed to Liverpool to become part of the Free French Forces under Charles de Gaulle, and to participate in the anti-Nazi resistance. He went on to fight in Italy, France, and Germany.\nAfter the end of World War II he entered the University of Paris, where he enrolled in the \"Facult\u00e9 des lettres\" pursuing a degree in history, studying the Hindi and Malagasy languages. In 1945 he joined the Young Communists movement of the French Communist Party, while his father was helping to organize the Reunionese Communist Party. During this time he befriended Erich Honecker, future leader of East Germany, Henri Alleg and Felix Hophouet-Boigny, future President of the Ivory Coast. He would also marry his first wife Karine at this time. His twin brother, Paul, returned to Reunion, later becoming leader of the Communist Party there, and a member of the European Parliament. In 1949 Jacques became president of the AEC (Association for Colonial Students), where he befriended Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan. In 1950, at the request of his Communist mentors, he went to Prague to lead a youth organization for four years. He returned to Paris, where he went on to study law, passing his final exams in 1955. Verg\u00e8s was then elected \"Secr\u00e9taire\" of the \"Conf\u00e9rence du barreau de Paris.\"\nPolitical activities.\nArriving in Paris, Jacques Verg\u00e8s joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1945. On 25 May 1946, Alexis de Villeneuve, who ran for the legislative elections under the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) against his father, Raymond Verg\u00e8s, was assassinated in front of the cathedral of Saint-Denis in R\u00e9union. The firearm used belonged to Raymond Verg\u00e8s.\nAlgerian independence movement.\nAfter returning to France, Verg\u00e8s became a lawyer and quickly gained fame for his willingness to take controversial cases. During the struggle in Algiers he defended many accused of terrorism by the French government. He was a supporter of the Algerian armed independence struggle against France, comparing it to French armed resistance to the Nazi German occupation in the 1940s.\nVerg\u00e8s became a nationally known figure following his defence of the anti-French Algerian guerrilla Djamila Bouhired on terrorism charges: she was convicted of blowing up a caf\u00e9 and killing eleven people inside it. This is where he pioneered the rupture strategy, in which he accused the prosecution of the same offenses as the defendants. She was sentenced to death but pardoned and freed following public pressure brought on by Verg\u00e8s' efforts. After some years she married Verg\u00e8s, who had by then converted to Islam. In an effort to limit Verg\u00e8s' success at defending Algerian clients, he was sentenced to two months in jail in 1960 and temporarily lost his licence to officially practice law for anti-state activities. After Algeria gained its independence in 1962, Verg\u00e8s obtained Algerian citizenship, going by the name of Mansour. During the Algerian War he had become acquainted with Ahmed Ben Bella of the FLN and the first President of Algeria, Swiss Nazi and financier for the FLN, Fran\u00e7ois Genoud, as well as Ahmed Huber, a Swiss Muslim-convert and Nazi who covered the war as a journalist.\nIsrael and the Palestinians.\nIn 1965, Verg\u00e8s arrived in Israel, seeking to represent Mahmud Hijazi (), a Palestinian member of the Fatah movement who had at the time been sentenced to death by an Israeli military court on charges of terrorism, for crossing into Israel and setting a small demolition charge near the National Water Conduit in the Galilee. Israel's Justice Minister Dov Yosef forbade Hijazi's being represented by a foreign lawyer. Verg\u00e8s was detained at the airport and deported. Nevertheless, though Verg\u00e8s did not succeed in getting to represent Hijazi in court, his initiative generated considerable publicity and controversy which were influential in Hijazi's death sentence being eventually commuted by an appeals court. (Hijazi was later released in a 1971 prisoner exchange.)\nMissing years.\nFrom 24 February 1970 to 1978, Verg\u00e8s disappeared from public view without explanation. He refused to comment about those years, remarking in an interview with \"Der Spiegel\" that \"It's highly amusing that no one, in our modern police state, can figure out where I was for almost ten years.\" Verg\u00e8s was last seen at an anti-colonial rally in Paris. He left his wife, Djamila, and cut off all his ties with his friends and family. Many people wondered if he had been killed, kidnapped, become a spy, or had gone into hiding. His whereabouts during these years have remained a mystery. Many of his close associates of the time assume that he was in Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, a rumour Pol Pot (Brother #1), Nuon Chea (Brother #2) and Ieng Sary (Brother #3) have denied. There are claims that Verg\u00e8s was spotted in Paris by Mohamed Boudia, a contact from Algerian War and an old Communist associate, Ji\u0159\u00ed Pelik\u00e1n. He is also alleged to have been in Switzerland at the house of Fran\u00e7ois Genoud according to Ahmed Huber. He was also thought to be in several Arab countries in the company of Ali Hassan Salameh and Palestinian militant groups according to the Lebanese attorney Karim Pakradouni, and exiled Algerian politician Bachir Boumaza.\nHigh-profile defendants.\nAfter Verg\u00e8s's return to public life he resumed his legal practice, taking on a variety of legal cases ranging from; Muslim children who wanted to wear headscarves in school, transfusion-transmitted HIV/AIDS patients contaminated by unscreened blood, prostitutes suing their pimps for back pay to defending high profile war criminals and dictators.\nThe first file that Jacques Verg\u00e8s handled as a lawyer concerns Sonacotra. He engages in a \"defence of rupture\" (also called \"strategy of rupture\"), rather than what he calls the \"defense of connivance\", which was classically pleaded: the accused becomes the accuser, considers that the judge does not have jurisdiction or that the court does not have the legitimacy, and takes the opinion to witness.\nNotable clients.\nSources:\nKlaus Barbie.\nThe thrust of Verg\u00e8s's defence in the case was that Barbie was being singled out for prosecution while the French state conveniently ignored other cases that qualified as crimes against humanity. Verg\u00e8s adopted a \"tu quoque\" defense, asking the judges \"is a crime against humanity to be defined as only one of Nazis against the Jews or if it applies to more serious crimes...the crimes of imperialists against people struggling for their independence?\", going on to say there was nothing his client did against the Resistance that was not done by \"certain French officers in Algeria\" whom Verg\u00e8s noted could not be prosecuted because of de Gaulle's amnesty of 1962. As such, Verg\u00e8s argued that the republic had no right to convict Barbie of anything given that French officers like the war hero General Jacques Massu had also engaged in torture and extrajudicial executions during the fight against the FLN. Verg\u00e8s argued in impassioned speeches before the court that the main conflict motivating history was the struggle between the Global North and the Global South, and that American policy in the Vietnam war and French policy during the Algerian war were the \"true face\" of the West. Verg\u00e8s maintained that to convict Barbie was a base act of hypocrisy for a French court as his actions were those of a typical Westerner, and therefore he could not be punished for doing merely other Westerners had done.\nBesides his \"tu quoque\" defense of arguing that French actions in the Algerian War were no different from Barbie's, Verg\u00e8s spent much time attempting to prove the Resistance hero Jean Moulin had been betrayed by either the Communists, the Gaullists, or both, which led him to argue Barbie was less culpable than those who had betrayed Moulin. Verg\u00e8s claimed Moulin's colleagues were \"playing a double game\" and all those in the Resistance \"whether they were anti-Gaullists or anti-Communists forgot their duty to the Resistance because of partisan political passions\". At one point, Verg\u00e8s claimed that Moulin had actually wanted to be tortured to death and tipped off Barbie himself. Under French law, defense lawyers are entitled to use competing theories in defense of their clients, unlike the prosecution who must stick to only one line of argument. Barbie was not on trial for the torture and murder of Moulin as the statute of limitations in the Moulin case had expired, but instead on trial for crimes against humanity for his role in deporting Jews from Lyons in 1942-44, for which there was no statute of limitations. Barbie was on trial for his role in the arrest and deportation of 44 Jewish children from the Izieu orphanage on 6 April 1944. Of the 44 children, 42 were killed at Auschwitz.\nVerg\u00e8s seems to have brought in the Moulin case as part of his defense of Barbie as a strategy of drawing attention from the actions that Barbie had actually been put on trial for. Despite Verg\u00e8s's efforts, the court found Barbie guilty of crimes against humanity, sentencing him to life imprisonment. Reviewing the film \"\", the film critic David Denby wrote the climax of the film was when the French filmmaker Marcel Oph\u00fcls pressed the \"despicable\" Verg\u00e8s during an interview about his defense of Barbie, whom Denby wrote \"...persists in pretending that Barbie is a victim of some sort\". Verg\u00e8s was paid to defend Barbie by Swiss Nazi financier Fran\u00e7ois Genoud, whom Verg\u00e8s had met during the Algerian War due to their mutual support for the FLN.\nLawsuits against Amnesty International and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Verschave.\nIn 1999 Verg\u00e8s sued Amnesty International on behalf of the government of Togo. In 2001, on behalf of Idriss D\u00e9by, president of Chad, Omar Bongo, president of Gabon, and Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, he sued Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Verschave for his book \"Noir silence\" denouncing the crimes of the \"Fran\u00e7afrique\" on the charges of \"offense toward a foreign state leader\", using an arcane 1881 law. The attorney general observed how this crime recalled the lese majesty crime; the court thus deemed it contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, thus leading to Verschave's acquittal.\nKhieu Samphan.\nIn April 2008, former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, and old associate of Verg\u00e8s, made his first appearance at Cambodia's genocide tribunal. Verg\u00e8s represented Samphan, using the defence that, while Samphan has never denied that many people in Cambodia were killed, as head of state he was not directly responsible.\nSaddam Hussein.\nAfter the US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq in March 2003 and deposed Saddam Hussein, many former leaders in the Baathist regime were arrested. In late 2003, Verg\u00e8s offered to defend Hussein after he was approached by Saddam's nephew who was putting a legal team together. However, the Hussein family opted not to use Verg\u00e8s.\nIn May 2008, Tariq Aziz assembled a team that included Verg\u00e8s as well as a French-Lebanese and four Italian lawyers.\nPersonal life.\nJacques Verg\u00e8s was married twice. He had a son with his first wife, Karine. He would go on to marry his client Djamila Bouhired, having two children with her.\nAccording to \"The Economist\", \"history was his first love, and he still sometimes dreamed of deciphering Etruscan or Linear A, unfolding the secrets of mysterious civilizations.\"\nIn 2002, he called former Serbian leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 \"extremely likeable\". In January 2008, he personally supported Tomislav Nikoli\u0107, nationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party.\nDeath.\nJacques Verg\u00e8s died on 15 August 2013 of a heart attack in Paris at the age of 88. His funeral was attended by Roland Dumas and Dieudonn\u00e9. Verg\u00e8s is buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery.\nBibliography.\nBooks written by Verg\u00e8s (English language).\nNote: Few works by Verg\u00e8s have been translated into English. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38289", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38289", "title": "Economic depression", "text": "Sustained downturn in economic activity\nAn economic depression is a period of carried long-term economic downturn that is the result of lowered economic activity in one or more major national economies. It is often understood in economics that an economic crisis and the following recession that may be termed an economic depression are part of economic cycles where the slowdown of the economy follows economic growth and vice versa. It is a result of more severe economic problems or a \"downturn\" than a recession itself, which is a slowdown in economic activity over the course of the normal business cycle of growing economy.\nEconomic depressions may also be characterized by their length or duration, showing increases in unemployment, larger increases in unemployment or even abnormally large levels of unemployment (as with for example some problems in Japan in incorporating digital economy, that such technological difficulty resulting in very large unemployment rates or lack of good social balance in employment among population, lesser revenues for businesses, or other economic difficulties, with having signs of financial crisis, that may also reflect on the work of banks, or may result in banking crisis (in various ways that may be for example unauthorized transformations of banks), and further the crisis in investment and credit; that further could reflect on innovation and new businesses investments lessening or even shrinking, or buyers dry up in recession and suppliers cut back on production and investment in technology, in financial crisis that may be more country defaults or debt problems, and further in feared businesses bankruptcies, and overall business slowdown. Other bad signs of economic depression could be significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce (especially international trade), as well as in currency markets that maybe fluctuations or unexpected exchange rates with observed highly volatile currency value fluctuations (often due to relative currency devaluations). Other signs of depression are prices deflation, financial crises, stock market crash or even bank failures, or even specific behaviour of economic agents or population, that are also common or also non common elements of a depression that do not normally occur during a recession.\nDefinitions.\nIn the United States the National Bureau of Economic Research determines contractions and expansions in the business cycle, but does not declare depressions. Generally, periods labeled depressions are marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced using current resources and technology (potential output). Another proposed definition of \"depression\" includes two general rules:\nThere are also differences in the duration of depression across definitions. Some economists refer only to the period when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until the economic activity has returned close to normal levels.\nA recession is briefly defined as a period of declining economic activity spread across the economy (according to NBER). Under the first definition, each depression will always coincide with a recession, since the difference between a depression and a recession is the severity of the fall in economic activity. In other words, each depression is always a recession, sharing the same starting and ending dates and having the same duration.\nUnder the second definition, depressions and recessions will always be distinct events however, having the same starting dates. This definition of depression implies that a recession and a depression will have different ending dates and thus distinct durations. Under this definition, the length of depression will always be longer than that of the recession starting the same date.\nA useful example is a difference in the chronology of the Great Depression in the U.S. under the view of alternative definitions. Using the second definition of depression, most economists refer to the Great Depression, as the period between 1929 and 1941. On the other hand, using the first definition, the depression that started in August 1929 lasted until March 1933. Note that NBER, which publishes the recession (instead of depression) dates for the U.S. economy, has identified two recessions during that period. The first between August 1929 and March 1933 and the second starting in May 1937 and ending in June 1938.\nTerminology.\nToday the term \"depression\" is most often associated with the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the term had been in use long before then. Indeed, an early major American economic crisis, the Panic of 1819, was described by then-president James Monroe as \"a depression\", and the economic crisis immediately preceding the 1930s depression, the Depression of 1920\u201321, was referred to as a \"depression\" by president Calvin Coolidge.\nHowever, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, \"financial\" crises were traditionally referred to as \"panics\", e.g., the 'major' Panic of 1907, and the 'minor' Panic of 1910\u20131911, though the 1929 crisis was more commonly called \"The Crash\", and the term \"panic\" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression (of the 1930s), the phrase \"The Great Depression\" had already been used to refer to the period 1873\u201396 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873\u201379 (in the United States), which has since been renamed the Long Depression.\nCommon use of the phrase \"The Great Depression\" for the 1930s crisis is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins, whose 1934 book \"The Great Depression\" is credited with 'formalizing' the phrase, though US president Herbert Hoover is widely credited with having 'popularized' the term/phrase, informally referring to the downturn as a \"depression\", with such uses as \"Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement\", (December 1930, Message to Congress) and \"I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression\" (1931).\nOccurrence.\nDue to the lack of an agreed definition and the strong negative associations, the characterization of any period as a \"depression\" is contentious. The term was frequently used for regional crises from the early 19th century until the 1930s, and for the more widespread crises of the 1870s and 1930s, but economic crises since 1945 have generally been referred to as \"recessions\", with the 1970s global crisis referred to as \"stagflation\", but not a depression. The only two eras commonly referred to at the current time as \"depressions\" are the 1870s and 1930s.\nTo some degree, this is simply a stylistic change, similar to the decline in the use of \"panic\" to refer to financial crises, but it does also reflect that the economic cycle \u2013 both in the United States and in most OECD countries \u2013 though not in all \u2013 has been more moderate since 1945.\nThere \"have\" been many periods of prolonged economic underperformance in particular countries/regions since 1945, detailed below, but terming these as \"depressions\" is controversial. The 2008\u20132009 economic cycle, which has comprised the most significant global crisis since the Great Depression, has at times been termed a depression, but this terminology is not widely used, with the episode instead being referred to by other terms, such as the \"Great Recession\".\nNotable depressions.\nThe General Crisis of 1640.\nThe largest depression of all time occurred during the General Crisis. The Ming Empire of China went bankrupt and the Stuart Monarchy fought a civil war on three fronts in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Thomas Hobbes, an English philosopher, created the first recorded explanation of the need for a universal Social Contract in his 1651 book \"Leviathan\" based on the general misery within society during this period.\nGreat depression of 1837.\nThis depression is acknowledged to be a worse depression in the United States than the later Great Depression of the 1930s. This depression ended in the United States due to the California gold rush and its tenfold addition to the United States' gold reserves. As with most depressions, it was followed by a thirty-year period of a booming economy in the United States, which is now called the Second Industrial Revolution (of the 1850s).\nPanic of 1837.\nThe Panic of 1837 was an American financial crisis, built on a speculative real estate market. The bubble burst on 10 May 1837 in New York City, when every bank stopped payment in gold and silver coinage. The Panic was followed by a five-year depression, with the failure of banks and record high unemployment levels.\nLong Depression.\nStarting with the adoption of the gold standard in Britain and the United States, the Long Depression (1873\u20131896) was indeed longer than what is now referred to as the Great Depression, but shallower in some sectors. Many who lived through it regarded it to have been worse than the 1930s depression at times. It was known as \"the Great Depression\" until the 1930s.\nGreat Depression.\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s affected most national economies in the world. This depression is generally considered to have begun with the Wall Street crash of 1929, and the crisis quickly spread to other national economies. Between 1929 and 1933, the gross national product of the United States decreased by 33% while the rate of unemployment increased to 25% (with industrial unemployment alone rising to approximately 35% \u2013 U.S. employment was still over 25% agricultural).\nA long-term effect of the Great Depression was the departure of every major currency from the gold standard, although the initial impetus for this was World War II (see Bretton Woods Accord).\nGreek depression.\nBeginning in 2009, Greece sank into a recession that, after two years, became a depression. The country saw an almost 20% drop in economic output, and unemployment soared to near 25%. Greece's high amounts of sovereign debt precipitated the crisis, and the poor performance of its economy after the introduction of severe austerity measures slowed the entire eurozone's recovery. Greece's troubles led to discussions about its departure from the eurozone.\nPost-communism depression.\nThe economic crisis in the 1990s that struck former members of the Soviet Union was almost twice as intense as the Great Depression in the countries of Western Europe and the United States in the 1930s. Average standards of living registered a catastrophic fall in the early 1990s in many parts of the former Eastern Bloc, most notably in post-Soviet states. Even before Russia's financial crisis of 1998, Russia's GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s. Some populations are still poorer today than they were in 1989 (e.g. Ukraine, Moldova, Serbia, Central Asia, Caucasus). The collapse of the Soviet planned economy and the transition to a market economy resulted in catastrophic declines in GDP of about 45% from 1990 to 1996 and poverty in the region had increased more than tenfold.\nFinnish economists refer to the Finnish economic decline during and after the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989\u20131994) as a great depression (\"suuri lama\"). However, the depression was multicausal, with its severity compounded by a coincidence of multiple sudden external shocks, including loss of Soviet trade, the savings and loan crisis and early 1990s recession in the West, with the internal overheating that had been brewing throughout the 1980s. Liberalization had resulted in the so-called \"casino economy\". Persistent structural and monetary policy problems had not been solved, leaving the economy vulnerable to even mild external shocks. The depression had lasting effects: the Finnish markka was floated and was eventually replaced by the euro in 1999, ending decades of government control of the economy, but also high, persistent unemployment. Employment has never returned even close to the pre-crisis level.\nOther depressions.\nGlobal.\nThe late 1910s and early 1920s were marked by an economic depression that unraveled in particularly catastrophic circumstances: World War I and its aftermath led to a global nosedive in commodities that ruined many developing nations, while servicemen returning from the trenches found themselves with high unemployment as businesses failed, unable to transition into a peacetime economy. Also, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918\u201320 brought economic activity to a standstill as even more people became incapacitated. Most developed countries had mostly recovered by 1921\u201322, however Germany saw its economy crippled until 1923\u201324 because of the hyperinflation crisis.\nThe 1973 oil crisis, coupled with the rising costs of maintenance of welfare state in most countries led to a recession between 1973 and 1975, followed by a period of almost minimal growth and rising inflation and unemployment. The 1980\u201382 recession marked the end of the period.\nThe savings &amp; loans and the leveraged buyout crises led to a severe depression in mid-to-late 1989, causing a recession in 1990\u201391 (also fueled by the oil price crisis), whose effects lasted as late as 1994. This downturn is more remembered for its political effects: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had to resign in November 1990; and while his approval ratings were above 60%, U.S. President George H. W. Bush lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton because of the domestic malady marked by the depression and increasing urban decay.\nIn 2005, the persistent oil price rises and economic overheating caused by deregulation led to a gradual deterioration of the world economy with inflation and unemployment rising as growth slowed: The housing bubble in the U.S. burst in 2007, and the American economy slipped into a recession. This, in turn, provoked the failure of many prominent financial institutions throughout 2008, most notably Lehman Brothers, leading to the loss of millions of jobs.\nRegional.\nSeveral Latin American countries had severe downturns in the 1980s: by the Kehoe and Prescott definition of a great depression as at least one year with output 20% below trend, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru experienced great depressions in the 1980s, and Argentina experienced another between 1998 and 2002. South American countries fell once again into this in the early-to-mid 2010s.\nThis definition also includes the economic performance of New Zealand from 1974 to 1992 and Switzerland from 1973 to the present, although this designation for Switzerland has been controversial.\nFrom 1980 to 2000, Sub-Saharan Africa broadly suffered a fall in absolute income levels.\nSince 2018, Turkey is experiencing an ongoing crisis known as the Great Turkish Depression.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pozna\u0144 University of Technology is known as one of the best technical universities in Poland. URAP ranked PUT among the top 6% of world universities and Webometrics ranked it at no. 842 in the world by Google citations for the year 2015. In 1995, it became the first Polish university to become a member of the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research (CESAER), an organization comprising the best technical universities in Europe. The university is also a member of the Socrates-Erasmus programme for exchange students from all over Europe, promoting advanced engineering and a European dimension. The university is home to many organizations and student circles, and the radio station Afera 98.6\u00a0MHz. The university has over 21,000 students and over 1,100 academic staff.\nFaculties.\nThere are nine faculties (since 2020):\nHistory.\nPoznan University of Technology (PUT) was officially founded in 1955 and the first rector was Roman Kozak. But a state school had existed in Pozna\u0144 since 1919, named the Higher State School of Machinery. After adding a second department in 1929, its name was changed to the Higher State School of Machinery and Electrotechnics. It was supposed to become the University of Technology in 1940, but its development was interrupted by World War II. In 1945 the school received the status of Higher Engineering School and in 1955 it became the University of Technology.\nIn 1999 PUT celebrated the 80th anniversary of the higher educational technical system in Poznan. It continues traditions of the State Higher School of Mechanical Engineering, which was opened in August 1919. The school remained open at the outbreak of the Second World War, during which time 716 graduates had completed their studies there. It was allocated in a building nowadays situated at Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Square, today the Rector's Office. In 1929, the school changed its name to the State Higher School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. As a result of further development, the Higher School was to be given the status of a university in 1940. Unfortunately, this did not occur during the war period. In September 1945, the school received the title High School of Engineering and after ten years became Poznan University of Technology.\nPUT is at present autonomous state institution consisting of nine faculties in which institutes and chairs over one thousand academic staff members do research and run educational tasks for over fourteen thousand students of full -time and part-time studies. PUT has been granted the right to confer doctorates in technical science. Moreover, it runs postgraduate studies within different faculties.\nIn 1995 PUT, as the first Polish University of Technology, became a member of the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research \u2013 CESAER-bringing together the best European Engineering Colleges and Universities of Technology. In 1999 PUT was the host organization of the IX CESAER Conference.\nIn the academic year 1999 / 2000 European Credit Transfer System \u2013ECTS-was introduced at the PUT.\nFrom the academic year 2006/2007, Poznan University of Technology also conducts its existing doctoral studies as third-cycle studies.\nSuccesses.\nStudents from the Faculty of Computer Science started few times in CSIDC computer systems projecting world championships organised by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society and ImagineCup (Microsoft).

{"id": "38293", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38293", "title": "Arthur Machen", "text": "Welsh author and mystic (1863\u20131947)\nArthur Machen ( or ; 3 March 1863 \u2013 15 December 1947) was the pen-name of Arthur Llewellyn Jones, a Welsh author and mystic of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best known for his influential supernatural, fantasy, and horror fiction. His novella \"The Great God Pan\" (1890; 1894) has garnered a reputation as a classic of horror, with Stephen King describing it as \"Maybe the best [horror story] in the English language.\" He is also well known for \"The Bowmen\", a short story that was widely read as fact, creating the legend of the Angels of Mons.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nMachen was born Arthur Llewelyn Jones in Caerleon, Monmouthshire. The house of his birth, opposite the Olde Bull Inn in The Square at Caerleon is marked with a commemorative blue plaque. The landscape of Monmouthshire (which he usually referred to by the name of the medieval Welsh kingdom, Gwent), with its associations of Celtic, Roman, and medieval history, made a powerful impression on him, and his love of it is at the heart of many of his works. \nMachen was descended from a long line of clergymen, the family having originated in Carmarthenshire. In 1864, when Machen was two, his father John Edward Jones, became rector of the parish of Llanddewi Fach with Llandegveth, about five miles north of Caerleon, and Machen was brought up at the rectory there. Jones had adopted his wife's maiden name, Machen, to inherit a legacy, legally becoming \"Jones-Machen\"; his son later used a shortened version, Arthur Machen, as a pen name.\nLocal historian and folklorist Fred Hando suggests Machen's early interest in the occult came from an article of alchemy in a volume of \"Household Words\" in his father's library. Hando recounts Machen's other early reading:\nHe bought De Quincey's \"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater\" at Pontypool Road Railway Station, \"The Arabian Nights\" at Hereford Railway Station, and borrowed \"Don Quixote\" from Mrs. Gwyn, of Llanfrechfa Rectory. In his father's library he found also the \"Waverley Novels\", a three-volume edition of the \"Glossary of Gothic Architecture\", and an early volume of Tennyson.\nAt the age of eleven, Machen boarded at Hereford Cathedral School, where he received a good education. His family could not afford for him to attend university, and Machen went to London, where he sat, but failed, exams for entrance to medical school. He displayed some literary promise and in 1881 published a long poem on the subject of the Eleusinian Mysteries. He attempted to make a living as a journalist, a publisher's clerk, and a children's tutor, devoting his evenings to writing and solitary walks.\nIn 1884 he published his second work, the pastiche \"The Anatomy of Tobacco\", and secured work with the publisher and bookseller George Redway as a cataloguer and magazine editor. This led to further work as a translator from French, translating the \"Heptam\u00e9ron\" of Marguerite de Navarre, \"Le Moyen de Parvenir\" (\"Fantastic Tales\") of B\u00e9roalde de Verville, and the \"Memoirs\" of Casanova.\nIn 1887, the year his father died, Machen married Amelia (Amy) Hogg, an unconventional music teacher with a passion for the theatre, who had literary friends in London's bohemian circles. Hogg had introduced Machen to the writer and occultist A. E. Waite, who was to become one of Machen's closest friends. Machen also made the acquaintance of other literary figures, such as M. P. Shiel and Edgar Jepson. Soon after his marriage, Machen began to receive a series of legacies from Scottish relatives that allowed him to gradually devote more time to writing.\nLiterary decadence in the 1890s.\nAround 1890 Machen began to publish in literary magazines, writing stories influenced by the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, some of which used gothic or fantastic themes. This led to his first major success, \"The Great God Pan\". It was published in 1894 by John Lane in the noted Keynotes Series, which was part of the growing aesthetic movement of the time. Machen's story was widely denounced for its sexual and horrific content and consequently sold well, going into a second edition.\nMachen next produced \"The Three Impostors\", a novel composed of a number of interwoven tales, in 1895. The novel and the stories within it were eventually to be regarded as among Machen's best works. However, following the scandal surrounding Oscar Wilde later that year, Machen's association with works of decadent horror made it difficult for him to find a publisher for new works. Thus, though he would write some of his greatest works over the next few years, some were published much later. These included \"The Hill of Dreams\", \"Hieroglyphics\", \"A Fragment of Life\", the story \"The White People\", and the stories which make up \"Ornaments in Jade\".\nTragedy and acting: 1899\u20131910.\nIn 1899, Machen's wife Amy died of cancer after a long period of illness. This had a devastating effect on Machen. He only gradually recovered from his loss over the next year, partially through his close friendship with the poet A. E. Waite. It was through Waite's influence that Machen joined at this time the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, though Machen's interest in the organization was not lasting or very deep.\nMachen's recovery was further helped by his sudden change of career, becoming an actor in 1901 and a member of Frank Benson's company of travelling players, a profession which took him round the country.\nThis led in 1903 to a second marriage, to Dorothie Purefoy Hudleston, which brought Machen much happiness. Machen managed to find a publisher in 1902 for his earlier written work \"Hieroglyphics\", an analysis of the nature of literature, which concluded that true literature must convey \"ecstasy\". In 1906 Machen's literary career began once more to flourish as the book \"The House of Souls\" collected his most notable works of the nineties and brought them to a new audience. He also published a satirical work, \"Dr Stiggins: His Views and Principles\", generally considered one of his weakest works.\nMachen also was at this time investigating Celtic Christianity, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Publishing his views in Lord Alfred Douglas's \"The Academy\", for which he wrote regularly, Machen concluded that the legends of the Grail actually were based on dim recollections of the rites of the Celtic Church. These ideas also featured strongly in the novel \"The Secret Glory\" which he wrote at this time, marking the first use in fiction of the idea of the Grail's surviving into modern times in some form, an idea much utilised ever since, as by Charles Williams (\"War in Heaven\"), Dan Brown (\"The Da Vinci Code\") and George Lucas (\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\"). In 1907, \"The Hill of Dreams\", generally considered Machen's masterpiece, was finally published, though it was not recognized much at the time.\nThe next few years saw Machen continue with acting in various companies and with journalistic work, but he was finding it increasingly hard to earn a living and his legacies were long exhausted. Machen was also attending literary gatherings such as the New Bohemians and the Square Club.\nJournalism and the Great War: 1910\u20131921.\nFinally Machen accepted a full-time journalist's job at Alfred Harmsworth's \"Evening News\" in 1910. In February 1912 his son Hilary was born, followed by a daughter Janet in 1917. The coming of the First World War in 1914 saw Machen return to public prominence for the first time in twenty years due to the publication of \"The Bowmen\" and the subsequent publicity surrounding the \"Angels of Mons\" episode. He published a series of stories capitalizing on this success, most of which were morale-boosting propaganda, but the most notable, \"The Great Return\" (1915) and the novella \"The Terror\" (1917), were more accomplished. He also published a series of autobiographical articles during the war, later reprinted in book form as \"Far Off Things\". During the war years Machen also met and championed the work of a fellow Welshman, Caradoc Evans.\nIn general, though, Machen thoroughly disliked work at the newspaper, and it was only the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it. The money came in useful, allowing him to move in 1919 to a bigger house with a garden, in St John's Wood, which became a noted location for literary gatherings attended by friends such as the painter Augustus John, D. B. Wyndham Lewis, and Jerome K. Jerome. Machen's dismissal from the \"Evening News\" in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems. Machen, however, was recognized as a great Fleet Street character by his contemporaries, and he remained in demand as an essay writer for much of the twenties.\nThe Machen boom of the 1920s.\nThe year 1922 saw a revival in Machen's literary fortunes. \"The Secret Glory\", considered by some to be Machen's final masterpiece, was belatedly published, as well as the autobiographical \"Far Off Things\" and new editions of his Casanova translation, \"The House of Souls\" and \"The Hill of Dreams\". Machen's works had now found a new audience and publishers in the United States, and a series of requests for republications of books started to come in. Vincent Starrett, James Branch Cabell, and Carl Van Vechten were American devotees who helped in this process.\nAnother sign of his rising fortunes was the publication in 1923 of a collected edition of his works (the \"Caerleon Edition\") and a bibliography. That year also saw the publication of a recently completed second volume of autobiography, \"Things Near and Far\"\u2014the third and final volume, \"The London Adventure\", being published in 1924. Machen's earlier works suddenly started becoming much-sought-after collector's items at this time, a position they have held ever since. In 1924 he issued a collection of bad reviews of his own work, with very little commentary, under the title \"Precious Balms\". In this period of prosperity Machen's home saw many visitors and social gatherings, and Machen made new friends, such as Oliver Stonor.\nFinal years: 1926\u20131947.\nBy 1926 the boom in republication was mostly over, and Machen's income dropped. He continued republishing earlier works in collected editions, as well as writing essays and articles for various magazines and newspapers and contributing forewords and introductions to both his own works and those of other writers\u2014such as the Monmouthshire historian Fred Hando's \"The Pleasant Land of Gwent\" (1944)\u2014but produced little new fiction. In 1927, he became a manuscript reader for the publisher Ernest Benn, which brought in a much-needed regular income until 1933.\nIn 1929, Machen and his family moved away from London to Amersham in Buckinghamshire, but they still faced financial hardship. He received some recognition for his literary work when he received a Civil List pension of \u00a3100 per annum in 1932, but the loss of work from Benn's a year later made things difficult once more. A few more collections of Machen's shorter works were published in the thirties, partially as a result of the championing of Machen by John Gawsworth, who also began work on a biography of Machen that was only published in 2005 thanks to the Friends of Arthur Machen.\nMachen's financial difficulties were only finally ended by the literary appeal launched in 1943 for his eightieth birthday. The initial names on the appeal show the general recognition of Machen's stature as a distinguished man of letters, as they included Max Beerbohm, T. S. Eliot, Bernard Shaw, Walter de la Mare, Algernon Blackwood, and John Masefield. The success of the appeal allowed Machen to live the last few years of his life, until 1947, in relative comfort.\nViews.\nSpiritual.\nFrom the beginning of his literary career, Machen espoused a mystical belief that the humdrum ordinary world hid a more mysterious and strange world beyond. His gothic and decadent works of the 1890s concluded that the lifting of this veil could lead to madness, sex, or death, and usually a combination of all three. Machen's later works became somewhat less obviously full of gothic trappings, but for him investigations into mysteries invariably resulted in life-changing transformation and sacrifice. Machen loved the medieval worldview because he felt it manifested deep spirituality alongside a rambunctious earthiness.\nMachen was a great enthusiast for literature that expressed the \"rapture, beauty, adoration, wonder, awe, mystery, sense of the unknown, desire for the unknown\" that he summed up in the word \"ecstasy\". His main passions were for writers and writing he felt achieved this, an idiosyncratic list which included the \"Mabinogion\" and other medieval romances, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Miguel de Cervantes, William Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson, Thomas de Quincey, Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Allan Poe, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Those writers who failed to achieve this, or far worse did not even attempt it, received short shrift from Machen.\nMachen's strong opposition to a materialistic viewpoint is obvious in many of his works, marking him as part of neo-romanticism. He was deeply suspicious of science, materialism, commerce, and Puritanism, all of which were anathema to Machen's conservative, bohemian, mystical, and ritualistic temperament. Machen's virulent satirical streak against things he disliked has been regarded as a weakness in his work, and rather dating, especially when it comes to the fore in works such as \"Dr Stiggins\". Similarly, some of his propagandistic First World War stories also have little appeal to a modern audience.\nMachen, brought up as the son of a Church of England clergyman, always held Christian beliefs, though accompanied by a fascination with sensual mysticism; his interests in paganism and the occult were especially prominent in his earliest works. Machen was well read on such matters as alchemy, the kabbalah, and Hermeticism, and these occult interests formed part of his close friendship with A. E. Waite. Machen, however, was always very down-to-earth, requiring substantial proof that a supernatural event had occurred, and was thus highly sceptical of Spiritualism.\nThe death of his first wife led him to a spiritual crossroads, and he experienced a series of mystical events. After his experimentation with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the orthodox ritual of the Church became ever more important to him, gradually defining his position as a High Church Anglican who was able to incorporate elements from his own mystical experiences, Celtic Christianity, and readings in literature and legend into his thinking.\nIn his later years, Machen became a Roman Catholic.\nPolitical.\nIn politics, Machen was reactionary. He stated in response to a 1937 questionnaire on the Spanish Civil War in the \"Left Review\", \"Mr. Arthur Machen presents his compliments and begs to inform that he is, and always has been, entirely for General Franco.\"\nLegacy and influence.\nMachen's literary significance is substantial; his stories have been translated into many languages and reprinted in short story anthologies countless times. In the early 1970s, a paperback reprint of \"The Three Impostors\" in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series brought him to the notice of a new generation. More recently, the small press has continued to keep Machen's work in print. In 2010, to mark the 150 years since Machen's birth, two volumes of Machen's work were republished in the prestigious Library of Wales series.\nLiterary critics such as Wesley D. Sweetser and S. T. Joshi see Machen's works as a significant part of the late Victorian revival of the gothic novel and the decadent movement of the 1890s, bearing direct comparison to the themes found in contemporary works like Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", and Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". At the time authors such as Wilde, William Butler Yeats, and Arthur Conan Doyle were all admirers of Machen's works. He is also usually noted in the better studies of Anglo-Welsh literature. The French writer Paul-Jean Toulet translated Machen's \"The Great God Pan\" into French and visited Machen in London. Charles Williams was also a devotee of Machen's work, which inspired Williams' own fiction.\nThere is a blue plaque, at New Angel Hotel, New Quay Road, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, commemorating his stay there in November 1916.\nGenre fiction.\nHistorian of fantastic literature Brian Stableford has suggested that Machen \"was the first writer of authentically modern horror stories, and his best works must still be reckoned among the finest products of the genre\".\nMachen's popularity in 1920s America has been noted, and his work was an influence on the development of the pulp horror found in magazines like \"Weird Tales\" and on such notable fantasy writers as James Branch Cabell, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, Frank Belknap Long (who wrote a tribute to Machen in verse, \"On Reading Arthur Machen\"), Donald Wandrei, David Lindsay and E. Charles Vivian.\nHis significance was recognized by H. P. Lovecraft, who in his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" named Machen as one of the four \"modern masters\" of supernatural horror (with Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, and M. R. James). Machen's influence on Lovecraft's own work was substantial. Lovecraft's reading of Machen in the early 1920s led him away from his earlier Dunsanian writing towards the development of what became the Cthulhu Mythos. Machen's use of a contemporary Welsh or London background in which sinister ancient horrors lurk and are capable of interbreeding with modern people obviously helped inspire Lovecraft's similar use of a New England background. Machen's story \"The White People\" includes references to curious unknown rites and beings, an idea Lovecraft uses frequently in the mythos.\nLovecraft pays tribute to the influence by directly incorporating some of Machen's creations and references, such as Nodens and Aklo, into his Cthulhu Mythos and using similar plotlines, most notably seen by a comparison of \"The Dunwich Horror\" to \"The Great God Pan\" and of \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" to \"The Novel of the Black Seal\". Other Lovecraft tales with a debt or reference to Machen include \"The Call of Cthulhu\", \"The Festival\", \"Cool Air\", \"The Descendant\", and \"The Colour Out of Space\".\nHis intense, atmospheric stories of horror and the supernatural have been read and enjoyed by many modern horror and fantasy writers, influencing directly Peter Straub, Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, Karl Edward Wagner, \"Sarban\" (John William Wall), Joanna Russ, Graham Joyce, Simon Clark, Tim Lebbon, and T. E. D. Klein, to name but a few. Klein's novel \"The Ceremonies\" was partly based on Machen's \"The White People\", and Straub's novel \"Ghost Story\" was influenced by \"The Great God Pan\".\nWider literary influence.\nMachen's influence is not limited to genre fiction, however. Jorge Luis Borges recognized Machen as a great writer, and through him Machen has had an influence on magic realism. He was also a major influence on Paul Bowles and Javier Mar\u00edas, the latter of whom dedicated a subplot of his 1989 novel \"All Souls\" to collecting the works of Machen and his circle of peers. He was one of the most significant figures in the life of the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, who attributed to Machen his conversion to High Church Anglicanism, an important part of his philosophy and poetry. Sylvia Townsend Warner (a niece of Machen's second wife, Purefoy) admired Machen and was influenced by him, as is his great-granddaughter, the contemporary artist Tessa Farmer.\nMachen was also a pioneer in psychogeography, due to his interest in the interconnection between landscape and the mind. His strange wanderings in Wales and London recorded in his beautiful prose make him of great interest to writers on this subject, especially those focusing on London, such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd. Alan Moore wrote an exploration of Machen's mystical experiences in his work \"Snakes and Ladders\". Aleister Crowley loved Machen's works, feeling they contained \"Magickal\" truth, and put them on the reading list for his students, though Machen, who never met him, detested Crowley. Other occultists, such as Kenneth Grant, also find Machen an inspiration. Far closer to Machen's personal mystical world view was his effect on his friend Evelyn Underhill, who reflected some of Machen's thinking in her highly influential book \"Mysticism\".\nOne chapter of the French best-seller \"The Morning of the Magicians\", by L. Pauwels and J. Berger (1960), deals extensively with Machen's thought and works. Machen's approach to reality is described as an example of the \"fantastic realism\" which the book is dedicated to.\nOther fields.\nIn music, the composer John Ireland found Machen's works to be a life-changing experience that directly influenced much of his composition \u2013 specifically the piano piece \"The Scarlet Ceremonies\" (1912\u201313, founded on a quotation from \"The White People\"); the symphonic rhapsody \"Mai-Dun\" (1920\u201321, believed to have been inspired by \"The Hill of Dreams\"); and \"Legend\" for piano and orchestra (1933), which is dedicated to Machen.\nMark E. Smith of The Fall also found Machen an inspiration. Likewise, Current 93 have drawn on the mystical and occult leanings of Machen, with songs such as \"The Inmost Light\", which shares its title with Machen's story. Some artists on the Ghost Box Music label like Belbury Poly and The Focus Group draw heavily on Machen. It is an interest also shared by film directors like Mexican Rogelio A. Gonz\u00e1lez who made a successful version of \"The Islington Mystery\" as \"El Esqueleto de la se\u00f1ora Morales\" (1960), adapted by Luis Alcoriza, a frequent collaborator in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's classic films. This interest in Machen's works among filmmakers is also shared by Guillermo del Toro and Richard Stanley. Other notable figures with an enthusiasm for Machen have included Brocard Sewell, Barry Humphries, Stewart Lee and Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nLiterary societies.\nAn Arthur Machen Society was established in 1948 in the United States and survived until the 1960s. It was followed by the Arthur Machen Society based in the UK, in 1986, which in turn was replaced by the current literary society, The Friends of Arthur Machen.\nThe Friends of Arthur Machen (FoAM) is a non-profit international literary society founded in 1998 dedicated to supporting interest in Arthur Machen and his work, and to aid research. It publishes two journals: \"Faunus\", which reprints rare Machen articles and criticism of his work, and \"Machenalia\". It fosters interest not only in Machen but in events in which he played a key part, such as the Angels of Mons affair, and organises psychogeographic excursions.\nProminent members include Alan Moore, Stewart Lee and R. B. Russell of Tartarus Press. The society was nominated for a in 2006.\n\"In approximate order of composition, with date of publication:\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38298", "revid": "47399125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38298", "title": "George Boole", "text": "English mathematician and philosopher (1815\u20131864)\nGeorge Boole ( ; 2 November 1815 \u2013 8 December 1864) was an English autodidact, mathematician, philosopher and logician who served as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of \"The Laws of Thought\" (1854), which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic, essential to computer programming, is credited with helping to lay the foundations for the Information Age.\nBoole was the son of a shoemaker. He received a primary school education and learned Latin and modern languages through various means. At 16, he began teaching to support his family. He established his own school at 19 and later ran a boarding school in Lincoln. Boole was an active member of local societies and collaborated with fellow mathematicians. In 1849, he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork) in Ireland, where he met his future wife, Mary Everest. He continued his involvement in social causes and maintained connections with Lincoln. In 1864, Boole died due to fever-induced pleural effusion after developing pneumonia.\nBoole published around 50 articles and several separate publications in his lifetime. Some of his key works include a paper on early invariant theory and \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic\", which introduced symbolic logic. Boole also wrote two systematic treatises: \"Treatise on Differential Equations\" and \"Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences\". He contributed to the theory of linear differential equations and the study of the sum of residues of a rational function. In 1847, Boole developed Boolean algebra, a fundamental concept in binary logic, which laid the groundwork for the algebra of logic tradition and forms the foundation of digital circuit design and modern computer science. Boole also attempted to discover a general method in probabilities, focusing on determining the consequent probability of events logically connected to given probabilities.\nBoole's work was expanded upon by various scholars, such as Charles Sanders Peirce and William Stanley Jevons. Boole's ideas later gained practical applications when Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov employed Boolean algebra to optimize the design of electromechanical relay systems, leading to the development of modern electronic digital computers. His contributions to mathematics earned him various honours, including the Royal Society's first gold prize for mathematics, the Keith Medal, and honorary degrees from the Universities of Dublin and Oxford. University College Cork celebrated the 200th anniversary of Boole's birth in 2015, highlighting his significant impact on the digital age.\nEarly life.\nBoole was born in 1815 in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John Boole Snr (1779\u20131848), a shoemaker and Mary Ann Joyce. He had a primary school education, and received lessons from his father, but due to a serious decline in business, he had little further formal and academic teaching. William Brooke, a bookseller in Lincoln, may have helped him with Latin, which he may also have learned at the school of Thomas Bainbridge. He was self-taught in modern languages. In fact, when a local newspaper printed his translation of a Latin poem, a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretence that he was not capable of such achievements. At age 16, Boole became the breadwinner for his parents and three younger siblings, taking up a junior teaching position in Doncaster at Heigham's School. He taught briefly in Liverpool.\nBoole participated in the Lincoln Mechanics' Institute, in the Greyfriars, Lincoln, which was founded in 1833. Edward Bromhead, who knew John Boole through the institution, helped George Boole with mathematics books and he was given the calculus text of Sylvestre Fran\u00e7ois Lacroix by the Rev. George Stevens Dickson of St Swithin's, Lincoln. Without a teacher, it took him many years to master calculus.\nAt age 19, Boole successfully established his own school in Lincoln: Free School Lane. Four years later he took over Hall's Academy in Waddington, outside Lincoln, following the death of Robert Hall. In 1840, he moved back to Lincoln, where he ran a boarding school. Boole immediately became involved in the Lincoln Topographical Society, serving as a member of the committee, and presenting a paper entitled \"On the origin, progress, and tendencies of polytheism, especially amongst the ancient Egyptians and Persians, and in modern India\".\"\"\nBoole became a prominent local figure, an admirer of John Kaye, the bishop. He took part in the local campaign for early closing. With Edmund Larken and others he set up a building society in 1847. He associated also with the Chartist Thomas Cooper, whose wife was a relation.\nFrom 1838 onwards, Boole was making contacts with sympathetic British academic mathematicians and reading more widely. He studied algebra in the form of symbolic methods, as far as these were understood at the time, and began to publish research papers.\nProfessorship and life in Cork.\nBoole's status as a mathematician was recognised by his appointment in 1849 as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork (UCC)) in Ireland. He met his future wife, Mary Everest, there in 1850 while she was visiting her uncle John Ryall who was professor of Greek. They married in 1855. He maintained his ties with Lincoln, working there with E. R. Larken in a campaign to reduce prostitution.\nIn 1861, Boole was involved in a Judgement in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland against one John Hewitt Wheatley of Craig House, Sligo for the sum of \u00a3400, whereby Wheatley's estate and interest in lands of Maghan/Mahon, County Cork became vested in Boole.\nIn March 1863, Boole leased Litchfield Cottage, Cork, the house in which he would live with his wife Mary until his death in December of the following year. The premises was described in the deeds as \"all that and those the dwelling house called Litchfield Cottage with the premises and appurtenances thereunto belonging and the Garden and Walled in field to the rere thereof\". Boole's will bequeathed all his 'estate term and interest' in the lease of Litchfield Cottage unto his wife. In August 1865, some 8 months after his death, Mary (by then living at 68 Harley Street, London) passed the house on to Francis Heard of Ballintemple, Cork, Esquire, a captain in her Majesty's 87th Regiment of South Cork.\nHonours and awards.\nIn 1844, Boole's paper \"On a General Method in Analysis\" won the first gold prize for mathematics awarded by the Royal Society. He was awarded the Keith Medal by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1855 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1857. He received honorary degrees of LL.D. from the University of Dublin and the University of Oxford.\nWorks.\nBoole's first published paper was \"Researches in the theory of analytical transformations, with a special application to the reduction of the general equation of the second order\", printed in the \"Cambridge Mathematical Journal\" in February 1840 (Volume 2, No. 8, pp. 64\u201373), and it led to his friendship with Duncan Farquharson Gregory, the editor of the journal. His works are in about 50 articles and a few separate publications.\nIn 1841, Boole published an influential paper in early invariant theory. He received a medal from the Royal Society for his memoir of 1844, \"On a General Method in Analysis\". It was a contribution to the theory of linear differential equations, moving from the case of constant coefficients on which he had already published, to variable coefficients. The innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not commute. In 1847, Boole published \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic\", the first of his works on symbolic logic.\nDifferential equations.\nBoole completed two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects during his lifetime. The \"Treatise on Differential Equations\" appeared in 1859, and was followed, the next year, by a \"Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences\", a sequel to the former work. Shortly after his death, Todhunter republished Boole's treatise with some of Boole's revisions, along with a supplement that was originally intended to be merged in the making of the second edition.\nAnalysis.\nIn 1857, Boole published the treatise \"On the Comparison of Transcendent, with Certain Applications to the Theory of Definite Integrals\", in which he studied the sum of residues of a rational function. Among other results, he proved what is now called Boole's identity:\nformula_1\nfor any real numbers \"a\"\"k\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a00, \"b\"\"k\", and \"t\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a00. Generalisations of this identity play an important role in the theory of the Hilbert transform.\nBinary logic.\nIn 1847, Boole published the pamphlet \"Mathematical Analysis of Logic\". He later regarded it as a flawed exposition of his logical system and wanted \"An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities\" to be seen as the mature statement of his views. Contrary to widespread belief, Boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of Aristotle's logic. Rather he intended to systematise it, to provide it with a foundation, and to extend its range of applicability. Boole's initial involvement in logic was prompted by a current debate on quantification, between Sir William Hamilton who supported the theory of \"quantification of the predicate\", and Boole's supporter Augustus De Morgan who advanced a version of De Morgan duality, as it is now called. Boole's approach was ultimately much further reaching than either sides' in the controversy. It founded what was first known as the \"algebra of logic\" tradition.\nAmong his many innovations is his principle of wholistic reference, which was later, and probably independently, adopted by Gottlob Frege and by logicians who subscribe to standard first-order logic. A 2003 article provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of Aristotelian logic and Boolean logic; it also reveals the centrality of holistic reference in Boole's philosophy of logic.\n1854 definition of the universe of discourse.\nIn every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them, the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.\nTreatment of addition in logic.\nBoole conceived of \"elective symbols\" of his kind as an algebraic structure. But this general concept was not available to him: he did not have the segregation standard in abstract algebra of postulated (axiomatic) properties of operations, and deduced properties. His work was a beginning to the algebra of sets, again not a concept available to Boole as a familiar model. His pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties, and the treatment of addition was an obvious difficulty in the early days.\nBoole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word \"and\" and addition by the word \"or\". But in Boole's original system, + was a partial operation: in the language of set theory it would correspond only to the union of disjoint subsets. Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as exclusive or, or in set theory terms symmetric difference; this step means that addition is always defined.\nIn fact, there is the other possibility generalizing Boole's original partial operation, that + should be read as non-exclusive or. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both Boolean rings and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, in the form of the correct evaluation of \"x\" + \"x\". Jevons argued for the result \"x\", which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation \"x\" + \"x\" = 0 as implying \"x\" = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.\nProbability theory.\nThe second part of the \"Laws of Thought\" contained a corresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities. Here the goal was algorithmic: from the given probabilities of any system of events, to determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with those events.\nDeath.\nIn late November 1864, Boole walked, in heavy rain, from his home at Lichfield Cottage in Ballintemple to the university, a distance of three miles, and lectured wearing his wet clothes. He soon became ill, developing pneumonia. As his wife believed that remedies should resemble their cause, she wrapped him in wet blankets \u2013 the wet having brought on his illness. Boole's condition worsened and on 8 December 1864, he died of fever-induced pleural effusion.\nHe was buried in the Church of Ireland cemetery of St Michael's, Church Road, Blackrock (a suburb of Cork). There is a commemorative plaque inside the adjoining church.\nLegacy.\nBoole is the namesake of the branch of algebra known as Boolean algebra, as well as the namesake of the lunar crater Boole. The keyword \"Bool\" represents a Boolean data type in many programming languages, though Pascal and Java, among others, both use the full name \"Boolean\". The library, underground lecture theatre complex and the Boole Centre for Research in Informatics at University College Cork are named in his honour. A road called \"Boole Heights\" in Bracknell, Berkshire is named after him.\n19th-century development.\nBoole's work was extended and refined by a number of writers, beginning with William Stanley Jevons, who also authored the article about Boole in the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\". Augustus De Morgan had worked on the logic of relations, and Charles Sanders Peirce integrated his work with Boole's during the 1870s. Other significant figures were Platon Sergeevich Poretskii, and William Ernest Johnson. The conception of a Boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a propositional calculus is credited to Hugh MacColl (1877), in work surveyed 15 years later by Johnson. Surveys of these developments were published by Ernst Schr\u00f6der, Louis Couturat, and Clarence Irving Lewis.\n20th-century development.\nIn 1921, the economist John Maynard Keynes published a book on probability theory, \"A Treatise of Probability\". Keynes believed that Boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis. In his book \"The Last Challenge Problem\", David Miller provides a general method in accord with Boole's system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by Keynes and others. Theodore Hailperin showed much earlier that Boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems.\nBoole's work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses. Claude Shannon attended a philosophy class at the University of Michigan which introduced him to Boole's studies. Shannon recognised that Boole's work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant. In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical relays then used in telephone routing switches. He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems. Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic digital computers. Victor Shestakov at Moscow State University (1907\u20131987) proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic even earlier than Claude Shannon in 1935 on the testimony of Soviet logicians and mathematicians Sofya Yanovskaya, Gaaze-Rapoport, Roland Dobrushin, Lupanov, Medvedev and Uspensky. But the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian). Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical digital circuit design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the Information Age.\n21st-century celebration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Boole's legacy surrounds us everywhere, in the computers, information storage and retrieval, electronic circuits and controls that support life, learning and communications in the 21st century. His pivotal advances in mathematics, logic and probability provided the essential groundwork for modern mathematics, microelectronic engineering and computer science.\"\n\u2014University College Cork.\nThe year 2015 saw the 200th anniversary of Boole's birth. To mark the bicentenary year, University College Cork joined admirers of Boole around the world to celebrate his life and legacy.\nUCC's George Boole 200 project, featured events, student outreach activities and academic conferences on Boole's legacy in the digital age, including a new edition of Desmond MacHale's 1985 biography \" The Life and Work of George Boole: A Prelude to the Digital Age\", 2014.\nThe search engine Google marked the 200th anniversary of his birth on 2 November 2015 with an algebraic reimaging of its Google Doodle.\nIn September 2022, a statue of George Boole in his role as a teacher was unveiled at Lincoln Central Train Station, in Boole's home town of Lincoln.\nViews.\nBoole's views were given in four published addresses: \"The Genius of Sir Isaac Newton\"; \"The Right Use of Leisure\"; \"The Claims of Science\"; and \"The Social Aspect of Intellectual Culture\". The first of these was from 1835 when Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough gave a bust of Newton to the Mechanics' Institute in Lincoln. The second justified and celebrated in 1847 the outcome of the successful campaign for early closing in Lincoln, headed by Alexander Leslie-Melville, of Branston Hall. \"The Claims of Science\" was given in 1851 at Queen's College, Cork. \"The Social Aspect of Intellectual Culture\" was also given in Cork, in 1855 to the Cuvierian Society.\nThough his biographer Des MacHale describes Boole as an \"agnostic deist\", Boole read a wide variety of Christian theology. Combining his interests in mathematics and theology, he compared the Christian trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost with the three dimensions of space, and was attracted to the Hebrew conception of God as an absolute unity. Boole considered converting to Judaism but in the end was said to have chosen Unitarianism.[reference?] Boole came to speak against what he saw as \"prideful\" scepticism, and instead favoured the belief in a \"Supreme Intelligent Cause\". He also declared \"I firmly believe, for the accomplishment of a purpose of the Divine Mind.\" In addition, he stated \"To infer the existence of an intelligent cause from the teeming evidence of surrounding design, to rise to the conception of a moral Governor of the World, from the study of the constitution and the moral provisions of our own nature;--these, though but the feeble steps of an understanding limited in its faculties and its materials of knowledge, are of more avail than the ambitious attempt to arrive at a certainty unattainable on the ground of natural religion. And as these were the most ancient, so are they still the most solid foundations, Revelation being set apart, of the belief that the course of this world is not abandoned to chance and inexorable fate.\"\nTwo influences on Boole were later claimed by his wife, Mary Everest Boole: a universal mysticism tempered by Jewish thought, and Indian logic. Mary Boole stated that an adolescent mystical experience provided for his life's work:\nMy husband told me that when he was a lad of seventeen a thought struck him suddenly, which became the foundation of all his future discoveries. It was a flash of psychological insight into the conditions under which a mind most readily accumulates knowledge\u00a0... For a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of \"the Bible\" as a whole, and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the English Church. But by the help of a learned Jew in Lincoln he found out the true nature of the discovery which had dawned on him. This was that man's mind works by means of some mechanism which \"functions normally towards Monism.\"\nIn Ch. 13 of \"Laws of Thought\" Boole used examples of propositions from Baruch Spinoza and Samuel Clarke. The work contains some remarks on the relationship of logic to religion, but they are slight and cryptic. Boole was apparently disconcerted at the book's reception just as a mathematical toolset:\nGeorge afterwards learned, to his great joy, that the same conception of the basis of Logic was held by Leibniz, the contemporary of Newton. De Morgan, of course, understood the formula in its true sense; he was Boole's collaborator all along. Herbert Spencer, Jowett, and Robert Leslie Ellis understood, I feel sure; and a few others, but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored [953] the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind; and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact.\nMary Boole claimed that there was profound influence \u2013 via her uncle George Everest \u2013 of Indian thought in general and Indian logic, in particular, on George Boole, as well as on Augustus De Morgan and Charles Babbage:\nThink what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830\u201365. What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?\nBoole maintained that:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.\nFamily.\nIn 1855, Boole married Mary Everest (niece of George Everest), who later wrote several educational works on her husband's principles.\nThe Booles had five daughters:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38299", "revid": "45280120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38299", "title": "Activision", "text": "American video game publisher\nActivision Publishing, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica, California. It serves as the publishing business for its parent company, Activision Blizzard, and consists of several subsidiary studios. Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016.\nThe company was founded as Activision, Inc. on October 1, 1979, in Sunnyvale, California, by former Atari game developers upset at their treatment by Atari in order to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The video game crash of 1983, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the experience of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$ by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.\nKotick drastically revamped and restructured the company to get it out of debt: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from its former financial troubles, started acquiring numerous studios and various types of intellectual property over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the \"Call of Duty\" and \"Guitar Hero\" series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to manage both its internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding company merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision manages numerous third-party studios and publishes all games besides those created by Blizzard. In October 2023, Microsoft acquired parent company Activision Blizzard, maintaining that the company would continue to operate as a separate business. While part of the larger Microsoft Gaming division, Activision retains its function as the publisher of games developed by their studios.\nHistory.\nFounding (1979).\nIn 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari, Inc. from Nolan Bushnell to help accelerate the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS or later the Atari 2600) to market by 1977. That same year, Atari began hiring programmers to create games for the system. Prior to Warner's acquisition, the company did not award bonus pay to programmers who worked on profitable games, nor credit the programmers publicly, to prevent them from being recruited by rival game companies. Warner Communications' management style was also different from Bushnell's. According to developer John Dunn, Warner management treated developers as engineers rather than creative staff, creating conflicts with staff. Atari's CEO Ray Kassar, named to that position following Warner's acquisition in 1978, was committed to keeping production costs minimal for Warner.\nIn early 1979, Atari's marketing department circulated a memo listing the best-selling cartridges from the previous year to help guide game ideas. Crane noted that the games he was fully responsible for had brought in over $ for the company but he was still only receiving a $ salary. Out of a development staff of thirty-five, four programmers (Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead), had produced games that had accounted for 60% of Atari's sales.\nCrane, Kaplan, Miller, and Whitehead became vocal about the lack of recognition within the company and became known as the \"Gang of Four\". The group met with Kassar in May 1979 to demand that the company treat developers as record labels treated musicians, with royalties and their names on game boxes. Kaplan, who called the others \"the best designers for the [2600] in the world\", recalled that Kassar called the four men \"towel designers\" and claimed that \"anybody can do a cartridge\".\nThe four made the decision to soon leave Atari and start their own business, but were not sure how to go about it. In 1979, the concept of third-party developers did not exist, as software for video game consoles were published exclusively by makers of the systems for which the games were designed; thus the common thinking was that to make console games, one needed to make a console first. The four decided to create their own independent game development company. They were directed by their attorney to Jim Levy, who was at the time raising venture capital to get into the software business for early home computers. Levy listened to their plans, agreed with its direction, and helped the four to secure about $ in capital from Sutter Hill Ventures. They also checked with legal counsel on their plans to develop games for the Atari VCS, and included litigation fees in their capital investment.\nBy August, Crane and Miller had left Atari, with Whitehead joining them shortly after. Kaplan had also quit Atari in August, but initially decided not to join as he did not like the starting business plan; he came back later to join Activision that December. Activision was formally founded on October 1, 1979, with Levy serving as CEO. The company was initially named \"Computer Arts, Inc.\" while they considered a better title. The founders had thought of the name VSync, Inc., but feared that the public would not understand or know how to say it. Levy suggested combining \"active\" and \"television\" to come up with Activision.\nEarly years (1980\u20131982).\nActivision began working out of Crane's garage in the latter half of 1979, each programmer developing their own game that was planned for release in mid-1980: \"Dragster\", \"Fishing Derby\", \"Checkers\", and \"Boxing\". The four's knowledge of the Atari 2600, as well as software tricks for the system, helped them make their own games visually distinct from Atari-produced games. To further distinguish themselves, Activision's boxes were brightly colored and featured an in-game screenshot on the back cover. Instruction manuals for games devoted at least one page to credit the developer. Additionally, for nearly all of Activision's games through 1983, the instruction manuals included instructions for sending the company a photograph of a player's high scores to receive a patch in return.\nAhead of the release of the first four games, Activision obtained space at the mid-year 1980 Consumer Electronics Show to showcase their titles, and they quickly obtained favorable press. The attention afforded to Activision worried Atari, as the four's departure had already created a major dent in their development staff. Atari initially tried to tarnish Activision's reputation by using industry press at CES to label those that took trade secrets as \"evil, terrible people\", according to Crane, and then later threatened to refuse to sell Atari games to retailers that also carried these Activision titles. By the end of 1980, Atari filed a formal lawsuit against Activision to try to stop the company, claiming the four had stolen trade secrets and violated non-disclosure agreements. The lawsuit was settled by 1982, with Activision agreeing to pay royalties to Atari but otherwise legitimizing the third-party development model.\nFollowing the first round of releases, each of the founders developed their own titles, about once a year, over the first few years of the company. While their 1980 games were modest hits, one of the company's first successful games was \"Kaboom!\", released in 1981, which was Activision's first game to sell over a million units. Activision's breakout title was 1982's \"Pitfall!\", created by Crane. More than four million copies of the game were sold. Near the end of 1982, Kaplan left Activision to work on the development of the Amiga personal computer as he wanted to be more involved in hardware development.\nTotal sales for Activision were estimated at $ and revenues at $ ahead of its June 1983 initial public offering; at this point Activision had around 60 employees. Danny Goodman stated in \"Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games\" in 1983, \"I doubt that there is an active [Atari 2600] owner who doesn't have at least one Activision cartridge in his library\". The company completed its public offering in June 1983 on NASDAQ under the stock ticker AVSN.\nThe video game market crash (1983\u20131988).\nThe success of Activision, alongside the popularity of the Atari 2600, led to many more home consoles third-party developers as well as other home consoles. Activision produced some of its Atari games for the Intellivision and ColecoVision consoles, among other platforms. However, several new third-party developers also arose, attempting to follow the approach Activision had used but without the experience they had; according to Crane, several of these companies were founded with venture capital and hired programmers with little game design experience off the street, mass-publishing whatever product the developers had made. This was a contributing factor to the video game crash of 1983.\nFor Activision, while they survived the crash, they felt its effects in the following years. These third-party developers folded, leaving warehouses full of unsold games, which savvy retailers purchased and sold at a mass discount ($ compared to Activision's $ manufacturer's suggested retail price). While there was still a demand for Activision games, uneducated consumers were more drawn to the heavily discounted titles instead, reducing their income. Their quarterly revenue dropped from $ in mid-1983 to about $ by the end of 1984, according to Levy, and they were forced to lay off staff, going from about 400 employees to 95 in that period. Because of this, Activision decided that they needed to diversify their games onto home computers such as the Commodore 64, Apple, and Atari 8-bit computers to avoid completely going out of business like other third-party developers. There still was a drain of talent through 1985 from the crash. Miller and Whitehead left in 1984 due to the large devaluation of their stock and went on to form Accolade.\nWith the video game crash making console game development a risky proposition, the company focused on developing for home computers with games like \"Little Computer People\" and \"Hacker\", while Levy tried to keep expenditures in check as they recovered. Looking to expand further, Activision acquired, through a corporate merger, the struggling text adventure pioneer Infocom in June 1986. This acquisition was spearheaded by Levy, who was a big fan of Infocom's titles and felt the company was in a similar position as Activision. About six months after the \"Infocom Wedding\", Activision's board decided to replace Levy with Bruce Davis. Davis was against the purchase of Infocom from the start and was heavy-handed in its management, and even attempted to seek a lawsuit to recover their purchase from Infocom's shareholders. Crane also found Davis difficult to work with and was concerned with how Davis managed the closure of Imagic, one of the third-party development studios formed after Activision's success in 1981. Crane left Activision in 1986 and helped Garry Kitchen found Absolute Entertainment. In late 1986, Activision adopted the Electric Dreams brand, usually used for British software, for titles outside of English for the American market.\nMediagenic (1988\u20131991).\nIn 1988, Activision began involvement in software besides video games, such as business applications. As a result, Activision changed its corporate name to Mediagenic to better represent all of its activities.\nMediagenic consisted of four groups:\nIn 1989, after several years of losses, Activision closed down the Infocom studios, extending to only 11 of the 26 employees an offer to relocate to Activision's Silicon Valley headquarters. Five of them accepted this offer.\nNotably during this time, Mediagenic was known to have worked on the early version of a football game that was the basis for \"Joe Montana Football\". Sega of America's Michael Katz had been able to get Sega to pay Mediagenic around early 1990 to develop this into the branded version after securing the rights to Joe Montana's name, but was unaware of internal troubles that had been going on within the company, which had left the state of the game mostly unfinished. Katz and Sega were forced to take the incomplete game to Electronic Arts, which had been developing its own \"John Madden Football\" series for personal computers, to complete the game.\nDuring this period Mediagenic, via Activision, secured the rights to distribute games from Cyan Worlds. The first game published by Activision from Cyan was \"The Manhole\", on CD-ROM for personal computers, the first major game distributed in this format.\nPurchase by Bobby Kotick (1991\u20131997).\nDavis' management of Mediagenic failed to produce a profitable company; in 1991, Mediagenic reported a loss of $ on only $ of revenue and had over $ in debt. This debt included a $ penalty against Mediagenic in May 1990 after losing patent infringement lawsuits filed against it by Magnavox over the similarities of Activision's games to Magnavox's patents. Cyan severed their contract with Activision, and turned to Broderbund for publishing, including what became one of the most significant computer games of the 1990s, \"Myst\".\nBobby Kotick had become interested in the value of the video game industry following the crash, and he and three other investors worked to buy Commodore International in an effort to gain access to the Amiga line of personal computers. After failing to complete purchase, the group bought a company that licensed Nintendo characters, and through Nintendo was directed to the failing Mediagenic. Kotick was drawn to buy out Mediagenic not for its current offerings but for the Activision name, given its past successes with \"Pitfall!\", with hopes to restore Activision to its former glory. After failing to negotiate a purchase with Davis, Kotick and additional investors bought Mediagenic in a hostile takeover for approximately $ in 1991. This group of investors included real estate businessman Steve Wynn and Philips Electronics.\nKotick became CEO of Mediagenic on its purchase and made several immediate changes: He let go of all but 8 of the companies' 150 employees, performed a full restructuring of the company, developed a bankruptcy restructuring plan, and reincorporated the company in Los Angeles, California. In the bankruptcy plan, Kotick recognized that Mediagenic still had valuable assets, which included the Infocom library as well as its authoring tools to make games, Activision's distribution network, and licenses to develop on Nintendo and Sega home consoles. Kotick offset some debt by giving stock in the company to its distributors as to keep them vested in the company's success; this included convincing Philips Electronics, Magnavox's parent company, to convert their legal debt into stock in Activision. Kotick also had the company reissue several of its past console and Infocom titles as compilations for personal computers. Kotick had also recognized the value of the \"Zork\" property from Infocom, and had the company develop a sequel, \"Return to Zork\". Combined, these steps allowed Mediagenic to fulfill on the bankruptcy plan, and by the end of 1992, Kotick renamed Mediagenic to the original Activision name. The new Activision went public in October 1993, raising about $, and was listed on NASDAQ under its new ticker symbol ATVI.\nBy 1995, Kotick's approach had met one promise he made to investors: that he would give them four years of 50% growth in revenues while remaining break-even. Reaching this goal, Kotick then set Activision on his second promise to investors, to develop high-demand games and make the company profitable by 1997.\nActivision published the first-person perspective \"MechWarrior\" in 1989, based on FASA's pen-and-paper game \"BattleTech\". A sequel, \"MechWarrior 2\", was released in 1995 after two years of delays and internal struggles, prompting FASA not to renew their licensing deal with Activision. To counter, Activision released several more games bearing the \"MechWarrior 2\" name, which did not violate their licensing agreement. These included \"NetMech\", ', and '. The entire \"MechWarrior 2\" game series accounted for more than US$ in sales.\nActivision procured the license to another pen-and-paper-based war game, \"Heavy Gear\", in 1997. The video game version was well received by critics, with an 81.46% average rating on GameRankings and being considered the best game of the genre at the time by GameSpot. The \"Mechwarrior 2\" engine was also used in other Activision games, including 1997's \"Interstate '76\" and 1998's \"Battlezone\".\nGrowth and acquisitions (1997\u20132008).\nWith several of its own successfully developed games helping to turn a profit, Kotick led Activision to start seeking acquisitions of video game development studios, guided by market surveys to determine what areas of content to focus on. It is estimated that between 1997 and 2008, Activision made 25 acquisitions, several for undisclosed amounts. Several of these came prior to 2001, in the midst of the Dot-com bubble, enabling the company to acquire studios at a lower valuation. On June 16, 2000, Activision reorganized as a holding company, Activision Holdings, to manage Activision and its subsidiaries more effectively. Activision changed its corporate name from \"Activision, Inc.\" to \"Activision Publishing, Inc.\", while Activision Holdings took Activision's former \"Activision, Inc.\" name. Activision Publishing became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision, which in turn became the publicly traded company, with all outstanding shares of capital stock converted.\nSome of the key acquisitions and investments made by Activision in this period include:\nMerger with Vivendi Games (2008).\nWhile Activision was highly successful with its range of developers and successful series, Kotick was concerned that they did not have a title for the growing massively multiplayer online market, which presented the opportunity for continued revenues from subscription models and microtransactions instead of the revenue from a single sale. Around 2006, Kotick contacted Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, the new CEO of Vivendi, a French media conglomerate. Vivendi had a games division, Vivendi Games, that was struggling to be viable at the time, but its principal feature was that it owned Blizzard Entertainment and its highly successful \"World of Warcraft\" game, which was drawing in $ a year in subscription fees. Vivendi Games also owned Sierra Entertainment.\nL\u00e9vy recognized Kotick wanted control of \"World of Warcraft\", and offered to allow the companies to merge, but only if L\u00e9vy held the majority shares in the merged group, forcing Kotick to cede control. Kotick fretted about this decision for a while, according to friends and investors. During this time in 2006\u20132007, some of Activision's former successful properties began to wane, such as \"Tony Hawk's\", so Activision bought RedOctane, the publisher of the \"Guitar Hero\" franchise. Kotick met with Blizzard's president Mike Morhaime, and learned that Blizzard also had a successful inroad into getting their games into China, a potentially lucrative market. Given this potential opportunity, Kotick agreed to the merger.\nActivision's board signed on to the merger by December 2007. The merger was completed in July 2008. The new company was called Activision Blizzard and was headed by Kotick, while Vivendi maintained a 52% share in the company. The new company was estimated to be worth US$, ahead of Electronic Arts, which was valued at US$.\nPost-merger developments (2009\u20132022).\nActivision Publishing remains a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard following the merger, and is responsible for developing, producing, and distributing games from its internal and subsidiary studios. Eric Hirshberg was announced as Activision Publishing's CEO in 2010.\nActivision Publishing established Sledgehammer Games in November 2009. Formed earlier in 2009 by Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey, former Visceral Games leads that had worked on \"Dead Space\", Sledgehammer intended to develop a \"Call of Duty\" spin-off title fashioned after the gameplay in \"Dead Space\". However, in early 2010, legal issues between Infinity Ward and Activision Blizzard led to several members of Infinity Ward leaving, and Activision assigned Sledgehammer to assist Infinity Ward in the next major \"Call of Duty\" title, \"\". Since then, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, and Treyarch share development duties for the flagship series, with support from Raven and other studios as necessary.\nIn February 2010, Activision Blizzard reported significant losses in revenue stemming from a slow down in \"Guitar Hero\" sales and from its more casual games. Subsequently, Activision Publishing shuttered Red Octane, Luxoflux and Underground Development as well as laid off about 25% of the staff at Neversoft. Within the same year, Activision shuttered Budcat Creations in November 2010, and Bizarre Creations in February 2011.\nHirshberg left the CEO position in March 2018. On January 9, 2019, Activision Blizzard appointed Rob Kostich as president of Activision Publishing, as part of a broader executive reshuffle at the company. Before the promotion, Kostich served as executive vice president and general manager of the Call of Duty franchise for more than ten years.\nInto the 2020s, Activision put more focus on the \"Call of Duty\" franchise, including the release of the free-to-play \"\" in 2020. By April 2021, the company had assigned all of its internal studios to work on some part of the \"Call of Duty\" franchise. This includes a new studio, Activision Mobile, devoted to the \"Call of Duty Mobile\" title as reported in August 2021.\nIn 2021, while all their employees were working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, Activision and its parent Activision Blizzard vacated their longtime headquarters building in Santa Monica and ended their lease with Boston Properties. In September 2021, they subleased a much smaller office space in Santa Monica at the Pen Factory (a former Paper Mate factory) from Kite Pharma, which had leased the space from Lincoln Property Company.\nPurchase by Microsoft (2023\u2013present).\nWith the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft in October 2023, Activision Blizzard as a whole, including the Activision Publishing subdivision, became a separate division under the Microsoft Gaming arm of Microsoft.\nOn March 8, 2024, 600 Activision QA workers in Texas, Minnesota and California unionized under the Communication Workers of America (CWA), marking it as the largest union in the United States video game industry.\nOn May 16, 2024, Activision announced the establishment of Warsaw-based studio Elsewhere Entertainment, assembled for the development of a new narrative-based AAA IP not associated with other Activision series like \"Call of Duty\". The studio comprises various developers associated with other narrative-driven gaming franchises such as \"The Last of Us\", \"Uncharted\", \"The Witcher\" and \"Far Cry\" among others; at the time of announcement they were recruiting more staff to create a \"state-of-the-art and next-generation gaming experience\", as well as a franchise with \"an enduring legacy that goes far beyond games.\"\nIn July 2024, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) actor labor union, which provides numerous video game voice actors, initiated a labor strike against a number of video publishers, including Activision, over concerns about lack of AI protections which concern not only video game actors, but also the use of AI to replicate an actor's voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness.\nNotable games published.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards.\nIn 2003, the company was awarded the Game Developers Choice \"First Penguin\" award in recognition of its place as the first third-party developer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38300", "revid": "47988270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38300", "title": "Pancreas", "text": "Organ of the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates\nThe pancreas (plural pancreases, or pancreata) is an organ of the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and functions as a gland. The pancreas is a mixed or heterocrine gland, i.e., it has both an endocrine and a digestive exocrine function. Ninety-nine percent of the pancreas is exocrine and 1% is endocrine. As an endocrine gland, it functions mostly to regulate blood sugar levels, secreting the hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide. As a part of the digestive system, it functions as an exocrine gland secreting pancreatic juice into the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. This juice contains bicarbonate, which neutralizes acid entering the duodenum from the stomach; and digestive enzymes, which break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats in food entering the duodenum from the stomach.\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis, with common causes including chronic alcohol use and gallstones. Because of its role in the regulation of blood sugar, the pancreas is also a key organ in diabetes. Pancreatic cancer can arise following chronic pancreatitis or due to other reasons, and carries a very poor prognosis, as it is often only identified after it has spread to other areas of the body.\nThe word pancreas comes from the Greek \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd (p\u00e2n, \"all\") &amp; \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 (kr\u00e9as, \"flesh\"). The function of the pancreas in diabetes has been known since at least 1889, with its role in insulin production identified in 1921.\nStructure.\nThe pancreas is an organ that in humans lies in the abdomen, stretching from behind the stomach to the left upper abdomen near the spleen. In adults, it is about long, , and salmon-coloured in appearance.\nAnatomically, the pancreas is divided into a \"head\", \"neck\", \"body\", and \"tail\". The pancreas stretches from the inner curvature of the duodenum, where the head surrounds two blood vessels: the superior mesenteric artery and vein. The longest part of the pancreas, the body, stretches across behind the stomach, and the tail of the pancreas ends adjacent to the spleen.\nTwo ducts, the main pancreatic duct and a smaller accessory pancreatic duct run through the body of the pancreas. The main pancreatic duct joins with the common bile duct forming a small ballooning called the ampulla of Vater (hepatopancreatic ampulla). This ampulla is surrounded by a muscle, the sphincter of Oddi. This ampulla opens into the descending part of the duodenum. The opening of the common bile duct into main pancreatic duct is controlled by sphincter of Boyden. The accessory pancreatic duct opens into duodenum with separate openings located above the opening of the main pancreatic duct.\nParts.\nThe head of the pancreas sits within the curvature of the duodenum, and wraps around the superior mesenteric artery and vein. To the right sits the descending part of the duodenum, and between these travel the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Behind rest the inferior vena cava, and the common bile duct. In front sit the peritoneal membrane and the transverse colon. A small uncinate process emerges from below the head, situated behind the superior mesenteric vein and sometimes artery.\nThe neck of the pancreas separates the head of the pancreas, located in the curvature of the duodenum, from the body. The neck is about wide, and sits in front of where the portal vein is formed. The neck lies mostly behind the pylorus of the stomach, and is covered with peritoneum. The anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery travels in front of the neck of the pancreas.\nThe body is the largest part of the pancreas, and mostly lies behind the stomach, tapering along its length. The peritoneum sits on top of the body of the pancreas, and the transverse colon in front of the peritoneum. Behind the pancreas are several blood vessels, including the aorta, the splenic vein, and the left renal vein, as well as the beginning of the superior mesenteric artery. Below the body of the pancreas sits some of the small intestine, specifically the last part of the duodenum and the jejunum to which it connects, as well as the suspensory ligament of the duodenum which falls between these two. In front of the pancreas sits the transverse colon.\nThe pancreas narrows towards the tail, which sits near to the spleen. It is usually between long, and sits between the layers of the ligament between the spleen and the left kidney. The splenic artery and vein pass behind the body and tail of the pancreas.\nBlood supply.\nThe pancreas has a rich blood supply, with vessels originating as branches of both the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery. The splenic artery, the largest branch of the celiac trunk, runs along the top of the pancreas, and supplies the left part of the body and the tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery. The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the back and front surfaces of the head of the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum. These supply the head of the pancreas. These vessels join together () in the middle.\nThe body and neck of the pancreas drain into the splenic vein, which sits behind the pancreas. The head drains into, and wraps around, the superior mesenteric and portal veins, via the pancreaticoduodenal veins.\nThe pancreas drains into lymphatic vessels that travel alongside its arteries, and has a rich lymphatic supply. The lymphatic vessels of the body and tail drain into splenic lymph nodes, and eventually into lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta, between the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. The lymphatic vessels of the head and neck drain into intermediate lymphatic vessels around the pancreaticoduodenal, mesenteric and hepatic arteries, and from there into the lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta.\nMicroanatomy.\nThe pancreas contains tissues with both an endocrine and exocrine role. This division is visible when the pancreas is viewed under a microscope.\nThe majority of pancreatic tissue has a digestive role. The cells with this role form clusters (acini) around small ducts, and are arranged in lobes that have thin fibrous walls. The cells of each acinus secrete inactive digestive enzymes called zymogens into the small \"intercalated\" ducts which they surround. In each acinus, the cells are pyramid-shaped and situated around the intercalated ducts, with the nuclei resting on the basement membrane, a large endoplasmic reticulum, and a number of zymogen granules visible within the cytoplasm. The intercalated ducts drain into larger \"intralobular\" ducts within the lobule, and finally \"interlobular\" ducts. The ducts are lined by a single layer of column-shaped cells. There is more than one layer of cells as the diameter of the ducts increases.\nThe tissues with an endocrine role within the pancreas exist as clusters of cells called pancreatic islets (also called islets of Langerhans) that are distributed throughout the pancreas. Pancreatic islets contain alpha cells, beta cells, and delta cells, each of which releases a different hormone. These cells have characteristic positions, with alpha cells (secreting glucagon) tending to be situated around the periphery of the islet, and beta cells (secreting insulin) more numerous and found throughout the islet. Enterochromaffin cells are also scattered throughout the islets. Islets are composed of up to 3,000 secretory cells, and contain several small arterioles to receive blood, and venules that allow the hormones secreted by the cells to enter the systemic circulation.\nVariation.\nThe size of the pancreas varies considerably. Several anatomical variations exist, relating to the embryological development of the two pancreatic buds. The pancreas develops from these buds on either side of the duodenum. The ventral bud rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud, eventually fusing. In about 10% of adults, an accessory pancreatic duct may be present if the main duct of the dorsal bud of the pancreas does not regress; this duct opens into the minor duodenal papilla. If the two buds themselves, each having a duct, do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a pancreas divisum. This condition has no physiologic consequence. If the ventral bud does not fully rotate, an annular pancreas may exist, where part or all of the duodenum is encircled by the pancreas. This may be associated with duodenal atresia.\nGene and protein expression.\n10,000 protein coding genes (~50% of all human genes) are expressed in the normal human pancreas. Less than 100 of these genes are specifically expressed in the pancreas. Similar to the salivary glands, most pancreas-specific genes encode for secreted proteins. Corresponding pancreas-specific proteins are either expressed in the exocrine cellular compartment and have functions related to digestion or food uptake such as digestive chymotrypsinogen enzymes and pancreatic lipase PNLIP, or are expressed in the various cells of the endocrine pancreatic islets and have functions related to secreted hormones such as insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide.\nDevelopment.\nThe pancreas forms during development from two pancreatic buds that arise from the duodenal part of the foregut, an embryonic tube that is a precursor to the gastrointestinal tract. It is of endodermal origin. Pancreatic development begins with the formation of a dorsal and ventral pancreatic bud. Each joins with the foregut through a duct. The dorsal pancreatic bud forms the neck, body, and tail of the developed pancreas, and the ventral pancreatic bud forms the head and uncinate process.\nThe definitive pancreas results from rotation of the ventral bud and the fusion of the two buds. During development, the duodenum rotates to the right, and the ventral bud rotates with it, moving to a position that becomes more dorsal. Upon reaching its final destination, the ventral pancreatic bud is below the larger dorsal bud, and eventually fuses with it. At this point of fusion, the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse, forming the main pancreatic duct. Usually, the duct of the dorsal bud regresses, leaving the main pancreatic duct.\nCellular development.\nPancreatic progenitor cells are precursor cells that differentiate into the functional pancreatic cells, including exocrine centroacinar cells, endocrine islet cells, and ductal cells. These progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1.\nThe cells of the exocrine pancreas differentiate through molecules that induce differentiation including follistatin, fibroblast growth factors, and activation of the Notch receptor system. Development of the exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages. These are the predifferentiated, protodifferentiated, and differentiated stages, which correspond to undetectable, low, and high levels of digestive enzyme activity, respectively.\nPancreatic progenitor cells differentiate into endocrine islet cells under the influence of neurogenin-3 and ISL1, but only in the absence of notch receptor signaling. Under the direction of a Pax gene, the endocrine precursor cells differentiate to form alpha and gamma cells. Under the direction of Pax-6, the endocrine precursor cells differentiate to form beta and delta cells. The pancreatic islets form as the endocrine cells migrate from the duct system to form small clusters around capillaries. This occurs around the third month of development, and insulin and glucagon can be detected in the human fetal circulation by the fourth or fifth month of development.\nFunction.\nThe pancreas is involved in blood sugar control and metabolism within the body, and also in the secretion of substances (collectively pancreatic juice) that help digestion. These functions are divided into an endocrine role, relating to the secretion of insulin and other hormones within pancreatic islets that help control blood sugar levels and metabolism, and an exocrine role, relating to the secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes.\nBlood glucose regulation.\nCells within the pancreas help to maintain blood glucose levels (homeostasis). The cells that do this are located within the pancreatic islets that are present throughout the pancreas. The following processes take place with blood glucose levels:\nDelta cells in the islet also secrete somatostatin which decreases the release of insulin and glucagon.\nGlucagon acts to increase glucose levels by promoting the creation of glucose and the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver. It also decreases the uptake of glucose in fat and muscle. Glucagon release is stimulated by low blood glucose or insulin levels, and during exercise. Insulin acts to decrease blood glucose levels by facilitating uptake by cells (particularly skeletal muscle), and promoting its use in the creation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Insulin is initially created as a precursor form called preproinsulin. This is converted to proinsulin and cleaved by C-peptide to insulin which is then stored in granules in beta cells. Glucose is taken into the beta cells and degraded. The end effect of this is to cause depolarisation of the cell membrane which stimulates the release of the insulin.\nThe main factor influencing the secretion of insulin and glucagon are the levels of glucose in blood plasma. Low blood sugar stimulates glucagon release, and high blood sugar stimulates insulin release. Other factors also influence the secretion of these hormones. Some amino acids, that are byproducts of the digestion of protein, stimulate insulin and glucagon release. Somatostatin acts as an inhibitor of both insulin and glucagon. The autonomic nervous system also plays a role. Activation of Beta-2 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system by catecholamines secreted from sympathetic nerves stimulates secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas activation of Alpha-1 receptors inhibits secretion. M3 receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system act when stimulated by the right vagus nerve to stimulate release of insulin from beta cells.\nDigestion.\nThe pancreas plays a vital role in the digestive system. It does this by secreting pancreatic juice, a fluid that contains digestive enzymes, into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine that receives food from the stomach. These enzymes help to break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats). This is the exocrine role of the pancreas. The cells responsible for this are centroacinar cells arranged in clusters called acini. Secretions into the middle of the acinus accumulate in intralobular ducts, which drain to the main pancreatic duct, which drains directly into the duodenum. About 1.5\u20133 liters of fluid are secreted in this manner every day.\nThe cells in each acinus are filled with granules containing the digestive enzymes. These are secreted in an inactive form termed zymogens or proenzymes. When released into the duodenum, they are activated by the enzyme enterokinase present in the lining of the duodenum. The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes.\nThese enzymes are secreted in a fluid rich in bicarbonate. Bicarbonate helps maintain an alkaline pH for the fluid, a pH in which most of the enzymes act most efficiently, and also helps to neutralise the stomach acids that enter the duodenum. Secretion is influenced by hormones including secretin, cholecystokinin, and VIP, as well as acetylcholine stimulation from the vagus nerve. Secretin is released from the S cells which form part of the lining of the duodenum in response to stimulation by gastric acid. Along with VIP, it increases the secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate. Cholecystokinin is released from Ito cells of the lining of the duodenum and jejunum mostly in response to long chain fatty acids, and increases the effects of secretin. At a cellular level, bicarbonate is secreted from centroacinar and ductal cells through a sodium and bicarbonate cotransporter that acts because of membrane depolarisation caused by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Secretin and VIP act to increase the opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which leads to more membrane depolarisation and more secretion of bicarbonate.\nA variety of mechanisms act to ensure that the digestive action of the pancreas does not act to digest pancreatic tissue itself. These include the secretion of inactive enzymes (zymogens), the secretion of the protective enzyme trypsin inhibitor, which inactivates trypsin, the changes in pH that occur with bicarbonate secretion that stimulate digestion only when the pancreas is stimulated, and the fact that the low calcium within cells causes inactivation of trypsin.\nAdditional functions.\nThe pancreas also secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide and pancreatic polypeptide. Enterochromaffin cells of the pancreas secrete the hormones motilin, serotonin, and substance P. It has been demonstrated that pancreatic tissue is a strong accumulator and secretor in the intestine of radioactive cesium (Cs-137).\nClinical significance.\nInflammation.\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent gallstones or chronic alcohol use, with other common causes including traumatic damage, damage following an ERCP, some medications, infections such as mumps and very high blood triglyceride levels. Acute pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central abdomen, that often radiates to the back, and may be associated with nausea or vomiting. Severe pancreatitis may lead to bleeding or perforation of the pancreas resulting in shock or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, bruising of the flanks or the region around the belly button. These severe complications are often managed in an intensive care unit.\nIn pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection of some of these enzymes, such as amylase and lipase in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on medical imaging such as ultrasound or a CT scan, are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is often managed medically with pain relief, and monitoring to prevent or manage shock, and management of any identified underlying causes. This may include removal of gallstones, lowering of blood triglyceride or glucose levels, the use of corticosteroids for autoimmune pancreatitis, and the cessation of any medication triggers.\nChronic pancreatitis refers to the development of pancreatitis over time. It shares many similar causes, with the most common being chronic alcohol use, with other causes including recurrent acute episodes and cystic fibrosis. Abdominal pain, characteristically relieved by sitting forward or drinking alcohol, is the most common symptom. When the digestive function of the pancreas is severely affected, this may lead to problems with fat digestion and the development of steatorrhoea; when the endocrine function is affected, this may lead to diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis is investigated in a similar way to acute pancreatitis. In addition to management of pain and nausea, and management of any identified causes (which may include alcohol cessation), because of the digestive role of the pancreas, enzyme replacement may be needed to prevent malabsorption.\nCancer.\nPancreatic cancers, particularly the most common type, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, remain very difficult to treat, and are mostly diagnosed only at a stage that is too late for surgery, which is the only curative treatment. Pancreatic cancer is rare in people younger than 40 and the median age of diagnosis is 71. Risk factors include chronic pancreatitis, older age, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and dysplastic nevus syndrome among others. About 25% of cases are attributable to tobacco smoking, while 5\u201310% of cases are linked to inherited genes.\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most common form of pancreatic cancer, and is cancer arising from the exocrine digestive part of the pancreas. Most occur in the head of the pancreas. Symptoms tend to arise late in the course of the cancer, when it causes abdominal pain, weight loss, or yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Jaundice occurs when the outflow of bile is blocked by the cancer. Other less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, diabetes or recurrent venous thrombosis. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by medical imaging in the form of an ultrasound or CT scan with contrast enhancement. An endoscopic ultrasound may be used if a tumour is being considered for surgical removal, and biopsy guided by ERCP or ultrasound can be used to confirm an uncertain diagnosis.\nBecause of the late development of symptoms, most cancer presents at an advanced stage. Only 10 to 15% of tumours are suitable for surgical resection. As of 2018[ [update]], when chemotherapy is given the FOLFIRINOX regimen containing fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and leucovorin has been shown to extend survival beyond traditional gemcitabine regimens. For the most part, treatment is palliative, focus on the management of symptoms that develop. This may include management of itch, a choledochojejunostomy or the insertion of stents with ERCP to facilitate the drainage of bile, and medications to help control pain. In the United States pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer. The disease occurs more often in the developed world, which had 68% of new cases in 2012. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and 5% respectively. In localized disease where the cancer is small (&lt; 2\u00a0cm) the number alive at five years is approximately 20%.\nThere are several types of pancreatic cancer, involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue. The many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare, and have varied outlooks. However the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply; it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection, especially through medical imaging, of tumors that would be very slow to develop. Insulinomas (largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types. For those with neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after five years is much better at 65%, varying considerably with type.\nA solid pseudopapillary tumour is a low-grade malignant tumour of the pancreas of papillary architecture that typically afflicts young women.\nDiabetes mellitus.\nType 1 diabetes.\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. Insulin is needed to keep blood sugar levels within optimal ranges, and its lack can lead to high blood sugar. As an untreated chronic condition, complications including accelerated vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease and neuropathy can result. In addition, if there is not enough insulin for glucose to be used within cells, the medical emergency diabetic ketoacidosis, which is often the first symptom that a person with type 1 diabetes may have, can result. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but is most often diagnosed before age 40. For people living with type 1 diabetes, insulin injections are critical for survival. An experimental procedure to treat type 1 diabetes is pancreas transplantation or isolated transplantation of islet cells to supply a person with functioning beta cells.\nType 2 diabetes.\nDiabetes mellitus type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. The causes for high blood sugar in this form of diabetes usually are a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role in the development of the disease. Over time, pancreatic beta cells may become \"exhausted\" and less functional. The management of type 2 diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle measures, medications if required and potentially insulin. \nWith relevance to the pancreas, several medications act to enhance the secretion of insulin from beta cells, particularly sulphonylureas, which act directly on beta cells; incretins which replicate the action of the hormones glucagon-like peptide 1, increasing the secretion of insulin from beta cells after meals, and are more resistant to breakdown; and DPP-4 inhibitors, which slow the breakdown of incretins.\nRemoval.\nIt is possible for a person to live without a pancreas, provided that the person takes insulin for proper regulation of blood glucose concentration and pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion.\nHistory.\nThe pancreas was first identified by Herophilus (335\u2013280 BC), a Greek anatomist and surgeon. A few hundred years later, Rufus of Ephesus, another Greek anatomist, gave the pancreas its name. Etymologically, the term \"pancreas\", a modern Latin adaptation of Greek \u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2, [\u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd (\"all\", \"whole\"), and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 (\"flesh\")], originally means sweetbread, although literally meaning all-flesh, presumably because of its fleshy consistency. It was only in 1889 when Oskar Minkowski discovered that removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic. Insulin was later isolated from pancreatic islets by Frederick Banting and Charles Best in 1921.\nThe way the tissue of the pancreas has been viewed has also changed. Previously, it was viewed using simple staining methods such as H&amp;E stains. Now, immunohistochemistry can be used to more easily differentiate cell types. This involves visible antibodies to the products of certain cell types, and helps identify with greater ease cell types such as alpha and beta cells.\nOther animals.\nPancreatic tissue is present in all vertebrates, but its precise form and arrangement varies widely. There may be up to three separate pancreases, two of which arise from the pancreatic bud, and the other dorsally. In most species (including humans), these \"fuse\" in the adult, but there are several exceptions. Even when a single pancreas is present, two or three pancreatic ducts may persist, each draining separately into the duodenum (or equivalent part of the foregut). Birds, for example, typically have three such ducts.\nIn teleost fish, and a few other species (such as rabbits), there is no discrete pancreas at all, with pancreatic tissue being distributed diffusely across the mesentery and even within other nearby organs, such as the liver or spleen. In a few teleost species, the endocrine tissue has fused to form a distinct gland within the abdominal cavity, but otherwise it is distributed among the exocrine components. The most primitive arrangement, however, appears to be that of lampreys and lungfish, in which pancreatic tissue is found as a number of discrete nodules within the wall of the gut itself, with the exocrine portions being little different from other glandular structures of the intestine.\nCuisine.\nThe pancreas of calf (\"ris de veau\") or lamb (\"ris d'agneau\"), and, less commonly, of beef or pork, are used as food under the culinary name of sweetbread.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1965 until 2011. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state; industry and business were nationalized, and socialist reforms were implemented throughout society.\nBorn in Bir\u00e1n, the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist and anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro travelled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother, Ra\u00fal Castro, and Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's prime minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic embargo, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014a defining incident of the Cold War\u2014in 1962.\nAdopting a Marxist\u2013Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada, as well as sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur, Ogaden, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuban medical internationalism, increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the \"Special Period\", embracing environmentalist and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American \"pink tide\"\u2014namely with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's Venezuela\u2014and formed the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006, Castro transferred his responsibilities to Vice President Ra\u00fal Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008. Castro died at the age of 90 from natural causes in November 2016.\nThe longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized world opinion. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary government advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from American hegemony. His critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human rights abuses, the exodus of many Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy.\nEarly life and career.\nYouth: 1926\u20131947.\nFidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born out of wedlock at his father's farm on 13 August 1926. His father, \u00c1ngel Castro y Argiz, was a migrant to Cuba from Galicia, northwest Spain. After the collapse of his first marriage he took his household servant, Lina Ruz Gonz\u00e1lez\u2014of Canarian ancestry\u2014as his mistress and later second wife; together they had seven children, among them Fidel. At age six, Castro was sent to live with his teacher in Santiago de Cuba, before being baptized into the Catholic Church at the age of eight. His baptism allowed Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, and was later sent to the Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago.\nIn 1942, Castro transferred to the Jesuit-run El Colegio de Bel\u00e9n in Havana. In 1945, Castro began studying law at the University of Havana where he became embroiled in student activism and the violent \"gangsterismo\" culture within the university. After becoming passionate about anti-imperialism and opposing US intervention in the Caribbean, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidency of the Federation of University Students. Castro became critical of the corruption and violence of President Ram\u00f3n Grau's government, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that received coverage on the front page of several newspapers.\nIn 1947, Castro joined the Party of the Cuban People (\"Partido Ortodoxo\"), founded by Eduardo Chib\u00e1s. Though Chib\u00e1s came third in the 1948 general election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated when Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro received a death threat urging him to leave the university, but he refused and began to carry a gun and surround himself with armed friends. Anti-Castro dissidents accused him of committing gang-related assassinations at the time, but these accusations remain unproven.\nRebellion and Marxism: 1947\u20131950.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI joined the people; I grabbed a rifle in a police station that collapsed when it was rushed by a crowd. I witnessed the spectacle of a totally spontaneous revolution\u00a0... [T]hat experience led me to identify myself even more with the cause of the people. My still incipient Marxist ideas had nothing to do with our conduct\u2014it was a spontaneous reaction on our part, as young people with Mart\u00ed-an, anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and pro-democratic ideas.\n\u2013\u00a0Fidel Castro on the Bogotazo, 2009\nIn June 1947, Castro joined a planned expedition to overthrow the government of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. The military force intended to sail from Cuba in July 1947, but Grau's government stopped the invasion under US pressure, and Castro evaded arrest. Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards. The protests and subsequent crackdown on suspected communists led to violent clashes between activists and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. His subsequent public speeches took a leftist slant, condemning social and economic inequality in Cuba.\nIn April 1948, Castro travelled to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, leading a Cuban student group sponsored by President Juan Per\u00f3n's Argentine government. There, the assassination of leftist leader Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n Ayala led to rioting and clashes between the governing Conservatives\u2014backed by the army\u2014and leftist Liberals. Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing guns from a police station; subsequent police investigations concluded that he had not been involved in killings. In April 1948, the Organization of American States was founded at a summit in Bogot\u00e1, leading to protests, which Castro joined.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Marxism taught me what society was. I was like a blindfolded man in a forest, who doesn't even know where north or south is. If you don't eventually come to truly understand the history of the class struggle, or at least have a clear idea that society is divided between the rich and the poor, and that some people subjugate and exploit other people, you're lost in a forest, not knowing anything.\n\u2013 Fidel Castro on discovering Marxism, 2009\nReturning to Cuba, Castro became a prominent figure in protests against government attempts to raise bus fares. He married Mirta D\u00edaz Balart, through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The subsequent election was won by \"Partido Aut\u00e9ntico\"'s new candidate, Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s. Castro had moved further to the left and interpreted Cuba's problems as an integral part of capitalist society, or the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\", rather than the failings of corrupt politicians, and adopted the Marxist view that meaningful political change could only be brought about by proletariat revolution. Visiting Havana's poorest neighbourhoods, he became active in the student anti-racist campaign.\nIn September 1949, Mirta gave birth to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro continued to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the 30 September Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the \"Partido Ortodoxo\". The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Pr\u00edo had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. \nCastro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on 13 November, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the US. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro laid low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.\nCareer in law and politics: 1950\u20131952.\nCastro co-founded a legal partnership that primarily catered to poor Cubans, albeit it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro failed to pay his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He took part in a high school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police to protest the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; he was arrested and charged for violent conduct, but the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chib\u00e1s and the \"Partido Ortodoxo\", and he was present at Chib\u00e1s' politically motivated suicide in 1951. \nSeeing himself as Chib\u00e1s' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior \"Ortodoxo\" members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. He was instead nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts and began campaigning. The \"Ortodoxo\" had considerable support and was predicted to do well in the election.\nDuring his campaign, Castro met with General Fulgencio Batista, the former president who had returned to politics with the Unitary Action Party. Batista offered him a place in his administration if he was successful; although both opposed Pr\u00edo's administration, their meeting never got beyond polite generalities. On 10 March 1952, Batista seized power in a military coup, with Pr\u00edo fleeing to Mexico. Declaring himself president, Batista cancelled the planned presidential elections, describing his new system as \"disciplined democracy\"; Castro was deprived of being elected in his run for office by Batista's move, and like many others, considered it a one-man dictatorship. \nBatista moved to the right, solidifying ties with both the wealthy elite and the United States, severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, suppressing trade unions and persecuting Cuban socialist groups. Intent on opposing Batista, Castro brought several legal cases against the government, but these came to nothing, and Castro began thinking of alternative ways to oust the regime.\nCuban Revolution.\nThe Movement and the Moncada Barracks attack: 1952\u20131953.\nCastro formed a group called \"The Movement\" which operated along a clandestine cell system, publishing underground newspaper \"El Acusador\" (\"The Accuser\"), while arming and training anti-Batista recruits. From July 1952 they went on a recruitment drive, gaining around 1,200 members in a year, the majority from Havana's poorer districts. Although a revolutionary socialist, Castro avoided an alliance with the communist Popular Socialist Party (PSP), fearing it would frighten away political moderates, but kept in contact with PSP members like his brother Ra\u00fal. Castro stockpiled weapons for a planned attack on the Moncada Barracks, a military garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on 25 July, seizing control and raiding the armoury before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters and promote further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th-century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir to independence leader Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed.\nCastro gathered 165 revolutionaries for the mission, ordering his troops not to cause bloodshed unless they met armed resistance. The attack took place on 26 July 1953, but ran into trouble; 3 of the 16 cars that had set out from Santiago failed to get there. Reaching the barracks, the alarm was raised, with most of the rebels pinned down by machine gun fire. Four were killed before Castro ordered a retreat. The rebels suffered 6 fatalities and 15 other casualties, whilst the army suffered 19 dead and 27 wounded. Meanwhile, some rebels took over a civilian hospital; subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the rebels were rounded up, tortured and 22 were executed without trial. Accompanied by 19 comrades, Castro set out for Gran Piedra in the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains several kilometres to the north, where they could establish a guerrilla base. Responding to the attack, Batista's government proclaimed martial law, ordering a violent crackdown on dissent, and imposing strict media censorship. The government broadcast misinformation about the event, claiming that the rebels were communists who had killed hospital patients, although news and photographs of the army's use of torture and summary executions in Oriente soon spread, causing widespread public and some governmental disapproval.\nOver the following days, the rebels were rounded up; some were executed and others\u2014including Castro\u2014transported to a prison north of Santiago. Believing Castro incapable of planning the attack alone, the government accused \"Ortodoxo\" and PSP politicians of involvement, putting 122 defendants on trial on 21 September at the Palace of Justice, Santiago. Acting as his own defence counsel, Castro cited Mart\u00ed as the intellectual author of the attack and convinced the three judges to overrule the army's decision to keep all defendants handcuffed in court, proceeding to argue that the charge with which they were accused\u2014of \"organizing an uprising of armed persons against the Constitutional Powers of the State\"\u2014was incorrect, for they had risen up against Batista, who had seized power in an unconstitutional manner. The trial embarrassed the army by revealing that they had tortured suspects, after which they tried unsuccessfully to prevent Castro from testifying any further, claiming he was too ill. The trial ended on 5 October, with the acquittal of most defendants; 55 were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 months and 13 years. Castro was sentenced on 16 October, during which he delivered a speech that would be printed under the title of \"History Will Absolve Me\". Castro was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in the hospital wing of the Model Prison (\"Presidio Modelo\"), a relatively comfortable and modern institution on the Isla de Pinos.\nImprisonment and 26 July Movement: 1953\u20131955.\nImprisoned with 25 comrades, Castro renamed his group the \"26th of July Movement\" (MR-26-7) in memory of the Moncada attack's date, and formed a school for prisoners. He read widely, enjoying the works of Marx, Lenin, and Mart\u00ed but also reading books by Freud, Kant, Shakespeare, Munthe, Maugham, and Dostoyevsky, analysing them within a Marxist framework. Corresponding with supporters, he maintained control over the Movement and organized the publication of \"History Will Absolve Me\". Initially permitted a relative amount of freedom within the prison, he was locked up in solitary confinement after inmates sang anti-Batista songs on a visit by the president in February 1954. Meanwhile, Castro's wife Mirta gained employment in the Ministry of the Interior, something he discovered through a radio announcement. Appalled, he raged that he would rather die \"a thousand times\" than \"suffer impotently from such an insult\". Both Fidel and Mirta initiated divorce proceedings, with Mirta taking custody of their son Fidelito; this angered Castro, who did not want his son growing up in a bourgeois environment.\nIn 1954, Batista's government held presidential elections, but no politician stood against him; the election was widely considered fraudulent. It had allowed some political opposition to be voiced, and Castro's supporters had agitated for an amnesty for the Moncada incident's perpetrators. Some politicians suggested an amnesty would be good publicity, and the Congress and Batista agreed. Backed by the US and major corporations, Batista believed Castro to be no threat, and on 15 May 1955, the prisoners were released. Returning to Havana, Castro gave radio interviews and press conferences; the government closely monitored him, curtailing his activities. Now divorced, Castro had sexual affairs with two female supporters, Naty Revuelta and Maria Laborde, each conceiving him a child. Setting about strengthening the MR-26-7, he established an 11-person National Directorate but retained autocratic control, with some dissenters labelling him a \"caudillo\" (dictator); he argued that a successful revolution could not be run by committee and required a strong leader.\nIn 1955, bombings and violent demonstrations led to a crackdown on dissent, with Castro and Ra\u00fal fleeing the country to evade arrest. Castro sent a letter to the press, declaring that he was \"leaving Cuba because all doors of peaceful struggle have been closed to me\u00a0... As a follower of Mart\u00ed, I believe the hour has come to take our rights and not beg for them, to fight instead of pleading for them.\" The Castros and several comrades travelled to Mexico, where Ra\u00fal befriended an Argentine doctor and Marxist\u2013Leninist named Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, who was working as a journalist and photographer for \"Agencia Latina de Noticias\". Fidel liked him, later describing him as \"a more advanced revolutionary than I was\". Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, who agreed to teach Castro's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare. Requiring funding, Castro toured the US in search of wealthy sympathizers, there being monitored by Batista's agents, who allegedly orchestrated a failed assassination attempt against him. Castro kept in contact with the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente. Other militant anti-Batista groups had sprung up, primarily from the student movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE), founded by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda. Antonio met with Castro in Mexico City, but Castro opposed the student's support for indiscriminate assassination.\nAfter purchasing the decrepit yacht \"Granma\", on 25 November 1956, Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 armed revolutionaries. The crossing to Cuba was harsh, with food running low and many suffering seasickness. At some points, they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another, a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the crossing to take five days, and on the \"Granma\"'s scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pa\u00eds led an armed uprising in Santiago and Manzanillo. However, the \"Granma\"'s journey ultimately lasted seven days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, Pa\u00eds and his militants dispersed after two days of intermittent attacks.\nGuerrilla war: 1956\u20131959.\nThe \"Granma\" ran aground in a mangrove swamp at Playa Las Coloradas, close to Los Cayuelos, on 2 December 1956. Fleeing inland, its crew headed for the forested mountain range of Oriente's Sierra Maestra, being repeatedly attacked by Batista's troops. Upon arrival, Castro discovered that only 19 rebels had made it to their destination, the rest having been killed or captured. Setting up an encampment, the survivors included the Castros, Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos. They began launching raids on small army posts to obtain weaponry, and in January 1957 they overran the outpost at La Plata, treating any soldiers that they wounded but executing Chicho Osorio, the local \"mayoral\" (land company overseer), who was despised by the local peasants and who boasted of killing one of Castro's rebels. Osorio's execution aided the rebels in gaining the trust of locals, although they largely remained unenthusiastic and suspicious of the revolutionaries. As trust grew, some locals joined the rebels, although most new recruits came from urban areas. With volunteers boosting the rebel forces to over 200, in July 1957 Castro divided his army into three columns, commanded by himself, his brother, and Guevara. The MR-26-7 members operating in urban areas continued agitation, sending supplies to Castro, and on 16 February 1957, he met with other senior members to discuss tactics; here he met Celia S\u00e1nchez, who would become a close friend.\nAcross Cuba, anti-Batista groups carried out bombings and sabotage; police responded with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions. In March 1957, the DRE launched a failed attack on the presidential palace, during which Antonio was shot dead. Batista's government often resorted to brutal methods to keep Cuba's cities under control. In the Sierra Maestra mountains, Castro was joined by Frank Sturgis who offered to train Castro's troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner. Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) weapons expert Samuel Cummings' International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26 July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare. Frank Pa\u00eds was also killed, leaving Castro the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader. Although Guevara and Ra\u00fal were well known for their Marxist\u2013Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain the support of less radical revolutionaries. In 1957 he met with leading members of the \"Partido Ortodoxo\", Ra\u00fal Chib\u00e1s and Felipe Pazos, authoring the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, and a literacy campaign before holding multiparty elections. As Cuba's press was censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist from \"The New York Times\". Reporters from CBS and \"Paris Match\" soon followed.\nCastro's guerrillas increased their attacks on military outposts, forcing the government to withdraw from the Sierra Maestra region, and by spring 1958, the rebels controlled a hospital, schools, a printing press, slaughterhouse, land-mine factory and a cigar-making factory. By 1958, Batista was under increasing pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with increasing domestic and foreign criticism surrounding his administration's press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the US government ceased supplying him with weaponry. The opposition called a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support in central and eastern Cuba, but little elsewhere.\nBatista responded with an all-out-attack, Operation Verano, in which the army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages suspected of aiding the militants, while 10,000 soldiers commanded by General Eulogio Cantillo surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments. Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no experience with guerrilla warfare, and Castro halted their offensive using land mines and ambushes. Many of Batista's soldiers defected to Castro's rebels, who also benefited from local popular support. In the summer, the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army out of the mountains, with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled most of Oriente and Las Villas, and divided Cuba in two by closing major roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista.\nThe US instructed Cantillo to oust Batista due to fears in Washington that Castro was a socialist, which were exacerbated by the association between nationalist and communist movements in Latin America and the links between the Cold War and decolonization. By this time the great majority of Cuban people had turned against the Batista regime. Ambassador to Cuba, E. T. Smith, who felt the whole CIA mission had become too close to the MR-26-7 movement, personally went to Batista and informed him that the US would no longer support him and felt he no longer could control the situation in Cuba. General Cantillo secretly agreed to a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would be tried as a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$ on 31 December 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to be president, and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread looting and vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on 2 January, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking the wars of independence. Heading toward Havana, he greeted cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews. Castro reached Havana on 9 January 1959.\nProvisional government.\nConsolidating leadership: 1959.\nAt Castro's command, the politically moderate lawyer Manuel Urrutia Lle\u00f3 was proclaimed provisional president, but Castro announced falsely that Urrutia had been selected by \"popular election\". Most of Urrutia's cabinet were MR-26-7 members. Entering Havana, Castro proclaimed himself Representative of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency, setting up home and office in the penthouse of the Havana Hilton Hotel. Castro exercised a great deal of influence over Urrutia's regime, now ruling by decree. He ensured the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy, and that it attempted to remove Batistanos from positions of power by dismissing Congress and barring all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 from future office. He then pushed Urrutia to issue a temporary ban on political parties; he repeatedly said that they would eventually hold multiparty elections. Although repeatedly denying that he was a communist to the press, he began clandestinely meeting members of the PSP to discuss the creation of a socialist state.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe are not executing innocent people or political opponents. We are executing murderers and they deserve it.\n\u2013 Castro's response to his critics regarding the mass executions, 1959\nIn suppressing the revolution, Batista's government had killed thousands of Cubans; Castro and influential sectors of the press put the death toll at 20,000, but a list of victims published shortly after the revolution contained only 898 names\u2014over half of them combatants. More recent estimates place the death toll between 1,000 and 4,000. In response to popular uproar, which demanded that those responsible be brought to justice, Castro helped to set up many trials, resulting in hundreds of executions. Although popular domestically, critics\u2014in particular the US press, argued that many were not fair trials. Castro responded that \"revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts, but on moral conviction.\"\nAcclaimed by many across Latin America, he travelled to Venezuela where he met with President-elect R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, unsuccessfully requesting a loan and a new deal for Venezuelan oil. Returning home, an argument between Castro and senior government figures broke out. He was infuriated that the government had left thousands unemployed by closing down casinos and brothels. As a result, Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mir\u00f3 Cardona resigned, going into exile in the US and joining the anti-Castro movement.\nOn 16 February 1959, Castro was sworn in as Prime Minister of Cuba. Castro also appointed himself president of the National Tourist Industry, introducing unsuccessful measures to encourage African-American tourists to visit, advertising Cuba as a tropical paradise free of racial discrimination. Judges and politicians had their pay reduced while low-level civil servants saw theirs raised, and in March 1959, Castro declared rents for those who paid less than $100 a month halved. The Cuban government also began to expropriate the casinos and properties from mafia leaders and taking millions in cash. Before his death, Russian-American gangster Meyer Lansky said Cuba \"ruined\" him.\nOn 9 April, Castro announced that the elections, which the 26th of July Movement had promised would occur after the revolution, would be postponed, so that the provisional government could focus on domestic reform. Castro announced this electoral delay with the slogan: \"revolution first, elections later\".\nLater in April, he visited the US on a charm offensive where President Dwight D. Eisenhower would not meet with him, but instead sent Vice President Richard Nixon, whom Castro instantly disliked. After meeting Castro, Nixon described him to Eisenhower: \"The one fact we can be sure of is that Castro has those indefinable qualities which made him a leader of men. Whatever we may think of him he is going to be a great factor in the development of Cuba and very possibly in Latin American affairs generally. He seems to be sincere. He is either incredibly naive about Communism or under Communist discipline-my guess is the former...His ideas as to how to run a government or an economy are less developed than those of almost any world figure I have met in fifty countries. But because he has the power to lead...we have no choice but at least try to orient him in the right direction\".\nProceeding to Canada, Trinidad, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, Castro attended an economic conference in Buenos Aires, unsuccessfully proposing a $30\u00a0billion US-funded \"Marshall Plan\" for Latin America. In May 1959, Castro signed into law the First Agrarian Reform, setting a cap for landholdings to per owner and prohibiting foreigners from obtaining Cuban land ownership. Around 200,000 peasants received title deeds as large land holdings were broken up; popular among the working class, it alienated the richer landowners, including Castro's own mother, whose farmlands were taken. Within a year, Castro and his government had effectively redistributed 15 per cent of the nation's wealth, declaring that \"the revolution is the dictatorship of the exploited against the exploiters.\"\nIn the summer of 1959, Fidel began nationalizing plantation lands owned by American investors as well as confiscating the property of foreign landowners. He also seized property previously held by wealthy Cubans who had fled. He nationalized sugar production and oil refinement, over the objection of foreign investors who owned stakes in these commodities.\nAlthough then refusing to categorize his regime as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist, Castro appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions. President Urrutia increasingly expressed concern with the rising influence of Marxism. Angered, Castro in turn announced his resignation as prime minister on 18 July\u2014blaming Urrutia for complicating government with his \"fevered anti-Communism\". Over 500,000 Castro-supporters surrounded the Presidential Palace demanding Urrutia's resignation, which he submitted. On 23 July, Castro resumed his premiership and appointed Marxist Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s as president.\nOn October 19, 1959, army commander Huber Matos wrote a resignation letter to Fidel Castro, complaining of Communist influence in government. Matos lamented in his resignation that communists were gaining positions of power that he felt were undeserved for having not participated in the Cuban Revolution. Matos planned for his officers to also resign en masse in support. Two days later, Castro sent fellow revolutionary Camilo Cienfuegos to arrest Matos. The same day Matos was arrested, Cuban exile Pedro Luis D\u00edaz Lanz, a former air force chief of staff under Castro and friend of Huber Matos, flew from Florida and dropped leaflets into Havana that called for the removal of all Communists from the government. In response, Castro held a rally where he called for the reintroduction of revolutionary tribunals to try Matos and Diaz for treason. Shortly after Hubert Matos' detention various other disillusioned economists would send in their resignations. Felipe Pazos would resign as head of the National Bank and be replaced within a month by Che Guevara. Cabinet members Manuel Ray and Faustino Perez also resigned.\nCastro's government continued to emphasise social projects to improve Cuba's standard of living, often to the detriment of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within the first six months of Castro's government, of roads were built across the island, while $300\u00a0million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.\nDiplomatic and political shifts: 1960.\nCastro used radio and television to develop a \"dialogue with the people\", posing questions and making provocative statements. His regime remained popular with workers, peasants, and students, who constituted the majority of the country's population, while opposition came primarily from the middle class; thousands of doctors, engineers and other professionals emigrated to Florida in the US, causing an economic brain drain. Productivity decreased and the country's financial reserves were drained within two years. After conservative press expressed hostility towards the government, the pro-Castro printers' trade union disrupted editorial staff, and in January 1960 the government ordered them to publish a \"\"coletilla\" (clarification) written by the printers' union at the end of articles critical of the government. Castro's government arrested hundreds of counter-revolutionaries, many of whom were subjected to solitary confinement, rough treatment, and threatening behaviour. Militant anti-Castro groups, funded by exiles, the CIA, and the Dominican government, undertook armed attacks and set up guerrilla bases in Cuba's mountains, leading to the six-year Escambray Rebellion.\nAt the time, 1960, the Cold War raged between two superpowers: the United States, a capitalist liberal democracy, and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist state ruled by the Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the US, Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist\u2013Leninist states. Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibres, and hides in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100\u00a0million loan. Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries\u2014then controlled by the US corporations Shell and Esso\u2014to process Soviet oil, but under US pressure they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the US cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most US-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.\nRelations between Cuba and the US were further strained following the explosion of a French vessel, the \"La Coubre\", in Havana harbour in March 1960. The ship carried weapons purchased from Belgium, and the cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the US government was guilty of sabotage. He ended this speech with \"\u00a1Patria o Muerte!\"\" (\"Fatherland or Death\"), a proclamation that he made much use of in ensuing years. Inspired by their earlier success with the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat, in March 1960, US President Eisenhower authorized the CIA to overthrow Castro's government. He provided them with a budget of $13\u00a0million and permitted them to ally with the Mafia, who were aggrieved that Castro's government closed down their brothel and casino businesses in Cuba.\nDuring a May Day speech in 1960, Fidel Castro announced that all future elections would be cancelled. Castro proclaimed that his administration was a direct democracy, in which Cubans could assemble at demonstrations to express their will, thus there was no need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites. US Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, and the absence of freedom of speech and press.\nIn September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the General Assembly of the United Nations. Staying at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, he met with journalists and anti-establishment figures like Malcolm X. Castro had decided to stay in Harlem as a way of expressing solidarity with the poor African-American population living there, thus leading to an assortment of world leaders such as Nasser of Egypt and Nehru of India having to drive out to Harlem to see him. He also met Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, with the two publicly condemning the poverty and racism faced by Americans in areas like Harlem. Relations between Castro and Khrushchev were warm; they led the applause to one another's speeches at the General Assembly. The opening session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 1960 was a highly rancorous one with Khrushchev famously banging his shoe against his desk to interrupt a speech by Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong, which set the general tone for the debates and speeches. Castro delivered the longest speech ever held before the United Nations General Assembly, speaking for four and a half hours in a speech mostly given over to denouncing American policies towards Latin America. Subsequently, visited by Polish first secretary W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, Bulgarian first secretary Todor Zhivkov, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Indian premier Jawaharlal Nehru, Castro also received an evening's reception from the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.\nBack in Cuba, Castro feared a US-backed coup; in 1959 his regime spent $120\u00a0million on Soviet, French, and Belgian weaponry and by early 1960 had doubled the size of Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favourable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighbourhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints. By 1970, a third of the population would be involved in the CDR, and this would eventually rise to 80%.\nOn 13 October 1960, the US prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba, initiating an economic embargo. In retaliation, the National Institute for Agrarian Reform INRA took control of 383 private-run businesses on 14 October, and on 25 October a further 166 US companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized. On 16 December, the US ended its import quota of Cuban sugar, the country's primary export.\nBay of Pigs Invasion and \"Socialist Cuba\": 1961\u20131962.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere was ... no doubt about who the victors were. Cuba's stature in the world soared to new heights, and Fidel's role as the adored and revered leader among ordinary Cuban people received a renewed boost. His popularity was greater than ever. In his own mind he had done what generations of Cubans had only fantasized about: he had taken on the United States and won.\n \u2013 Peter Bourne, Castro biographer, 1986\nIn January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's US Embassy to reduce its 300-member staff, suspecting that many of them were spies. The US responded by ending diplomatic relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Despite internal tensions, and diplomatic tensions, Castro garnered support in New York City. On 18 February 1961, 400 people\u2014mainly Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and college students\u2014picketed in the rain outside of the United Nations rallying for Castro's anti-colonial values and his effort to reduce the United States' power over Cuba. The protesters held up signs that read, \"Mr. Kennedy, Cuba is Not For Sale.\", \"Viva Fidel Castro!\" and \"Down With Yankee Imperialism!\". Around 200 policemen were on the scene, but the protesters continued to chant slogans and throw pennies in support of Fidel Castro's socialist movement. Some Americans disagreed with President John F. Kennedy's decision to ban trade with Cuba, and outwardly supported his nationalist revolutionary tactics.\nBoth President Eisenhower and his successor President Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia: the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On 15 April, CIA-supplied B-26s bombed three Cuban military airfields; the US announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation. Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries, publicly proclaiming, \"What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is that we have made a Socialist revolution under their noses\", his first announcement that the government was socialist.\nThe CIA and the Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. On the night of 16 to 17 April, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez to launch the counter-offensive, before taking personal control of it. After bombing the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade to surrender on 20 April. He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated by a panel of journalists on live television, personally taking over the questioning on 25 April. Fourteen were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the US in exchange for medicine and food valued at US$. Castro's victory reverberated around the world, especially in Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained in the run-up to the invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many fled to the US, establishing themselves in Florida.\nAfter the banning of the film \"P.M.\", film critics hotly debated censorship in Cuba, which then caused the intervention of Castro, who met with the contesting writers and delivered his famed \"Words to the Intellectuals\" speech; which he delivered in June 1961. In the speech, Castro commented on Cuba's censorship policy, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This means that within the Revolution, everything goes; against the Revolution, nothing. Nothing against the Revolution, because the Revolution has its rights also, and the first right of the Revolution is the right to exist, and no one can stand against the right of the Revolution to be and to exist, No one can rightfully claim a right against the Revolution. Since it takes in the interests of the people and Signifies the interests of the entire nation.\nIn an effort to consolidate \"Socialist Cuba\", Castro united the MR-26-7, PSP and Revolutionary Directorate into a governing party based on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism, what resulted was the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (\"Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas\" \u2013 ORI), eventually renamed the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) in 1962. The ORI began shaping Cuba using the Soviet model, persecuting political opponents and perceived social deviants such as prostitutes and homosexuals; Castro considered same-sex sexual activity a bourgeois trait. \nAlthough the USSR was hesitant regarding Castro's embrace of socialism, relations with the Soviets deepened. Castro sent Fidelito for a Moscow schooling, Soviet technicians arrived on the island, and Castro was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.\nIn order to plan the Cuban economy, the commission JUCEPLAN was tasked with creating a four year plan. Regino Boti, the head of JUCEPLAN, announced in August 1961, that the country would soon have a 10% rate of economic growth, and the highest living standard in Latin America in 10 years. The plan drafted by JUCEPLAN in 1961, was a four year plan devised to be implemented in 1962 through 1965. It stressed agricultural diversification and rapid industrialization via Soviet assistance. In September 1961, Castro publicly complained that the industrialization plan had stalled because of lazy uncooperative workers.\nIn December 1961, Castro admitted that he had been a Marxist\u2013Leninist for years, and in his Second Declaration of Havana he called on Latin America to rise up in revolution. In response, the US successfully pushed the Organization of American States to expel Cuba; the Soviets privately reprimanded Castro for recklessness, although he received praise from China. Despite their ideological affinity with China, in the Sino-Soviet split, Cuba allied with the wealthier Soviets, who offered economic and military aid.\nBy 1962, Cuba's economy was in steep decline, a result of poor economic management and low productivity coupled with the US trade embargo. Food shortages led to rationing, resulting in protests in C\u00e1rdenas. Security reports indicated that many Cubans associated austerity with the \"Old Communists\" of the PSP, while Castro considered a number of them\u2014namely An\u00edbal Escalante and Blas Roca\u2014unduly loyal to Moscow. In March 1962 Castro removed the most prominent \"Old Communists\" from office, labelling them \"sectarian\". On a personal level, Castro was increasingly lonely, and his relations with Guevara became strained as the latter became increasingly anti-Soviet and pro-Chinese.\nCuban Missile Crisis and furthering socialism: 1962\u20131968.\nMilitarily weaker than NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear missiles on Cuba to even the power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dortic\u00f3s and security chief Ramiro Vald\u00e9s knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the US implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The US saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defence only. Castro urged that Khrushchev should launch a nuclear strike on the US if Cuba were invaded, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was left out of the negotiations, in which Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a US commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the US would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khrushchev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the US end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. He presented these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, but the US ignored them. In turn Castro refused to allow the UN's inspection team into Cuba.\nIn May 1963, Castro visited the USSR at Khrushchev's personal invitation, touring 14 cities, addressing a Red Square rally, and being awarded both the Order of Lenin and an honorary doctorate from Moscow State University. Castro returned to Cuba with new ideas; inspired by Soviet newspaper \"Pravda\", he amalgamated \"Hoy\" and \"Revoluci\u00f3n\" into a new daily, \"Granma\", and oversaw large investment into Cuban sport that resulted in an increased international sporting reputation. Seeking to further consolidate control, in 1963 the government cracked down on Protestant sects in Cuba, with Castro labelling them counter-revolutionary \"instruments of imperialism\"; many preachers were found guilty of illegal US links and imprisoned. Measures were implemented to force perceived idle and delinquent youths to work, primarily through the introduction of mandatory military service. In September, the government temporarily permitted emigration for anyone other than males aged between 15 and 26, thereby ridding the government of thousands of critics, most of whom were from upper and middle-class backgrounds. In 1963, Castro's mother died. This was the last time his private life was reported in Cuba's press. In January 1964, Castro returned to Moscow, officially to sign a new five-year sugar trade agreement, but also to discuss the ramifications of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Castro was deeply concerned by the assassination, believing that a far-right conspiracy was behind it but that the Cubans would be blamed. In October 1965, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations was officially renamed the \"Cuban Communist Party\" and published the membership of its Central Committee.\nBeginning in 1965, gay men were forced into the Military Units to Aid Production (\"Unidades Militares de Ayuda a la Producci\u00f3n\" \u2013 UMAP). However, after many revolutionary intellectuals decried this move, the UMAP camps were closed in 1967, although gay men continued to be imprisoned.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe greatest threat presented by Castro's Cuba is as an example to other Latin American states which are beset by poverty, corruption, feudalism, and plutocratic exploitation ... his influence in Latin America might be overwhelming and irresistible if, with Soviet help, he could establish in Cuba a Communist utopia.\n \u2013 Walter Lippmann, \"Newsweek\", 27 April 1964\nDespite Soviet misgivings, Castro continued to call for global revolution, funding militant leftists and those engaged in national liberation struggles. Cuba's foreign policy was strongly anti-imperialist, believing that every nation should control its own natural resources. He supported Che Guevara's \"Andean project\", an unsuccessful plan to set up a guerrilla movement in the highlands of Bolivia, Peru and Argentina. He allowed revolutionary groups from around the world, from the Viet Cong to the Black Panthers, to train in Cuba.\nHe considered Western-dominated Africa to be ripe for revolution and sent troops and medics to aid Ahmed Ben Bella's socialist regime in Algeria during the Sand War. He also allied with Alphonse Massamba-D\u00e9bat's socialist government in Congo-Brazzaville. In 1965, Castro authorized Che Guevara to travel to Congo-Kinshasa to train revolutionaries against the Western-backed government. Castro was personally devastated when Guevara was killed by CIA-backed troops in Bolivia in October 1967 and publicly attributed it to Guevara's disregard for his own safety.\nIn 1966, Castro staged a Tri-Continental Conference of Africa, Asia and Latin America in Havana, further establishing himself as a significant player on the world stage. From this conference, Castro created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS), which adopted the slogan of \"The duty of a revolution is to make revolution\", signifying Havana's leadership of Latin America's revolutionary movement.\nCastro's increasing role on the world stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-US attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist An\u00edbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. Recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.\nInfluenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counterrevolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged, consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.\nGrey years and Third World politics: 1969\u20131974.\nCastro publicly celebrated his administration's 10th anniversary in January 1969; in his celebratory speech he warned of sugar rations, reflecting the nation's economic problems. The 1969 crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane, and to meet its export quota, the government drafted in the army, implemented a seven-day working week, and postponed public holidays to lengthen the harvest. When that year's production quota was not met, Castro offered to resign during a public speech, but assembled crowds insisted he remain. Despite the economic issues, many of Castro's social reforms were popular, with the population largely supportive of the \"Achievements of the Revolution\" in education, medical care, housing, and road construction, as well as the policies of \"direct democratic\" public consultation. Seeking Soviet help, from 1970 to 1972 Soviet economists re-organized Cuba's economy, founding the Cuban-Soviet Commission of Economic, Scientific and Technical Collaboration, while Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin visited in October 1971. In July 1972, Cuba joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), an economic organization of socialist states, although this further limited Cuba's economy to agricultural production.\nIn May 1970, the crews of two Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based dissident group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under US pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering the arrest of dissident poet Heberto Padilla who had been arrested 20 March; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.\nIn November 1971, Castro visited Chile, where Marxist President Salvador Allende had been elected as the head of a left-wing coalition. Castro supported Allende's socialist reforms but warned him of right-wing elements in Chile's military. In 1973, the military led a coup d'\u00e9tat and established a military junta led by Augusto Pinochet. Castro proceeded to Guinea to meet socialist President S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, praising him as Africa's greatest leader, and there received the Order of Fidelity to the People. He then went on a seven-week tour visiting leftist allies: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, where he was given further awards. On each trip, he was eager to visit factory and farm workers, publicly praising their governments; privately, he urged the regimes to aid revolutionary movements elsewhere, particularly those fighting the Vietnam War.\nIn September 1973, he returned to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's close relationship with the US and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became a friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to aid Syria. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.\nCuba's economy grew in 1974 as a result of high international sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the US finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution drafted that abolished the position of president and prime minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.\nCastro considered Africa to be \"the weakest link in the imperialist chain\", and at the request of Agostinho Neto he ordered 230 military advisers into Angola in November 1975 to aid Neto's Marxist MPLA in the Angolan Civil War. When the US and South Africa stepped up their support of the opposition FLNA and UNITA, Castro ordered a further 18,000 troops to Angola, which played a major role in forcing a South African and UNITA retreat. The decision to intervene in Angola has been a controversial one, all the more so as Castro's critics have charged that it was not his decision at all, contending that the Soviets ordered him to do so. Castro always maintained that he took the decision to launch Operation Carlota himself in response to an appeal from Neto and that the Soviets were in fact opposed to Cuban intervention in Angola, which took place over their opposition.\nTraveling to Angola, Castro celebrated with Neto, S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 and Guinea-Bissaun president Lu\u00eds Cabral, where they agreed to support Mozambique's Marxist\u2013Leninist government against RENAMO in the Mozambican Civil War. In February, Castro visited Algeria and then Libya, where he spent ten days with Gaddafi and oversaw the establishment of the Jamahariya system of governance, before attending talks with the Marxist government of South Yemen. From there he proceeded to Somalia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola where he was greeted by crowds as a hero for Cuba's role in opposing apartheid South Africa. Throughout much of Africa he was hailed as a friend to national liberation from foreign dominance. This was followed with visits to East Berlin and Moscow.\nConstitutional government.\nInstitutionalization and interventions: 1976-1979.\nUp until 1976, Cuba had been managed by a provisional government, headed by Fidel Castro, without a constitution. Cuba then adopted a new constitution in 1976, based on the 1936 Soviet Constitution. This adoption marked the end of 16 years of non-constitutional government. Up until this point, Castro had simply ruled by decree, but after the 1976 constitution, the Communist Party became the official decision-making body in Cuba. Some scholars like Peter Roman, Nino Pagliccia, and Loreen Collin have written books concluding that the system that developed after the 1976 constitution, particularly the National Assembly of People's Power, are part of a highly participatory democracy. Julio Cesar Guache offers a critical view of the \"democracy\" that developed, and argues it is informally controlled by the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, who vet candidates. Samuel Farber argues that the National Assembly of People's Power is legally prohibited form political debate, and that real decision-making power lied for a long time with the Castro brothers as heads of the Communist Party of Cuba. Farber mentions that the Communist Party often passes legislation without any consideration from the National Assembly of People's Power. Fidel Castro would remain in the leadership position of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba for 49 years, until stepping down in 2011.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is often talk of human rights, but it is also necessary to talk of the rights of humanity. Why should some people walk barefoot, so that others can travel in luxurious cars? Why should some live for thirty-five years, so that others can live for seventy years? Why should some be miserably poor, so that others can be hugely rich? I speak on behalf of the children in the world who do not have a piece of bread. I speak on the behalf of the sick who have no medicine, of those whose rights to life and human dignity have been denied.\n\u2013 Fidel Castro's message to the UN General Assembly, 1979\nIn 1977, the Ogaden War broke out over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; although a former ally of Somali president Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. In a desperate attempt to stop the war, Castro had a summit with Barre where he proposed a federation of Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Yemen as an alternative to war. Barre who saw seizing the Ogaden as the first step towards creating a greater Somalia that would unite all of the Somalis into one state rejected the federation offer and decided upon war. Castro sent troops under the command of General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. Mengistu's regime was barely hanging on by 1977, having lost one-third of its army in Eritrea at the time of the Somali invasion. The intervention of 17,000 Cuban troops into the Ogaden was by all accounts decisive in altering a war that Ethiopia was on the brink of losing into a victory. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. \nOn 22 December 1977, the Cuban exile group known as the \"Antonio Maceo Brigade\" took their first trip to Cuba, with the aim of cultural and political reconciliation. This visit came at the request of the Cuban government, after President Jimmy Carter briefly lifted the travel ban with Cuba. The brigade consisted of 55 Cuban exiles, who toured Cuba for two weeks. After the visit, Fidel Castro would call for dialogues with Cuban exiles abroad. These dialogues resulted in the release of political prisoners, family unifications, and relaxing of restrictions to visit Cuba.\nCastro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavours; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When American critics claimed that Castro had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered that Cuba had been invited into them, pointing out the US's own involvement in various foreign nations. Between 1979 and 1991 about 370,000 Cuban troops together with 50,000 Cuban civilians (mostly teachers and doctors) served in Angola, representing about 5% of Cuba's population. The Cuban intervention in Angola was envisioned as a short-term commitment, but the Angolan government used the profits from the oil industry to subsidize Cuba's economy, making Cuba as economically dependent upon Angola as Angola was militarily dependent upon Cuba.\nIn the late 1970s, Cuba's relations with North American states improved during the period with Mexican president Luis Echeverr\u00eda, Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, and US president Jimmy Carter in power. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the US and attacking Vietnam. In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was held in Havana, where Castro was selected as NAM president, a position he held until 1982. In his capacity as both president of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's refusal to condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.\nReagan and Gorbachev: 1980\u20131991.\nBy the 1980s, Cuba's economy was again in trouble, following a decline in the market price of sugar and 1979's decimated harvest. For the first time, unemployment became a serious problem in Castro's Cuba, with the government sending unemployed youth to other countries, primarily East Germany, to work there. Desperate for money, Cuba's government secretly sold off paintings from national collections and illicitly traded for US electronic goods through Panama. Increasing numbers of Cubans fled to Florida but were labelled \"scum\" and \"lumpen\" by Castro and his CDR supporters. In one incident, 10,000 Cubans stormed the Peruvian Embassy requesting asylum, and so the US agreed that it would accept 3,500 refugees. Castro conceded that those who wanted to leave could do so from Mariel port. In what was known as the Mariel boatlift, hundreds of boats arrived from the US, leading to a mass exodus of 120,000; Castro's government took advantage of the situation by loading criminals, the mentally ill, and homosexuals onto the boats destined for Florida. The event destabilized Carter's administration, and later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected US president.\nReagan's administration adopted a hard-line approach against Castro, making its desire to overthrow his regime clear. In late 1981, Castro publicly accused the US of biological warfare against Cuba by orchestrating a dengue fever epidemic. Cuba's economy became even more dependent on Soviet aid, with Soviet subsidies (mainly in the form of supplies of low-cost oil and voluntarily buying Cuban sugar at inflated prices) averaging $4\u20135\u00a0billion a year by the late 1980s. This accounted for 30\u201338% of the country's entire GDP. Soviet economic assistance had not helped Cuba's long-term growth prospects by promoting diversification or sustainability. Although described as a \"relatively highly developed Latin American export economy\" in 1959 and the early 1960s, Cuba's basic economic structure changed very little between then and the 1980s. Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports and were produced using an expensive and labor-intensive pre-industrial process. The Cuban economy remained highly inefficient and over-specialized in a few highly subsidized commodities exported primarily to the Soviet bloc countries.\nAlthough despising Argentina's right-wing military junta, Castro supported them in the 1982 Falklands War against Britain and offered military aid to the Argentinians. Castro supported the leftist New Jewel Movement that seized power in Grenada in 1979, befriending Grenadine president Maurice Bishop and sending doctors, teachers, and technicians to aid the country's development. When Bishop was executed in a Soviet-backed coup by hard-line Marxist Bernard Coard in October 1983, Castro condemned the killing but cautiously retained support for Grenada's government. However, the US used the coup as a basis for invading the island. Cuban soldiers died in the conflict, with Castro denouncing the invasion and comparing the US to Nazi Germany. In a July 1983 speech marking the 30th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, Castro condemned Reagan's administration as a \"reactionary, extremist clique\" who were waging an \"openly warmongering and fascist foreign policy\". Castro feared a US invasion of Nicaragua and sent Ochoa to train the governing Sandinistas in guerrilla warfare but received little support from the USSR.\nIn 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party; a reformer, he implemented measures to increase freedom of the press (\"glasnost\") and economic decentralization (\"perestroika\") in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to US demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example for the rest of the populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.\nBy November 1987, Castro began spending more time on the Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxist MPLA government had fallen into retreat. Angolan president Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. In response to the siege of Cuito Cuanavale in 1987\u20131988 by South African\u2013UNITA forces, Castro sent an additional 12,000 Cuban Army troops to Angola in late 1987. From afar in Havana, Castro was closely involved in the decision-making about the defence of Cuito Cuanavle and came into conflict with Ochoa, whom he criticized for almost losing Cuito Cuanavle to a South African-UNITA assault on 13 January 1988 despite warning for almost two months prior that such an attack was coming. On 30 January 1988, Ochoa was summoned to a meeting with Castro in Havana where he was told that Cuito Cuanavale must not fall and to execute Castro's plans for a pull-back to more defensible positions over the objections of the Angolans. The Cuban troops played a decisive role in the relief of Cuito Cuanavale, breaking the siege in March 1988, which led to the withdrawal of most of the South African troops from Angola. Cuban propaganda turned the siege of Cuito Cuanavle into a decisive victory that changed the course of African history and Castro awarded 82 soldiers medals of the newly created Medal of Merit for the Defense of Cuito Cuanavle on 1 April 1988. Tensions were increased with the Cubans advancing close to the border of Namibia, which led to warnings from the South African government that they considered this an extremely unfriendly act, causing South Africa to mobilize and call up its reserves. In the spring of 1988, the intensity of South African-Cuban fighting drastically increased with both sides taking heavy losses.\nThe prospect of an all-out Cuban-South African war served to concentrate minds in both Moscow and Washington and led to an increased push for a diplomatic solution to the Angolan war. The cost of Cuba's wars in Africa were paid for with Soviet subsidies at a time when the Soviet economy was badly hurt by low oil prices while the apartheid government of South Africa had by the 1980s become a very awkward American ally as much of the American population, especially black Americans, objected to apartheid. From the viewpoint of both Moscow and Washington, having both Cuba and South Africa disengage in Angola was the best possible outcome. The low oil prices of the 1980s had also changed the Angolan attitude about subsidizing the Cuban economy as dos Santos found the promises made in the 1970s when oil prices were high to be a serious drain upon Angola's economy in the 1980s. South African whites were vastly outnumbered by South African blacks, and accordingly the South African Army could not take heavy losses with its white troops as that would fatally weaken the ability of the South African state to uphold apartheid. The Cubans had also taken heavy losses while the increasing difficult relations with dos Santos who become less generous in subsidizing the Cuban economy suggested that such losses were not worth the cost. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talk between the USSR, US, Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola while South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favour of d\u00e9tente.\nWhen Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that \"perestroika\" meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to capitalist reformers between 1989 and 1991 and many Western observers expected the same in Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama\u2014despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega\u2014but it was overthrown in a US invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the US-funded National Opposition Union in an election. With the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the US secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that this was a manifestation of US hegemony and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.\nSpecial Period: 1992\u20132000.\nWith favourable trade from the Soviet bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a \"Special Period in Time of Peace\". Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non-essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors; firewood began being used for cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open war, and that the country might have to resort to subsistence farming. By 1992, Cuba's economy had declined by over 40% in under two years, with major food shortages, widespread malnutrition and a lack of basic goods. Castro hoped for a restoration of Marxism\u2013Leninism in the USSR but refrained from backing the 1991 coup in that country. When Gorbachev regained control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further, and Soviet troops were withdrawn in September 1991. In December, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved as Boris Yeltsin abolished the Soviet Communist Party and introducing a capitalist multiparty democracy. Yeltsin despised Castro and developed links with the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. He welcomed Western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended Manuel Fraga and took a particular interest in Margaret Thatcher's policies in the UK, believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on low taxation and personal initiative. He ceased support for foreign militants, refrained from praising FARC on a 1994 visit to Colombia and called for a negotiated settlement between the Zapatistas and Mexican government in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.\nIn 1991, Havana hosted the Pan American Games, which involved construction of a stadium and accommodation for the athletes; Castro admitted that it was an expensive error, but it was a success for Cuba's government. Crowds regularly shouted \"Fidel! Fidel!\" in front of foreign journalists, while Cuba became the first Latin American nation to beat the US to the top of the gold-medal table. Support for Castro remained strong, and although there were small anti-government demonstrations, the Cuban opposition rejected the exile community's calls for an armed uprising. In August 1994, Havana witnessed the largest anti-Castro demonstration in Cuban history, as 200 to 300 young men threw stones at police, demanding that they be allowed to emigrate to Miami. A larger pro-Castro crowd confronted them, who were joined by Castro; he informed media that the men were anti-socials misled by the US. The protests dispersed with no recorded injuries. Fearing that dissident groups would invade, the government organized the \"War of All the People\" defence strategy, planning a widespread guerrilla warfare campaign, and the unemployed were given jobs building a network of bunkers and tunnels across the country.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe do not have a smidgen of capitalism or neo-liberalism. We are facing a world completely ruled by neo-liberalism and capitalism. This does not mean that we are going to surrender. It means that we have to adopt to the reality of that world. That is what we are doing, with great equanimity, without giving up our ideals, our goals. I ask you to have trust in what the government and party are doing. They are defending, to the last atom, socialist ideas, principles and goals.\n\u2013 Fidel Castro explaining the reforms of the Special Period\nCastro believed in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was to survive in a world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while US dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the economics reforms\u2014although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.\nCastro's government diversified its economy into biotechnology and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash. Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, both in the form of Catholicism and Santer\u00eda. Although long thinking religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to religious institutions and religious people were permitted for the first time to join the Communist Party. Although he viewed the Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.\nIn the early 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against global warming and the waste of natural resources and accusing the US of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a ministry dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing US global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his strong stance against apartheid, and at the 26 July celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa during the Angolan Civil War and thanked Castro personally. Castro later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001, Castro attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through US film.\nBattle of Ideas: 2000\u20132006.\nMired in economic problems, Cuba was aided by the election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Ch\u00e1vez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day. \nMeanwhile, in 1998, Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien arrived in Cuba to meet Castro and highlight their close ties. He was the first Canadian government leader to visit the island since Pierre Trudeau was in Havana in 1976.\nAfter a spontaneous march for the return of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, in December 2000, a youth group named: \"Group of the Battle of Ideas\", was formed by the Young Communist League and the Federation of University Students. The group began organizing demonstrations across Cuba for the return of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. After Gonz\u00e1lez's return, the group began regularly meeting with Fidel Castro to oversee various construction projects and government meetings in Cuba. Fidel Castro ensured that the group had special authorities, and could bypass the approval of various ministries. Along with domestic projects, the wider campaign known as the \"Battle of Ideas\" included attempts to provide medical aid to various pink tide governments.\nIn 2002, former US president Jimmy Carter visited Cuba, where he highlighted the lack of civil liberties in the country and urged the government to pay attention to the Varela Project of Oswaldo Pay\u00e1.\nEconomic problems remained in Cuba, and in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel. In September 2005, Castro established a group of medical professionals, known as the Henry Reeve Brigade, with the mission of international medical solidarity. The group were sent throughout the world to carry out humanitarian missions on behalf of the Cuban government.\nCuba and Venezuela became the founding members of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA's origins lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries and was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' Bolivia in April 2006. Castro had also been calling for greater Caribbean integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only country to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.\nIn contrast to the improved relations between Cuba and a number of leftist Latin American states, in 2004 it broke off diplomatic ties with Panama after centrist President Mireya Moscoso pardoned four Cuban exiles accused of attempting to assassinate Castro in 2000. Diplomatic ties were reinstalled in 2005 following the election of leftist President Mart\u00edn Torrijos.\nCastro's improving relations across Latin America were accompanied by continuing animosity towards the US. However, after massive damage caused by Hurricane Michelle in 2001, Castro successfully proposed a one-time cash purchase of food from the US while declining its government's offer of humanitarian aid. Castro expressed solidarity with the US following the 2001 September 11 attacks, condemning Al-Qaeda and offering Cuban airports for the emergency diversion of any US planes. He recognized that the attacks would make US foreign policy more aggressive, which he believed was counterproductive. Castro criticized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying that the US-led war had imposed an international \"law of the jungle\".\nFinal years.\nStepping down: 2006\u20132008.\nCastro underwent surgery for intestinal bleeding, and on 31 July 2006, delegated his presidential duties to Ra\u00fal Castro. In February 2007, Ra\u00fal announced that Fidel's health was improving and that he was taking part in important issues of government. Later that month, Fidel called into Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's radio show \"Al\u00f3 Presidente\". On 21 April, Castro met Wu Guanzheng of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, with Ch\u00e1vez visiting in August, and Morales in September. That month, the Non-Aligned Movement held its 14th Summit in Havana, there agreeing to appoint Castro as the organization's president for a year's term.\nCommenting on Castro's recovery, US president George W. Bush said: \"One day the good Lord will take Fidel Castro away.\" Hearing about this, the atheist Castro replied: \"Now I understand why I survived Bush's plans and the plans of other presidents who ordered my assassination: the good Lord protected me.\" The quote was picked up on by the world's media.\nIn a February 2008 letter, Castro announced that he would not accept the positions of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief at that month's National Assembly meetings, remarking, \"It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion, that I am not in a physical condition to offer\". On 24 February 2008, the National Assembly of People's Power unanimously voted Ra\u00fal as president. Describing his brother as \"not substitutable\", Ra\u00fal proposed that Fidel continue to be consulted on matters of great importance, a motion unanimously approved by the 597 National Assembly members.\nRetirement: 2008\u20132016.\nFollowing his retirement, Castro's health deteriorated; international press speculated that he had diverticulitis, but Cuba's government refused to corroborate this. He continued to interact with the Cuban people, published an opinion column titled \"Reflections\" in \"Granma\", used a Twitter account, and gave occasional public lectures. In January 2009 Castro asked Cubans not to worry about his lack of recent news columns and failing health, and not to be disturbed by his future death. He continued meeting foreign leaders and dignitaries, and that month photographs were released of Castro's meeting with Argentine president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nIn July 2010, he made his first public appearance since falling ill, greeting science center workers and giving a television interview to \"Mesa Redonda\" in which he discussed US tensions with Iran and North Korea. On 7 August 2010, Castro gave his first speech to the National Assembly in four years, urging the US not to take military actions against those nations and warning of a nuclear holocaust. When asked whether Castro may be re-entering government, culture minister Abel Prieto told the BBC, \"I think that he has always been in Cuba's political life but he is not in the government... He has been very careful about that. His big battle is international affairs.\" In August 2010, Castro accepted responsibility for persecuting gay men in the 1960s and 70s, which included imprisonment in forced labor camps.\nOn 19 April 2011, Castro resigned from the Communist Party central committee, thus stepping down as First Secretary. Ra\u00fal was selected as his successor. Now without any official role in the country's government, he took on the role of an elder statesman. In March 2011, Castro condemned the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. In late March 2012, Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba for three days, during which time he briefly met with Castro despite the Pope's vocal opposition to Cuba's government. \nLater in 2012, it was revealed that along with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Castro had played a significant behind-the-scenes role in orchestrating peace talks between the Colombian government and the far left FARC guerrilla movement to end the conflict which had raged since 1964. During the North Korea crisis of 2013, he urged both the North Korean and US governments to show restraint. Calling the situation \"incredible and absurd\", Castro maintained that war would not benefit either side, and that it represented \"one of the gravest risks of nuclear war\" since the Cuban missile crisis.\nIn December 2014, Castro was awarded the Chinese Confucius Peace Prize for seeking peaceful solutions to his nation's conflict with the US and for his post-retirement efforts to prevent nuclear war. In January 2015, he publicly commented on the \"Cuban Thaw\", an increased normalization between Cuba-US relations, by stating that while it was a positive move for establishing peace in the region, he mistrusted the US government. He did not meet with US president Barack Obama on the latter's visit to Cuba in March 2016, although sent him a letter stating that Cuba \"has no need of gifts from the empire\". \nIn April 2016, he gave his most extensive public appearance in many years when addressing the Communist Party. Highlighting that he was soon to turn 90 years old, he noted that he would die in the near future but urged those assembled to retain their communist ideals. In September 2016, Castro was visited at his Havana home by the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, and later that month was visited by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. In late October 2016, Castro met with the Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who became one of the last foreign leaders to meet him.\nDeath.\nCastro died in Havana on the night of 25 November 2016 at the age of 90. The cause of death was not disclosed. \nHis brother, President Ra\u00fal Castro, confirmed the news in a brief speech: \"The commander in chief of the Cuban revolution died at 22:29 [EST] this evening.\" \nFidel Castro was cremated the next day. A funeral procession travelled along the island's central highway from Havana to Santiago de Cuba, tracing in reverse the route of the \"Freedom Caravan\" of January 1959. \nAfter nine days of public mourning, his ashes were entombed in the Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba.\nFidel's death came nine months after his older brother Ram\u00f3n died at the age of 91 in February.\nIdeology.\n \nCastro proclaimed himself to be \"a Socialist, a Marxist, and a Leninist\", and publicly identified as a Marxist\u2013Leninist from December 1961 onward. Castro sought to transform Cuba from a capitalist state to a socialist society and ultimately to a communist society. Influenced by Guevara, he suggested that Cuba could evade most stages of socialism and progress straight to communism. According to Castro, a country could be regarded as socialist if its means of production were controlled by the state. In this way, his understanding of socialism was less about who controlled power in a country and more about the method of distribution.\nCastro's government was also nationalistic and drew upon a longstanding tradition of Cuban nationalism. Historian Richard Gott remarked that one of the keys to Castro's success was his ability to use the \"twin themes of socialism and nationalism\" and keep them \"endlessly in play\". Castro described Karl Marx and Cuban nationalist Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed as his main political influences, although Gott believed that Mart\u00ed ultimately remained more important than Marx in Castro's politics.\nTheodore Draper described Castro's approach as \"Castroism\", viewing it as a blend of European socialism with the Latin American revolutionary tradition. Political scientist Paul C. Sondrol described the approach as \"totalitarian utopianism\", with leadership that drew upon the wider Latin American phenomenon of the \"caudillo\". Castro drew inspiration from the wider Latin American anti-imperialist movements of the 1930s and 1940s, including Argentina's Per\u00f3n and Guatemala's Jacobo \u00c1rbenz. Castro took a relatively socially conservative stance on many issues, opposing drug use, gambling, and prostitution, which he viewed as moral evils. He advocated hard work, family values, integrity, and self-discipline. Although his government repressed homosexual activity for decades, he later described this persecution as a \"great injustice\".\nPersonal life.\nReligious beliefs.\nCastro's religious beliefs have been a matter of some debate; he was baptized and raised as a Catholic. He criticized the use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans, but commented that Christianity exhibited \"a group of very humane precepts\" which gave the world \"ethical values\" and a \"sense of social justice\", relating, \"If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am a Christian.\" During a visit of American minister and activist Jesse Jackson, Castro accompanied him to a Methodist church service where he even spoke from the pulpit with a Bible before him, an event that marked a beginning of increased openness towards Christianity in Cuba. He promoted the idea that Jesus Christ was a communist, citing the feeding of the 5,000 and the story of Jesus and the rich young man as evidence.\nWealth.\n\"Forbes\" magazine ranked Castro as the seventh wealthiest ruler in the world at an estimated personal wealth of approximately 900 million US dollars in 2006, going from 550 million US dollars in their 2005 list. The estimate is based on the magazine's assumption that Castro had economic control over a network of state-owned companies, including CIMEX, Medicuba, the Havana Convention Palace, and the assumption that a portion of their profits went to Castro through investments. Suggesting that Castro's fortune multiplied, growing from 103 million to 850 million euros, equivalent to 900 million dollars, in just three years, the \"Forbes\" article also referred to rumours of Castro's Swiss bank accounts with \"large stashes\" of this fortune. According to Juan Reinaldo S\u00e1nchez, a former personal bodyguard of Castro, his assets included Cayo Piedra, a private island; over twenty mansions; a marina with yachts; encrypted bank accounts; and a gold mine.\nMarital history.\nThe Cuban government has never published an official marital history of Castro, with most information coming from defectors and scarce details published in state media. In his earlier years in power, he showcased some of his family life, in particular his eldest son Fidelito to portray himself as a regular \"family man\" to the apprehensive American audience, but abandoned that as he became more concerned about his safety. Throughout his rule, Castro never named an official \"First Lady\" and when the need for such a public female companion was necessary, Celia S\u00e1nchez or Ra\u00fal's wife, Vilma Esp\u00edn, would play such a role of \"la primera dama\".\nCastro's first wife was Mirta D\u00edaz-Balart, whom he married in October 1948. She is the only spouse of Castro acknowledged by the Cuban Government. She was a student at the University of Havana, where she met and married Castro. She divorced him later, in 1955, while he was in prison due to the attacks on the Moncada Barracks. They had one son, Fidel \u00c1ngel \"Fidelito\" Castro D\u00edaz-Balart, born in September 1949. \nDuring his first marriage, Castro briefly encountered Maria Laborde, an admirer from Camag\u00fcey, of whom very little is known and who has long been deceased. They had one son, Jorge \u00c1ngel Castro, born on 23 March 1949. It was long believed that his birth was in 1956, but S\u00e1nchez and another defector uncovered that he was born earlier than Fidelito. This was confirmed by Alina Fern\u00e1ndez, who claimed that Fidelito told her that Jorge Angel was the \"around the same age as him\". While married to Mirta, Castro had an affair with Natalia \"Naty\" Revuelta Clews who gave birth to his daughter, Alina Fern\u00e1ndez Revuelta, in 1956.\nCastro's second and longest marriage was with Dalia Soto Del Valle, an admirer who met Castro during a speech in Villa Clara in 1961. She moved to Havana on Castro's initiative and later moved in with him at \"Punto Cero\". Her relationship with Castro was kept secret until 2006 when she was photographed. Castro and Dalia had five sons, Alexis, Alex, Alejandro, Antonio, and Angelito. After the 1970s, Castro began a long relationship with Juanita Vera, a Colonel in the foreign intelligence service who joined his escort unit as his English interpreter. She and Castro had one son, Abel Castro Vera, born in 1983.\nCastro had another daughter, Francisca Pupo, born 1953, the result of a one-night affair. Pupo and her husband now live in Miami. Another son known as Ciro was born in the early 1960s, the result of another brief fling, his existence confirmed by Celia S\u00e1nchez.\nReception and legacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWithin Cuba, Fidel's domination of every aspect of the government and the society remains total. His personal needs for absolute control seems to have changed little over the years. He remains committed to a disciplined society in which he is still determined to remake the Cuban national character, creating work-orientated, socially concerned individuals\u00a0... He wants to increase people's standard of living, the availability of material goods, and to import the latest technology. But the economic realities, despite rapid dramatic growth in the gross national product, severely limit what Cuba can buy on the world market.\n\u2013 Peter Bourne, Castro biographer, 1986\nOne of the most controversial political leaders of his era, Castro inspired and dismayed people around the world during his lifetime. He ruled a single-party authoritarian regime in Cuba where political opposition was not permitted. Censorship of information was extensive, and independent journalism was repressed.\nDespite its small size and limited economic weight, Castro's Cuba gained a large role in world affairs. The Castro government relied heavily on its appeals to nationalistic sentiment, in particular the widespread hostility to the US government. According to Balfour, Castro's domestic popularity stemmed from the fact that he symbolized \"a long-cherished hope of national liberation and social justice\" for much of the population. Balfour also noted that throughout Latin America, Castro served as \"a symbol of defiance against the continued economic and cultural imperialism of the United States\". Similarly, Wayne S. Smith\u2014the former Chief of the United States Interests Section in Havana\u2014noted that Castro's opposition to US dominance and transformation of Cuba into a significant world player resulted in him receiving \"warm applause\" throughout the Western Hemisphere.\nVarious Western governments and human rights organizations nevertheless heavily criticized Castro and he was widely reviled in the US. Following Castro's death, US president-elect Donald Trump called him a \"brutal dictator\", while the Cuban-American politician Marco Rubio called him \"an evil, murderous dictator\" who turned Cuba into \"an impoverished island prison\". Castro publicly rejected the \"dictator\" label, stating that he constitutionally held less power than most heads of state and that his government allowed for greater democratic involvement in policy making than Western liberal democracies. \nNevertheless, critics claim that Castro wielded significant unofficial influence aside from his official duties. Quirk stated that Castro wielded \"absolute power\" in Cuba, albeit not in a legal or constitutional manner, while Bourne claimed that power in Cuba was \"completely invested\" in Castro, adding that it was very rare for \"a country and a people\" to have been so completely dominated by \"the personality of one man\". Balfour stated that Castro's \"moral and political hegemony\" within Cuba diminished the opportunities for democratic debate and decision making. Describing Castro as a \"totalitarian dictator\", Sondrol suggested that in leading \"a political system largely [of] his own creation and bearing his indelible stamp\", Castro's leadership style warranted comparisons with totalitarian leaders like Mao Zedong, Hideki Tojo, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini.\nNoting that there were \"few more polarising political figures\" than Castro, Amnesty International described him as \"a progressive but deeply flawed leader\". In their view, he should be \"applauded\" for his regime's \"substantial improvements\" to healthcare and education, but criticized for its \"ruthless suppression of freedom of expression.\" Human Rights Watch stated that his government constructed a \"repressive machinery\" which deprived Cubans of their \"basic rights\". Castro defended his government's record on human rights, stating that the state was forced to limit the freedoms of individuals and imprison those involved in counter-revolutionary activities to protect the rights of the collective populace, such as the right to employment, education, and health care.\nHistorian and journalist Richard Gott considered Castro to be \"one of the most extraordinary political figures of the twentieth century\", commenting that he had become a \"world hero in the mould\" of Giuseppe Garibaldi to people throughout the developing world for his anti-imperialist efforts. Balfour stated that Castro's story had \"few parallels in contemporary history\", for there existed no other \"Third World [\"sic\"] leader\" in the second half of the twentieth century who held \"such a prominent and restless part on the international stage\" or remained head of state for such a long period. Bourne described Castro as \"an influential world leader\" who commanded \"great respect\" from individuals of all political ideologies across the developing world. \nCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau described Castro as a \"remarkable leader\" and a \"larger than life leader who served his people.\" The European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that Castro \"was a hero for many.\" Russian president Vladimir Putin described Castro as both \"a sincere and reliable friend of Russia\" and a \"symbol of an era\", while Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping similarly referred to him as \"a close comrade and a sincere friend\" to China. \nIndian prime minister Narendra Modi termed him \"one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century\" and a \"great friend\", while South African president Jacob Zuma praised Castro for aiding black South Africans in \"our struggle against apartheid\". He was awarded a wide variety of awards and honours from foreign governments and was cited as an inspiration for foreign leaders like Ahmed Ben Bella and Nelson Mandela, who awarded him South Africa's highest civilian award for foreigners, the Order of Good Hope. The biographer Volker Skierka stated that \"he will go down in history as one of the few revolutionaries who remained true to his principles\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
