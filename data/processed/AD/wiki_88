Rickover", "text": "US Navy admiral\nHyman George Rickover (27 January 1900 \u2013 8 July 1986) was an admiral in the United States Navy. He directed the original development of naval nuclear propulsion and controlled its operations for three decades as director of the U.S. Naval Reactors office. In addition, he oversaw the development of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the world's first commercial pressurized water reactor used for generating electricity. Rickover is also one of seven people who have been awarded two Congressional Gold Medals.\nRickover is known as the \"Father of the Nuclear Navy,\" and his influence on the Navy and its warships was of such scope that he \"may well go down in history as one of the Navy's most important officers.\" He served in a flag rank for nearly 30 years (1953 to 1982), ending his career as a four-star admiral. His years of service exceeded that of each of the U.S. Navy's five-star fleet admirals\u2014Leahy, King, Nimitz and Halsey\u2014all of whom served on active duty for life after their appointments. Rickover's total of 63 years of active duty service makes him the longest-serving naval officer, as well as the longest-serving member of the U.S armed forces in history.\nHaving become a naval engineering duty officer (EDO) in 1937 after serving as both a surface ship and submarine-qualified unrestricted line officer, his substantial legacy of technical achievements includes the United States Navy's continuing record of zero reactor accidents.\nEarly life and education.\nRickover was born Chaim Gdala Rykower () to Abraham and Rachel/Ruchla Lea (n\u00e9e Unger) Rykower, a Polish Jewish family from Mak\u00f3w Mazowiecki in Vistula Land. His parents changed his name to \"Hyman\" which is derived from Chayyim, meaning \"life\". He did not use his middle name Godalia (a form of \"Gedaliah\"), but he substituted \"George\" when at the Naval Academy.\nIn 1906 (aged six), Rickover made passage to New York City with his mother and sister, fleeing anti-Semitic Russian pogroms during the Revolution of 1905. They joined Abraham, who had made earlier trips there beginning in 1897 to become established. Rickover's family lived initially on the East Side of Manhattan but moved two years later to North Lawndale, Chicago, which was a heavily Jewish neighborhood at the time, where Rickover's father continued work as a tailor. Rickover took his first paid job at age nine, earning three cents an hour () for holding a light as his neighbor operated a machine. Later, he delivered groceries. He graduated from grammar school at 14.\nRickover attended John Marshall Metropolitan High School in Chicago and graduated with honors in 1918. He then held a full-time job as a telegraph boy delivering Western Union telegrams, through which he became acquainted with Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, a Czech Jewish immigrant. Sabath nominated Rickover for appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Rickover was only a third alternate for appointment, but he passed the entrance exam and was accepted.\nNaval career through World War II.\nRickover's naval career began in 1918 at the Naval Academy; at this time, attending military academies was considered active duty service, due in part to World War I. On 2 June 1922, Rickover graduated 107th out of 540 midshipmen and was commissioned as an ensign. He joined the destroyer on 5 September 1922. Rickover impressed his commanding officer with his hard work and efficiency, and was made engineer officer on 21 June 1923, becoming the youngest such officer in the squadron.\nHe next served on board the battleship before earning a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University in 1930 by way of a year at the Naval Postgraduate School and further coursework at Columbia. At the latter institution, he met Ruth D. Masters, a graduate student in international law, whom he married in 1931 after she returned from her doctoral studies at the Sorbonne in Paris. Shortly after marrying, Rickover wrote to his parents of his decision to become an Episcopalian, remaining so for the remainder of his life.\nRickover had a high regard for the quality of the education he received at Columbia, as demonstrated in this excerpt from a speech he gave at the university some 52 years after attending:\nColumbia was the first institution that encouraged me to think rather than memorize. My teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university and were able to share their experience with their students. I am grateful, among others, to Professors Morecroft, Hehre, and Arendt. Much of what I have subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles I learned from them.\nRickover preferred life on smaller ships, and he also knew that young officers in the submarine service were advancing quickly, so he went to Washington and volunteered for submarine duty. His application was turned down due to his age, at that time 29 years. Fortunately for Rickover, he encountered his former commanding officer from \"Nevada\" while leaving the building, who interceded successfully on his behalf. From 1929 to 1933, Rickover qualified for submarine duty and command aboard the submarines and . While aboard \"S-48\" he was addressed a letter of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy \"for rescuing Augustin Pasis... from drowning at the Submarine Base, Coco Solo, Canal Zone.\" While at the Office of the Inspector of Naval Material in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1933, Rickover translated \"Das Unterseeboot\" (\"The Submarine\") by World War I German Imperial Navy Admiral Hermann Bauer. Rickover's translation became a basic text for the U.S. submarine service.\nOn 17 July 1937, he reported aboard the minesweeper at Qingdao, China, and assumed what would be his only ship command with additional duty as Commander, Mine Division Three, Asiatic Fleet. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident had occurred ten days earlier. In August, \"Finch\" stood out for Shanghai to protect American citizens and interests from the conflict between Chinese and Japanese forces. On 25 September, Rickover was promoted to lieutenant commander, retroactive to 1 July. In October, his designation as an engineering duty officer became effective, and he was relieved of his three-month command of \"Finch\" at Shanghai on 5 October 1937.\nRickover was assigned to the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines, and was transferred shortly thereafter to the Bureau of Engineering in Washington, D.C. Once there, he took up his duties as assistant chief of the Electrical section of the Bureau of Engineering on 15 August 1939.\nOn 10 April 1942, after America's entry into World War II, Rickover flew to Pearl Harbor to organize repairs to the electrical power plant of . Rickover had been promoted to the rank of commander on 1 January 1942, and in late June of that year was made a temporary captain. In late 1944 he appealed for a transfer to an active command. He was sent to investigate inefficiencies at the naval supply depot at Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, then was appointed in July 1945 to command of a ship repair facility on Okinawa. Shortly thereafter, his command was destroyed by Typhoon Louise, and he subsequently spent some time helping to teach school to Okinawan children.\nLater in the war, his service as head of the Electrical Section in the Bureau of Ships brought him a Legion of Merit and gave him experience in directing large development programs, choosing talented technical people, and working closely with private industry. \"Time\" magazine featured him on the cover of its 11 January 1954 issue. The accompanying article described his wartime service:\nSharp-tongued Hyman Rickover spurred his men to exhaustion, ripped through red tape, drove contractors into rages. He went on making enemies, but by the end of the war he had won the rank of captain. He had also won a reputation as a man \"who gets things done.\"\nNaval Reactors and the Atomic Energy Commission.\nIn December 1945, Rickover was appointed Inspector General of the 19th Fleet on the west coast, and was assigned to work with General Electric at Schenectady, New York, to develop a nuclear propulsion plant for destroyers. In 1946, an initiative was begun at the Manhattan Project's Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) to develop a nuclear electric generating plant. Realizing the potential that nuclear energy held for the Navy, Rickover applied. Rickover was sent to Oak Ridge through the efforts of his wartime boss, Rear Admiral Earle Mills, who became the head of the Navy's Bureau of Ships that same year.\nRickover became an early convert to the idea of nuclear marine propulsion, and was the driving force for shifting the Navy's initial focus from applications on destroyers to submarines. Rickover's vision was not initially shared by his immediate superiors: he was recalled from Oak Ridge and assigned \"advisory duties\" with an office in an abandoned ladies' room in the Navy Building. He subsequently went around several layers of superior officers, and in 1947 went directly to the Chief of Naval Operations, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, also a former submariner. Nimitz immediately understood the potential of nuclear propulsion in submarines and recommended the project to the Secretary of the Navy, John L. Sullivan. Sullivan's endorsement to build the world's first nuclear-powered vessel, , later caused Rickover to state that Sullivan was \"the true father of the Nuclear Navy.\"\nSubsequently, Rickover became chief of a new section in the Bureau of Ships, the Nuclear Power Division reporting to Mills. He began work with Alvin M. Weinberg, the Oak Ridge director of research, to initiate and develop the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology and to begin the design of the pressurized water reactor for submarine propulsion. In February 1949 he was assigned to the Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development, and then assumed control of the Navy's effort within the AEC as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch. This twin role enabled him to lead the effort to develop \"Nautilus\".\nThe original selection of Rickover as head of development of the nation's nuclear submarine program ultimately rested with Admiral Mills. According to Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, Mills was anxious to have a very determined man involved. He knew that Rickover was \"not too easy to get along with\" and \"not too popular,\" but in his judgement Rickover was the man on whom the Navy could depend \"no matter what opposition he might encounter\".\nWhile his team and industry were completing construction of \"Nautilus\", Rickover was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1953. However, this was anything but routine, and occurred only after an extraordinary chain of events:\n[Rickover's] peers in the Navy\u2019s engineer branch thought to get rid of him through failure of promotion above captain. This would entail automatic retirement at the thirty-year mark. But someone made the case to the U.S. Senate, charged by the Constitution with formal confirmation of military promotions. In that year, 1953, two years before \"Nautilus\" first went to sea, the Senate failed to give its usual perfunctory approval of the Navy admiral promotion list, and the press was outraged because Rickover's name was not on it... Ultimately an enlightened Secretary of the Navy, Robert B. Anderson, ordered a special selection board to sit. With some shuffling of feet it did what it had been ordered to do... Ninety-five percent of Navy captains must retire regardless of how highly qualified because there are only vacancies for 5 percent of them to become admirals, and although vindictiveness has sometimes played a part in determining who shall fail of selection for promotion (thus also violating the system), never before or since have pressures from outside the Navy overturned this form of career-termination.\nRegardless of the challenges faced in developing and operating brand-new technology, Rickover and the team did not disappoint: the result was a highly reliable nuclear reactor in a form-factor that would fit into a submarine hull with no more than a beam. This became known as the S1W reactor. \"Nautilus\" was launched and commissioned with this reactor in 1954.\nLater Rickover oversaw the development of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first commercial pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant. Kenneth Nichols of the AEC decided that the Rickover-Westinghouse pressurized-water reactor was \"the best choice for a reactor to demonstrate the production of electricity\" with Rickover \"having a going organization and a reactor project under way that now had no specific use to justify it.\" This was a reference to the first core used at Shippingport originating from a cancelled nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. This was accepted by Lewis Strauss and the Commission in January 1954.\nRickover was promoted to vice admiral in 1958, the same year that he was awarded the first of two Congressional Gold Medals. He exercised tight control for the next three decades over the ships, technology, and personnel of the nuclear Navy, interviewing and approving or denying every prospective officer being considered for a nuclear ship. Over the course of Rickover's career, these personal interviews numbered in the tens of thousands; over 14,000 interviews were with recent college-graduates alone. The interviewees ranged from midshipmen and newly commissioned ensigns destined for nuclear-powered submarines and surface combatants, to very senior combat-experienced Naval Aviator captains who sought command of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The content of most of these interviews has been lost to history, though some were later chronicled in several books on Rickover's career, as well as in a http:// with Diane Sawyer in 1984.\nIn 1973, though his role and responsibilities remained unchanged, Rickover was promoted to the rank of four-star admiral. This was the second time (after Samuel Murray Robinson) in the history of the U.S. Navy that an officer with a career path other than an operational line officer achieved that rank. Because his responsibilities did not include direct command and control of combatant naval units, technically Rickover was appointed to the grade of admiral on the retired list so as to provide some clarity on this issue. This was also done to avoid affecting the maximum-authorized number of admirals (O-10) on the \"active list.\"\nAs head of Naval Reactors, Rickover's focus and responsibilities were dedicated to reactor safety rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training. However, this extreme focus was well known during Rickover's era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities. One way that this was addressed after Rickover retired was that only the very strongest, former at-sea submarine commanders have held Rickover's now unique eight-year position as NAVSEA-08, the longest chartered tenure in the U.S. military. From Rickover's first replacement, Kinnaird R. McKee, to today's head of Naval Reactors, William J. Houston, all have held command of nuclear submarines, their squadrons and ocean fleets, but none have been a long-term Engineering Duty Officer such as Rickover. In keeping with Rickover's promotion to four-star admiral, those who were subsequently selected for assignment to Director, Naval Reactors are promoted to this same rank, but also on active duty status.\nHistorian Francis Duncan, who for over eight years was granted generous access to diverse numbers and levels of witnesses\u2014including U.S. presidents\u2014as well as Rickover himself, came to the conclusion that the man was best understood with respect to a guiding principle that Rickover invoked foremost for both himself and those who served in the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program: \"exercise of the concept of responsibility.\" This is further evidenced by Rickover listing \"responsibility\" as his first principle in his final-years paper and speech, \"Thoughts on Man's Purpose in Life.\"\nSafety record.\nRickover's stringent standards are largely credited with being responsible for the U.S. Navy's continuing record of zero reactor accidents (defined as the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core). He made it a point to be aboard during the initial sea trial of almost every nuclear submarine completing its new-construction period. Following the Three Mile Island accident on March 28, 1979, Admiral Rickover was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents, as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place.\nThe accident-free record of United States Navy reactor operations stands in some very stark contrast to those of the Soviet Union, which had fourteen known reactor accidents. As stated in a retrospective analysis in October 2007:\nU.S. submarines far outperformed the Soviet ones in the crucial area of stealth, and Rickover's obsessive fixation on safety and quality control gave the U.S. nuclear Navy a vastly superior safety record to the Soviet one.\nViews on nuclear power.\nGiven Rickover's single-minded focus on naval nuclear propulsion, design, and operations, it came as a surprise to many in 1982, near the end of his career, when he testified before the U.S. Congress that, were it up to him what to do with nuclear powered ships, he \"would sink them all.\" At a congressional hearing Rickover testified that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every time you produce radiation, you produce something that has a certain half-life, in some cases for billions of years. [...] I do not believe that nuclear power is worth the present benefits since it creates radiation. You might ask why do I design nuclear powered ships. That is because it is a necessary evil. I would sink them all. I am not proud of the part I played in it. I did it because it was necessary for the safety of this country. That's why I am such a great exponent of stopping this whole nonsense of war. Unfortunately, attempts to limit war have always failed. One lesson of history is when a war erupts every nation will ultimately use whatever weapon is available. ... It is important that we control these forces and try to eliminate them.\u2014\u200a\nA few months later, following his retirement, Rickover spoke more specifically regarding the questions \"Could you comment on your own responsibility in helping to create a nuclear navy? Do you have any regrets?\":\nI do not have regrets. I believe I helped preserve the peace for this country. Why should I regret that? What I accomplished was approved by Congress\u2014which represents our people. All of you live in safety from domestic enemies because of security from the police. Likewise, you live in safety from foreign enemies because our military keeps them from attacking us. Nuclear technology was already under development in other countries. My assigned responsibility was to develop our nuclear navy. I managed to accomplish this.\nFocus on education.\nWhen he was a child still living in Russian-occupied Poland, Rickover was not allowed to attend public schools because of his Jewish faith. Starting at the age of four, he attended a religious school where the teaching was solely from the \"Tanakh\", i.e., \"Old Testament\", in Hebrew. Following his formal education in the United States, Rickover developed a decades-long and outspoken interest in the educational standards of the US as being a national security issue, particularly as compared during the Cold War era to Soviet Russia.\nAn example of his passion for education from his 1959 \"Report on Russia\" in the context of comparative educational systems:\nThere is no room here (in nuclear powerplant development) for lofty theories which do not work out in practice. We would not get anywhere if we had the loose, hazy thinking you encounter when you bring out the obvious failures of the American educational system. ... there are times when it is irresponsible to avoid criticizing something which one knows to be wrong and dangerous for the Nation as a whole. I feel that every one who has a position of responsibility in this country and who can see and understand what is happening not only has the right, he has the obligation and the duty to speak. ... This is why I feel so strongly about education\u2014about our failure to give our children as good an education as they deserve and need. ... It is my considered opinion that there is no problem that faces the Congress or the country that is as important.\nRickover believed that US standards of education were unacceptably low. His first book centered on education was a collection of essays calling for improved standards of education, particularly in math and science, entitled \"Education and Freedom\" (1959). In it, he stated that \"education is the most important problem facing the United States today\" and \"only the massive upgrading of the scholastic standards of our schools will guarantee the future prosperity and freedom of the Republic.\" A second book, \"Swiss Schools and Ours\" (1962) was a scathing comparison of the educational systems of Switzerland and America. He argued that the higher standards of Swiss schools, including a longer school day and year, combined with an approach stressing student choice and academic specialization produced superior results.\nRecognizing that \"nurturing careers of excellence and leadership in science and technology in young scholars is an essential investment in the United States national and global future,\" Rickover founded the Center for Excellence in Education following his retirement in 1983. Additionally, Rickover founded the Research Science Institute (formerly the Rickover Science Institute) in 1984, a summer science program hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for high school seniors from around the world.\nGeneral Dynamics scandal.\nIn the early 1980s, structural welding flaws in submarines under construction were covered up by falsified inspection records, and the resulting scandal led to significant delays and expenses in the delivery of several submarines being built at the General Dynamics Electric Boat Division shipyard in Groton, Connecticut. The yard tried to pass on the vast cost overruns to the Navy, while Rickover demanded that the yard make good on its \"shoddy\" workmanship. The Navy settled with General Dynamics in 1981, paying out $634 million of $843 million in cost overrun and reconstruction claims. Secretary of the Navy John Lehman was partly motivated to seek the agreement in order to continue to focus on achieving President Reagan's goal of a 600-ship Navy. But Rickover was extremely bitter over the General Dynamics yard being paid hundreds of millions of dollars, and he lambasted both the settlement and Secretary Lehman. This was not Rickover's first clash with the defense industry; he was historically harsh in exacting high standards from defense contractors. It was later publicly announced by a former General Dynamics employee on \"60 Minutes\" with Mike Wallace that Rickover was right that General Dynamics was lying to the Navy, but by then Rickover's public image was already damaged.\nA Navy Ad Hoc Gratuities Board determined that Rickover had received gifts from General Dynamics over a 16-year period valued at $67,628, including jewelry, furniture, exotic knives, and gifts that Rickover had in turn presented to politicians. Charges were investigated that gifts were provided by General Electric and the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock, both major nuclear ship contractors for the Navy. Secretary Lehman admonished him in a non-punitive letter and stated that Rickover's \"fall from grace with these little trinkets should be viewed in the context of his enormous contributions to the Navy.\" Rickover released a statement through his lawyer saying his \"conscience is clear\" with respect to the gifts. \"No gratuity or favor ever affected any decision I made.\" Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, a longtime supporter of Rickover, later publicly associated a debilitating stroke suffered by the admiral to his having been censured and \"dragged through the mud by the very institution to which he rendered his invaluable service.\"\nForced retirement.\nBy the late 1970s, Rickover's position seemed stronger than it had ever been. Over many years, powerful friends on both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees ensured that he remained on active duty long after most other admirals had retired from their second careers. Jimmy Carter's admiration for Rickover was shown by the fact that the title of Carter's autobiography was based on a question that Rickover had asked Carter when the latter was in the Navy (\"Why Not The Best?\"). However, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman felt that Rickover was hindering the well-being of the navy. As Lehman stated in his book, \"Command of the Seas\":\nOne of my first orders of business as Secretary of the Navy would be to solve ... the Rickover problem. Rickover's legendary achievements were in the past. His present viselike grip on much of the navy was doing it much harm. I had sought the job because I believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security. The navy's grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision; loss of self-confidence, and morale; a prolonged starvation of resources, leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job; and too few ships to cover a sea so great, all resulting in cynicism, exhaustion, and an undercurrent of defeatism. The cult created by Admiral Rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery, entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy.\nSecretary Lehman eventually attained enough political clout to enforce his decision to retire Rickover. This was in part assisted by the admiral's nearly insubordinate stance against paying the General Dynamics submarine construction claims, as well as his advanced age and waning political leverage. On 27 July 1981, Lehman was handed the final impetus for ending Rickover's career by way of an operational error on the admiral's part: a \"moderate\" loss of ship control and depth excursion while performing a submerged \"crash back\" maneuver during the sea trials of the newly constructed . Rickover was the actual man-in-charge during this specific performance test, and his actions and inactions were judged to have been the causal factor. On 31 January 1982, five weeks after his 82nd birthday, Rickover was forced to retire from the Navy after 63 years of service under 13 presidents (Woodrow Wilson through Ronald Reagan). According to Rickover, he first learned of his firing when his wife told him what she heard on the radio.\nAccording to former President Jimmy Carter, several weeks following his retirement, Rickover \"was invited to the Oval Office and decided to don his full dress uniform. He told me that he refused to take a seat, listened to the president [Reagan] ask him to be his special nuclear advisor, replied 'Mr. President, that is bullshit,' and then walked out.\" The Navy's official investigation of General Dynamics' Electric Boat division was ended shortly afterward. According to Theodore Rockwell, Rickover's Technical Director for more than 15 years, more than one source at that time stated that General Dynamics officials were bragging around Washington that they had \"gotten Rickover.\"\nOn 28 February 1983, a post-retirement party honoring Admiral Rickover was attended by all three living former U.S. Presidents at the time: Nixon, Ford, and Carter, all formerly officers in the U.S. Navy. President Reagan was not in attendance.\nPublic image.\nRickover has been called \"the most famous and controversial admiral of his era.\" He was hyperactive, blunt, confrontational, insulting, and a workaholic, always demanding of others without regard for rank or position. Moreover, he had \"little tolerance for mediocrity, none for stupidity.\" Even while a captain, Rickover did not conceal his opinions, and many of the officers whom he regarded as unintelligent eventually rose to be admirals and were assigned to the Pentagon. Rickover frequently found himself in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers, to the point that he almost missed becoming an admiral; two selection boards passed him over for promotion, and it took the intervention of the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Secretary of the Navy before he was promoted.\nRickover's military authority and congressional mandate were absolute with regard to the U.S. fleet's reactor operations, but his controlling personality was frequently a subject of internal Navy controversy. He was head of the Naval Reactors branch, and thus responsible for signing off on a crew's competence to operate the reactor safely, giving him the power to effectively remove a warship from active service, which he did on several occasions. The view became established that he sometimes exercised power to settle scores. Author and former submariner Edward L. Beach Jr. referred to him as a \"tyrant\" with \"no account of his gradually failing powers\" in his later years.\nLater life and death.\nOn 4 July 1985, Admiral Rickover suffered what was described as a \"serious\" stroke, and was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital, thereafter dealing with partial paralysis in his right arm.\nRickover died at his home in Arlington, Virginia, on 8 July 1986, at age 86. He was buried on 11 July in a small, private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. On 14 July, memorial services were led by Admiral James D. Watkins at the Washington National Cathedral, with President Carter, Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary Lehman, senior naval officers, and about 1,000 other people in attendance. At the request of the admiral's widow, President Carter read Milton's sonnet \"When I Consider How My Light is Spent\".\nSecretary of the Navy Lehman said in a statement:\nWith the death of Adm. Rickover, the Navy and this nation have lost a dedicated officer of historic accomplishment. In his 63 years of service, Adm. Rickover took the concept of nuclear power from an idea to the present reality of more than 150 U.S. naval ships under nuclear power, with a record of 3,000 ship-years of accident-free operations.\nAnd the then-Chief of Naval Operations:\n\"Most important,\" Admiral Watkins said, \"he was a teacher. He set the standards. They were tough. That is the legacy and the challenge he left to all who study his contributions.\"\nRickover is buried in Section 5 at Arlington National Cemetery. His first wife Ruth is buried with him and the name of his second wife Eleonore is inscribed on his gravestone. Eleonore died on 5 July 2021, and was buried in Arlington Cemetery. Rickover is survived by Robert Rickover, his sole son by his first wife.\nHonors.\nThe \"Los Angeles\"-class submarine was named for him. She was commissioned two years before his death, and was, at that time, one of only two Navy ships to be named after a living person since 1900 (there have been 16 more since). The submarine was launched on 27 August 1983, sponsored by his second wife Eleonore, commissioned on 21 July 1984, and deactivated on 14 December 2006. In 2015, the Navy announced a named in his honor. The submarine's christening took place on 31 July 2021.\nRickover Hall at the United States Naval Academy houses the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Naval Architecture, Ocean Engineering, and Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering. Rickover Center at Naval Nuclear Power Training Command is located at Joint Base Charleston, where Navy personnel begin their engineering training. In 2011, the U.S. Navy Museum included Rickover as part of the \"Technology for the Nuclear Age: Nuclear Propulsion\" display for its Cold War exhibit, which featured the following quotation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Good ideas are not adopted automatically. They must be driven into practice with courageous impatience.\nOther things named in his honor include the Admiral Hyman Rickover Fellowship at M.I.T., Hyman G. Rickover Naval Academy, and Rickover Junior High School.\nAwards.\nForeign order.\nIn recognition of his wartime service, he was invested as an Honorary Commander of the Military Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1946 by King George VI.\nOther awards.\nAdmiral Rickover was twice awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for exceptional public service; the first in 1958, and the second 25 years later in 1983, becoming one of only three persons to be awarded more than one. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter presented Admiral Rickover with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest non-military honor, for his contributions to world peace.\nHe also received 61 civilian awards and 15 honorary degrees, including the Enrico Fermi Award \"For engineering and demonstrative leadership in the development of safe and reliable nuclear power and its successful application to our national security and economic needs.\" Some of the most notable other awards include:\nSome of his honorary degrees included:\nPublications.\nHyman was a writer who penned several books about education and naval history.

{"id": "42353", "revid": "1456683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42353", "title": "Acupressure", "text": "Alternative medicine technique similar to acupuncture\nAcupressure is an alternative medicine technique often used in conjunction with acupuncture or reflexology. It is based on the concept of \"life energy\" (qi), which purportedly flows through \"meridians\" in the body. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of acupuncture points, meridians, or qi.\nAlthough some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, insomnia, low back pain, migraines, and constipation, among other things, such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias. There is no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of acupressure.\nHistory and origin.\nAcupressure originated in ancient China, developing as part of traditional Chinese medicine.\nChinese origin.\nAcupressure and acupuncture are generally held to have originated in China, with the earliest references appearing in documents from a few hundred years before the Common Era. The \"Huangdi Neijing\" (Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine), dating from approximately 100 BCE, represents the first document that unequivocally described an organized system of diagnosis and treatment recognized as acupuncture. This foundational text, compiled over 2000 years ago during China's Warring States period, established the concepts of meridians through which Qi (vital energy) flowed, though precise anatomical locations of acupuncture points developed later. Historical evidence indicates that acupuncture has been practiced in China for more than 3000 years and subsequently spread to Europe and America from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries.\nIndian origin theory.\nAn alternative theory posits that acupressure originated in India around 560 BCE during the Buddhist era, was taught at Nalanda and Takshshila, and later transmitted to China by a migrating Buddhist monk. Proponents of this theory note that major points of Indian acupressure and Chinese acupuncture share similarities. The subsequent development and promotion of this medicine in China is attributed to official support and extensive research conducted there.\nEffectiveness.\nA 2011 systematic review of 43 studies of acupressure's effectiveness at treating symptoms found that the nature of these 43 studies \"indicated a significant likelihood of bias.\" Thirty-five of the 43 studies had concluded that acupressure was effective at treating certain symptoms. The authors of this systematic review concluded that this \"review of clinical trials from the past decade did not provide rigorous support for the efficacy of acupressure for symptom management. Well-designed, randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the utility and efficacy of acupressure to manage a variety of symptoms in a number of patient populations.\"\nA 2011 Cochrane review of four trials using acupuncture and nine studies using acupressure to control pain in childbirth concluded that \"acupuncture or acupressure may help relieve pain during labour, but more research is needed\". Another Cochrane Collaboration review found that massage provided some long-term benefit for low back pain, and stated: \"It seems that acupressure or pressure point massage techniques provide more relief than classic (Swedish) massage, although more research is needed to confirm this.\"\nAn acupressure wristband that is claimed to relieve the symptoms of motion sickness and other forms of nausea provides pressure to the P6 acupuncture point, a point that has been extensively investigated. The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the use of P6 for nausea and vomiting, and found it to be effective for reducing post-operative nausea, but not vomiting. The Cochrane review included various means of stimulating P6, including acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, laser stimulation, acustimulation device and acupressure; it did not comment on whether one or more forms of stimulation were more effective; it found low-quality evidence supporting stimulation of P6 compared with sham, with 2 out of 59 trials having low risk of bias. EBM reviewer Bandolier said that P6 in two studies showed 52% of patients with control having a success, compared with 75% with P6.\nQuackwatch includes acupressure in a list of methods which have no \"rational place\" as massage therapy and states that practitioners \"may also use irrational diagnostic methods to reach diagnoses that do not correspond to scientific concepts of health and disease.\"\nClinical use of acupressure frequently relies on the conceptual framework of traditional Chinese medicine. There is no physically verifiable anatomical or histological basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians. Proponents reply that TCM is a prescientific system that continues to have practical relevance. Acupuncturists tend to perceive TCM concepts in functional rather than structural terms (e.g., as being useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients). Trials using placebo have not demonstrated any statistically significant effect but concluded that acupressure is safe to use along with conventional treatment.\nInstruments.\nThere are several different instruments for applying nonspecific pressure by rubbing, rolling, or applying pressure on the reflex zones of the body. The acuball is a small ball made of rubber with protuberances that is heatable. It is used to apply pressure and relieve muscle and joint pain. The energy roller is a small cylinder with protuberances. It is held between the hands and rolled back and forth to apply acupressure. The foot roller (also \"krupa chakra\") is a round, cylindrical roller with protuberances. It is placed on the floor, and the foot is rolled back and forth over it. The power mat (also pyramid mat) is a mat with small pyramid-shaped bumps that you walk on. The spine roller is a bumpy roller containing magnets that is rolled up and down the spine. The Teishein is one of the original nine classical acupuncture needles described in the original acupuncture texts. Even though it is described as an acupuncture needle, it did not pierce the skin. It is used to apply rapid percussion pressure to the points being treated.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42357", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42357", "title": "Elizabeth Taylor", "text": "British and American actress (1932\u20132011)\nDame Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor (February 27, 1932 \u2013 March 23, 2011) was a British and American actress. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s and was one of the most popular stars of classical Hollywood cinema in the 1950s. She then became the world's highest-paid movie star in the 1960s, remaining a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her seventh on its greatest female screen legends list.\nBorn in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to Los Angeles in 1939 at the age of seven. She made her acting debut with a minor role in the Universal Pictures film \"There's One Born Every Minute\" (1942), but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and became a popular teen star after appearing in \"National Velvet\" (1944). She transitioned to mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951). She starred in the historical adventure epic \"Ivanhoe\" (1952) with Robert Taylor and Joan Fontaine. Despite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio's control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned.\nShe began receiving more enjoyable roles in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama \"Giant\" (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by Tennessee Williams: \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958), and \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" (1959); Taylor won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a call girl in \"BUtterfield 8\" (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. During the production of the film \"Cleopatra\" in 1961, Taylor and co-star Richard Burton began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, they continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including \"The V.I.P.s\" (1963), \"The Sandpiper\" (1965), \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1967), and \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for \"Woolf\", winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974 but reconciled soon after, remarrying in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.\nTaylor's acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator John Warner. In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She became the second celebrity to launch a perfume brand after Sophia Loren. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in HIV/AIDS activism. She co-founded the American Foundation for AIDS Research in 1985 and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001.\nThroughout her career, Taylor's personal life was the subject of constant media attention. She was married eight times to seven men, had four children, converted to Judaism, endured several serious illnesses, and led a jet set lifestyle, including assembling one of the most expensive private collections of jewelry in the world. After many years of ill health, Taylor died from congestive heart failure in 2011, at the age of 79.\nEarly life.\nElizabeth Rosemond Taylor was born on 27 February 1932, at Heathwood, her family's home at 8 Wildwood Road in Hampstead Garden Suburb, northwest London, England. She received dual British\u2013American citizenship at birth as her parents, art dealer Francis Lenn Taylor (1897\u20131968) and stage actress Sara Sothern (1895\u20131994), were United States citizens, both originally from Arkansas City, Kansas.\nThey had moved to London in 1929 and opened an art gallery on Bond Street; their first child, a son named Howard (died 2020), was born the same year.\nThe family lived in London during Taylor's childhood. Their social circle included artists such as Augustus John and Laura Knight and politicians such as Colonel Victor Cazalet. Cazalet was Taylor's unofficial godfather and an important influence in her early life. She was enrolled in Byron House School, a Montessori school in Highgate and was raised according to the teachings of Christian Science, the religion of her mother and Cazalet.\nIn early 1939, the Taylors decided to return to the United States due to fear of impending war in Europe. United States ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy contacted her father, urging him to return to the US with his family. Sara and the children left first in April 1939 aboard the ocean liner SS \"Manhattan\" and moved in with Taylor's maternal grandfather in Pasadena, California. Francis stayed behind to close the London gallery and joined them in December. In early 1940, he opened a new gallery in Los Angeles. After briefly living in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, with the Chapman family, the Taylor family settled in Beverly Hills, California, where the two children were enrolled in Hawthorne School.\nActing career.\n1941\u20131949: Early roles and teenage stardom.\nIn California, Taylor's mother was frequently told that her daughter should audition for films. Taylor's eyes in particular drew attention; they were blue, to the extent of appearing violet, and were rimmed by dark double eyelashes caused by a genetic mutation. Sara was initially opposed to Taylor appearing in films, but after the outbreak of war in Europe made return there unlikely, she began to view the film industry as a way of assimilating to American society. Francis Taylor's Beverly Hills gallery had gained clients from the film industry soon after opening, helped by the endorsement of gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, a friend of the Cazalets. Through a client and a school friend's father, Taylor auditioned for both Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in early 1941. Both studios offered Taylor contracts, and Sara Taylor chose to accept Universal's offer.\nTaylor began her contract in April 1941 and was cast in a small role in \"There's One Born Every Minute\" (1942). She did not receive other roles, and her contract was terminated after a year. Universal's casting director explained her dislike of Taylor, stating that \"the kid has nothing ... her eyes are too old, she doesn't have the face of a child\". Biographer Alexander Walker agrees that Taylor looked different from the child stars of the era, such as Shirley Temple and Judy Garland. Taylor later said that, \"apparently, I used to frighten grown ups, because I was totally direct\". Taylor received another opportunity in late 1942, when her father's acquaintance, MGM producer Samuel Marx, arranged for her to audition for a minor role in \"Lassie Come Home\" (1943), which required a child actress with an English accent. After a trial contract of three months, she was given a standard seven-year contract in January 1943. Following \"Lassie\", she appeared in minor uncredited roles in two other films set in England \u2013 \"Jane Eyre\" (1943) playing Helen Burns, and \"The White Cliffs of Dover\" (1944).\nTaylor was cast in her first starring role at the age of 12, when she was chosen to play a girl who wants to compete as a jockey in the exclusively male Grand National in \"National Velvet\". She later called it \"the most exciting film\" of her career. Since 1937, MGM had been looking for a suitable actress with a British accent and the ability to ride horses. They decided on Taylor at the recommendation of \"White Cliffs\" director Clarence Brown, who knew she had the necessary skills. At that time Taylor was deemed too short for the role, so filming was delayed several months in order for her to grow an inch or two. In the interim Taylor spent her time practicing her horseback riding. In MGM's effort developing Taylor into a film star, they required her to wear braces to straighten her teeth, and had two of her baby teeth pulled out. The studio also wanted to dye her hair, change the shape of her eyebrows, and proposed that she use the screen name \"Virginia\", but Taylor and her parents refused.\n\"National Velvet\" became a box-office success upon its release on Christmas 1944. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" stated that \"her whole manner in this picture is one of refreshing grace\", while James Agee of \"The Nation\" wrote that she \"is rapturously beautiful... I hardly know or care whether she can act or not.\"\nTaylor later stated that her childhood ended when she became a star, as MGM started to control every aspect of her life. She described the studio as a \"big extended factory\", where she was required to adhere to a strict daily schedule. Her days were spent attending school, and filming at the studio lot. In the evenings, Taylor took dancing and singing classes, and practiced the following day's scenes. Following the success of \"National Velvet\", MGM gave Taylor a new seven-year contract with a weekly salary of $750. They cast her in a minor role in the third film of the Lassie series, \"Courage of Lassie\" (1946). MGM also published a book of Taylor's writings about her pet chipmunk, \"Nibbles and Me\" (1946), and had paper dolls and coloring books made in her likeness.\nWhen Taylor turned 15 in 1947, MGM began to cultivate a more mature public image for her by organizing photo shoots and interviews that portrayed her as a \"normal\" teenager attending parties and going on dates. Film magazines and gossip columnists also began comparing her to older actresses such as Ava Gardner and Lana Turner. \"Life\" called her \"Hollywood's most accomplished junior actress\" for her two film roles that year. In the critically panned \"Cynthia\" (1947), Taylor portrayed a frail girl who defies her over-protective parents to go to the prom; in the period film \"Life with Father\" (1947), opposite William Powell and Irene Dunne, she portrayed the love interest of a stockbroker's son.\nThey were followed by supporting roles as a teenaged \"man-stealer\" who seduces her peer's date to a high school dance in the musical \"A Date with Judy\" (1948), and as a bride in the romantic comedy \"Julia Misbehaves\" (1948). This became a commercial success, grossing over $4 million in the box office. Taylor's last adolescent role was as Amy March in Mervyn LeRoy's \"Little Women\" (1949), a box-office success. The same year, \"Time\" featured Taylor on its cover, and called her the leader among Hollywood's next generation of stars, \"a jewel of great price, a true sapphire\".\n1950\u20131951: Transition to adult roles.\nTaylor made the transition to adult roles when she turned 18 in 1950. In her first mature role, the thriller \"Conspirator\" (1949), she plays a woman who begins to suspect that her husband is a Soviet spy. Taylor had been only 16 at the time of its filming, but its release was delayed until March 1950, as MGM disliked it and feared it could cause diplomatic problems. Taylor's second film of 1950 was the comedy \"The Big Hangover\" (1950), co-starring Van Johnson. It was released in May. That same month, Taylor married hotel-chain heir Conrad \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr. in a highly publicized ceremony. The event was organized by MGM, and used as part of the publicity campaign for Taylor's next film, Vincente Minnelli's comedy \"Father of the Bride\" (1950), in which she appeared opposite Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett as a bride preparing for her wedding. The film became a box-office success upon its release in June, grossing $6 million worldwide ($ in 2024 dollars ), and was followed by a successful sequel, \"Father's Little Dividend\" (1951), ten months later.\nTaylor's next film release, George Stevens' \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951), marked a departure from her earlier films. According to Taylor, it was the first film in which she had been asked to act, instead of simply being herself, and it brought her critical acclaim for the first time since \"National Velvet\". Based on Theodore Dreiser's novel \"An American Tragedy\" (1925), it featured Taylor as a spoiled socialite who comes between a poor factory worker (Montgomery Clift) and his pregnant girlfriend (Shelley Winters). Stevens cast Taylor as she was \"the only one ... who could create this illusion\" of being \"not so much a real girl as the girl on the candy-box cover, the beautiful girl in the yellow Cadillac convertible that every American boy sometime or other thinks he can marry.\"\n\"A Place in the Sun\" was a critical and commercial success, grossing $3 million. Herb Golden of \"Variety\" said that Taylor's \"histrionics are of a quality so far beyond anything she has done previously, that Stevens' skilled hands on the reins must be credited with a minor miracle.\" A.H. Weiler of \"The New York Times\" wrote that she gives \"a shaded, tender performance, and one in which her passionate and genuine romance avoids the pathos common to young love as it sometimes comes to the screen.\"\n1952\u20131955: Continued success at MGM.\nTaylor next starred in the romantic comedy \"Love Is Better Than Ever\" (1952). According to Alexander Walker, MGM cast her in the \"B-picture\" as a reprimand for divorcing Hilton in January 1951 after only eight months of marriage, which had caused a public scandal that reflected negatively on her. After completing \"Love Is Better Than Ever\", Taylor was sent to Britain to take part in the historical epic \"Ivanhoe\" (1952), which was one of the most expensive projects in the studio's history. She was not happy about the project, finding the story superficial and her role as Rebecca too small. Regardless, \"Ivanhoe\" became one of MGM's biggest commercial successes, earning $11 million in worldwide rentals.\nTaylor's last film made under her old contract with MGM was \"The Girl Who Had Everything\" (1953), a remake of the pre-code drama \"A Free Soul\" (1931). Despite her grievances with the studio, Taylor signed a new seven-year contract with MGM in the summer of 1952. Although she wanted more interesting roles, the decisive factor in continuing with the studio was her financial need; she had recently married British actor Michael Wilding, and was pregnant with her first child. In addition to granting her a weekly salary of $4,700 ($ in 2024 dollars ), MGM agreed to give the couple a loan for a house, and signed her husband for a three-year contract. Due to her financial dependency, the studio now had even more control over her than previously.\nTaylor's first two films made under her new contract were released ten days apart in early 1954. The first was \"Rhapsody\", a romantic film starring her as a woman caught in a love triangle with two musicians. The second was \"Elephant Walk\", a drama in which she played a British woman struggling to adapt to life on her husband's tea plantation in Ceylon. She had been loaned to Paramount Pictures for the film after its original star, Vivien Leigh, fell ill. In the fall, Taylor starred in two more film releases. \"Beau Brummell\" was a Regency era period film, another project in which she was cast against her will. Taylor disliked historical films in general, as their elaborate costumes and makeup required her to wake up earlier than usual to prepare. She later said that she gave one of the worst performances of her career in \"Beau Brummell\". The second film was Richard Brooks' \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\", based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story. Although she had wanted to be cast in \"The Barefoot Contessa\" (1954) instead, Taylor liked the Brooks film and later stated that it \"convinced me I wanted to be an actress instead of yawning my way through parts.\" While \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" was not as profitable as many other MGM films, it garnered positive reviews. Taylor became pregnant again during the production, and had to agree to add another year to her contract to make up for the period spent on maternity leave.\n1956\u20131960: Critical acclaim.\nBy the mid-1950s, the American film industry was beginning to face serious competition from television, which resulted in studios producing fewer films, and focusing instead on their quality. The change benefited Taylor, who finally found more challenging roles after several years of career disappointments. After lobbying director George Stevens, she won the female lead role in \"Giant\" (1956), an epic drama about a ranching dynasty, which co-starred Rock Hudson and James Dean. Its filming in Marfa, Texas, was a difficult experience for Taylor, as she clashed with Stevens, who wanted to break her will to make her easier to direct, and was often ill, resulting in delays. To further complicate the production, Dean died in a car accident only days after completing filming; the grieving Taylor still had to film reaction shots to their joint scenes. When \"Giant\" was released a year later, it became a box-office success, and was widely praised by critics. Although not nominated for an Academy Award like her co-stars, Taylor garnered positive reviews for her performance, with \"Variety\" calling it \"surprisingly clever\", and \"The Manchester Guardian\" lauding her acting as \"an astonishing revelation of unsuspected gifts.\" It named her one of the film's strongest assets.\nMGM reunited Taylor with Montgomery Clift in \"Raintree County\" (1957), a Civil War drama which it hoped would replicate the success of \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939). Taylor found her role as a mentally disturbed Southern belle fascinating, but overall disliked the film. Although the film failed to become the type of success MGM had planned, Taylor was nominated for the first time for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\nTaylor considered her next performance as Maggie the Cat in the screen adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958) a career \"high point.\" But it coincided with one of the most difficult periods in her personal life. After completing \"Raintree County\", she had divorced Wilding and married producer Mike Todd. She had completed only two weeks of filming in March 1958, when Todd was killed in a plane crash. Although she was devastated, pressure from the studio and the knowledge that Todd had large debts led Taylor to return to work only three weeks later. She later said that \"in a way ... [she] became Maggie\", and that acting \"was the only time I could function\" in the weeks after Todd's death.\nDuring the production, Taylor's personal life drew more attention when she began an affair with singer Eddie Fisher, whose marriage to actress Debbie Reynolds had been idealized by the media as the union of \"America's sweethearts.\" The affair \u2013 and Fisher's subsequent divorce \u2013 changed Taylor's public image from a grieving widow to a \"homewrecker\". MGM used the scandal to its advantage by featuring an image of Taylor posing on a bed in a slip in the film's promotional posters. \"Cat\" grossed $10 million in American cinemas alone, and made Taylor the year's second-most profitable star. She received positive reviews for her performance, with Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" calling her \"terrific\", and \"Variety\" praising her for \"a well-accented, perceptive interpretation.\" Taylor was nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA.\nTaylor's next film, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" (1959), was another Tennessee Williams adaptation, with a screenplay by Gore Vidal and also starring Montgomery Clift and Katharine Hepburn. The independent production earned Taylor $500,000 for playing the role of a severely traumatized patient in a mental institution. Although the film was a drama about mental illness, childhood traumas, and homosexuality, it was again promoted with Taylor's sex appeal; both its trailer and poster featured her in a white swimsuit. The strategy worked, as the film was a financial success. Taylor received her third Academy Award nomination and her first Golden Globe for Best Actress for her performance.\nBy 1959, Taylor owed one more film for MGM, which it decided should be \"BUtterfield 8\" (1960), a drama about a high-class call girl, in an adaptation of a John O'Hara 1935 novel of the same name. The studio correctly calculated that Taylor's public image would make it easy for audiences to associate her with the role. She hated the film for the same reason, but had no choice in the matter, although the studio agreed to her demands of filming in New York and casting Eddie Fisher in a sympathetic role. As predicted, \"BUtterfield 8\" was a major commercial success, grossing $18 million in world rentals. Crowther wrote that Taylor \"looks like a million dollars, in mink or in neglig\u00e9e\", while \"Variety\" stated that she gives \"a torrid, stinging portrayal with one or two brilliantly executed passages within.\" Taylor won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n1961\u20131967: \"Cleopatra\" and other collaborations with Richard Burton.\nAfter completing her MGM contract, Taylor starred in 20th Century-Fox's \"Cleopatra\" (1963). According to film historian Alexander Doty, this historical epic made her more famous than ever before. She became the first movie star to be paid $1 million for a role; Fox also granted her 10% of the film's gross profits, as well as shooting the film in Todd-AO, a widescreen format for which she had inherited the rights from Mike Todd. The film's production \u2013 characterized by costly sets and costumes, constant delays, and a scandal caused by Taylor's extramarital affair with her co-star Richard Burton \u2013 was closely followed by the media, with \"Life\" proclaiming it the \"Most Talked About Movie Ever Made.\" Filming began in England in 1960, but had to be halted several times because of bad weather and Taylor's ill health. In March 1961, she developed nearly fatal pneumonia, which necessitated a tracheotomy; one news agency erroneously reported that she had died. Once she had recovered, Fox discarded the already filmed material, and moved the production to Rome, changing its director to Joseph Mankiewicz, and the actor playing Mark Antony to Burton. Filming was finally completed in July 1962. The film's final cost was $62 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024), making it the most expensive film made up to that point.\n\"Cleopatra\" became the biggest box-office success of 1963 in the United States; the film grossed $15.7 million at the box office (equivalent to $ million in 2024). Regardless, it took several years for the film to earn back its production costs, which drove Fox near to bankruptcy. The studio publicly blamed Taylor for the production's troubles and unsuccessfully sued Burton and Taylor for allegedly damaging the film's commercial prospects with their behavior. The film's reviews were mixed to negative, with critics finding Taylor overweight and her voice too thin, and unfavorably comparing her with her classically trained British co-stars. In retrospect, Taylor called \"Cleopatra\" a \"low point\" in her career, and said that the studio had cut out the scenes which she felt provided the \"core of the characterization.\"\nTaylor intended to follow \"Cleopatra\" by headlining an all-star cast in Fox's black comedy \"What a Way to Go!\" (1964), but negotiations fell through, and Shirley MacLaine was cast instead. In the meantime, film producers were eager to profit from the scandal surrounding Taylor and Burton, and they next starred together in Anthony Asquith's \"The V.I.P.s\" (1963), which mirrored the headlines about them. Taylor played a famous model attempting to leave her husband for a lover, and Burton her estranged millionaire husband. Released soon after \"Cleopatra\", it became a box-office success. Taylor was also paid $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in 2024) to appear in a CBS television special, \"Elizabeth Taylor in London\", in which she visited the city's landmarks and recited passages from the works of famous British writers.\nAfter completing \"The V.I.P.s\", Taylor took a two-year hiatus from films, during which she and Burton divorced their spouses and married each other. The supercouple continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88 million over the next decade; Burton once stated, \"They say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations.\" Biographer Alexander Walker compared these films to \"illustrated gossip columns\", as their film roles often reflected their public personae, while film historian Alexander Doty has noted that the majority of Taylor's films during this period seemed to \"conform to, and reinforce, the image of an indulgent, raucous, immoral or amoral, and appetitive (in many senses of the word) 'Elizabeth Taylor'\". Taylor and Burton's first joint project following her hiatus was Vincente Minnelli's romantic drama \"The Sandpiper\" (1965), about an illicit love affair between a bohemian artist and a married clergyman in Big Sur, California. Its reviews were largely negative, but it grossed a successful $14 million in the box office (equivalent to $ million in 2024).\nTheir next project, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966), an adaptation of a play of the same name by Edward Albee, featured the most critically acclaimed performance of Taylor's career. She and Burton starred as Martha and George, a middle-aged couple going through a marital crisis. In order to convincingly play 50-year-old Martha, Taylor gained weight, wore a wig, and used makeup to make herself look older and tired \u2013 in stark contrast to her public image as a glamorous film star. At Taylor's suggestion, theatre director Mike Nichols was hired to direct the project, despite his lack of experience with film. The production differed from anything she had done previously, as Nichols wanted to thoroughly rehearse the play before beginning filming. \"Woolf\" was considered ground-breaking for its adult themes and uncensored language, and opened to \"glorious\" reviews. \"Variety\" wrote that Taylor's \"characterization is at once sensual, spiteful, cynical, pitiable, loathsome, lustful, and tender.\" Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New York Times\" stated that she \"does the best work of her career, sustained and urgent.\" The film also became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year. Taylor received her second Academy Award, and BAFTA, National Board of Review, and New York City Film Critics Circle awards for her performance.\nIn 1966, Taylor and Burton performed \"Doctor Faustus\" for a week in Oxford to benefit the Oxford University Dramatic Society; he starred and she appeared in her first stage role as Helen of Troy, a part which required no speaking. Although it received generally negative reviews, Burton produced it as a film, \"Doctor Faustus\" (1967), with the same cast. It was also panned by critics and grossed only $600,000 in the box office (equivalent to $ million in 2024). Taylor and Burton's next project, Franco Zeffirelli's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1967), which they also co-produced, was more successful. It posed another challenge for Taylor, as she was the only actor in the project with no previous experience of performing Shakespeare; Zeffirelli later stated that this made her performance interesting, as she \"invented the part from scratch.\" Critics found the play to be fitting material for the couple, and the film became a box-office success by grossing $12 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024).\nTaylor's third film released in 1967, John Huston's \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\", was her first without Burton since \"Cleopatra\". Based on a novel of the same name by Carson McCullers, it was a drama about a repressed gay military officer and his unfaithful wife. It was originally slated to co-star Taylor's old friend Montgomery Clift, whose career had been in decline for several years owing to his substance abuse problems. Determined to secure his involvement in the project, Taylor even offered to pay for his insurance. But Clift died from a heart attack before filming began; he was replaced in the role by Marlon Brando. \"Reflections\" was a critical and commercial failure at the time of its release. Taylor and Burton's last film of the year was the adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, \"The Comedians\", which received mixed reviews and was a box-office disappointment.\n1968\u20131979: Career decline.\nTaylor's career was in decline by the late 1960s. She had gained weight, was in her late 30s and did not fit in with New Hollywood stars such as Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. After several years of nearly constant media attention, the public was tiring of Burton and her, and criticized their jet set lifestyle. In 1968, Taylor starred in two films directed by Joseph Losey \u2013 \"Boom!\" and \"Secret Ceremony\" \u2013 both of which were critical and commercial failures. The former, based on Tennessee Williams' \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\", features her as an ageing, serial-marrying millionaire, and Burton as a younger man who turns up on the Mediterranean island on which she has retired. \"Secret Ceremony\" is a psychological drama that also stars Mia Farrow and Robert Mitchum. Taylor's third film with George Stevens, \"The Only Game in Town\" (1970), in which she played a Las Vegas showgirl who has an affair with a compulsive gambler, played by Warren Beatty, was unsuccessful.\nThe three 1972 films in which Taylor acted were somewhat more successful. \"X Y &amp; Zee\", which portrayed Michael Caine and her as a troubled married couple, won her the David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress. She appeared with Burton in the adaptation of Dylan Thomas's \"Under Milk Wood\"; although her role was small, the producers decided to give her top-billing to profit from her fame. Her third film role that year was playing a blonde diner waitress in Peter Ustinov's \"Faust\" parody \"Hammersmith Is Out\", her tenth collaboration with Burton. Although it was overall not successful, Taylor received some good reviews, with Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" writing that she has \"a certain vulgar, ratty charm\", and Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" saying, \"The spectacle of Elizabeth Taylor growing older and more beautiful continues to amaze the population.\" Her performance won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival.\nTaylor and Burton's last film together was the Harlech Television film \"Divorce His, Divorce Hers\" (1973), fittingly named as they divorced the following year. Her other films released in 1973 were the British thriller \"Night Watch\" (1973) and the American drama \"Ash Wednesday\" (1973). For the latter, in which she starred as a woman who undergoes multiple plastic surgeries in an attempt to save her marriage, she received a Golden Globe nomination. Her only film released in 1974, the Italian Muriel Spark adaptation \"The Driver's Seat\" (1974), was a failure.\nTaylor took fewer roles after the mid-1970s, and focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, Republican politician John Warner, a US senator. In 1976, she participated in the Soviet-American fantasy film \"The Blue Bird\" (1976), a critical and box-office failure, and had a small role in the television film \"Victory at Entebbe\" (1976). In 1977, she sang in the critically panned film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical \"A Little Night Music\" (1977).\n1980\u20132007: Stage and television roles; retirement.\nAfter a period of semi-retirement from films, Taylor starred in \"The Mirror Crack'd\" (1980), adapted from an Agatha Christie mystery novel and featuring an ensemble cast of actors from the studio era, such as Angela Lansbury, Kim Novak, Rock Hudson, and Tony Curtis. Wanting to challenge herself, she took on her first substantial stage role, playing Regina Giddens in a Broadway production of Lillian Hellman's \"The Little Foxes\". Instead of portraying Giddens in negative light, as had often been the case in previous productions, Taylor's idea was to show her as a victim of circumstance, explaining, \"She's a killer, but she's saying, 'Sorry fellas, you put me in this position'.\"\nThe production premiered in May 1981, and had a sold-out six-month run despite mixed reviews. Frank Rich of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Taylor's performance as \"Regina Giddens, that malignant Southern bitch-goddess ... begins gingerly, soon gathers steam, and then explodes into a black and thunderous storm that may just knock you out of your seat\", while Dan Sullivan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated, \"Taylor presents a possible Regina Giddens, as seen through the persona of Elizabeth Taylor. There's some acting in it, as well as some personal display.\" She appeared as evil socialite Helena Cassadine in the day-time soap opera \"General Hospital\" in November 1981. The following year, she continued performing \"The Little Foxes\" in London's West End, but received largely negative reviews from the British press.\nEncouraged by the success of \"The Little Foxes\", Taylor and producer Zev Buffman founded the Elizabeth Taylor Repertory Company. Its first and only production was a revival of No\u00ebl Coward's comedy \"Private Lives\", starring Taylor and Burton. It premiered in Boston in early 1983, and although commercially successful, received generally negative reviews, with critics noting that both stars were in noticeably poor health \u2013 Taylor admitted herself to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center after the play's run ended, and Burton died the following year. After the failure of \"Private Lives\", Taylor dissolved her theatre company. Her only other project that year was the television film \"Between Friends\".\nFrom the mid-1980s, Taylor acted mostly in television productions. She made cameos in the soap operas \"Hotel\" and \"All My Children\" in 1984, and played a brothel keeper in the historical mini-series \"North and South\" in 1985. She also starred in several television films, playing gossip columnist Louella Parsons in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985), a fading movie star in the drama \"There Must Be a Pony\" (1986), and a character based on Poker Alice in the eponymous Western (1987). She re-united with director Franco Zeffirelli to appear in his French-Italian biopic \"Young Toscanini\" (1988), and had the last starring role of her career in a television adaptation of \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1989), her fourth Tennessee Williams play. During this time, she also began receiving honorary awards for her career \u2013 the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1985, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Chaplin Award in 1986.\nIn the 1990s, Taylor focused her time on HIV/AIDS activism. Her few acting roles included characters in the animated series \"Captain Planet and the Planeteers\" (1992) and \"The Simpsons\" (1992, 1993), and cameos in four CBS series \u2013 \"The Nanny\", \"Can't Hurry Love\", \"Murphy Brown\", and \"High Society\" \u2013 all airing on February 26, 1996, to promote her new fragrance.\nHer last theatrically released film was the critically panned, but commercially successful, \"The Flintstones\" (1994), in which she played Pearl Slaghoople in a brief supporting role. Taylor received American and British honors for her career: the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1993, the Screen Actors Guild honorary award in 1997, and a BAFTA Fellowship in 1999. In 2000, she was appointed a Dame Commander in the chivalric Order of the British Empire in the millennium New Year Honours List by Queen Elizabeth II. After supporting roles in the television film \"These Old Broads\" (2001) and in the animated sitcom \"God, the Devil and Bob\" (2001), Taylor announced that she was retiring from acting to devote her time to philanthropy. She gave one last public performance in 2007, when she performed the play \"Love Letters\" at an AIDS benefit at the Paramount Studios with James Earl Jones.\nOther ventures.\nHIV/AIDS activism.\nTaylor was one of the first celebrities to participate in HIV/AIDS activism and helped to raise more than $270 million for the cause since the mid-1980s. She began her philanthropic work after becoming frustrated with the fact that very little was being done to combat the disease despite the media attention. She later explained for \"Vanity Fair\" that she \"decided that with my name, I could open certain doors, that I was a commodity in myself \u2013 and I'm not talking as an actress. I could take the fame I'd resented and tried to get away from for so many years \u2013 but you can never get away from it \u2013 and use it to do some good. I wanted to retire, but the tabloids wouldn't let me. So, I thought: If you're going to screw me over, I'll use you.\"\nTaylor began her philanthropic efforts in 1984, helping to organize and by hosting the first AIDS fundraiser to benefit the AIDS Project Los Angeles. In August 1985, she and Michael Gottlieb founded the National AIDS Research Foundation after her friend and former co-star Rock Hudson announced that he was dying of the disease. The following month, the foundation merged with Mathilde Krim's AIDS foundation to form the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR). As amfAR's focus is on research funding, Taylor founded the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) in 1991 to raise awareness and to provide support services for people with HIV/AIDS, paying for its overhead costs herself. Since her death, her estate has continued to fund ETAF's work, and donates 25% of royalties from the use of her image and likeness to the foundation. In addition to her work for people affected by HIV/AIDS in the United States, Taylor was instrumental in expanding amfAR's operations to other countries; ETAF also operates internationally.\nTaylor testified before the Senate and House for the Ryan White Care Act in 1986, 1990, and 1992. She persuaded President Ronald Reagan to acknowledge the disease for the first time in a speech in 1987, and publicly criticized presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton for lack of interest in combatting the disease. Taylor also founded the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center to offer free HIV/AIDS testing and care at the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, DC, and the Elizabeth Taylor Endowment Fund for the UCLA Clinical AIDS Research and Education Center in Los Angeles. In 2015, Taylor's business partner Kathy Ireland claimed that Taylor ran an illegal \"underground network\" that distributed medications to Americans suffering from HIV/AIDS during the 1980s, when the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved them. The claim was challenged by several people, including amfAR's former vice-president for development and external affairs, Taylor's former publicist, and activists who were involved in Project Inform in the 1980s and 1990s.\nTaylor was honored with several awards for her philanthropic work. She was made a Knight of the French Legion of Honour in 1987, and received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1993, the Screen Actors' Guild Lifetime Achievement Award for Humanitarian service in 1997, the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2000, and the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001.\nFragrance and jewelry brands.\nTaylor created a collection of fragrances whose unprecedented success helped establish the trend of celebrity-branded perfumes in later years. In collaboration with Elizabeth Arden, Inc., she began by launching two best-selling perfumes \u2013 Passion in 1987, and White Diamonds in 1991. Taylor personally supervised the creation and production of each of the 11 fragrances marketed in her name. According to biographers Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger, she earned more money through the fragrance collection than during her entire acting career, and upon her death, the British newspaper \"The Guardian\" estimated that the majority of her estimated $600 million-$1 billion estate consisted of revenue from fragrances. In 2005, Taylor also founded a jewelry company, House of Taylor, in collaboration with Kathy Ireland and Jack and Monty Abramov.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages, relationships, and children.\nThroughout her adult years, Taylor's personal life, especially her eight marriages (two to the same man), drew a large amount of media attention and public disapproval. According to biographer Alexander Walker, \"Whether she liked it or not ... marriage is the matrix of the myth that began surrounding Elizabeth Taylor from [when she was sixteen].\" In 1948, MGM arranged for her to date American football champion Glenn Davis and she announced plans for them to marry once he returned from Korea. The following year, Taylor was briefly engaged to William Pawley Jr., son of US ambassador William D. Pawley. Film tycoon Howard Hughes also wanted to marry her, and offered to pay her parents a six-figure sum of money if she were to become his wife. Taylor declined the offer, but was otherwise eager to marry young, as her \"rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs\" made her believe that \"love was synonymous with marriage.\" Taylor later described herself as being \"emotionally immature\" during this time due to her sheltered childhood, and believed that she could gain independence from her parents and MGM through marriage.\nTaylor was 18 years old when she married Conrad \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr., heir to the Hilton Hotels chain, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills on May 6, 1950. MGM organized the large and expensive wedding, which became a major media event. In the weeks after their wedding, Taylor realized that she had made a mistake; not only did she and Hilton have few interests in common, but he was also abusive and a heavy drinker. Taylor suffered a miscarriage during one of his violent outbursts. She announced their separation on December 14, 1950, and was granted a divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty on January 29, 1951, eight months after their wedding.\nTaylor married her second husband, British actor Michael Wilding \u2013 a man 20 years her senior \u2013 in a low-key ceremony at Caxton Hall in London on February 21, 1952. She had first met him in 1948 while filming \"The Conspirator\" in England, and their relationship began when she returned to film \"Ivanhoe\" in 1951. Taylor found their age gap appealing. She wanted \"the calm and quiet and security of friendship\" from their relationship; he hoped that the marriage would aid his career in Hollywood. They had two sons: Michael Howard (born January 6, 1953) and Christopher Edward (born February 27, 1955; Taylor's 23rd birthday). As Taylor grew older and more confident in herself, she began to drift apart from Wilding, whose failing career was also a source of marital strife. When she was away filming \"Giant\" in 1955, gossip magazine \"Confidential\" caused a scandal by claiming that he had entertained strippers at their home. Taylor and Wilding announced their separation on July 18, 1956, and were divorced on January 26, 1957.\nTaylor was three months pregnant when she married her third husband, theatre and film producer Mike Todd, in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, on February 2, 1957. They had one daughter, Elizabeth \"Liza\" Frances (born August 6, 1957). Todd, known for publicity stunts, encouraged the media attention to their marriage; for example, in June 1957, he threw a birthday party at Madison Square Garden, which was attended by 18,000 guests and broadcast on CBS. His death in a plane crash on March 22, 1958, left Taylor devastated. She was comforted by a friend of Todd's and hers, singer Eddie Fisher, with whom she soon began an affair. Fisher was still married to actress Debbie Reynolds. The affair resulted in a public scandal, with Taylor being branded a \"homewrecker.\" Taylor and Fisher were married at the Temple Beth Sholom in Las Vegas on May 12, 1959; she later stated that she married him only due to her grief. Taylor and Reynolds would reconcile in the 1960s.\nWhile filming \"Cleopatra\" in Italy in 1962, Taylor began an affair with her co-star, Welsh actor Richard Burton, although Burton was also married. Rumors about the affair began to circulate in the press, and were confirmed by a paparazzi shot of them on a yacht in Ischia. According to sociologist Ellis Cashmore, the publication of the photograph was a \"turning point\", beginning a new era in which it became difficult for celebrities to keep their personal lives separate from their public images. The scandal caused Taylor and Burton to be condemned for \"erotic vagrancy\" by the Vatican, with calls also in the US Congress to bar them from re-entering the country. Taylor was granted a divorce from Fisher on March 5, 1964, in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, and married Burton 10 days later in a private ceremony at the Ritz-Carlton Montreal. Burton subsequently adopted Liza Todd and Maria McKeown (born 1961), a German orphan whose adoption process Taylor had begun while married to Fisher.\nDubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the media, Taylor and Burton starred together in 11 films, and led a jet-set lifestyle, spending millions on \"furs, diamonds, paintings, designer clothes, travel, food, liquor, a yacht, and a jet.\" Sociologist Karen Sternheimer states that they \"became a cottage industry of speculation about their alleged life of excess. From reports of massive spending [...] affairs, and even an open marriage, the couple came to represent a new era of 'gotcha' celebrity coverage, where the more personal the story, the better.\" They divorced for the first time in June 1974, but reconciled, and remarried in Kasane, Botswana, on 10 October 1975. The second marriage lasted less than a year, ending in divorce in July 1976. Taylor and Burton's relationship was often referred to as the \"marriage of the century\" by the media, and she later stated, \"After Richard, the men in my life were just there to hold the coat, to open the door. All the men after Richard were really just company.\" Soon after her final divorce from Burton, Taylor met her sixth husband, John Warner, a Republican politician from Virginia. They were married on 4 December 1976, after which Taylor concentrated on working for his electoral campaign. Once Warner had been elected to the Senate, she started to find her life as a politician's wife in Washington, D.C. boring and lonely, becoming depressed, gaining weight, and becoming increasingly addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol. Taylor and Warner separated in December 1981, and divorced on 5 November 1982.\nAfter the divorce from Warner, Taylor dated actors Anthony Geary and George Hamilton, and was engaged to Mexican lawyer Victor Luna in 1983\u20131984, and New York businessman Dennis Stein in 1985. She met her seventh and last husband, construction worker Larry Fortensky, at the Betty Ford Center in 1988. They were married at the Neverland Ranch of her close friend Michael Jackson on October 6, 1991. The wedding was again subject to intense media attention, with one photographer parachuting to the ranch and Taylor selling the wedding pictures to \"People\" for $1 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024), which she used to start her AIDS foundation. Taylor and Fortensky divorced on October 31, 1996, but remained in contact for life. She attributed the split to her painful hip operations and his obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the winter of 1999, Fortensky underwent brain surgery after falling off a balcony and was comatose for six weeks; Taylor immediately notified the hospital she would personally guarantee his medical expenses. At the end of 2010, she wrote him a letter that read: \"You\u2019re a part of my life that cannot be carved out nor do I ever wish it to be.\" Taylor's last phone call with Fortensky was on February 7, 2011, one day before she checked into the hospital for what turned out to be her final stay. He told her she would outlive him. Although they had been divorced for almost 15 years, Taylor left Fortensky $825,000 in her will.\nIn the last years of her life, she had a platonic friendship with the actor Colin Farrell. On the phone, they often talked about the topic of insomnia and how to deal with it.\nJudaism.\nTaylor was raised as a Christian Scientist, and converted to Judaism in 1959. Although two of her husbands \u2013 Mike Todd and Eddie Fisher \u2013 were Jewish, Taylor stated that she did not convert because of them, and had wanted to do so \"for a long time\", and that there was \"comfort and dignity and hope for me in this ancient religion that [has] survived for four thousand years... I feel as if I have been a Jew all my life.\" Walker believed that Taylor was influenced in her decision by her godfather, Victor Cazalet, and her mother, who were active supporters of Zionism during her childhood.\nFollowing her conversion, Taylor became an active supporter of Jewish and Zionist causes. In 1959, she purchased $100,000 worth of Israeli bonds, which led to her films being banned by Arab countries throughout the Middle East and Africa. She was also barred from entering Egypt to film \"Cleopatra\" in 1962, but the ban was lifted two years later after the Egyptian officials deemed that the film brought positive publicity for the country. In addition to purchasing bonds, Taylor helped to raise money for organizations such as the Jewish National Fund, and sat on the board of trustees of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\nTaylor also advocated for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel, cancelled a visit to the USSR because of its condemnation of Israel due to the Six-Day War, and signed a letter protesting the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 of 1975. In 1976, she offered herself as a replacement hostage after more than 100 Israeli civilians were taken hostage in the Entebbe skyjacking. She had a small role in the television film made about the incident, \"Victory at Entebbe\" (1976), and narrated \"Genocide\" (1981), an Academy Award-winning documentary about the Holocaust.\nStyle and jewelry collection.\nTaylor is considered a fashion icon both for her film costumes and personal style. At MGM, her costumes were mostly designed by Helen Rose and Edith Head, and in the 1960s by Irene Sharaff. Her most famous costumes include a white ball gown in \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951), a Grecian dress in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958), a green A-line dress in \"Suddenly Last Summer\" (1959), and a slip and a fur coat in \"BUtterfield 8\" (1960). Her look in \"Cleopatra\" (1963) started a trend for \"cat-eye\" makeup done with black eyeliner.\nTaylor collected jewelry through her life, and owned the Krupp Diamond, the Taylor-Burton Diamond, and the La Peregrina Pearl, all three of which were gifts from husband Richard Burton. She also published a book about her collection, \"My Love Affair with Jewelry\", in 2002. Taylor helped to popularise the work of fashion designers Valentino Garavani and Halston. She received a Lifetime of Glamour Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) in 1997. After her death, her jewelry and fashion collections were auctioned by Christie's to benefit her AIDS foundation, ETAF. The jewelry sold for a record-breaking sum of $156.8 million, and the clothes and accessories for a further $5.5 million.\nIllness and death.\nTaylor struggled with health problems for most of her life. She was born with scoliosis and broke her back while filming \"National Velvet\" in 1944. The fracture went undetected for several years, although it caused her chronic back problems. In 1956, she underwent an operation in which some of her spinal discs were removed and replaced with donated bone. Taylor was also prone to other illnesses and injuries, which often necessitated surgery; in 1961, she survived a near-fatal bout of pneumonia that required a tracheotomy. She was treated for the pneumonia with bacteriophage.\nIn 1968 she underwent an emergency hysterectomy, which exacerbated her back problems and contributed to hip problems. Perhaps self-medicating, she was addicted to alcohol and prescription pain killers and tranquilizers. She was treated at the Betty Ford Center for seven weeks from December 1983 to January 1984, becoming the first celebrity to openly admit herself to the clinic. She relapsed later in the decade and entered rehabilitation again in 1988. Taylor had gained weight by the 1970s, especially after her marriage to Senator John Warner, and published a diet book about her experiences, \"Elizabeth Takes Off\" (1988). Taylor was a heavy smoker until she experienced a severe bout of pneumonia in 1990. According to her ex-cousin-in-law Sandra Souza, Taylor was still smoking menthol cigarettes in 1995.\nTaylor's health increasingly declined during the last two decades of her life and she rarely attended public events after 1996. Taylor had serious bouts of pneumonia in 1990 and 2000, two hip replacement surgeries in the mid-1990s, a surgery for a benign brain tumor in 1997, and successful treatment for skin cancer in 2002. She used a wheelchair due to her back problems and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2004. She died of the illness aged 79 on March 23, 2011, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, six weeks after being hospitalized. Her funeral took place the following day at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. The service was a private Jewish ceremony presided by Rabbi Jerome Cutler. At Taylor's request, the ceremony began 15 minutes behind schedule, as, according to her representative, \"She even wanted to be late for her own funeral.\" She was entombed in the cemetery's Great Mausoleum.\nLos Angeles residence.\nTaylor lived at 700 Nimes Road in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles from 1982 until her death in 2011. The art photographer Catherine Opie created an eponymous photographic study of the house in 2011.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMore than anyone else I can think of, Elizabeth Taylor represents the complete movie phenomenon \u2013 what movies are as an art and an industry, and what they have meant to those of us who have grown up watching them in the dark... Like movies themselves, she's grown up with us, as we have with her. She's someone whose entire life has been played in a series of settings forever denied the fourth wall. Elizabeth Taylor is the most important character she's ever played.\n\u2014Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" in 1986\nTaylor was one of the last stars of classical Hollywood cinema and one of the first modern celebrities. During the era of the studio system, she exemplified the classic film star. She was portrayed as different from \"ordinary\" people, and her public image was carefully crafted and controlled by MGM. When the era of classical Hollywood ended in the 1960s, and paparazzi photography became a normal feature of media culture, Taylor came to define a new type of celebrity whose real private life was the focus of public interest. \"More than for any film role,\" Adam Bernstein of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"she became famous for being famous, setting a media template for later generations of entertainers, models, and all variety of semi-somebodies.\"\nRegardless of the acting awards she won during her career, Taylor's film performances were often overlooked by contemporary critics; according to film historian Jeanine Basinger, \"No actress ever had a more difficult job in getting critics to accept her onscreen as someone other than Elizabeth Taylor... Her persona ate her alive.\" Her film roles often mirrored her personal life, and many critics continue to regard her as always playing herself, rather than acting. In contrast, Mel Gussow of \"The New York Times\" stated that \"the range of [Taylor's] acting was surprisingly wide\", despite the fact that she never received any professional training. Film critic Peter Bradshaw called her \"an actress of such sexiness it was an incitement to riot \u2013 sultry and queenly at the same time\", and \"a shrewd, intelligent, intuitive acting presence in her later years.\" David Thomson stated that \"she had the range, nerve, and instinct that only Bette Davis had had before \u2013 and like Davis, Taylor was monster and empress, sweetheart and scold, idiot and wise woman.\" Five films in which she starred \u2013 \"Lassie Come Home\", \"National Velvet\", \"A Place in the Sun\", \"Giant\", and \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" \u2013 have been preserved in the National Film Registry, and the American Film Institute has named her the seventh greatest female screen legend.\nTaylor has also been discussed by journalists and scholars interested in the role of women in Western society. Camille Paglia writes that Taylor was a \"pre-feminist woman\" who \"wields the sexual power that feminism cannot explain and has tried to destroy. Through stars like Taylor, we sense the world-disordering impact of legendary women like Delilah, Salome, and Helen of Troy.\" In contrast, cultural critic M.G. Lord calls Taylor an \"accidental feminist\", stating that while she did not identify as a feminist, many of her films had feminist themes and \"introduced a broad audience to feminist ideas.\" Similarly, Ben W. Heineman Jr. and Cristine Russell write in \"The Atlantic\" that her role in \"Giant\" \"dismantled stereotypes about women and minorities.\"\nTaylor is considered a gay icon, and received widespread recognition for her HIV/AIDS activism. After her death, GLAAD issued a statement saying that she \"was an icon not only in Hollywood, but in the LGBT community, where she worked to ensure that everyone was treated with the respect and dignity we all deserve\", and Sir Nick Partridge of the Terrence Higgins Trust called her \"the first major star to publicly fight fear and prejudice towards AIDS.\" According to Paul Flynn of \"The Guardian\", she was \"a new type of gay icon, one whose position is based not on tragedy, but on her work for the LGBTQ community.\" Speaking of her charity work, former President Bill Clinton said at her death, \"Elizabeth's legacy will live on in many people around the world whose lives will be longer and better because of her work and the ongoing efforts of those she inspired.\"\nSince Taylor's death, House of Taylor, Elizabeth Taylor's estate, has preserved Taylor's legacy through content, partnerships, and products. The estate is managed by three trustees selected by Elizabeth prior to her death. They continue to be involved with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation and oversee The Elizabeth Taylor Archive. In 2022, House of Taylor released \"Elizabeth The First\", a 10-part podcast series with Imperative Entertainment and Kitty Purry Productions and narrated by Katy Perry. In December 2022, \"Elizabeth Taylor: The Grit &amp; Glamour of an Icon\" by Kate Andersen Brower, the first Elizabeth Taylor biography authorized by the estate, was released.\nIn 2019, it was announced that Rachel Weisz would portray Taylor in \"A Special Relationship\", an upcoming film about Taylor's journey from actress to activist written by Simon Beaufoy. In 2024, it was announced that Kim Kardashian would executive produce and feature in a docuseries about Taylor. Commissioned by the BBC, it's been given the working title \"Elizabeth Taylor: Rebel Superstar\".\nThe second track of the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's twelfth studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl\" (2025), is titled after Taylor. Swift had already made a reference to Taylor's relationship with Richard Burton on the single \"...Ready for It?\" from her 2017 album \"Reputation\".\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42361", "revid": "49867084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42361", "title": "On the Waterfront", "text": "1954 film by Elia Kazan\nOn the Waterfront is a 1954 American crime drama film, directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg. It stars Marlon Brando, and features Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Pat Henning and Eva Marie Saint in her film debut. The musical score was composed by Leonard Bernstein. The black-and-white film was inspired by \"Crime on the Waterfront\" by Malcolm Johnson, a series of articles published in November\u2013December 1948 in the \"New York Sun\" which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, but the screenplay by Budd Schulberg is directly based on his own original story. The film focuses on union violence and corruption among longshoremen, while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\"On the Waterfront\" was a critical and commercial success and is considered one of the greatest films ever made and is said to revolve around the subject matter of alienation at the lowest social level. It received twelve Academy Award nominations and won eight, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brando, Best Supporting Actress for Saint, and Best Director for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as the eighth-greatest American movie of all time; in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.\nIn 1989, \"On the Waterfront\" was one of the first 25 films to be deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nNew York prizefighter Terry Malloy's career was cut short when he purposely lost a fight at the request of mob boss Johnny Friendly. Terry now works for Friendly's labor union as a longshoreman while his older, more educated brother Charley is Friendly's right-hand man. Terry is coerced into luring fellow worker Joey Doyle onto a rooftop, where he believes Friendly's henchmen want to talk Joey out of testifying to the Waterfront Crime Commission. When they instead murder Joey by throwing him off the roof, Terry confronts Friendly, but is threatened and bribed into acquiescence.\nJoey's sister Edie and priest Father Barry try to inspire the dockworkers to stand up to Friendly. Terry attends the meeting as a snitch, but when it is violently broken up by Friendly's men, he helps Edie escape and misses Father Barry convincing one worker to testify. After the testimony, the worker is killed in a staged workplace accident.\nTerry's unwillingness to testify is softened by his growing feelings for Edie, and her and Father Barry\u2019s pursuit of justice. He confesses his role in Joey's death to both. Shocked by this, Edie distances herself from him.\nFriendly sends Charley with a job offer to keep Terry quiet. Knowing refusal will get Terry killed, Charley urges him to comply. When Terry expresses regret about throwing his best fight and blames Charley for setting up the fix, Charley hands him a gun and tells him to run. Terry finds Edie and they kiss. After hearing someone in the street, they find Charley murdered.\nDetermined to kill Friendly, Terry is convinced by Father Barry to instead testify in court. Following the hearing, Friendly loses his powerful connections and faces indictment.\nWhen he is excluded from the next hiring call at the harbor, Terry confronts Friendly together with the other workers, saying that he is proud of testifying and no longer betraying himself. After seeing Terry get beaten severely by Friendly\u2019s thugs, the longshoremen refuse to work without him and renounce Friendly, wishing to run the union \"on the up-and-up\". Encouraged by Edie and Father Barry, Terry stumbles to the warehouse. The men follow him inside and the door closes, leaving Friendly outside, ignored by the workers and shippers.\nProduction.\nScreenplay and political context.\nThe film is widely considered to be Elia Kazan's answer to those who criticized him for identifying eight Communists in the film industry before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952. One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright Arthur Miller, who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally titled \"The Hook\". Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make \"The Hook\", but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials. When Cohn asked that the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie \"pro-American\". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with Budd Schulberg. The screenwriter later recalled how he had researched the story on the docks: \"I spent two years down there. I sat in on meetings the rebels held and roamed about the waterfront bars. I saw what a shapeup was like. I would report back to Kazan on what I had seen. Kazan made many suggestions in the course of my writing.\"\nCobb's character of Johnny Friendly was partly modeled on Johnny Dio, a real-life mobster known for involvement in labor racketeering.\nCasting.\nAccording to Richard Schickel in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially declined the role of Terry Malloy, and Frank Sinatra (a native of Hoboken, where the film was being made) then had \"a handshake deal\"\u00a0\u2013 but no formally signed contract\u00a0\u2013 to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a \"more Brando-like\" actor as Terry Malloy, to persuade producer Sam Spiegel that \"an actor like Marlon Brando\" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of Actors Studio members Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterward, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had been signed for this role.\nFilming locations.\n\"On the Waterfront\" was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in Hoboken, New Jersey, including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic Our Lady of Grace, built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.\nReception.\nUpon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954. In his July 29, 1954, review, \"New York Times\" critic A. H. Weiler called the film \"an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals\".\nFilm critic of the time Pauline Kael said of the film that it succeeded in creating a complicated and meaningful figure out of the \"American lower depths.\"\nFilm showings at the time produced violent audience reactions where many theaters had to call in the police to keep order.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 99% from 111 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"With his electrifying performance in Elia Kazan's thought-provoking, expertly constructed melodrama, Marlon Brando redefined the possibilities of acting for film and helped permanently alter the cinematic landscape\". On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nGaining the Academy Award for Best Actor and being named the greatest and second-greatest film performance of all time by Aaron West of Criterion and by \"Premiere\" respectively, Brando's performance is regarded as one of the watershed moments in the history of movies. Through his portrayal of Terry Malloy, Brando popularized method acting and conclusively exemplified the power of Stanislavski-based approach in cinema. Praising Brando in 2004, director Martin Scorsese noted: \"Everything that we know about the power of great screen acting relates back to him: when you watch his work in \"On the Waterfront\" ... you're watching the purest poetry imaginable, in dynamic motion\". Brando, at the time in which he accepted the Academy Award, gave a humble acceptance speech, stating that he was \"sure [the winner] was going to be Bing [Crosby]\" for his performance in \"The Country Girl\". Kazan, the director of the film, would later write in his book, \"If there is a better performance by a man in the history of film in America, I don't know what it is.\"\nAl Pacino, recounting his own memories on first seeing \"On the Waterfront\", told \"Playboy\" in a 1979 interview that he concentrated more on the lead actor than the film itself, \"I couldn't move. I couldn't leave the theatre. I'd never seen the like of it.\" Anthony Hopkins said, \"When you see Brando in the famous cab scene in \"On the Waterfront\", it's still breathtaking.\" In a eulogy for Brando, Jack Nicholson described his display \"probably the height of any age\", and added that, \"You just couldn't take your eyes off the guy. He was spellbinding.\"\nIn a 1982 interview, Orson Welles criticized the film and its director, saying, \"Elia Kazan is a traitor. He is a man who sold to all his companions to McCarthy at the time. Then he made \"On the Waterfront\", which was a celebration of the informant.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nIn 1989, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nIn 1995, it made it on the Vatican's list of 45 important films.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nHome media.\nThe first home video release of the film was by Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment in 1982, on VHS and Beta. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the Columbia Classics line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's \"Studio Heritage Collection\", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette \"Contender: Mastering the Method\", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the Criterion Collection.\nThe 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: \"In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including \"On The Waterfront\", would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (\"Twelve Angry Men\", \"Baby Doll\") split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, \"On The Waterfront\" was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer.\"\nAdaptations.\nIn the same year that the film was released, Budd Schulberg published a novel simply entitled \"Waterfront\" based on his script. In the novel Terry Malloy dies. It is more heavily focused on the priest who stands up to the mob, and narrated in first person by him.\nIn 1984, the film script was adapted to stage by Schulberg, opening on Broadway in November. It had several technical innovations for the time, including lasers, filmlike scenic dissolves and sounds that enveloped the audience. As with Schulberg's earlier novel, the motivations of Father Barry are made more explicit, and the ending is less happy. It was revised in 1995 and lasted for only 8 performances, losing $2.6 million, a record on Broadway for a non-musical at the time.\nThe Indian films \"Baarish\" (1957), \"Kabzaa\" (1988), \"Ghulam\" (1998) and \"Sudhandhiram\" (2000) are inspired by \"On the Waterfront\".\nA 2009 British stage production was directed by Steven Berkoff, who also played Johnny Friendly, with Simon Merrells as Terry. It played at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in London, after the Nottingham Playhouse and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, a founding member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and an early fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society.\nEarly life and education.\nBarlow was born in Sublette County, Wyoming near the town of Cora, the only child of Norman Walker Barlow (1905\u20131972), a Republican state legislator, and his wife, Miriam Adeline Barlow (n\u00e9e Jenkins, later Bailey; 1905\u20131999), who married in 1929.\nBarlow's paternal ancestors were Mormon pioneers. He grew up on Bar Cross Ranch in Cora, Wyoming, a property his great-uncle founded in 1907, and attended elementary school in a one-room schoolhouse. Raised as a devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he was prohibited from watching television until the sixth grade, when his parents allowed him to \"absorb televangelists\".\nAlthough Barlow's academic record was erratic throughout his secondary education, he \"had his pick of top eastern universities... simply because he was from Wyoming, where few applications originated\". In 1969, he graduated from Wesleyan University's College of Letters. He served as Wesleyan's student body president until the administration \"tossed him into a sanitarium\" following a drug-induced attempted suicide attack in Boston, Massachusetts. After two weeks of rehabilitation, he returned to his studies. In his senior year, he became a part-time resident of New York City's East Village and immersed himself in Andy Warhol's Factory demimonde, cultivating a friendship with Rene Ricard and developing a brief addiction to heroin.\nAs he neared graduation, Barlow was admitted to Harvard Law School and was contracted to write a novel by Farrar, Straus and Giroux at the behest of his mentor, the autodidactic Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and historian Paul Horgan. Initially supported by a $5,000 or $1,000 advance from the publisher, he decided to eschew these options in favor of spending the next two years traveling around the world, including a nine-month sojourn in India, a riotous winter in a summer cottage on Long Island Sound in Connecticut, and a screenwriting foray in Los Angeles. Barlow eventually finished the novel, but it was rejected by several publishers (including Farrar, Straus and Giroux) and remains unpublished. During this period, he also \"lived beside Needle Park on New York's Upper West Side and dealt cocaine in Spanish Harlem\".\nCareer.\nGrateful Dead.\nAt age 15, Barlow became a student at the Fountain Valley School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There he met Bob Weir, who later co-founded the Grateful Dead. Weir and Barlow maintained a close friendship through the years.\nAs a frequent visitor during college to Timothy Leary's facility in Millbrook, New York, Barlow was introduced to LSD; he later claimed to have consumed the substance over 1,000 times. These transformative experiences led him to distance himself from Mormonism. He went on to facilitate the first meeting between the Grateful Dead and the Leary organization (who recognized each other as kindred souls in spite of their differing philosophical approaches) in June 1967.\nWhile on his way to California to reunite with the Grateful Dead in 1971, Barlow stopped at his family's ranch, not intending to stay. His father had suffered a debilitating stroke in 1966 before dying in 1972, resulting in a $700,000 business debt. Dismayed by the situation, Barlow changed his plans and began practicing animal husbandry under the auspices of the Bar Cross Land and Livestock Company in Cora, Wyoming, for almost two decades. To support the ranch, he continued to write and sell spec scripts. In the meantime, Barlow was still able to play an active role in the Grateful Dead while recruiting many unconventional part-time ranch hands from the mainstream as well as the counterculture. Prior to his death in 2018, John Byrne Cooke intended to produce a documentary film (provisionally titled \"The Bar Cross Ranch\") that documented this era.\nBarlow became interested in collaborating with Weir at a Grateful Dead show at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, in February 1971. Until then, Weir had mostly worked with resident Dead lyricist Robert Hunter. Hunter preferred that those who sang his songs stick to his \"canonical\" lyrics rather than improvise additions or rearrange words. A feud erupted backstage over a couplet in \"Sugar Magnolia\" from the band's most recent release (most likely \"She can dance a Cajun rhythm/Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive\"), culminating in a disgruntled Hunter summoning Barlow and telling him \"take [Weir]\u2014he's yours\".\nIn late 1971, with a deal for a solo album in hand and only two songs completed, Weir and Barlow began to write together for the first time. They co-wrote songs such as \"Cassidy\", \"Mexicali Blues\" and \"Black-Throated Wind\", all three of which remained in the repertoires of the Grateful Dead and of Weir's varied solo projects. Barlow subsequently collaborated with Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland, a partnership that culminated in four songs on 1989's \"Built to Last\". He also wrote one song (\"The Devil I Know\") with Mydland's successor, Vince Welnick.\nInternet activism.\nIn 1986, Barlow joined The WELL, an online community then known for a strong Deadhead presence. He served on the company's board of directors for several years. In 1990, Barlow founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) with fellow digital-rights activists John Gilmore and Mitch Kapor.\nAs a founder of EFF, Barlow helped publicize the Secret Service raid on Steve Jackson Games. His involvement is documented in \"\" (1992) by Bruce Sterling. EFF later sponsored the groundbreaking case \"Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service\" in support of Steve Jackson Games. Steve Jackson Games won the case in 1993.\nIn 1996, Barlow was invited to speak about his work in cyberspace to a middle school classroom at North Shore Country Day School. This event was highly influential upon the life of then-student Aaron Swartz: Swartz's father Robert recalls Aaron coming home that day a changed person. That year, Barlow also wrote \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\", a widely disseminated creed for the Internet.\nIn 2003, Barlow met the recently appointed Brazilian Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil at the event Tactic Media Brazil to discuss the perspectives of digital inclusion and political participation, which in the following years helped shape Brazilian governmental policy on intellectual property and digital media. In 2004, the two began working together to expand the availability and variety of Brazilian music to remix and share online. At the same time, as one of the \"digerati\", Barlow was among the first users of the invitation-only social network Orkut at its inception. He decided to send all of his 100 invitations to friends in Brazil; two years later, some 11 million internet users in that country (out of 14 million total) were on the social network.\nWriting.\nFrom 1971 to 1995, Barlow wrote lyrics for the Grateful Dead, mostly through his relationship with Weir. Barlow's songs include \"Cassidy\" (about Neal Cassady and Cassidy Law), \"Estimated Prophet\", \"Black-Throated Wind\", \"Hell in a Bucket\", \"Mexicali Blues\", \"The Music Never Stopped\" and \"Throwing Stones\".\nBarlow wrote extensively for \"Wired\" magazine, as well as \"The New York Times\", \"Nerve\", and \"Communications of the ACM\". In his writings, he explained the wonder of the Internet. The Internet to him was more than a computer network; he called it an \"electronic frontier\". \"He frequently wrote in language that echoed Henry Morton Stanley's African diary. 'Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business you never heard of can own the history of your personal affairs.'\"\nBarlow's writings include \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\", written in response to the enactment of the Communications Decency Act in 1996. The EFF saw the law as a threat to the independence and sovereignty of cyberspace. He argued that the cyberspace legal order would reflect the ethical deliberation of the community instead of the coercive power that characterized real-space governance. Since online \"identities have no bodies\", they found it inappropriate to obtain order in the cyberspace by physical coercion. Instead, ethics, enlightened self-interest and the commonwealth were the elements they believed to create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.\nIn his 1990 piece \"Crime and Puzzlement: in advance of the law on the electronic frontier\", Barlow wrote about his firsthand experience with Phiber Optik (Mark Abene) and Acid Phreak (Elias Ladopoulos) from the hacker group Masters of Deception, and mentioned Kevin Mitnick\u2014all of whom were engaged in phone phreaking. The title alludes to \"Crime and Punishment\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\nBarlow is credited with popularizing of the concept of pronoia (defined as the opposite of paranoia) and was considered a celebrity ally of the Zippy Pronoia Tour in 1994.\nIn 1998, Barlow wrote the article \"Africa Rising: Everything You Know About Africa Is Wrong\" for \"Wired\", which documented the start of his extensive travels as he worked to expand Internet access across the continent: \"I went from Mombasa to Tombouctou, experiencing various parts of Kenya, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Uganda, and the Virunga volcano area where Uganda, Rwanda, and the Congo meet. Part of the idea was that I would attempt to email \"Wired\" a series of dispatches on my travels. The act of finding a port into cyberspace would be part of the adventure\u2026 Before I left, I believed Africans could proceed directly from the agricultural epoch into an information economy without having to submit to the dreary indignities and social pathologies of industrialization\".\nBarlow also returned to writing lyrics, most recently with The String Cheese Incident's mandolinist and vocalist Michael Kang, including their song \"Desert Dawn\". He was seen many times with Carolyn Garcia (whose monologue is dubbed on the eponymous track \"Mountain Girl\") at their concerts mixing with the fans and members in the band, and was a close friend of String Cheese Incident producer Jerry Harrison. He also participated with the Chicago-based jam band Mr. Blotto on their release \"Barlow Shanghai\". Barlow was a spiritual mentor and student of Kemp Muhl and Sean Lennon, collaborating with their band The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger and making a cameo in their 2014 music video \"Animals\".\nOne of Barlow's works that has remained in circulation is his \"Principles of Adult Behavior\", which he wrote in 1977 on the eve of his 30th birthday and continued to use to describe his approach to life. He described his reason for writing these as he was about to enter adulthood, \"my wariness of the pursuit of happiness might be a subtle form of treason\". While he considered most of the 25 statements similar to the platitudes Polonius dispensed to Prince Hamlet, the 15th attracted attention: \"Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that\". That was counter to prevailing thought and \"un-American\". Barlow saw this more as a way to challenge how one perceived their life, their job, and their goals in life, and to not see achieving happiness as \"an obligation [one owes] to Jefferson, the United States, or God Itself\".\nPolitics.\nBarlow was chairman of the Sublette County Republican Party, and served as western Wyoming campaign coordinator of Dick Cheney\u2019s 1978 Congressional campaign.\nBarlow was president of the Wyoming Outdoor Council from 1978 to 1984.\nHe was chairman of the Sublette County Master Plan Design Commission and served on the Sublette County Planning and Zoning Commission for many years; in that capacity, he was one of five ranchers who administered water distribution in the New Fork Irrigation District (an area of nearly 100,000 acres serving about 35 ranchers).\nDespite having once lauded Cheney as \"the smartest man I've ever met [with] the possible exception of Bill Gates\", Barlow renounced Cheney before his vice presidency, owing to his perceived repudiation of environmental and civil-rights issues in Congress. Barlow opined that \"Dick's votes\u2026 were parts of complex deals aimed at enhancing his own power\u2026 [H]e has the least interest in human beings of anyone I have ever met\".\nBarlow was named \"One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services\" in the June 1999 issue of \"FutureBanker Magazine\". By the early 2000s, Barlow was unable to reconcile his ardent libertarianism with the prevailing neoconservative movement, and \"didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush\". In 2004, he said that he was \"voting for John Kerry, though with little enthusiasm\".\nContemporaneously, he characterized cocaine derogatorily as a \"Republican drug\" that \"makes its users self-obsessed, aggressive, and greedy\". Barlow subsequently said that he remained a Republican, most notably during an appearance on \"The Colbert Report\" on March 26, 2007, and also claimed to be an anarchist.\nBarlow said he voted for Natural Law Party Presidential candidate John Hagelin in 2000 after discovering in the voting booth that his friend Nat Goldhaber was Hagelin's running mate. He said in 2004: \"I'm embarrassed for my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom I felt I could vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for George Wallace, Dick Gregory, or John Hagelin, have been protest votes\". Barlow condemned Donald Trump in November 2016, characterizing him as a \"thorough creep\" and \"toxic asshole\" in a Facebook \"micromanifesto\".\nLater work.\nUntil his death, Barlow served on the EFF's board of directors, where he was listed as a co-founder after previously serving as vice chairman. The EFF was designed to mediate the \"inevitable conflicts that have begun to occur on the border between Cyberspace and the physical world\". It tried to build a legal wall separating and protecting the Internet from territorial government, especially the US government.\nIn 2012, Barlow was one of the founders of the EFF-related Freedom of the Press Foundation and also served on its board of directors until his death. He had several public conversations via video conference with fellow Freedom of the Press Foundation Board of Directors member Edward Snowden, and appeared in interviews with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks touting Snowden as a hero.\nBarlow was a Fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School (1997\u20132007; Fellow Emeritus thereafter); a member of the advisory board of Diamond Management &amp; Technology Consultants (1994\u20132008); a member of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences; and \"professor of cyberspace\" (2011) at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.\nIn his final years, Barlow spent much of his time on the road, lecturing about and consulting on civil rights, freedom of speech, the state of the internet and the EFF. He delivered lectures and panel discussions at TWiT Live, TedxHamburg, Hamburg (Germany), Greenfest SF, Civitas (Norwegian think tank), Internet Society (New York Chapter), the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, and the European Graduate School. On September 16, 2012, he was a presenter at TEDxSantaCruz, in Santa Cruz, California.\nOn September 8, 2014, Barlow was the first speaker in the Art, Activism, and Technology: The 50th Anniversary of the Free Speech Movement colloquium series at University of California, Berkeley.\nBarlow also served on the advisory boards of the Marijuana Policy Project, Clear Path International, TTI/Vanguard, the Hypothes.is project, the stakeholder engagement nonprofit Future 500 and the global company Touch Light Media founded by Anita Ondine. He was a collaborator on the WetheData project founded by Juliette Powell.\nHe was Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in Daphne, Alabama, dedicated to commercializing novel methods at the water-energy nexus for growing microalgae offshore as a second-generation biofuels feedstock and converting it to useful crude via hydrothermal liquefaction, while simultaneously treating wastewater, reducing carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and producing biochar.\nAt Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow said that he was motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely \"electronify\" financial transactions and speculative asset assembly. The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order to do something about the \"amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth\u2026 We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder\". At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with \"Grandmother of the Conservation Movement\" Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, \"Environmentalists can be a pain in the ass\u2026 But they make great ancestors\". Adopting this philosophy, he stated, \"I want to be a good ancestor\".\nFor several years, Barlow attended Burning Man. In 2013, he led a town hall meeting with Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey about \"the current state [o]f Practical Anarchy at Burning Man\".\nA stir in the media transpired when retired U.S. Army general Wesley Clark attended Burning Man in 2013 and spent time with Barlow and Harvey.\nBarlow appeared in many films and television shows, both as an actor and as himself. Interviews with Barlow have been featured in documentaries such as the Tao Ruspoli-directed film \"Monogamish\" (under production), \"Bits &amp; Bytes\" (under production), and \"Dying to Know: Ram Dass &amp; Timothy Leary\".\nThe iPhone app Detour, released in February 2015 by Groupon founder and ex-CEO Andrew Mason, features a 75-minute audio tour narrated by Barlow as he walks through the Tenderloin neighborhood in downtown San Francisco.\nBarlow was also a self-ordained minister who performed baptisms and weddings.\nBarlow's memoir, \"Mother American Night: My Life in Crazy Times\", was published posthumously in June 2018. Written with Robert Greenfield, it is a full-length recounting of his life and times. The book was completed days before Barlow's death in February of that year.\nPersonal life.\nBarlow married Elaine Parker Barlow in 1977, and the couple had three daughters: Amelia Rose, Anna Winter, and Leah Justine. Elaine and John separated in 1992 and divorced in 1995. In 2002, he helped his friend Simone Banos (a realtor, entrepreneur, model and actress) deliver her daughter Emma Victoria, whom he regarded as his surrogate daughter thereafter.\nBarlow was engaged to Cynthia Horner, a doctor he met in 1993 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco while she was attending a psychiatry conference and Barlow was participating in a Steve Jobs comedy roast at a convention for the NeXT Computer. She died unexpectedly in 1994 while asleep on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City, days before her 30th birthday, from a heart arrhythmia apparently caused by undetected viral myocarditis. Barlow describes this period in his life in the \"This American Life\" episode \"Conventions\", from August 29, 1997.\nBarlow had been a good friend and mentor to John F. Kennedy Jr., ever since his mother Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had made arrangements for her troublesome son to be a wrangler at the Bar Cross Ranch for six months in 1978. The two men later went on many double dates in New York City with Cynthia and Kennedy's then-girlfriend Daryl Hannah.\nIn a piece for Nerve, \"A Ladies Man and Shameless: A Polygamist's Manifesto\", Barlow professed his love of many women at the same time, and summarized the relationships in his personal life: \"I doubt I'll ever be monogamous again ... I want to know as many more women as time and their indulgence will permit me ... There are probably twenty-five or thirty women\u2014I certainly don't count them\u2014for whom I feel an abiding and deep emotional attachment. They're scattered all over the planet. They range in age from less than half to almost twice my own. Most of these relationships are not actively sexual. Some were at one time. More never will be. But most of them feel as if they could become so. I love the feel of that tension, the delicious gravity of possibilities\".\nBarlow was a friend and former roommate of the technology entrepreneur Sean Parker.\nIn 2014, Barlow suffered the loss of Buck, his beloved Maine Coon cat that he believed to be a bodhisattva; the cat had many fans on social media.\nAfter a series of illnesses, Barlow suffered a near-fatal heart attack on May 27, 2015. He later reported that he was recovering. After a prolonged hospitalization, the John Perry Barlow Wellness Fund was established in October 2016 to allay outstanding medical bills and \"provide the quality and consistency of care that is critical to Barlow's recovery as he faces a variety of debilitating health conditions\", including \"extremely compromised mobility\". A concert held on October 11, 2016, to benefit the fund at Sweetwater Music Hall in Mill Valley, California, featured Weir, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Jerry Harrison, Les Claypool, Robin Sylvester, Jeff Chimenti, Steve Kimock, Sean Lennon, Lukas Nelson, and members of The String Cheese Incident.\nDeath.\nBarlow died in his sleep on the night of February 7, 2018, at his San Francisco home, at the age of 70.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

PPD-40 specifies particular requirements for continuity plan development, including the requirement that all federal executive branch departments and agencies develop an integrated, overlapping continuity capability that supports the eight National Essential Functions described in the document.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency guides the private sector for business continuity planning purposes. A continuity plan is essential to help identify critical functions and develop preventative measures to continue important functions should disruption occur.\nHistory.\nA Continuity of Operations Plan (or Continuity of Government Plan) has been a part of U.S. government operations since President Dwight D. Eisenhower provided (via executive order) various measures designed to ensure that the government of the United States would be able to continue operating after a nuclear war.\nThese measures included construction of underground facilities such as \"Mount Weather\", a putatively nuclear-weapon-proof facility in a hollowed-out mountain in northeastern Virginia; and Raven Rock Mountain Complex near Camp David in Maryland. The public can now tour one such facility, intended to house the entire United States Congress, on the grounds of the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Other provisions of the plans included executive orders designating certain government officials to assume Cabinet and other executive-branch positions and carry out the position's responsibilities if the primary officeholders are killed.\nThere has been a formal line of succession to the presidency since 1792 (currently found in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, \u00a0https://). This runs from the Vice President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, President \"pro tempore\" of the Senate, and then through the Cabinet secretaries in a sequence specified by Congress.\nContinuity of government plans are not limited to the federal government. The majority of states have constitutional provisions that provide for the succession of government in the event of an \"enemy attack\".\nContinuity of Operations plan activated.\nThe George W. Bush administration put the Continuity of Operations plan into effect for the first time directly following the September 11 attacks. Their implementation involved a rotating staff of 75 to 150 senior officials and other government workers from every federal executive department and other parts of the executive branch in two secure bunkers on the East Coast. Friends, family, and co-workers could reach them only through a toll-free number and personal extensions. The Bush administration did not acknowledge the implementation of the COG plan until March 1, 2002.\nIn 2007, Larry Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia, criticized the incomplete nature of the plan in his book \"A More Perfect Constitution\". In particular, he objected to the fact that there is no constitutional procedure for replacing U.S. House members in the case of a large-scale disaster that could potentially kill many representatives. Regarding the Continuity of Operations Plan, Sabato said it \"failed outright\" during the September 11 attacks.\nLack of congressional oversight.\nOn July 18, 2007, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), a member of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security at that time, requested the classified and more detailed version of the government's continuity-of-operations plan in a letter signed by him and the chairperson of the House Homeland Security Committee, which is supposed to have access to confidential government information.\nTo the surprise of the congressional committee, the president refused to provide the information. As of \u00a02007[ [update]], efforts by the committee to secure a copy of the plan continued.\nDocuments.\nA document named in italics supersedes a previously published document.\nFederal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD 1) is a 2017 directive released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that provides doctrine and guidance to all federal organizations regarding the development of continuity program plans and capabilities. FCD 1 also serves as guidance to state, local, and tribal governments.\nThe Federal Continuity Directive 2 (FCD 2) of June 2017 is a directive to assist federal Executive Branch organizations in identifying their Mission Essential Functions (MEFs) and candidate Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs).\nIn July 2013, the DHS, together with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and in coordination with other non-federal partners, developed the Continuity Guidance Circular 1 (CGC 1) and CGC 2.\nThe preamble of the CGC 1 states that its function is to provide \"direction to the non-Federal Governments (NFGs) for developing continuity plans and programs. Continuity planning facilitates the performance of essential functions during all-hazards emergencies or other situations that may disrupt normal operations. By continuing the performance of essential functions through a catastrophic emergency, the State, territorial, tribal, and local governments, and the private sector support the ability of the Federal Government to perform National Essential Functions (NEFs).\"\nCGC 1 closely parallels the information in FCD 1 but is geared toward states, territories, tribal and local governments, and private-sector organizations.\nThe purpose of Continuity Guidance Circular 2 (CGC 2) is to provide \"non-Federal Governments (NFGs) with guidance on how to implement CGC 1, Annex D: ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. It provides them with guidance, a methodology, and checklists to identify, assess, and validate their essential functions. This CGC includes guidance for conducting a continuity Business Process Analysis (BPA), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and a risk assessment that will identify essential function relationships, interdependencies, time sensitivities, threats and vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.\"\nReagan administration.\nAn unknown contingency plan (which some believe was Rex 84) was publicly mentioned during the Iran-Contra Hearings in 1987. Transcripts from the hearing in the \"New York Times\" record the following dialogue between Congressman Jack Brooks, Oliver North's attorney Brendan Sullivan and Senator Daniel Inouye, the Democratic Chair of the Committee:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Congressman Jack] Brooks: Colonel North, in your work at the N.S.C. were you not assigned, at one time, to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?\nBrendan Sullivan [North's counsel, agitatedly]: Mr. Chairman?\n[Senator Daniel] Inouye: I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that you not touch upon that?\nBrooks: I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami papers, and several others, that there had been a plan developed, by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of emergency, that would suspend the American constitution. And I was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was an area in which he had worked. I believe that it was, and I wanted to get his confirmation.\nInouye: May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage. If we wish to get into this, I'm certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.\nSection 202\nThe head of each Federal department and agency shall ensure the continuity of essential functions in any national security emergency by providing for: succession to office and emergency delegation of authority in accordance with applicable law; safekeeping of essential resources, facilities, and records; and establishment of emergency operating capabilities.\nHardware and facilities.\nThe Continuity of Operations Plan involves numerous bunkers, special airplanes, and communication systems. Much of the information about them is classified; however, the government has released information on various systems or described them to the public by reporters and writers. Since many of the details are classified, the public information may be incorrect. Also, they are subject to change without public notice, so this list may not reflect current plans.\nFacilities.\nDuring the Cold War, the United States constructed bunkers to help military command and government officials survive. Some have been decommissioned since then, but the ones that are still considered to be in operation are listed here.\nThe United States Congress was formerly housed in the Greenbrier Bunker, but since it was discovered in the early 1990s, the new location of the Congressional bunker is unknown.\nShips.\nTwo National Emergency Command Posts Afloat were:\nThese vessels were decommissioned in 1970.\nCommunication.\nThe Defense Communication Agency was tasked in 1963 with maintaining an active backup of all communications for any event that could disrupt communications and the management of command and control communications systems, as the National Communications System. This mission was partially transferred to Defense Information Systems Agency, in charge of supporting command, control, communications, and information systems for the military in the 1990s. It would support the National Command Authority. These functions were later transferred to Joint Forces Command and STRATCOM, but the backup contingency systems continue to operate. It is assumed that the various bunkers and airplanes have been equipped with special communication equipment to survive a catastrophe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42368", "revid": "50630815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42368", "title": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac", "text": "French novelist and playwright (1799\u20131850)\nHonor\u00e9 de Balzac ( , ; ; born Honor\u00e9 Balzac; 20 May 1799\u00a0\u2013 18 August 1850) was a French novelist and playwright. The novel sequence \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\", which presents a panorama of post-Napoleonic French life, is generally viewed as his \"magnum opus\".\nOwing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature. He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters; even his lesser characters are complex, morally ambiguous and fully human. Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well; the city of Paris, a backdrop for much of his writing, takes on many human qualities. His writing influenced many famous writers, including the novelists \u00c9mile Zola, Charles Dickens, Marcel Proust, Gustave Flaubert, Henry James and Fyodor Dostoevsky, and filmmakers Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Jacques Rivette. Many of Balzac's works have been made into films and continue to inspire other writers. James called him \"really the father of us all.\"\nAn enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.\nBalzac suffered from health problems throughout his life, possibly owing to his intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he lost more than one friend over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married Ewelina Ha\u0144ska (n\u00e9e\u00a0Contessa Rzewuska), a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love. He died in Paris six months later.\nBiography.\nFamily.\nHonor\u00e9 de Balzac was born into a family that aspired to achieve respectability through its industry and efforts. His father, born Bernard-Fran\u00e7ois Balssa, was one of eleven children from an artisan family in Tarn, a d\u00e9partement in the south-west of France. In 1760 he set off for Paris with only a \"Louis\" coin in his pocket, intent on improving his social standing; by 1776 he had become Secretary to the King's Council and a Freemason. (He had also changed his name to the more noble sounding Balzac, his son later adding\u2014without official recognition\u2014the nobiliary particle \"de\"). After the Reign of Terror (1793\u201394), Fran\u00e7ois Balzac was despatched to Tours to coordinate supplies for the Army.\nBalzac's mother, born Anne-Charlotte-Laure Sallambier, came from a family of haberdashers in Paris. Her family's wealth was a considerable factor in the match: she was eighteen at the time of the wedding and Fran\u00e7ois Balzac fifty. As the author and literary critic Sir Victor Pritchett explained, \"She was certainly drily aware that she had been given to an old husband as a reward for his professional services to a friend of her family and that the capital was on her side. She was not in love with her husband\".\nHonor\u00e9 (named after Saint-Honor\u00e9 of Amiens, who is commemorated on 16 May, four days before Balzac's birthday) was actually the second child born to the Balzacs: exactly one year earlier Louis-Daniel had been born, but he lived for only a month. Honor\u00e9's sisters, Laure and Laurence, were born in 1800 and 1802 and his younger brother, Henry-Fran\u00e7ois, in 1807.\nEarly life.\nAs an infant Balzac was sent to a wet nurse; the following year he was joined by his sister Laure and they spent four years away from home. (Although Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau's influential book \"\u00c9mile\" persuaded many mothers of the time to nurse their own children, sending babies to wet nurses was still common among the middle and upper classes.) When the Balzac children returned home, they were kept at a frosty distance from their parents, which affected the author-to-be significantly. His 1835 novel \"Le Lys dans la vall\u00e9e\" features a cruel governess named Miss Caroline, modelled after his own caregiver.\nAt age ten Balzac was sent to the Oratorian grammar school in Vend\u00f4me, where he studied for seven years. His father, seeking to instill the same hardscrabble work ethic that had gained him the esteem of society, intentionally gave little spending money to the boy. This made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.\nBalzac had difficulty adapting to the rote style of learning at the school. As a result, he was frequently sent to the \"alcove\", a punishment cell reserved for disobedient students. (The janitor at the school, when asked later if he remembered Honor\u00e9, replied: \"Remember M. Balzac? I should think I do! I had the honour of escorting him to the dungeon more than a hundred times!\") Still, his time alone gave the boy ample freedom to read every book which came his way.\nBalzac worked these scenes from his boyhood\u2014as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him\u2014into \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\". His time at Vend\u00f4me is reflected in \"Louis Lambert\", his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an Oratorian grammar school at Vend\u00f4me. The narrator says : \"He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. He had told me that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books.\"\nBalzac often fell ill, finally causing the headmaster to contact his family with news of a \"sort of a coma\". When he returned home, his grandmother said: \"\" (\"Look how the academy returns the pretty ones we send them!\") Balzac himself attributed his condition to \"intellectual congestion\", but his extended confinement in the \"alcove\" was surely a factor. (Meanwhile, his father had been writing a treatise on \"the means of preventing thefts and murders, and of restoring the men who commit them to a useful role in society\", in which he heaped disdain on prison as a form of crime prevention.)\nIn 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris, and Honor\u00e9 was sent to private tutors and schools for the next two and a half years. This was an unhappy time in his life, during which he attempted suicide on a bridge over the river Loire.\nIn 1816 Balzac entered the Sorbonne, where he studied under three famous professors: Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, who later became Prime Minister, was Professor of Modern History; Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Villemain, a recent arrival from the \"Coll\u00e8ge Charlemagne\", lectured on French and classical literature; and, most influential of all, Victor Cousin's courses on philosophy encouraged his students to think independently.\nOnce his studies were completed, Balzac was persuaded by his father to follow him into the Law; after a stint in the office of the Jean-Baptiste Guillonnet-Merville for three years he trained and worked at the office of the notary \u00c9douard-Victor Passez, a family friend. During this time Balzac began to understand the vagaries of human nature. In his 1840 novel \"Le Notaire\", he wrote that a young person in the legal profession sees \"the oily wheels of every fortune, the hideous wrangling of heirs over corpses not yet cold, the human heart grappling with the Penal Code\".\nIn 1819 Passez offered to make Balzac his successor, but his apprentice had had enough of the Law. He despaired of being \"a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same thing over and over again... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite\". He announced his intention to become a writer.\nThe loss of this opportunity caused serious discord in the Balzac household, although Honor\u00e9 was not turned away entirely. Instead, in April 1819 he was allowed to live in the French capital\u2014as English critic George Saintsbury describes it\u2014\"in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion, with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him\", while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles (32\u00a0km) outside Paris.\nFirst literary efforts.\nBalzac's first project was a libretto for a comic opera called \"Le Corsaire\", based on Lord Byron's \"The Corsair\". Realizing he would have trouble finding a composer, however, he turned to other pursuits.\nIn 1820 Balzac completed the five-act verse tragedy \"Cromwell\". Although it pales by comparison with his later works, some critics consider it a good-quality text. When he finished, Balzac went to Villeparisis and read the entire work to his family; they were unimpressed. He followed this effort by starting (but never finishing) three novels: \"St\u00e9nie\", \"Falthurne\", and \"Corsino\".\nIn 1821 Balzac met the enterprising , who convinced the author to write short stories, which Le Poitevin would then sell to publishers. Balzac quickly turned to longer works, and by 1826 he had written nine novels, all published under pseudonyms and often produced in collaboration with other writers. For example, the scandalous novel \"Vicaire des Ardennes\" (1822)\u2014banned for its depiction of nearly-incestuous relations and, more egregiously, of a married priest\u2014attributed to a \"Horace de Saint-Aubin\". These books were potboiler novels, designed to sell quickly and titillate audiences. In Saintsbury's view, \"they are curiously, interestingly, almost enthrallingly bad\". Saintsbury indicates that Robert Louis Stevenson tried to dissuade him from reading these early works of Balzac. American critic Samuel Rogers, however, notes that \"without the training they gave Balzac, as he groped his way to his mature conception of the novel, and without the habit he formed as a young man of writing under pressure, one can hardly imagine his producing \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\"\". Biographer Graham Robb suggests that as he discovered the Novel, Balzac discovered himself.\nDuring this time Balzac wrote two pamphlets in support of primogeniture and the Society of Jesus. The latter, regarding the Jesuits, illustrated his lifelong admiration for the Catholic Church. In the preface to \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" he wrote: \"Christianity, above all, Catholicism, being ... a complete system for the repression of the depraved tendencies of man, is the most powerful element of social order\".\nIn the late 1820s Balzac dabbled in several business ventures, a penchant his sister blamed on the temptation of an unknown neighbour. His first enterprise was in publishing which turned out cheap one-volume editions of French classics including the works of Moli\u00e8re. This business failed miserably, with many of the books \"sold as waste paper\". Balzac had better luck publishing the Memoirs of the Duchess of Abrant\u00e8s, with whom he also had a love affair.\nBalzac borrowed money from his family and friends and tried to build a printing business, then a type foundry. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.\nBalzac never lost his penchant for . It resurfaced painfully later when\u2014as a renowned and busy author\u2014he traveled to Sardinia in the hopes of reprocessing the slag from the Roman mines there. Near the end of his life Balzac was captivated by the idea of cutting of oak wood in Ukraine and transporting it for sale in France.\n\"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" and literary success.\nAfter writing several novels, in 1832 Balzac conceived the idea for an enormous series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of \"all aspects of society\". The moment the idea came to him, Balzac raced to his sister's apartment and proclaimed: \"I am about to become a genius!\" Although he originally called it \"Etudes des M\u0153urs\" (literally 'Studies of manners', or 'The Ways of the World') it eventually became known as \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\", and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime under his own name. This was to be Balzac's life work and his greatest achievement.\nAfter the collapse of his businesses, Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed with the De Pommereul family outside Foug\u00e8res. There he drew inspiration for \"Les Chouans\" (1829), a tale of love gone wrong amid the Chouan royalist forces. Although he was a supporter of the Crown, Balzac paints the revolutionaries in a sympathetic light\u2014even though they are the center of the book's most brutal scenes. This was the first book Balzac released under his own name, and it gave him what one critic called \"passage into the Promised Land\". It established him as an author of note (even if its historical fiction-genre imitates that of Sir Walter Scott) and provided him with a name outside his past pseudonyms.\nSoon afterwards, around the time of his father's death, Balzac wrote \"El Verdugo\"\u2014about a 30-year-old man who kills his father (Balzac was 30 years old at the time). This was the first work signed \"Honor\u00e9 \"de\" Balzac\". He followed his father in the surname Balzac but added the aristocratic-sounding nobiliary particle to help him fit into respected society, a choice based on skill rather than by right. \"The aristocracy and authority of talent are more substantial than the aristocracy of names and material power\", he wrote in 1830. The timing of the decision was also significant; as Robb explained: \"The disappearance of the father coincides with the adoption of the nobiliary particle. A symbolic inheritance.\" Just as his father had worked his way up from poverty into respectable society, Balzac considered toil and effort his real mark of nobility.\nWhen the July Revolution overthrew Charles X in 1830, Balzac declared himself a Legitimist, supporting King Charles' Royal House of Bourbon, but not without qualifications. He felt that the new July Monarchy (which claimed widespread popular support) was disorganized and unprincipled, in need of a mediator to keep the political peace between the King and insurgent forces. He called for \"a young and vigorous man who belongs neither to the Directoire nor to the Empire, but who is 1830 incarnate...\" He planned to be such a candidate, appealing especially to the higher classes in Chinon. But after a near-fatal accident in 1832 (he slipped and cracked his head on the street), Balzac decided not to stand for election.\n1831 saw the success of \"La Peau de chagrin\" (\"The Wild Ass's Skin\" or \"The Magic Skin\"), a fable-like tale about a despondent young man named Rapha\u00ebl de Valentin who finds an animal skin which promises great power and wealth. He obtains these things, but loses the ability to manage them. In the end, his health fails and he is consumed by his own confusion. Balzac meant the story to bear witness to the treacherous turns of life, its \"serpentine motion\".\nIn 1833 Balzac released \"Eug\u00e9nie Grandet\", his first best-seller. The tale of a young lady who inherits her father's miserliness, it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career. The writing is simple, yet the individuals (especially the bourgeois title character) are dynamic and complex. It is followed by \"La Duchesse de Langeais\", arguably the most sublime of his novels.\n\"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\" (\"Old Father Goriot\", 1835) was his next success, in which Balzac transposes the story of \"King Lear\" to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The centrality of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position\u2014not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but also the fact that he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of inspiration for \"Eug\u00e9nie Grandet\".\nIn 1836 Balzac took the helm of the \"Chronique de Paris\", a weekly magazine of society and politics. He tried to enforce strict impartiality in its pages and a reasoned assessment of various ideologies. As Rogers notes, \"Balzac was interested in any social, political, or economic theory, whether from the right or the left.\" The magazine failed, but in July 1840 he founded another publication, the \"Revue Parisienne\". It produced three issues.\nThese dismal business efforts\u2014and his misadventures in Sardinia\u2014provided an appropriate milieu in which to set the two-volume \"Illusions perdues\" (\"Lost Illusions\", 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9, a young poet trying to make a name for himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work is informed by Balzac's own failed ventures in the field. \"Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res des courtisanes\" (\"The Harlot High and Low\", 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is trapped by the Abb\u00e9 Herrera (Vautrin) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.\n\"Le Cousin Pons\" (1847) and \"La Cousine Bette\" (1848) tell the story of \"Les Parents Pauvres\" (\"The Poor Relations\"). The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the expertise gained by the author as a young law clerk. Balzac's health was deteriorating by this point, making the completion of this pair of books a significant accomplishment.\nMany of his novels were initially serialized, like those of Dickens. Their length was not predetermined. \"Illusions Perdues\" extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas \"La Fille aux yeux d'or\" (\"The Girl with the Golden Eyes\", 1835) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages. According to the literary critic Kornelije Kvas, \"Balzac's use of the same characters (Rastignac, Vautrin) in different parts of \"The Human Comedy\" is a consequence of the realist striving for narrative economy\".\nWork habits.\nBalzac's work habits were legendary. He wrote from 1 A.M. to 8 A.M. every morning and sometimes even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He often worked for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.\nBalzac revised obsessively, covering printer's proofs with changes and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during the publication of a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some\u2014such as \"Les employ\u00e9s\" (\"The Government Clerks\", 1841)\u2014are nonetheless noted by critics.\nAlthough Balzac was \"by turns a hermit and a vagrant\", he managed to stay in tune with the social spheres which nourished his writing. He was friends with Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, George Sand, Frederic Chopin, Gioachino Rossini and Pierre-Marie-Charles de Bernard du Grail de la Villette, and he was acquainted with Victor Hugo. Nevertheless, he did not spend as much time in \"salons\" and clubs of Paris like many of his characters. \"In the first place he was too busy\", explains Saintsbury, \"in the second he would not have been at home there... [H]e felt it was his business not to frequent society but to create it\". However, he often spent long periods at the Ch\u00e2teau de Sach\u00e9, near Tours, the home of his friend Jean de Margonne, his mother's lover and father to her youngest child. Many of Balzac's tormented characters were conceived in the chateau's small second-floor bedroom. Today the chateau is a museum dedicated to the author's life.\nMarriage, romantic relationships, and death.\nIn 1833, as he revealed in a letter to his sister, Balzac entered into an illicit affair with fellow writer Maria Du Fresnay, who was then aged 24. Her marriage to a considerably older man (Charles du Fresnay, Mayor of Sartrouville) had been a failure from the outset. In this letter, Balzac also reveals that the young woman had just come to tell him she was pregnant with his child. In 1834, 8 months after the event, Maria Du Fresnay's daughter by Balzac, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, was born. This revelation from French journalist Roger Pierrot in 1955 confirmed what was already suspected by several historians: the dedicatee of the novel \"Eug\u00e9nie Grandet\", a certain \"Maria\", turns out to be Maria Du Fresnay herself.\nBalzac had also long been suspected of being attracted to males as well. When the official records of homosexuals once maintained by the Paris police were finally released, his name was found listed.\nIn February 1832 Balzac received an intriguing letter from Odessa\u2014with no return address and signed simply \"L'\u00c9trang\u00e8re\" (\"The Foreigner\")\u2014expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in \"La Peau de Chagrin\" and its negative portrayal of women. His response was to place a classified advertisement in the \"Gazette de France\", hoping that his anonymous critic would see it. Thus began a fifteen-year correspondence between Balzac and \"the object of [his] sweetest dreams\": Ewelina Ha\u0144ska.\nEwelina (\"n\u00e9e\" Rzewuska) was married to a nobleman twenty years her senior, Marshal Wac\u0142aw Ha\u0144ski, a wealthy Polish landowner living near Kyiv. It had been a marriage of convenience to preserve her family's fortune. In Balzac Countess Ewelina found a kindred spirit for her emotional and social desires, with the added benefit of feeling a connection to the glamorous capital of France. Their correspondence reveals an intriguing balance of passion, propriety and patience; Robb says it is \"like an experimental novel in which the female protagonist is always trying to pull in extraneous realities but which the hero is determined to keep on course, whatever tricks he has to use\".\nMarshal Ha\u0144ski died in 1841, and his widow and her admirer finally had the chance to pursue their affections. A rival of the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt, Balzac visited Countess Ha\u0144ska in Saint Petersburg in 1843 and won her heart. After a series of financial setbacks, health problems and objections from Tsar Nicholas I, the couple finally received permission to wed. On 14 March 1850, with Balzac's health in serious decline, they travelled by carriage from her family seat at Verhivnya Park in Volhynia to St. Barbara's Catholic Church in Berdychiv (Russia's former banking city in present-day Ukraine), where they were married by Abbot O\u017carowski. The ten-hour journey to and from the ceremony took a toll on both husband and wife: her feet were too swollen to walk, and he endured severe heart trouble.\nAlthough he married late in life, Balzac had already written two treatises on marriage: \"Physiologie du Mariage\" and \"Sc\u00e8nes de la Vie Conjugale\". These works lacked firsthand knowledge; Saintsbury points out that \"c\u0153lebs cannot talk of [marriage] with much authority\". In late April the newly-weds set off for Paris. His health deteriorated on the way, and Ewelina wrote to her daughter about Balzac being \"in a state of extreme weakness\" and \"sweating profusely\". They arrived in the French capital on 20 May, his fifty-first birthday.\nFive months after his wedding, on Sunday, 18 August 1850, Balzac died of gangrene associated with congestive heart failure, in the presence of his mother\u2014his wife, Eve de Balzac (formerly Countess Ha\u0144ska) had gone to bed. He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo, who later served as a pallbearer and the eulogist at Balzac's funeral. Some modern researchers have attributed a factor in his death to excessive coffee consumption or a caffeine overdose (Balzac reportedly drank over 50 cups a day) but this has yet to be proved.\nBalzac is buried at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. At his memorial service, Victor Hugo pronounced \"Today we have people in black because of the death of the man of talent; a nation in mourning for a man of genius\". The funeral was attended by \"almost every writer in Paris\", including Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Lema\u00eetre, Gustave Courbet, Dumas \"p\u00e8re\" and Dumas \"fils\", as well as representatives of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and other dignitaries.\nIn the 1890s, the celebrated French sculptor Auguste Rodin created a statue called the \"Monument to Balzac\". Cast in bronze, the Balzac Monument has stood since 1939 nearby the intersection of Boulevard Raspail and Boulevard Montparnasse at Place Pablo-Picasso. Rodin featured Balzac in several of his smaller sculptures as well.\nWriting style.\nThe \"Com\u00e9die humaine\" remained unfinished at the time of his death\u2014Balzac had plans to include numerous other books, most of which he never started. He frequently flitted between works in progress. \"Finished articles\" were frequently revised between editions. This piecemeal style is reflective of the author's own life, a possible attempt to stabilize it through fiction. \"The vanishing man\", wrote Sir Victor Pritchett, \"who must be pursued from the rue Cassini to\u00a0...\u00a0Versailles, Ville d'Avray, Italy, and Vienna can construct a settled dwelling only in his work\".\nRealism.\nBalzac's extensive use of detail, especially the detail of objects, to illustrate the lives of his characters made him an early pioneer of literary realism. Whilst he admired and drew inspiration from the Romantic style of Scottish novelist Walter Scott, Balzac sought to depict human existence through the use of particulars. In the preface to the first edition of \"Sc\u00e8nes de la Vie priv\u00e9e\", he wrote: \"the author firmly believes that details alone will henceforth determine the merit of works\". Plentiful descriptions of d\u00e9cor, clothing, and possessions help breathe life into the characters. For example, Balzac's friend Henri de Latouche had a good knowledge of hanging wallpaper. Balzac transferred this to his descriptions of the Pension Vauquer in \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\", making the wallpaper speak of the identities of those living inside.\nSome critics consider Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism\u2014a more pessimistic and analytical form of realism, which seeks to explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist \u00c9mile Zola declared Balzac the father of the naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass\u2014precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.\nCharacters.\nBalzac sought to present his characters as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. \"To arrive at the truth\", he wrote in the preface to \"Le Lys dans la vall\u00e9e\", \"writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters\". \"Balzac's characters\", Robb notes, \"were as real to him as if he were observing them in the outside world\". This reality was noted by playwright Oscar Wilde, who said: \"One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [\"Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res des courtisanes\" protagonist] Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. I remember it when I laugh\".\nAt the same time, the characters depict a particular range of social types: the noble soldier, the scoundrel, the proud workman, the fearless spy, the alluring mistress. That Balzac was able to balance the strength of the individual against the representation of the type is evidence of the author's skill. One critic explained that \"there is a center and a circumference to Balzac's world\".\nBalzac's use of repeat characters, moving in and out of the \"Com\u00e9die\"'s books, strengthens the realist representation. \"When the characters reappear\", notes Rogers, \"they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see\". He also used a realist technique which French novelist Marcel Proust later termed \"retrospective illumination\", whereby a character's past is revealed long after she or he first appears.\nA nearly infinite reserve of energy propels the characters in Balzac's novels. Struggling against the currents of human nature and society, they may lose more often than they win\u2014but only rarely do they give up. This universal trait is a reflection of Balzac's own social wrangling, that of his family, and an interest in the Austrian mystic and physician Franz Mesmer, who pioneered the study of animal magnetism. Balzac spoke often of a \"nervous and fluid force\" between individuals, and Rapha\u00ebl de Valentin's decline in \"La Peau de Chagrin\" exemplifies the danger of withdrawing from other people's company.\nPlace.\nRepresentations of the city, countryside, and building interiors are essential to Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes that he had made on previous visits.\nThe influence of Paris permeates \"La Com\u00e9die\": nature defers to the artificial metropolis, in contrast to descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the countryside. \"If in Paris\", Rogers says, \"we are in a man-made region where even the seasons are forgotten, these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting\". Balzac said, \"the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds.\" His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist Charles Dickens and Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. The centrality of Paris in \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist. \"Realism is nothing if not urban\", notes critic Peter Brooks; the scene of a young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as \"Illusions Perdues\".\nBalzac visited the Ch\u00e2teau de Sach\u00e9 in Touraine which was owned by his friend Jean de Margonne (who was also his mother's lover), between 1830 and 1837, and wrote many of his novels in the series \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" there. It is now a museum dedicated to Balzac where one can see his writing desk and quill pen and chair.\nPerspective.\nBalzac's literary mood evolved over time from one of despondency and chagrin to that of solidarity and courage\u2014but not optimism. \"La Peau de Chagrin\", among his earliest novels, is a pessimistic tale of confusion and destruction. But the cynicism declined as his \"oeuvre\" developed, and the characters of \"Illusions Perdues\" reveal sympathy for those who are pushed to one side by society. As part of the 19th-century evolution of the novel as a \"democratic literary form\", Balzac wrote that \"\" (\"books are written for everybody\").\nBalzac concerned himself overwhelmingly with the darker essence of human nature and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies. His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently wandering through the streets \"incognito\" among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and the people around him, in works like \"Eug\u00e9nie Grandet\" and \"Louis Lambert\".\nPolitics.\nBalzac was a legitimist; in many ways, his views are the antithesis of Victor Hugo's democratic republicanism. He wrote, in his essay \"Society and the Individual\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The only absolute authority which the imagination has been able to conceive, the authority of God, works according to rules which He has imposed on Himself. He can destroy all His worlds and return to His rest, but while He allows them to exist, they continue to be governed by the laws which together create order.\nBalzac was influenced by the counter-revolutionary philosopher and statesman Louis de Bonald, and once remarked that \"[w]hen it beheaded Louis XVI, the Revolution beheaded in his person all fathers of families.\" Nevertheless, his keen insight regarding working-class conditions earned him the esteem of many socialists, including Marxists. Engels declared that Balzac was his favorite writer. Marx's \"Das Kapital\" also makes some references to the works of Balzac, and Trotsky famously read Balzac in the middle of meetings of the Central Committee, much to the consternation of his colleagues and comrades.\nLegacy.\nBalzac influenced writers of his time and beyond. He has been compared to Charles Dickens and is considered one of Dickens' significant influences. Literary critic W. H. Helm calls one \"the French Dickens\" and the other \"the English Balzac\", while another critic, Richard Lehan, states that \"Balzac was the bridge between the comic realism of Dickens and the naturalism of Zola\".\nGustave Flaubert was also substantially influenced by Balzac. Praising his portrayal of society while attacking his prose style, Flaubert once wrote: \"What a man he would have been had he known how to write!\" While he disdained the label of \"realist\", Flaubert clearly took heed of Balzac's close attention to detail and unvarnished depictions of bourgeois life. This influence shows in Flaubert's work \"L'\u00e9ducation sentimentale\" which owes a debt to Balzac's \"Illusions Perdues\". \"What Balzac started\", observes Lehan, \"Flaubert helped finish\".\nMarcel Proust similarly learned from the Realist example; he adored Balzac and studied his works carefully, although he criticised what he perceived as Balzac's \"vulgarity\". Balzac's story \"Une Heure de ma Vie\" (\"An Hour of my Life\", 1822), in which minute details are followed by deep personal reflections, is a clear forebear of the style which Proust used in \"\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu\". However, Proust wrote later in life that the contemporary fashion of ranking Balzac higher than Tolstoy was \"madness\".\nPerhaps the author most affected by Balzac was American expatriate novelist Henry James. In 1878 James wrote with sadness about the lack of contemporary attention paid to Balzac, and lavished praise on him in four essays (in 1875, 1877, 1902, and 1913). In 1878 James wrote: \"Large as Balzac is, he is all of one piece and he hangs perfectly together\". He wrote with admiration of Balzac's attempt to portray in writing \"a beast with a hundred claws\". In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac\u2014a conscious style preference; he stated: \"the artist of the \"Com\u00e9die humaine\" is half smothered by the historian\". Still, both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior.\nWilliam Saroyan wrote a short story about Balzac in his 1971 book, \"Letters from 74 rue Taitbout or Don't Go But If You Must Say Hello To Everybody\".\nBalzac's vision of a society in which class, money and personal ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: \"I have learned more [from Balzac] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together\". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia. He was also praised by James Baldwin, who said in 1984: \"I'm sure that my life in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac. [He taught me] the way that country and its society works.\" In 1970 Roland Barthes published \"S/Z\", a detailed analysis of Balzac's story \"Sarrasine\" and a key work in structuralist literary criticism. Carlos Fuentes, sometimes called \"the Balzac of Mexico\", cited Balzac as a major influence on his writing.\nBalzac has also influenced popular culture. Many of his works have been made into popular films and television serials, including: Travers Vale's \"P\u00e8re Goriot\" (1915), \"Les Chouans\" (1947), \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\" (1968 BBC mini-series), and \"La Cousine Bette\" (1974 BBC mini-series, starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren; 1998 film, starring Jessica Lange). Balzac is mentioned, along with Chaucer and Rabelais, to humorous effect (as authors of allegedly unreliable morals) in Meredith Willson's musical \"The Music Man\". The young protagonist in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1959 film \"The 400 Blows\" is so enamored of Balzac that he unwittingly plagiarizes the writer and starts a small apartment fire with a candle he lights in Balzac's honor. Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust to be the greatest French writers.\nHis life was dramatised as the 1950 Australian radio play \"Balzac\".\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42370", "revid": "13068117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42370", "title": "History of Belgium", "text": "For most of its history, what is today Belgium was either a part of a larger territory, such as the medieval Carolingian Empire, or was divided into a number of smaller states. In the Middle Ages, the territory of present-day Belgium was fragmented into numerous feudal principalities, including the Duchy of Lower Lorraine, the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Flanders, the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge, the County of Namur, the County of Hainaut and the County of Luxembourg. Belgium's modern shape can be traced back at least as far as the southern core of the medieval Burgundian Netherlands. The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648) later led to the split between a northern Dutch Republic and the Southern Netherlands from which Belgium and Luxembourg developed. The area, long a Habsburg stronghold, briefly came under Bourbon control during the War of the Spanish Succession. The resulting Peace of Utrecht transferred the area back to Habsburg control, creating what is now known as the Austrian Netherlands. The French Revolutionary wars led to Belgium becoming part of France in 1795. After the defeat of the French in 1814, the Congress of Vienna created two new states, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which were placed in dynastic union under the House of Orange-Nassau. The Southern Netherlands rebelled during the 1830 Belgian Revolution, establishing the modern Belgian state, officially recognized at the London Conference of 1830. The first King of Belgium, Leopold I, assumed the throne in 1831.\nThe first half of the twentieth century was tumultuous. Its historic neutrality was violated in each of the World Wars. During World War I, frustrated German invaders launched the Rape of Belgium. During the 1940 invasion, the quick surrender by Leopold III of Belgium to German forces drove a wedge between the King and his people. The King's attempt to return led to a constitutional crisis in 1950, which led to his abdication in favor of his son Baudouin. Belgium entered the second half of the twentieth century showing an unprecedented era of economic growth, as Belgium took an active role in the formation of the Benelux customs union with its neighbors. Ultimately, the Benelux union would serve as a model for the European Economic Community, a precursor to the European Union; to this day Brussels serves as the seat of many of the European Union institutions.\nDomestically, the country has faced divisions over differences of language and unequal economic development. This ongoing antagonism has caused far-reaching reforms since the 1970s. It is now divided into three regions: Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north, French-speaking Wallonia in the south, and bilingual Brussels in the middle. Since the 1990s, Belgium has become involved in several international conflicts, under the aegis of various United Nations peacekeeping forces, including the Rwandan Civil War, the ongoing civil wars in Somalia, the Kosovo War, and several others. Environmental concerns came to a head in the Dioxin affair, bringing down the Belgian government of Jean-Luc Dehaene's premiership. Since then, the Belgian political landscape has become increasingly politically fragmented; after the 2010 Belgian federal election, it took nearly a year to form a government, and in more recent elections a growing right-wing Flemish nationalist movement has had a strong influence over domestic politics.\nNames.\nBelgium and Flanders were the first two common names used for the Burgundian Netherlands which was the predecessor of the Austrian Netherlands, the predecessor of Belgium. The County of Flanders was the original foothold of the Burgundian dukes in the region, to which other territories were later attached.\n\"Belgium\" is originally a Latin term used by Julius Caesar, referring to an area now mostly in Northern France, where the tribes ruling the military alliance of the Belgae lived. Under Roman rule, this region was the equivalent of the province of \"Belgica Secunda\", which stretched into the coastal Flemish part of modern Belgium.\nIn late Roman and medieval times, the term Belgium tended to be used to refer to Roman \"Belgica Prima\", and its successor Upper Lotharingia, in the Moselle region of Germany, Luxembourg and France. Only slowly did the old term start to be used for the area to the north of the two Roman \"Belgica\" provinces, now the Netherlands and Belgium. A key turning point, when it was used specifically to refer to the southern part of the Netherlands, was during the Brabant Revolution in 1790. This terminology was revived after the better known revolution of 1830, when modern Belgium broke out of the post-Waterloo United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nPrehistory.\nOn Belgian territory Neanderthal fossils were discovered at Engis in 1829\u201330 and elsewhere, some dating back to at least 100,000 BC.\nThe earliest Neolithic farming technology of northern Europe, the so-called LBK culture, reached the east of Belgium at its furthest northwesterly stretch from its origins in southeast Europe. Its expansion stopped in the Hesbaye region of eastern Belgium around 5000 BC. The Belgian LBK is notable for its use of defensive walls around villages.\n\"Limburg pottery\" and \"La Hoguette pottery\" are styles which stretch into northwestern France and the Netherlands, but it has sometimes been argued that these technologies are the result of pottery technology spreading beyond the original LBK farming population and being made by hunter gatherers. A slightly later-starting Neolithic culture found in central Wallonia is the so-called \"Groupe de Blicquy\", which may represent an offshoot of the LBK settlers. One notable archaeological site in this region is the Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes.\nFarming in Belgium failed to take permanent hold at first. The LBK and Blicquy cultures disappeared and there is a long gap before a new farming culture, the Michelsberg culture, appeared and became widespread. Hunter gatherers of the Swifterbant culture apparently remained in the sandy north of Belgium, but apparently became more and more influenced by farming and pottery technology.\nIn the third and late fourth millennia BC, the whole of Flanders shows relatively little evidence of human habitation. The Seine-Oise-Marne culture spread into the Ardennes, and is associated with megalithic sites there (for example W\u00e9ris), but did not disperse over all of Belgium. To the north and east, in the Netherlands, a semi-sedentary culture group has been proposed to have existed, the so-called Vlaardingen-Wartburg-Stein complex, which possibly developed from the above-mentioned Swifterbant and Michelsburg cultures. The same pattern continues into the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. In the last part of the Neolithic, evidence is found for the Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures in the south of the Netherlands.\nThe population of Belgium started to increase permanently with the late Bronze Age from around 1750 BC. Three possibly related European cultures arrived in sequence. First the Urnfield culture arrived, then, coming into the Iron Age, the Hallstatt culture, and the La T\u00e8ne culture. All three of these are associated with Indo-European languages. From 500 BC Celtic tribes settled in the region and traded with the Mediterranean world. From c. 150 BC, the first coins came into use.\nCeltic and Roman periods.\nWhen Julius Caesar arrived in the region, as recorded in his \"De Bello Gallico\", the inhabitants of Belgium, northwestern France, and the German Rhineland were known as the Belgae, and they were considered to be the northern part of Gaul. The region of Luxembourg, including the part of the Belgian province of Luxembourg around Arlon, was inhabited by the Treveri.\nThe exact nature of the distinction between the Belgae to the North and the Celts to the south, and the Germani across the Rhine, is disputed. Caesar said that the Belgae were separated from the rest of Gaul by language, law and custom, and he also said they had Germanic ancestry. On the other hand, linguists have proposed that there is evidence that the northern part of the Belgic population had previously spoken an Indo-European language related to, but distinct from, Celtic and Germanic (see Belgian language and Nordwestblock).\nThe leaders of the Belgic alliance which Caesar confronted were in modern France, the Suessiones, Viromandui and Ambiani and perhaps some of their neighbours, in an area that he appears to distinguish as the true \"Belgium\" of classical times. Concerning the territory of modern Belgium, he reported that the more northerly allies of the Belgae, from west to east the Menapii, Nervii, and \"Germani cisrhenani\", were less economically developed and more warlike, similar to the \"Germani\" east of the Rhine river. The Menapii and northern Germani lived among low thorny forests, islands and swamps, and the central Belgian Nervii lands were deliberately planted with thick hedges to be impenetrable to cavalry. There is also less archaeological evidence of large settlements and trade in the area.\nModern linguists use the word \"germanic\" to refer to languages but it is not known for sure whether even the Belgian \"Germani\" spoke a Germanic language, and their tribal and personal names are clearly Celtic. Archaeologists have also had difficulty finding evidence of the exact migrations from east of the Rhine which Caesar reports and more generally there has been skepticism about using him in this way due to the political motives of his commentaries. But the archaeological record gives the impression that the classical Belgian \"Germani\" were a relatively stable population going back to Urnfield times, with a more recently immigrated elite class.\nThe Menapii and Nervii flourished within the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, along with the southern Belgae and the Treveri. These Roman provinces were broken into \"civitates\", each with a capital city, and each representing one of the major tribal groups named by Caesar. At first, only one, Tongeren capital of the Tungri, was in modern Belgium. Later, the capital of the Menapii was moved from Cassel in modern France to Tournai in Belgium. The Nervian capital was in the south of the territory in modern France, at Bavay, and later moved to Cambrai. Trier, the capital of the Treveri, is today in Germany.\nThe northeastern corner of this province, including Tongeren and the area of the earlier \"Germani\", was united with the militarized Rhine border to form a newer province known as Germania Inferior, with capital Colonia Agrippina (Cologne in Germany). Emperor Diocletian restructured the provinces around 300, and split the remaining Belgica into two provinces: \"Belgica Prima\" and \"Belgica Secunda\". Belgica Prima was the eastern part and had Trier as its main city, and included part of the Belgian province of Luxembourg. It became one of the most important Roman cities in Western Europe in the 3rd century.\nChristianity was introduced to Belgium during the late-Roman period, and the first known bishop in the region Servatius taught in the middle of the Fourth century in Tongeren.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nIn the Middle Ages, the old Roman \"civitates\" became the basis of Christian dioceses, and the row of dioceses which form the core of modern Belgium (Tournai, Cambrai, and Li\u00e8ge) were the most northerly continental areas to retain a Romanized culture. The modern Belgian language boundary derives from this period, as the area was a contact point of Frankish and Romanized populations.\nAs the Western Roman Empire lost power, Germanic tribes came to dominate the military, and then form kingdoms. Coastal Flanders, the old territory of the Menapii, became part of the \"Saxon Shore\". In inland northern Belgium, Franks from the Roman frontier in the Rhine delta were allowed to re-settle in Toxandria in the 4th century. Wallonia remained more heavily Romanized, although it eventually became subject to Franks in the 5th century. Franks remained important in the Roman military, and the Romanized Frankish Merovingian Dynasty eventually took over northern France. Clovis I, the best-known king of this dynasty, first conquered Romanized northern France, later called Neustria, then turned north to the Frankish lands later referred to as Austrasia, which included all or most of Belgium. Christian missionaries preached to the populace and started a wave of conversion.\nThe Merovingian dynasty was succeeded by the Carolingian dynasty, whose family power base was in and around the eastern part of modern Belgium. After Charles Martel countered the Moorish invasion from Spain (732 \u2014 Poitiers), King Charlemagne brought a huge part of Europe under his rule and was crowned the \"Emperor of the new Holy Roman Empire\" by the Pope Leo III in 800.\nThe Vikings raided widely throughout this period, but a major settlement that had caused problems in the area of Belgium was defeated in 891 by Arnulf of Carinthia in the battle of Leuven.\nThe Frankish lands were divided and reunified several times under the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties, but eventually were firmly divided into France and the Holy Roman Empire. The parts of the County of Flanders west of the river Scheldt became part of France during the Middle Ages, but the remainders of the County of Flanders and the Low Countries were part of the Holy Roman Empire, specifically the stem duchy of Lower Lotharingia, which had a period as an independent kingdom.\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the northern part of present-day Belgium (Flanders) was a Germanic language-speaking area, whereas in the southern part people had continued to be Romanized and spoke derivatives of Vulgar Latin.\nAs the Holy Roman emperors and French kings lost effective control of their domains in the 11th and 12th centuries, the territory more or less corresponding to the present Belgium was divided into relatively independent feudal states, including:\nThe coastal county of Flanders was one of the wealthiest parts of Europe in the late Middle Ages, from trading with England, France and Germany, and it became culturally important. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the Rheno-Mosan or Mosan art movement flourished in the region moving its centre from Cologne and Trier to Li\u00e8ge, Maastricht and Aachen.\nLate Middle Ages and Renaissance.\nIn this period, many cities, including Ypres, Bruges and Ghent, obtained their city charter. The Hanseatic League stimulated trade in the region, and the period saw the erection of many Gothic cathedrals and city halls. With the decline of the Holy Roman emperors' power starting in the 13th century, the Low Countries were largely left to their own devices. The lack of imperial protection also meant that the French and English began vying for influence.\nIn 1214, King Philip II of France defeated the Count of Flanders in the Battle of Bouvines and forced his submission to the French crown. Through the remainder of the 13th century, French control over Flanders steadily increased until 1302 when an attempt at total annexation by Philip IV met a stunning defeat when Count Guy humiliated the French knights at the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Philip launched a new campaign that ended with the inconclusive Battle of Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le in 1304. The king imposed harsh peace terms on Flanders, which included ceding the important textile-making centers of Lille and Douai.\nThereafter, Flanders remained a French tributary until the start of the Hundred Years' War in 1337. Paris's influence in the Low Countries was counterbalanced by England, which maintained important ties to the coastal ports and came to dominate the wool-shipping business. Flemish cloth remained a highly valued product, highly dependent on English wool. Any interruption in the supply of that invariably resulted in riots and violence from the weavers' guilds. Flanders received imports from other areas of Europe, but itself purchased little abroad except wine from Spain and France. Bruges became a great commercial center after the Hanseatic League set up business there. From early on, the Low Countries began to develop as a commercial and manufacturing center. Merchants became the dominant class in the towns, with the nobility largely limited to countryside estates.\nBy 1433 most of the Belgian and Luxembourgish territory became part of Burgundy under Philip the Good. When Mary of Burgundy, granddaughter of Philip the Good married Maximilian I, the Low Countries became Habsburg territory. The Holy Roman Empire was unified with Spain under the Habsburg Dynasty after Charles V inherited several domains.\nEspecially during the Burgundy period (the 15th and 16th centuries), Tournai, Bruges, Ypres, Ghent, Brussels, and Antwerp took turns at being major European centers for commerce, industry (especially textiles) and art. Bruges had a strategic location at the crossroads of the northern Hanseatic League trade and the southern trade routes. Bruges was already included in the circuit of the Flemish and French cloth fairs at the beginning of the 13th century, but when the old system of fairs broke down the entrepreneurs of Bruges innovated. They developed, or borrowed from Italy, new forms of merchant capitalism. They employed new forms of economic exchange, including bills of exchange (i.e. promissory notes) and letters of credit. Antwerp eagerly welcomed foreign traders, most notably the Portuguese pepper and spice traders.\nIn art the Renaissance was represented by the Flemish Primitives, a group of painters active primarily in the Southern Netherlands in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and the Franco-Flemish composers. Flemish tapestries and, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Brussels tapestry hung on the walls of castles throughout Europe. The Burgundian princes enhanced their political prestige with economic growth and artistic splendour. These \"Great Dukes of the West\" were effectively sovereigns, with domains extending from the Zuiderzee to the Somme. The urban and other textile industries, which had developed in the Belgian territories since the 12th century, became the economic center of northwestern Europe.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, issued by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, established the so-called Seventeen Provinces, as an entity on its own, apart from the Empire and from France. This comprised all of Belgium, present-day northeastern France, present-day Luxembourg, and present-day Netherlands, except for the lands of the Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge. In Brussels on 25 October 1555, Charles V abdicated Belgica Regia to his son, who in January 1556 assumed the throne of Spain as Philip II.\nDutch Revolt and 80 Years' War.\nThe northern part of Belgica Regia, comprising seven provinces and eventually forming the Dutch Republic, became increasingly Protestant (specifically, Calvinist), while the larger part comprising the ten southern provinces remained primarily Catholic. This schism, and other cultural differences which had been present since ancient times, launched the Union of Atrecht in the Belgian regions, later followed by the Union of Utrecht in the northern regions. When Philip II ascended the Spanish throne he tried to abolish all Protestantism. Portions of Belgica Regia revolted, eventually resulting in the Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic. The horrors of this war\u2014massacres, religious violence, mutinies\u2014were precursors to the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) with which it would merge.\nAfter the Iconoclastic Fury of 1566, Spanish authorities were able to largely gain control of the Low Countries. The most notable event of this period was the Battle of Oosterweel, in which Spanish forces destroyed an army of Dutch Calvinists. King Philip II sent in Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, as Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands from 1567 to 1573. Alba established a special court called the Council of Troubles (nicknamed the \"Council of Blood\"). The Blood Council's reign of terror saw it condemn thousands of people to death without due process and drive the nobles into exile while seizing their property. Alba boasted that he had burned or executed 18,600 persons in the Netherlands, in addition to the far greater number he massacred during the war, many of them women and children; 8,000 persons were burned or hanged in one year, and Alba's Flemish victims totalled at least 50,000.\nThe Dutch Revolt spread to the south in the mid-1570s after the Army of Flanders mutinied for lack of pay and went on the rampage in several cities. At the Battle of Gembloux, on January 31, 1578, the Dutch were followed by Don Juan of Austria, who sent forward a picked force that attacked the rearguard and dispersed it, and then, falling suddenly upon the main body, utterly routed it, killing at least 10,000 rebels. Don Juan of Austria died on October 1, 1578, and was succeeded by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma.\nWith the arrival of large numbers of troops from Spain, Farnese began a campaign of reconquest in the south. He took advantage of the divisions in the ranks of his opponents between the Dutch-speaking Flemish and the Walloon-speaking south to foment growing discord. By doing so he was able to bring back the Walloon provinces to an allegiance to the king. By the treaty of Arras in 1579, he secured the support of the \"Malcontents\", as the Catholic nobles of the south were styled. The seven northern provinces, controlled by Calvinists, responded with the Union of Utrecht, where they resolved to stick together to fight Spain. Farnese secured his base in Hainaut and Artois, then moved against Brabant and Flanders. He captured many rebel towns in the south: Maastricht (1579), Tournai (1581), Oudenaarde (1582), Dunkirk (1583), Bruges (1584), and Ghent (1584).\nOn August 17, 1585, Farnese laid siege to Antwerp. Antwerp was one of the richest cities in northern Europe and a rebel stronghold ever since Spanish and Walloon troops sacked it in 1576. The city was open to the sea, strongly fortified, and well defended under the leadership of Marnix van St. Aldegonde. Engineer Sebastian Baroccio cut off all access to the sea by constructing a bridge of boats across the Scheldt. The Dutch sailed fireships, called Hellburners, against the bridge and blew up a 200-foot-long span and killed 800 Spaniards. The besiegers repaired the damage, however, and pressed the investment. The city surrendered in 1585 as 60,000 Antwerp citizens (60% of the pre-siege population) fled north. Brussels, Mechelen and Geertruidenberg fell the same year.\nFarnese's strategy was to offer generous terms for surrender: there would be no massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual. Catholic refugees from the North regrouped in Cologne and Douai and developed a more militant, tridentine identity. They became the mobilising forces of a popular Counter-Reformation in the South, thereby facilitating the eventual emergence of the state of Belgium.\nIn 1601, the Spanish besieged Ostend, producing more than 100,000 casualties before Ostend finally fell in 1604. While the former northern part of Belgica Regia, the Seven United Provinces, gained independence, Southern Belgica Regia remained under the rule of Spain (1556\u20131713). The southern part spoke various romance languages and the northern part used Dutch, yet court accounts were kept in Spanish.\n17th and 18th centuries.\nDuring the 17th century, Antwerp continued to be blockaded by the Dutch but became a major European center for industry and art. The Brueghels, Peter Paul Rubens and Van Dyck's baroque paintings were created during this period.\nWars between France and the Dutch Republic.\nAfter the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659), Spain shifted most of its troops out of Belgium to Iberia. From 1659, Madrid increasingly relied on the aid of allied armies to restrain French ambitions to annex the Spanish Netherlands. Under Louis XIV (1643\u20131715), France pursued an expansionist policy. France frequently held control of territories in the Southern Netherlands, confronted by various opponents including the Netherlands and Austria. There was the War of Devolution (1667\u20131668), the Franco-Dutch War (1672\u20131678), the War of the Reunions (1683\u20131684), and the Nine Years' War (1688\u20131697). These were then followed by the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714), much of which was fought on Belgian soil. After the victory of Austria and its allies, under the 1714 Treaty of Rastatt, the Belgian and present-day Luxembourg territories (except the lands under the lordship of the Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge) were transferred to the Austrian Habsburgs, thus forming the Austrian Netherlands (1714\u20131797).\nBrabant Revolution.\nThe Brabant Revolution of 1789\u20131790 (also known as the Belgian Revolution of 1789\u20131790) overlapped with the French Revolution, and called for independence from Austrian rule. Brabant rebels, under the command of Jean-Andr\u00e9 van der Mersch, defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout and founded the United States of Belgium together with the Prince Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge. The new state was beset by factionalism between the radical \"Vonckists\", led by Jan Frans Vonck and the more conservative \"Statists\" of Henri Van der Noot. Businessmen with widescale operations generally supported the Statists, while the Vonckists attracted small business and members of the trade guilds. They called for independence from Austria but were conservative in social and religious questions. By November 1790, the revolt had been crushed and the Habsburg monarchy had returned to power.\nFrench control.\nFollowing the of the French Revolutionary Wars, Belgium Austriacum was invaded and annexed by France in 1795, ending Habsburg rule. Southern Netherlands and the territory of Li\u00e8ge was divided into nine united \"d\u00e9partements\" and became an integral part of France. The Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge was dissolved and divided over the \"d\u00e9partements\" Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure and Ourte. The Holy Roman Emperor confirmed the loss of Southern Netherlands, by the Treaty of Campo Formio, in 1797.\nNew rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit, but it was not at all popular. Until the establishment of the Consulate in 1799, Catholics were heavily repressed by the French. The first University of Leuven was closed in 1797 and churches were plundered.\nDuring this early period of the French rule, the Belgian economy was completely paralyzed as taxes had to be paid in gold and silver coin while goods bought by the French were paid for with worthless assignats. During this period of systematic exploitation, about 800,000 Belgians fled the Southern Netherlands. The French occupation of Belgium led to further suppression of the Dutch language across the country: French became the only accepted language in public life as well as in economic, political, and social affairs. The measures of the successive French governments and in particular the 1798 massive conscription into the French army were unpopular everywhere, especially in Flemish regions, where it sparked the Peasants' War. The brutal suppression of the Peasants' War marks the starting point of the modern Flemish movement.\nFrance promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining. In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the Industrial Revolution. Godechot finds that after the annexation, Belgium's business community supported the new regime, unlike the peasants, who remained hostile. Annexation opened new markets in France for wool and other goods from Belgium. Bankers and merchants helped finance and supply the French army. France ended the prohibition against seaborne trade on the Scheldt that had been enforced by the Netherlands. Antwerp quickly became a major French port with a world trade, and Brussels grew as well.\nIn 1814, the Allies drove out Napoleon and ended French rule. The plan was to join Belgium and the Netherlands, under Dutch control. Napoleon returned to power briefly during the Hundred Days in 1815, but on his way to recapturing Brussels as his intended power base, was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, 12 miles (19\u00a0km) south of that city.\nUnited Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nAfter Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815, the major victorious powers (Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia) agreed at the Congress of Vienna on uniting the former Austrian Netherlands (\"Belgium Austriacum\") and the former Seven United Provinces, creating the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against any future French invasions. This was under the rule of a Protestant king, William I. Most of the small and ecclesiastical states in the Holy Roman Empire were given to larger states at this time, and this included the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge which now became formally part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nThe enlightened despot William I, who reigned from 1815 to 1840, had almost unlimited constitutional power, the constitution having been written by a number of notable people chosen by him. As despot, he had no difficulty in accepting some of the changes resulting from the social transformation of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the estates as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house.\nWilliam I was a Calvinist and intolerant of the Roman Catholic majority in the southern parts of his newly created kingdom. He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This suppressed the clergy, abolished the privileges of the Roman Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the same civil and political rights to every subject. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing displeased the bishops in the south.\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. His authority was shared with a legislature partly chosen by himself and partly elected by the more prosperous citizens under the constitution. Government was in the hands of national ministries of state, and the old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center. The first fifteen years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the Industrial Revolution allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most of the former Dutch overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century.\nUnrest in the southern provinces.\nProtestants controlled the new country, although they formed only a quarter of the population. In theory, Roman Catholics had full legal equality; in practice few held high state or military offices. The king insisted that schools in the South end their traditional teaching of Roman Catholic doctrine, even though almost everyone there was of that faith. Socially, the French-speaking Walloons strongly resented the king's policy to make Dutch the language of government. There was also growing outrage at the king's insensitivity to social differences. According to Schama, there was growing hostility to the Dutch government.\nPolitical liberals in the south had their own grievances, especially regarding the king's authoritarian style; he seemed uncaring about the issue of regionalism, flatly vetoing a proposal for a French-language teacher-training college in francophone Li\u00e8ge. Finally, all factions in the South complained of unfair representation in the national legislature. The south was industrializing faster and was more prosperous than the north, leading to resentment of northern arrogance and political domination.\nThe outbreak of revolution in France in 1830 was used as a signal for revolt. The demand at first was Home Rule for \"Belgium\", as the southern provinces were now being called, rather than separation. Eventually, revolutionaries began demanding total independence.\nBelgian revolution.\nThe Belgian Revolution broke out in August 1830 when crowds, stirred by a performance of Auber's \"La Muette de Portici\" at the Brussels opera house of \"La Monnaie\", spilled out onto the streets singing patriotic songs. Violent street fighting soon broke out. The liberal bourgeoisie, who had initially been at the forefront of the burgeoning revolution, were appalled by the violence and became willing to accept a compromise with the Dutch.\nOn a political level, the Belgians felt significantly under-represented in the Netherlands' elected Lower Assembly and disliked the unpopular Prince of Orange, the future William II who was the representative of King William I in Brussels. The French-speaking Walloons also felt ostracised in a majority Dutch-speaking country. There were also significant religious grievances felt by the majority Catholic Belgians.\nThe king assumed the protest would blow over. He announced an amnesty for all revolutionaries, except foreigners and the leaders. When this did not succeed he sent in the army. Dutch forces were able to penetrate the Schaerbeek Gate into Brussels, but the advance was stalled in the Parc de Bruxelles under sniper fire. Royal troops elsewhere met determined resistance from revolutionaries at makeshift barricades. It is estimated that there were no more than 1,700 revolutionaries (described by the French Ambassador as an \"undisciplined rabble\") in Brussels at the time, faced with over 6,000 Dutch troops. However, faced with strong opposition, Dutch troops were ordered out of the capital on the night of 26 September. There were also battles around the country as revolutionaries clashed with Dutch forces. Eight Dutch warships bombarded Antwerp following its capture by revolutionary forces.\nBelgian independence was not allowed by the 1815 Congress of Vienna; nevertheless the revolutionaries were regarded sympathetically by the major powers of Europe. In November 1830, the London Conference of 1830 or \"Belgian Congress\" (comprising delegates from Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia and Austria) ordered an armistice on November 4. At the end of November Britain and France proposed no military intervention and the establishment of an independent kingdom of Belgium, which was accepted by the other three more conservative participants, who had favored a military intervention. A protocol signed on 20 January 1831 stated that Belgium would be formed of the regions that did not belong to the North in 1790. The new kingdom would be obliged to remain neutral in foreign affairs. The British foreign secretary Lord Palmerston strongly backed the Prince of Orange as the new king. The Prince proved to be unacceptable to William I, his father, as well as to the French. Finally, Palmerston came up with his second choice, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg, who was accepted by all. On July 21, 1831, the first \"King of the Belgians\" was inaugurated. The date of his acceptance of the constitution \u2013 21 July 1831 \u2013 is marked a national holiday.\nThe liberal bourgeoisie hastily formed a provisional government under Charles Rogier to negotiate with the Dutch, officially declaring Belgian independence on 4 October 1830. The Belgian National Congress was formed to draw up a constitution. Under the new constitution, Belgium became a sovereign, independent state with a constitutional monarchy. However, the constitution severely limited voting rights to the French-speaking haute-bourgeoisie and the clergy, in a country where French was not the majority language. The Catholic church was afforded a good deal of freedom from state intervention.\nThe state of conflict (but not open warfare) with the Netherlands lasted another eight years, but in 1839, the Treaty of London was signed between the two countries and the five great powers of Europe (Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom). By the treaty of 1839, the eastern part of Luxembourg did not join Belgium, but remained a possession of the Netherlands until different inheritance laws caused it to separate as an independent Grand Duchy (the western, French-speaking part of Luxembourg became the Belgian province of that name). Belgium lost Eastern Limburg, Zeelandic Flanders, French Flanders and Eupen. The Netherlands retained the former two while French Flanders remained in French possession. Eupen remained within the German Confederation. The five great powers pledged to protect Belgium's neutrality in the future. In 1914, the violation of Belgium's neutrality would be the stated \"Casus belli\" of Britain's entry into World War I.\nIndependence to World War I.\nIndustrial Revolution.\nMost of society was highly traditional, especially in rural areas, and the quality of education was low. Nevertheless, Belgium was the second country, after Britain, in which the industrial revolution took place. It developed into an open economy focused on industrial exports with strong ties between the banking sector and industry.\nIndustrialization took place in Wallonia starting in the mid-1820s, and especially after 1830. The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs. Coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Li\u00e8ge and Charleroi. The leader was a transplanted Englishman, John Cockerill. His factories at Seraing integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.\nIndustry spread through the Sillon industriel (\"industrial district\"), Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys. By 1830 when iron became important the Belgian coal industry had been long-established, and used steam engines for pumping. Coal was sold to local mills and railways as well as to France and Prussia. The textile industry, based on cotton and flax, employed about half of the industrial workforce for much of the industrial period. Ghent was the premier industrial city in Belgium until the 1880s, when the center of growth moved to Li\u00e8ge, with its steel industry.\nWallonia had rich coalfields over much of its area. Deep mines were not required at first so there were a large number of small operations. There was a complex legal system for concessions; often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper (thanks to the innovation of steam pumping). In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters. By 1856, the average depth in the area west of Mons was 361, and in 1866, some pits had reached down 700 and 900 meters; one was 1,065 meters deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.\nCheap and readily available coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, both of which required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The Sillon industriel, and in particular the \"Pays Noir\" around Charleroi, were the centre of the steel industry until the Second World War.\nRailways.\nThe nation provided an ideal model for showing the value of the railways for speeding the Industrial Revolution. After 1830, the new nation decided to stimulate industry. It funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. The system was very soundly built along British lines, so that profits and wages were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place. L\u00e9opold I went on to build the first railway in continental Europe in 1835, between Brussels and Mechelen. The development of smaller railways in Belgium, notably the Li\u00e8ge\u2013Jemappes line, was launched by tendering contracts to private companies which \"became the model for the extension of small local railways all over the low countries.\"\nBy the 1900s, Belgium was a major exporter of trams and other rail components, exporting vast quantities of railway materials. In South America, 3,800 kilometers of track were owned by Belgian firms, with a further 1,500 kilometers in China. One Belgian entrepreneur, \u00c9douard Empain, known as the \"Tramway King\", built many public transport systems across the world, including the Paris M\u00e9tro.\nOther important businesses included Cockerill-Sambre (steel), the chemical factories of Ernest Solvay, and the firearms maker Fabrique Nationale de Herstal.\nLiberalism and Catholicism.\nBefore the arrival of the socialists in the 1890s, the nation was polarised between the conservative Catholic Party and the secular Liberal Party. The Liberals were anticlerical and wanted to reduce the power of the Church. The conflict came to a head during the \"First School War\" of 1879\u20131884 as Liberal attempts to introduce a greater level of secularism in primary education were beaten back by outraged Catholics. The School War ushered in a period of Catholic Party dominance in Belgian politics that lasted (almost unbroken) until 1917.\nReligious conflict also extended to university education, where secular universities like the Free University of Brussels competed with Catholic universities like the Catholic University of Leuven.\nLinguistic conflict.\nThe majority of those in the north of the country spoke Dutch and other Low Franconian languages while those in the south spoke Langues d'o\u00efl such as French, Walloon and Picard. French became the official language of government after the separation from the Netherlands in 1830 and Belgian cultural life was especially dominated by the French influence, reinforced by economic domination of the industrial south. Flemish was \"reduced to the tongue of a second-class culture.\" Parts of the Flemish population reacted against this. This was partly due to a sense of growing Flemish identity. Flemish victories, like the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302 were celebrated and a Flemish cultural movement, led by figures like Hendrik Conscience was born. About the same time a Walloon Movement emerged, led by Jules Destr\u00e9e and based on loyalty to the French language. Universal suffrage meant the Francophones were a political minority, so the Walloon Movement concentrated on protecting French where it had a majority, and did not contest the expanded use of Dutch in Flemish areas.\nThe Flemish goal of linguistic equality (especially in schools and courts) was finally achieved by a series of laws in the 1920s and 1930s. Dutch became the language of government, education, and the courts in the northern provinces of East and West Flanders, Antwerp, Limburg, and eastern Brabant. French remained the official language in Wallonia; Brussels, which had seen a major language shift to French, became an officially bilingual region. Meanwhile, a small separatist Flemish movement had emerged; the Germans had supported it during the war, and in the 1930s it turned fascist. In the Second World War it collaborated with the Nazis.\nForeign relations and military policy.\nIn the mid-1860s during the \"Mexican Adventure\", around 1,500 Belgian soldiers joined the \"Belgian Expeditionary Corps\", better known as the \"Belgian Legion\" to fight for Emperor Maximilian I, whose wife Charlotte was the daughter of Leopold I of Belgium.\nBelgium was not a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War 1870\u201371, but the proximity of the war led to the mobilisation of the army. After the conflict, there was talk of modernising the military. The system of \"Remplacement\" (whereby wealthy Belgians conscripted into the military could pay for a \"replacement\") was abolished and an improved system of conscription implemented. These reforms, led by d'Anethan under pressure from Leopold II, divided Belgian politics. The Catholics united with the Liberals under Fr\u00e8re-Orban to oppose them, and the reforms were finally defeated when d'Anethan's government fell during an unrelated scandal. Eventually, the military was reformed. The 1909 System instituted compulsory military service of eight years on active duty and five years in the reserves. This swelled the size of the Belgian army to over 100,000 well-trained men. Construction of a chain of forts along the border was intensified, and let to a series of very modern fortifications, including the so-called \"National redoubt\" at Antwerp, at the fortified positions of Li\u00e8ge and Namur, many of them designed by the Belgian fortress architect, Henri Alexis Brialmont.\nRise of the Socialist Party and the trade unions.\nThe economy was stagnant during the long depression of 1873\u20131895, as prices and wages fell and labour unrest grew. The Belgian Workers' Party was founded in 1885 in Brussels. It issued the Charter of Quaregnon in 1894 calling for an end to capitalism and a thorough reorganization of society. During the late 19th century, general strikes became an established aspect of the political process. Between 1892 and 1961, there were 20 major strikes, including 7 general strikes. Many of these had overtly political motives, like the 1893 General Strike that helped achieve universal suffrage.\nOn several occasions, Belgian general strikes escalated into violence. In 1893, soldiers fired on the striking crowd, killing several. Karl Marx wrote, \"There exists but one country in the civilised world where every strike is eagerly and joyously turned into a pretext for the official massacre of the Working Class. That country of single blessedness is Belgium!\"\nNevertheless, Belgium created a welfare net particularly early, thanks in part to the trade unions. Sickness compensation was established in 1894, voluntary old-age insurance in 1900 and unemployment insurance in 1907, achieving good coverage nationwide much more quickly than its neighbours.\nCatholic governments and social policy.\nVarious reforms were introduced under the Catholic governments that led Belgium from the late nineteenth century onwards. In 1887, the system of paying workers in kind and in pubs was outlawed, and joint industrial and labour councils were established. In 1889, labour law councils were reformed, \"with employers facing increasing working class representation.\" That same year, legislation on social housing and women's and child labour was reformed. In 1900, the first law on old-age pensions was approved, while a 1903 law on industrial accidents \"stipulated it was no longer up to the worker to prove his innocence.\" From 1900 onwards, Catholic governments began subsidising unemployment funds, health services and savings banks. Mandatory Sunday rest was approved in 1905, while other reforms were carried out such as reduced working hours for miners, the outlawing of night work for women, and pensions for the military and civil service. Under a law that came into effect in 1892, the employment of women and children under the age of 21 was prohibited. In 1890, a fund of providence and relief for victims of industrial accidents was introduced by law. In 1894, state subsidies were established for sickness funds.\nFollowing the elections of 1894 and 1896, according to one study, \"The Catholics continued steadily carrying out their programme of social reforms, and various Acts were passed for the welfare of the working-classes-old-age pensions, workmen's dwellings, employers liability, subsidies to savings banks and mutual societies for the encouragement of thrift.\" An 1896 law made workshop regulations compulsory for all companies employing at least 10 workers (which changed to 5 workers in 1900), while other social policy measures included employers' industrial accident funds in 1903 and small state subsidies to voluntary unemployment funds in 1907. In 1914, compulsory education was introduced for children between 6 and 14. A National Crisis Fund as set up at the end of 1920 which, according to one study, \"marked an important step towards general compensation for involuntary unemployment.\" Healthcare subsidising by the national government was expanded, as characterised by disability funds in 1912, general medical care (expenses for general practitioner and pharmacist) in 1920, an anti-tuberculosis fund in 1921, basic treatment in 1927, expansion from general to particular medical care (surgery, hospitalisation, preventive medicine); cancer in 1931, and insurance for women and families (marriage premium and premium for death of spouse); death benefits in 1936. In 1919 a scheme for the war-injured was introduced and for the victims of occupational diseases in 1927. From 1928 onwards, means-tested allowances were provided to physically disabled persons. In August 1930, a law was passed making family allowances compulsory in private industry. In 1921, an Act was passed providing for an 8-hour day and 48-hour working week, and in 1936 annual paid holidays were introduced in most industries.\nVoting rights.\nIn 1893, the government rejected a proposal for universal male suffrage. Outraged, the Belgian Labour Party called a General Strike; by April 17, there were more than 50,000 strikers. Violent confrontations broke out with the \"Garde Civique\" (the \"Civil Guard\" or militia) around the country. The government soon backed down, and passed male universal suffrage but reduced its impact by creating plural votes based on wealth, education and age. The Catholic conservatives, with 68% of the seats, remained in power.\nAgain, in 1902 and 1913, there were general strikes aimed at forcing electoral reform and ending the system of plural voting. After the 1913 strike, a commission was created and was expected to remove plural voting, but implementation was delayed by the 1914 German invasion. In 1918, King Albert forged a post-war \"Government of National Union\" and brought about one man, one vote universal male suffrage. The last restrictions on women's voting were lifted in 1948.\nCulture.\nArtistic and literary culture in Belgium began a revival towards the late 19th century. A core element of Belgian nationalism was the scientific study of its national history. The movement was led by Godefroid Kurth, a student of the German historian Ranke. Kurth taught modern historical methods to his students at the University of Li\u00e8ge. The most prominent Belgian historian was Henri Pirenne, who was influenced by this method during his period as a student of Kurth.\nArchitecture and Art Nouveau.\nAt the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, monumental Historicism and Neoclassicism dominated the urban Belgian landscape, particularly in government buildings. Championed in part by King Leopold II, the style can be seen in the Palais de Justice (designed by Joseph Poelaert) and the Cinquantenaire.\nNevertheless, Brussels became one of the major European cities for the development of the Art Nouveau style in the late 1890s. The architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar, and Henry van de Velde became particularly famous for their designs, many of which survive today in Brussels. Four buildings designed by Horta are listed by UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Horta's largest work, the \"Maison du Peuple\" was demolished in 1960.\nEmpire.\nStanard rejects the widely held notion that Belgians were \"reluctant imperialists\". He argues that \"ordinary people came to understand and support the colony. Belgians not only sustained the empire in significant ways, but many became convinced imperialists, evidenced by the widespread, enduring and eagerly embraced propaganda in favor of the Congo.\"\nCongo Free State and Belgian Congo.\nKing Leopold II of Belgium had been the principal shareholder in the Belgian trading company which established trading stations on the lower Congo between 1879 and 1884. At the Berlin Conference of 1884\u20131885 the future Congo was personally assigned to Leopold, who named the territory the Congo Free State. It was originally intended to be an international Free Trade zone, open to all European traders. The area included in this territory was just under 1 million square miles, almost 80 times the size of Belgium. The first infrastructure projects took place during the Free State period, such as a railway that ran from the L\u00e9opoldville to the coast which took several years to complete.\nThe era of the Congo Free State is most infamous for the large number of atrocities committed under it. Since it was, in effect, a business venture, run by a private company headed by Leopold himself, it aimed to gain as much money as possible from primary exports. Leopold's personal fortune was greatly increased through the proceeds of selling Congolese rubber, which had never previously been mass-produced in such quantities, to the growing market for tyres. Between 1885 and 1908, as many as eight million Congolese died of exploitation and disease while the birth rate dropped. These are only rough estimates, as no figures are available for the period.\nTo enforce the rubber quotas, the Force Publique (FP) was created. While the Force Publique was nominally a military force \u2013 it would later fight during both the First and Second World Wars) \u2013 during the Congo Free State period its primary duties involved enforcing rubber quotas via imprisonment, rape, abduction, forced labor, or summary executions. Severing of limbs was sometimes used. A Belgian captain, Leon Rom, ornamented his flowerbeds with the heads of 21 natives.\nFollowing reports from missionaries, there was growing moral outrage, particularly in Britain and the United States. The Congo Reform Association, led by Edmund Dene Morel, was particularly important in this campaign, and published numerous best-selling tracts and pamphlets (including \"Red Rubber\") which reached a vast public. King Leopold appointed and financed his own commission to put these accusations to rest, but it too confirmed the atrocities.\nThe Belgian parliament long refused to take over the colony, which was considered a financial burden. In 1908, the Belgian parliament responded to the international pressure, annexing the Free State. After World War II, Belgium was criticized by the United Nations for making no progress on the political front. Despite propaganda campaigns within Belgium, few Belgians showed much interest in the colony. Also, the government limited the possibility of Congolese settling in Belgium.\nPolitical rights were not granted to the Africans until 1956 when the growing middle class (the so-called \"\u00c9volu\u00e9\") received the franchise, and the economy remained relatively undeveloped despite the mineral wealth of Katanga. At the Round Table Talks on independence, Belgium requested a process of gradual independence over four years, but following a series of riots in 1959, the decision was made to bring forward independence in matter of months. The chaos in which Belgium departed the Congo caused the secession of rich Western-backed province Katanga and the prolonged civil war known as the Congo Crisis.\nChina 1902\u20131931.\nThe Belgian Tianjin Concession in China was established in 1902. There was little investment and no settlement. However it led to a contract to supply an electric light and trolley system. In 1906, Tianjin became the first city in China with a modern public transportation system. The supply of electricity and lighting and the trolley business were profitable ventures. All the rolling stock was supplied by Belgian industries and by 1914, the network also reached nearby Austrian, French, Italian, Japanese and Russian concessions.\nRuanda-Urundi 1917\u20131961.\nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War I, Belgium inherited League of Nations mandates over Ruanda-Urundi.\nThe colony was administered in a similar way as by the former German administrators, continuing policies such as ethnic identity cards. In 1959, moves towards independence could be seen in the territory and agitation by PARMEHUTU, a Hutu political party, was evident. In 1960, the Rwandan Revolution occurred and Belgium changed the appointments of chiefs and vice-chiefs to promote Hutus.\nRuanda-Urundi gained independence in 1962 and its two regions, Rwanda and Burundi, separated.\nWorld War I.\nWhen World War I began, Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg as part of the Schlieffen Plan, trying to take Paris quickly. The threat to France caused Britain to enter the war, using the 1839 agreement as justification. The Belgian army is remembered for their stubborn resistance during the early days of the war, with the army \u2013 around a tenth the size of the Germany Army \u2013 holding up the German offensive for nearly a month, giving the French and British forces time to prepare for the Marne counteroffensive. The German invaders treated any resistance\u2014such as sabotaging rail lines\u2014as illegal and subversive, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation.\nBelgium had a prosperous economy at the start of the war but after four years of occupation, it emerged in a poor state, although Belgium itself had suffered few deaths. The Germans had \"brutally and efficiently stripped the country bare. Machinery, spare parts, whole factories including the roofs, had disappeared eastward. In 1919, 80 percent of its workforce was unemployed.\"\nMilitary role.\nBelgian soldiers fought delaying actions in 1914 during the initial invasion. They succeeded in throwing the elaborate German invasion plan off schedule and helped sabotage the Schlieffen Plan that Berlin had counted on for a quick victory over France. At the Battle of Li\u00e8ge, the town's fortifications were able to hold off the invaders for over a week. The German \"Race to the Sea\" was held off by Belgian forces at the Battle of the Yser. King Albert I stayed in the Yser as commander of the military to lead the army while Broqueville's government withdrew to nearby Le Havre in France.\nBelgian units continued to serve on the front until 1918.\nForces from the Belgian Congo played a major role in the African Campaign and a small unit of Belgian soldiers served on the Eastern Front.\nOccupation 1914\u20131918.\nThe Germans governed the occupied areas of Belgium through a General Governorate of Belgium, while a small area of the country remained unoccupied.\nThe whole country was ruled under martial law. On the advice of the government, civil servants remained in their posts for the duration.\nThe German army executed between 5,500 and 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings ordered by junior German officers. Individuals suspected of partisan activities were summarily shot. Several important Belgian figures, including politician Adolphe Max and historian Henri Pirenne, were deported to Germany.\nThe German occupying authorities viewed the Flemish as an oppressed people and had taken several Flemish-friendly measures, known as \"Flamenpolitik\". This included introducing Dutch as the language of instruction of all state-supported schools in Flanders in 1918. This prompted a renewed Flemish movement in the years following the war. The Flemish \"Frontbeweging\" (\"Soldiers' Movement\") was formed from Flemish soldiers in the Belgian army to campaign for greater use of Dutch language in education and government, though not separatist.\nThe Germans left Belgium stripped and barren. Over a 1.4 million refugees fled to France or to neutral Netherlands. After the systematic atrocities by the German army in the first few weeks of the war, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. There was never a violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. In 1916 Germany shipped 120,000 men and boys to work in Germany; this set off a storm of protest from neutral countries and they were returned. Germany then stripped the factories of all useful machinery, and used the rest as scrap iron for its steel mills.\nInternational relief.\nBelgium faced a food crisis and an international response was organized by the American engineer Herbert Hoover. It was unprecedented in world history. Hoover's Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB) had the permission of Germany and the Allies. As chairman of the CRB, Hoover worked with the leader of the Belgian \"Comit\u00e9 National de Secours et d'Alimentation\" (CNSA), \u00c9mile Francqui, to feed the entire nation for the duration of the war. The CRB imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CN to distribute, and watched over the CN to make sure the German army did not appropriate the food. The CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills, and railroads. Private donations and government grants (78%) supplied an $11-million-a-month budget.\nAt its peak, the American arm, the ARA fed 10.5 million people daily. Britain grew reluctant to support the CRB, preferring instead to emphasize Germany's obligation to supply the relief; Winston Churchill led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort \"a positive military disaster\".\nInterwar period.\nKing Albert returned as a war hero. In contrast, the government and the exiles came back discreetly. Belgium had been devastated\u2014not so much by combat, but rather by German seizure of valuable machinery. Only 81 operable locomotives remained, out of the 3,470 available in 1914. 46 of 51 steel mills were damaged, with 26 destroyed totally. More than 100,000 houses had been destroyed, as well as more than of farmland.\nWaves of popular violence accompanied liberation in November and December 1918 and the government responded through the judicial punishment of collaboration with the enemy conducted between 1919 and 1921. Shop windows were broken and houses sacked, men were harassed, and women's heads were shaved. Journalists who had boycotted and stopped writing called for harsh treatment of the newspapers that submitted to German censorship. Many people stigmatized profiteers and demanded justice. Thus in 1918, Belgium was already confronted with the problems associated with occupation that most European countries only discovered at the end of World War II.\nHowever, despite the status quo, Belgium recovered surprisingly quickly. The first postwar Olympic Games were held in Antwerp in 1920. In 1921, Luxembourg formed a customs union with Belgium.\nReparations.\nGerman reparations to Belgium for damage incurred during the First World War was set at \u00a312.5 billion pounds sterling.\nIn 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles the area of Eupen-Malmedy, along with Moresnet was transferred to Belgium. \"Neutral Moresnet\" was transferred to Belgium, as well as the Vennbahn railway. An opportunity was given to the population to \"oppose\" against the transfer by signing a petition, which gathered few signatures, in large part thanks to intimidation by local authorities, and all regions remain part of Belgium today.\nBelgian requests to annex territory considered as historically theirs from the Dutch, who were perceived as collaborators, was denied.\nBetween January 1923 and August 1925, Belgian and French soldiers were sent to the Ruhr in Germany to force the German government to agree to continue reparation payments. The Occupation of the Ruhr led to the Dawes Plan which allowed the German government more leniency in paying reparations.\nThe League of Nations in 1925 made Belgium the trustee for the former German East Africa which bordered the Belgian Congo to the east. It became Rwanda-Urundi (or \"Ruanda-Urundi\") (modern day Rwanda and Burundi). Although promising the League it would promote education, Belgium left the task to subsidised Catholic missions and unsubsidised Protestant missions. As late as 1962, fewer than 100 natives had gone beyond secondary school. The policy was one of low-cost paternalism, as explained by Belgium's special representative to the Trusteeship Council: \"The real work is to change the African in his essence, to transform his soul, [and] to do that one must love him and enjoy having daily contact with him. He must be cured of his thoughtlessness, he must accustom himself to living in society, he must overcome his inertia.\"\nArt and culture.\nThe Expressionism painting movement found a distinctive form in Flanders under artists like James Ensor, Constant Permeke and L\u00e9on Spilliaert. Belgian Surrealist art grew during the inter-war period, including works by Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Paul Delvaux.\nComic strips became extremely popular in Belgium during the 1930s. One of the most popular comics of the 20th century, Herg\u00e9's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" first appeared in 1929.\nBelgian comics are a distinct subgroup in the comics history, and played a major role in the development of European comics, alongside France with whom they share a long common history. While the comics in the two major language groups and regions of Belgium (Flanders with the Dutch language and Wallonia with French) each have clearly distinct characteristics, they are constantly influencing one another, and meeting each other in Brussels and in the bilingual publication tradition of the major editors. As one of the few arts where Belgium has had an international and enduring impact in the 20th century, comics are known to be \"an integral part of Belgian culture\". Major contributors include Herg\u00e9 with The Adventures of Tintin, Dupuis with Spirou, Willy Vandersteen with Suske en Wiske, Bessy, De Rode Ridder, Robert en Bertrand and many others, Marc Sleen with The Adventures of Nero, Peyo with The Smurfs, Jef Nys with Jommeke, and so many more.\nSales of comic books make up 14% of all book sales in Belgium's northern region of Flanders.\nBelgium has played a major role in the development of the 9th art. In fact, even the designation of comics as the 9th Art is due to a Belgian. Morris introduced the term in 1964 when he started a series about the history of comics in Spirou. Belgium's comic-strip culture has been called by Time magazine \"Europe's richest\", while the Calgary Sun calls Belgium \"the home of the comic strip\". Belgium has several museums dedicated to comic books, comic book heroes and their authors.\nThe growth of comic strips was also accompanied by a popular art movement, exemplified by Edgar P. Jacobs, Jij\u00e9, Willy Vandersteen and Andr\u00e9 Franquin.\nWorld War II.\nBelgium tried to pursue a policy of unaligned neutrality before the war, but on May 10, 1940, the country was invaded by German forces. In the initial attacks, the fortifications which had been constructed to protect the borders like Fort Eben-Emael and the K-W Line were captured or bypassed by German forces. On May 28, after 18 days of fighting, Belgian forces (including the commander in chief, King Leopold III) surrendered. The elected government, under Hubert Pierlot, escaped to form a government in exile.\nBelgian Army in the United Kingdom.\nAfter the defeat in 1940, significant numbers of Belgian soldiers and civilians managed to escape to Britain to join the Belgian army in Exile. Belgian soldiers formed the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, which also included a battery of soldiers from Luxembourg, more often known as the \"Brigade Piron\" after its commanding officer, Jean-Baptiste Piron. The Brigade Piron was involved in the Normandy Invasion and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation. Belgians also served in British special forces units during the war, forming a troop of No.10 Commando which was heavily involved in the Italian Campaign and Landings on Walcheren. The 5th Special Air Service (SAS) was entirely made up of Belgians.\nTwo Belgian squadrons, amounting to over 400 pilots, served in the Royal Air Force during the war, both 349 and 350 Squadrons, which claimed over 50 'kills'. Two Corvettes and a group of Minesweepers were also operated by the Belgians during the Battle of the Atlantic, comprising some 350 men in 1943. Congolese soldiers of the Force Publique were involved in the East African Campaign, as well as in the Middle East and Burma. The Congo was also a vitally important economic asset to the allied powers, particularly through its exports of rubber and uranium; in fact the uranium used during the Manhattan Project \u2013 including that used for the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was supplied by the Belgian firm Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga from Katanga Province.\nOccupation 1940\u20131944.\nBelgium was run by a Germany military government between its surrender and liberation in September 1944.\nThe former fort at Breendonk, near Mechelen was requisitioned by the Nazis and used for detainment and interrogation of Jews, political prisoners and captured members of the resistance. Of the 3,500 incarcerated in Breendonk between 1940 and 1944, 1,733 died. About 300 people were killed in the camp itself, with at least 98 dying from deprivation or torture.\nIn 1940, nearly 70,000 Jews were living in Belgium. Of these, 46 percent were deported from the Mechelen transit camp, while a further 5,034 people were deported via the Drancy internment camp. From the summer of 1942 until 1944, twenty-eight transports left Belgium carrying 25,257 Jews and 351 Roma to eastern Europe, often to Auschwitz. A total of 25,257 Jews were transported (including 5,093 children) and 352 Roma over the Mechelen-Leuven railway to concentration camps. Only 1,205 returned home alive.\nResistance.\nResistance against the German occupiers can be seen at all levels, but was highly fragmented. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist \"Front de l'Ind\u00e9pendance\", but there was also a far-right resistance movement, the \"L\u00e9gion Belge\" which comprised dissident Rexists, and other groups like \"Groupe G\" had no obvious political affiliation.\nResistance to the occupiers chiefly came in the form of helping allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this, for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 14,000 allied airmen to Gibraltar. Sabotage was also used, and \"Group G's\" activities alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 20 million man-hours of labor to repair damages. The resistance were also instrumental in saving Jews and Roma from deportation, for instance the attack on the Twentieth convoy. There was also significant low-level resistance, for instance in June 1941, the City Council of Brussels refused to distribute Stars of David badges. Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation, with one estimate putting the number at 20,000.\nCollaboration.\nDuring Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi political organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities before and during the war. The most significant were the Flemish DeVlag and \"Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond\" (VNV) as well as the Catholic Walloon \"Rexist\" movement. These organisations were also fundamental to encouraging Belgians to enlist in the German army. Two divisions of the Waffen SS, the Flemish 27th SS \"Langemarck\" Division and the Walloon 28th SS \"Wallonien\" Division. Some organisations, like Verdinaso appealed directly to Flemish separatist ideologies, though they did not become very popular.\nAfter the war, many of those who had collaborated \u2013 including many of the guards at Fort Breendonk \u2013 were tried, imprisoned or shot.\nAllied liberation 1944\u20131945.\nBelgium was liberated late in 1944 by Allied forces. On 3 September 1944 the Welsh Guards liberated Brussels. The British Second Army seized Antwerp on 4 of September 1944, and the First Canadian Army began conducting combat operations around the port that same month. Antwerp became a highly prized and heavily fought-over objective because its deep-water port was necessary to keep the Allied armies supplied. The Battle of the Scheldt in October 1944 was fought primarily on Dutch soil, but with the objective of opening the way for boats to Antwerp. The port city was also the ultimate objective of German armies during the Ardennes Offensive which resulted in heavy fighting on Belgian soil during the winter of 1944\u20131945.\nFollowing liberation, 10,000 Belgians who had remained in the country during the occupation were mobilised into the Belgian army in 57 \"Fusilier Battalions\".\nWWII to present.\n\"Royal Question\".\nImmediately after the war, L\u00e9opold III, who had surrendered to the German army in 1940, was released; however, the issue of whether he had betrayed his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented a constitutional dilemma. The Belgian public was concerned that he might be a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met Hitler in Berchtesgaden on November 19, 1940, and had even remarried (to Lilian Baels) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother Prince Charles presided as regent.\nA 1950 referendum produced a very close result. In Flanders, the electorate voted 70% in favour of his return but Wallonia voted 58% against. Brussels also returned a 51% \"No\" vote. Although the referendum narrowly produced a favourable result for L\u00e9opold (about 57.68% in the country as a whole), the militant socialist movement in Li\u00e8ge, Hainaut and other urban centres incited major protests and even called a General Strike against his return. L\u00e9opold III abdicated on July 16, 1951, in favour of his son Baudouin.\nOccupation of Germany, Korean War and EDC.\nBelgian soldiers were assigned to occupy a section of West Germany, known as \"Belgian Forces in Germany\" or FBA-BSD. The last Belgian soldiers left Germany in 2002.\nIn 1950, a unit of volunteers from the Belgian army was sent to fight for the United Nations in the Korean War. The Belgian United Nations Command (or BUNC) arrived in Korea in early 1951, and fought at several key engagements of the conflict, including at the Battle of the Imjin River, Haktang-ni and Chatkol. Over 300 Belgians were killed in action. The last Belgian soldiers returned from Korea in 1955.\nBenelux and Europe.\nOn September 5, 1944, the Benelux Customs Union was created. It entered into force in 1948, and ceased to exist on 1 November 1960, when it was replaced by the Benelux Economic Union after a treaty signed in The Hague on February 3, 1958. The Benelux Parliament was created in 1955.\nThe Treaty of Brussels, signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement, which Belgium became an official member of on April 4, 1949. The headquarters of NATO are located in Brussels, and the headquarters of SHAPE near Mons.\nBelgium was also one of the original founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in July 1952 and of the European Economic Community formed by the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957. Belgium has been a member of the Schengen area since 1985.\nBelgian \"Economic Miracle\".\nMarshall Plan.\nThe American Marshall Plan gave Belgium $559 million in grants from 1948 to 1951. A central goal of the ERP was to promote the growth of productivity along the lines of American management and labor practices. The interest among some Belgian employers in increasing rates of productivity per worker was motivated by the rise in wage levels. But the Americans also intended to inject a new \"spirit of productivity\" in Belgian industries, which implied, among other measures, a reinforcement of structures of corporatist negotiation. After the belated establishment of the Belgian Office for the Increase of Productivity in 1952, the political character of the program became apparent. The \"policy of productivity\" was successful for a time because it matched the evolution of social reforms. This policy success, however, was rendered impotent by the failure of the economic dimension of the productivity campaigns. The Americans had in effect failed to recognize the structural importance of the major financial groups which dominated heavy industry in Belgium. By not carrying out any large-scale programs of innovation and investment in the key sectors that they controlled in the aftermath of the war, these holding companies greatly restricted the scope for American influence. Consequently, it was by other means, such as the training of managers, that American paradigms entered Belgian economic culture.\nGrowth and poverty.\nAfter the war, the government cancelled Belgium's debts. It was during this period that the well-known Belgian highways were built. In addition, both the economy and the average standard of living rose significantly. As noted by Robert Gildea, \"Social and economic policy was designed to restore liberal capitalism tempered by social reform, as prepared for during the war. Trade unions were also involved in a price and wage policy to cut inflation and this, together with the Allied use of Antwerp as the main entry point for war supplies, produced the so-called Belgian miracle of high economic growth combined with high wages.\" According to one study, Belgian workers by 1961 earned wages \"second only to those of the French in the Common Market area\", and earned 40% more than their Dutch counterparts.\nDespite postwar affluence, however, many Belgians continued to live in poverty. An organisation of several poverty action groups, known as the National Action for Security of Subsistence, claimed that more than 900,000 Belgians (about 10% of the population) lived in poverty in 1967, while in the early 1970s, a group of social scientists called the Working Group on Alternative Economics estimated that about 14.5% of the Belgian population lived in poverty.\nBecause Flanders had been widely devastated during the war and had been largely agricultural since the Belgian uprising, it benefited most from the Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the European Union and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The economic balance between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia than it was before 1939.\nSecond \"School War\" 1950\u20131959.\nAfter victory in the 1950 elections, a Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP) government came to power. The new education minister, Pierre Harmel, increased the wages of teachers in private (Catholic) schools and introduced laws linking the subsidies for private schools to the number of pupils. These measures were perceived by the anti-clerical Liberals and Socialists as a \"declaration of war\".\nWhen the 1954 elections brought to power a coalition of Socialists and Liberals, the new Education Minister, Leo Collard, immediately set out to reverse the measures taken by his predecessor, founding a large number of secular schools and only permitting teachers with a diploma, forcing many priests out of the profession. These measures sparked mass protests from the Catholic bloc. A compromise was eventually found by the next government (a Catholic minority led by Gaston Eyskens), and the \"Schools War\" was concluded by the November 6, 1958 \"School Pact\".\nCongolese independence and the Congo Crisis.\nAfter riots in the Congo in 1959, the scheduled gradual transition to independence was sped up dramatically. In June 1960, the Belgian Congo was replaced by the short-lived First Republic of Congo, led by the democratically elected Congolese statesman Patrice Lumumba. Belgian forces withdrew, leaving the military Force Publique under Congo's control. Order broke down as mutinying soldiers attacked whites who remained in the country. Belgians forces were briefly sent to evacuate Belgian nationals and army officers.\nIn July 1960, the southern state of Katanga Province declared its independence, forming the State of Katanga. Katanga's bid for sovereignty was supported by Belgian mining companies and soldiers, who had considerable assets in the area. Later that month, United Nations peacekeepers were deployed to the country. During this period of anarchy, the region of South Kasai also declared independence. Western powers including Belgium supported Joseph Mobutu, who installed a right-wing regime in the Congo. Lumumba was murdered and civil war ensued. Belgian paratroopers were again deployed, this time to rescue civilian hostages captured in Stanleyville during an operation known as \"Dragon Rouge\". At the end Mobutu emerged as the ruler of the re-unified country, which he named Zaire.\nGeneral Strike of 1960\u201361.\nIn December 1960, Wallonia was gripped by a general strike in response to the general decline of Wallonian manufacturing in a period of turbulence in the aftermath of the \"Second Schools War\". The Wallonian workers demanded federalism, in addition to structural reforms. Even though the strike had been intended to be nationwide, Flemish workers appeared reluctant to support it.\nThe Strike was led by Andr\u00e9 Renard, the founder of \"Renardism\" which combined militant socialism with Walloon nationalism. The historian Ren\u00e9e Fox described Wallonia's alienation:\nAt the beginning of the 1960s (...), a major reversal in the relationship between Flanders and Wallonia was taking place. Flanders had entered a vigorous, post\u2013World War II period of industrialization, and a significant percentage of the foreign capital (particularly from the United States, coming into Belgium to support new industries, was being invested in Flanders. In contrast, Wallonia's coal mines and time-worn steel plants and factories were in crisis. The region had lost thousands of jobs and much investment capital. A new Dutch-speaking, upwardly mobile \"populist bourgeoisie\" was not only becoming visible and vocal in Flemish movements but also in both the local and national policy... [The strike of December 1960 against the austerity law of Gaston Eyskens ] was replaced by a collective expression of the frustrations, anxieties, and grievances that Wallonia was experiencing in response to its altered situation, and by the demands of the newly formed Walloon Popular Movement for...regional autonomy for Wallonia...\nNationwide the economy was generally healthy with an annual growth rate of 5% in the 1960s. However old inefficient factories were being shut down in textiles and leather goods. Coal miners were angered by the closure of used-up mines. Limburg miners at the Zwartberg mine rioted in 1966 to protest its closure. Two miners were killed by police and ten were injured, while nineteen policemen were hurt. In 1973 a series of worldwide crises adversely affected the Belgian economy.\n\"Linguistic Wars\".\nThis Flemish resurgence has been accompanied by a corresponding shift of political power to the Flemish, who constituted the majority of the population of around 60%. An official Dutch translation of the constitution was only accepted in 1967.\nThe linguistic wars reached a climax in 1968 with the splitting of the Catholic University of Leuven along linguistic lines into the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain. The government of Paul Vanden Boeynants fell over the issue in 1968.\nRise of the federal state.\nThe successive linguistic disputes made the successive Belgian governments very unstable. The three major parties all split in two according to their French- or Dutch-speaking electorate. A language border was determined by the first Gilson Act of November 8, 1962. The boundaries of certain provinces, arrondissements and municipalities were modified and facilities for linguistic minorities were introduced in 25 municipalities. On August 2, 1963, the second Gilson Act entered into force, fixing the division of Belgium into four language areas: a Dutch, a French and a German language area, with Brussels as a bilingual area.\nIn 1970, there was a first state reform, which resulted in the establishment of three cultural communities: Dutch, French and German. This reform was a response to the Flemish demand for cultural autonomy. The constitutional revision of 1970 also laid the foundations for the establishment of three Regions, which was a response to the demand of the Walloons and the French-speaking inhabitants of Brussels for economic autonomy. On February 18, 1970, Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens announced the end of \"La Belgique de papa\".\nThe second state reform took place in 1980, when the cultural communities became Communities. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community. Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge the institutions of the Community and the Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the Brussels-Capital Region was not established until the third state reform.\nDuring the third state reform in 1988 and 1989, under Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, the Brussels-Capital Region was established with its own regional institutions, as well as Dutch and French institutions for community matters. The Brussels-Capital Region remained limited to 19 municipalities. Other changes included that the competencies of the Communities and Regions were expanded. One notable responsibility that was transferred to the Communities during the third state reform was education.\nThe fourth state reform, which took place in 1993 under Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, consolidated the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a fully-fledged federal state. The first article of the Belgian Constitution was amended to read, \"Belgium is a Federal State which consists of Communities and Regions\". During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the Province of Brabant into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, and the reformation of the Federal Parliament's bicameral system and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the Federal Government. The first direct elections for the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions took place on May 21, 1995.\nIn 2001, a fifth state reform took place, under Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, with the Lambermont and the Lombard Accords. More powers were transferred to the Communities and the Regions, with regard to agriculture, fisheries, foreign trade, development cooperation, auditing of electoral expenses and the supplementary financing of the political parties. The Regions became responsible for twelve regional taxes, and local and provincial government became a matter for the Regions. The first municipal and provincial elections under the supervision of the Regions were in 2006. The functioning of the Brussels institutions was also amended during the fifth state reform, which resulted among other things in a guaranteed representation of the Flemish inhabitants in the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region.\nAt the end of 2011, following the longest political crisis in Belgium's contemporary history, a constitutional accord between the four main political families (socialists, liberals, social-Christians, ecologists), but excluding the Flemish nationalists, ushered in the sixth state reform which provided for major institutional changes and additional transfers of competences from the federal level to the Communities and the Regions. Among other changes, the Senate ceased to be directly elected to become an assembly of regional parliaments, the Brussels-Capital Region was granted constitutive autonomy, and the Regions received economic, employment and family welfare competences as well as greater fiscal autonomy.\nBelgium was one of the founders of the European Common Market. Between 1999 and 2002, the Euro gradually replaced the Belgian franc (the currency of Belgium since 1830) at the rate of 1 EUR=40.3399 BEF Belgian Euro coins usually depict King Albert II on the obverse.\nPolitical parties.\nFrom the 1960s, most political parties, which had previously stood in elections in both Flemish and Walloon areas, split down linguistic divides. The Catholic party split in 1968 while the Belgian Socialist Party split in 1978 into the French-speaking and Flemish Socialistische Partij. The Liberals also split on regional lines in 1992.\n\"Green\" politics in Belgium became quite successful in the aftermath of the Marc Dutroux Scandal and the \"Dioxin Affair\".\nMarc Dutroux scandal.\nIn 1996, confidence in the political and criminal justice systems was shaken by the news that Marc Dutroux and his accomplices had kidnapped, tortured, and murdered young girls. Parliamentary inquiries found the police forces were incompetent and bureaucratic, and the judicial system suffered from bureaucracy, very poor communication with, and support for, the victims, slow procedures and many loopholes for criminals. On October 26, 1996, about 300,000 Belgians joined the \"White March\" in Brussels in protest.\nBelgian military intervention since 1990.\nThe United Nations mission in Rwanda during the Rwandan Civil War, known as UNAMIR, involved a significant Belgian contingent under the command of Rom\u00e9o Dallaire. Belgium, as the former colonial power in the country, sent the largest force of around 400 soldiers from the 2nd Commando Battalion.\nAfter the downing of the Rwandan and Burundian presidential plane 10 Belgian peacekeepers were murdered by the Hutu-dominated government army. In response, Belgium withdrew all of its peacekeepers, blaming UNAMIR for failing to rescue their men. The Belgians had represented the largest and most capable element in the UNAMIR mission, leaving it incapacitated and unable to cope with the events of the Rwandan genocide.\nBelgian paratroopers were deployed to Somalia during Operation Restore Hope as part of UNOSOM tasked with securing aid deliveries and peacekeeping. Several Belgian soldiers were killed during the deployment.\nDuring the Kosovo crisis of 1999, 600 Belgian paratroopers participated in Operation Allied Harbour, a NATO operation to protect and provide assistance to the huge number of ethnic Albanian refugees in Albania and Macedonia. That same year, 1,100 Belgian soldiers participated in the Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force.\nBelgian soldiers have served in Lebanon, under the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Approximately 394 Belgians have served in Lebanon, in demining and medical operations, and a frigate is also present.\nIn the 2011, the Belgian Air Force deployed six fighter jets in support of the NATO intervention in the Libyan Civil War in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. Belgian aircraft were involved in airstrikes on pro-Ghadaffi forces.\nBelgium was part of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan, joint with soldiers from Luxembourg. The main objective was providing security at Kabul International Airport, while detachments assisted in the northern PRTs of Kunduz and Mazar-i-Sharif. In September 2008, four F\u201116 jets with about 140 support personnel were deployed.\nDebt and economic slowdown.\nBelgium created huge debts during times when rates were low and generated new debts to service the initial debt. Its debts amounted to about 130% of the GDP in 1992 and were decreased to about 108,2% in 2001. This drastic economic policy resulted in deep budget spending cuts, such as cuts to scientific research.\nInternal politics.\nIn the 1999 Belgian federal election, the traditional government parties suffered a significant defeat due to the so-called \"Dioxin Affair\", leading to the fall of Jean-Luc Dehaene's government after eight years in office. Guy Verhofstadt formed a government of Liberals, Socialists and Greens.\nIn July 1999, a government of Greens and Flemish Liberals and Democrats announced a gradual phase-out of Belgium's seven nuclear reactors after 40 years of operation. Though it was speculated that the next government without Greens would immediately revoke this legislation. after the 2003 elections there was still no sign of a policy reversal, particularly in the aftermath of the incident at Tihange reactor in 2002.\nThe Belgian government was strongly opposed to the Iraq War during the Iraq crisis of 2003. The Verhofstadt government proposed a diplomatic solution regarding WMD.\nOn January 30, 2003, Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriage. A 2005 proposal allowed adoption by same-sex partners.\nPolitical crisis 2010\u201311.\nThe 2010 Belgian federal election produced a highly fragmented political landscape, with 11 parties elected to the Chamber of Representatives, none of which had more than 20% of the seats. The separatist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), the largest party in Flanders and the country as a whole, controlled 27 of 150 seats in the lower chamber. Belgium beat the world record for time taken to form a new democratic government after an election, at 353 days. Finally a government coalition was sworn in on 6 December 2011, with Socialist Elio Di Rupo becoming prime minister.\n2014\u2013present.\nThe 2014 election resulted in a further electoral gain for the Flemish nationalist N-VA, although the incumbent coalition maintained a solid majority. On 22 July 2014, King Philippe nominated Charles Michel (MR) and Kris Peeters (CD&amp;V) to lead the formation of a new coalition federal cabinet.\nIn July 2019 prime minister Charles Michel was selected as President of the European Council. His successor Sophie Wilm\u00e8s was Belgium's first female prime minister. Alexander De Croo became prime minister in October 2020.\nOn 3 February 2025, Bart De Wever, leader of the New Flemish Alliance, became the new prime minister. He is the first Flemish nationalist to be named Belgian premier.\nSee also.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nReference and surveys.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitical history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEconomic, cultural and social history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography and memory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Possibly as a result of this unique property, the spira mirabilis has evolved in nature, appearing in certain growing forms such as nautilus shells and sunflower heads.

It is the country's cultural, educational, economic, political and administrative center and the seat of the Urban Municipality of Ljubljana.\nDuring antiquity, a Roman city called Emona stood in the area. The city was first mentioned in the first half of the 12th century. It was the historical capital of Carniola, one of the Slovene-inhabited parts of the Habsburg monarchy. It was under Habsburg rule from the Middle Ages until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. After World War II, Ljubljana became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The city retained this status until Slovenia became independent in 1991 and Ljubljana became the capital of the newly formed state.\nName.\nThe exact origin of the name \"Ljubljana\" is unclear. In medieval times, both the river and the town were also called \"Laibach\" () in German. This name was used within the region until 1918 and continues to be used in German. In Italian, the city is referred to as \"Lubiana\", and in Latin, it is known as \"Labacum\". An archaic English form of the city's name is \"Lublyana\", used primarily by Slovene Americans.\nThe German name was first documented in 1144, and the Slovenian form appeared in records as early as 1146. The 10th-century work \"Life of Gregentios\" provides the Greek variant (\"Lyplian\u00e9s\") and situates it among the Avars in the 6th century. This account is influenced by an earlier northern Italian source written shortly after the conquest of 774.\nThe connection between the Slovene and German names has posed a puzzle for scholars. In 2007, linguist Tijmen Pronk, an authority in comparative Indo-European linguistics and Slovene dialectology from the University of Leiden, provided strong support for the theory that the Slavic \"ljub-\" 'to love, like' was the most likely origin. He argued that the river's name likely stemmed from the settlement's name. Silvo Torkar, a linguist with expertise in Slovene names, put forth the idea that Ljubljana's name has its roots in \"Ljubija\", the original name of the Ljubljanica River. This can be traced back to the Old Slavic male name \"Ljubovid\", which translates to 'the one with a lovely appearance'. Torkar also asserted that the name \"Laibach\" is a combination of German and Slovene, sharing its origins with the same personal name.\nDragon symbol.\nThe city's symbol is the Ljubljana Dragon. It is depicted on the top of the tower of Ljubljana Castle in the Ljubljana coat of arms and on the Ljubljanica-crossing Dragon Bridge (). It represents power, courage, and greatness.\nSeveral explanations describe the origin of the Ljubljana Dragon. According to a Slavic myth, the slaying of a dragon releases the waters and ensures the fertility of the earth, and it is thought that the myth is tied to the Ljubljana Marsh, the expansive marshy area that periodically threatens Ljubljana with flooding. According to Greek legend, the Argonauts on their return home after having taken the Golden Fleece found a large lake surrounded by a marsh between the present-day towns of Vrhnika and Ljubljana. There Jason struck down a monster. This monster evolved into the dragon that today is present in the city coat of arms and flag.\nIt is historically more believable that the dragon was adopted from Saint George, the patron of the Ljubljana Castle chapel built in the 15th century. In the legend of Saint George, the dragon represents the old ancestral paganism overcome by Christianity. According to another explanation, related to the second, the dragon was at first only a decoration above the city coat of arms. In the Baroque, it became part of the coat of arms and, in the 19th and especially the 20th century, it outstripped the tower and other elements in importance.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nAround 2000 BC, the Ljubljana Marsh was settled by people living in pile dwellings. Prehistoric pile dwellings and the oldest wooden wheel in the world are among the most notable archeological findings from the marshland. These lake-dwelling people survived through hunting, fishing and primitive agriculture. To get around the marshes, they used dugout canoes made by cutting out the inside of tree trunks. Their archaeological remains, nowadays in the Municipality of Ig, have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since June 2011, in the common nomination of six Alpine states.\nLater, the area remained a transit point, for groups including the Illyrians, followed by a mixed nation of the Celts and the Illyrians called the Iapodes, and then in the 3rd century BC a Celtic tribe, the Taurisci.\nAntiquity.\nAround 50 BC, the Romans built a military encampment that later became a permanent settlement called Iulia Aemona. This entrenched fort was occupied by the \"Legio XV Apollinaris\". In 452, it was destroyed by the Huns under Attila's orders, and later by the Ostrogoths and the Lombards. Emona housed 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants and played an important role during battles. Its plastered brick houses, painted in different colours, were connected to a drainage system.\nIn the 6th century, the ancestors of the Slovenes moved in. In the 9th century, they fell under Frankish domination, while experiencing frequent Magyar raids. Not much is known about the area during the settlement of Slavs in the period between the downfall of Emona and the Early Middle Ages.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe parchment sheet \"Nomina defunctorum\" (\"Names of the Dead\"), most probably written in the second half of 1161, mentions the nobleman Rudolf of Tarcento, a lawyer of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, who had bestowed a canon with 20 farmsteads beside the castle of Ljubljana (\"castrum Leibach\") to the Patriarchate. According to the historian Peter \u0160tih's deduction, this happened between 1112 and 1125, the earliest mention of Ljubljana.\nThe property changed hands repeatedly until the first half of the 12th century. The territory south of the Sava where Ljubljana developed, gradually became property of the Carinthian Dukes of the House of Sponheim. Urban settlement started in the second half of the 12th century. At around 1200, market rights were granted to Old Square (), which at the time was one of Ljubljana's three original districts. The other two districts were an area called \"Town\" (), built around the predecessor of the present-day Ljubljana Cathedral at one side of the Ljubljanica River, and New Square () at the other side. The Franciscan Bridge, a predecessor of the present-day Triple Bridge, and the Butchers' Bridge connected the walled areas with wooden buildings. Ljubljana acquired the town privileges at some time between 1220 and 1243. Seven fires erupted during the Middle Ages. Artisans organised themselves into craft guilds. The Teutonic Knights, the Conventual Franciscans, and the Franciscans settled there. In 1256, when the Carinthian duke Ulrich III of Spanheim became lord of Carniola, the provincial capital was moved from Kamnik to Ljubljana.\nIn the late 1270s, Ljubljana was conquered by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. In 1278, after Ottokar's defeat, it became\u2014together with the rest of Carniola\u2014property of Rudolph of Habsburg. It was administered by the Counts of Gorizia from 1279 until 1335, when it became the capital town of Carniola. Renamed \"Laibach\", it was owned by the House of Habsburg until 1797. In 1327, the Ljubljana's \"Jewish Quarter\"\u2014now only \"Jewish Street\" () remains\u2014was established with a synagogue, and lasted until Emperor Maximilian I in 1515 and expelled the Jews from Ljubljana at the request of its citizens, for which he demanded a certain payment from the town. In 1382, in front of St. Bartholomew's Church in \u0160i\u0161ka, at the time a nearby village, now part of Ljubljana, a peace treaty was signed between the Republic of Venice and Leopold III of Habsburg.\nEarly modern.\nIn the 15th century, Ljubljana became recognised for its art, particularly painting and sculpture. The Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana was established in 1461 and the Church of St. Nicholas became the diocesan cathedral. After the 1511 Idrija earthquake, the city was rebuilt in the Renaissance style and a new wall was built around it. Wooden buildings were forbidden after a large fire at New Square in 1524.\nIn the 16th century, the population of Ljubljana numbered 5,000, 70% of whom spoke Slovene as their first language, with most of the rest using German. The first secondary school, public library and printing house opened in Ljubljana. Ljubljana became an important educational centre.\nFrom 1529, Ljubljana had an active Slovene Protestant community. They were expelled in 1598, marking the beginning of the Counter-Reformation. Catholic Bishop Thomas Chr\u00f6n ordered the public burning of eight cartloads of Protestant books.\nIn 1597, the Jesuits arrived, followed in 1606 by the Capuchins, seeking to eradicate Protestantism. Only 5% of all the residents of Ljubljana at the time were Catholic, but eventually they re-Catholicized the town. The Jesuits staged the first theatre productions, fostered the development of Baroque music, and established Catholic schools. In the middle and the second half of the 17th century, foreign architects built and renovated monasteries, churches, and palaces and introduced Baroque architecture. In 1702, the Ursulines settled in the town, and the following year they opened the first public school for girls in the Slovene Lands. Some years later, the construction of the Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity started. In 1779, St. Christopher's Cemetery replaced the cemetery at St. Peter's Church as Ljubljana's main cemetery.\nLate modern.\nFrom 1809 to 1813, during the \"Napoleonic interlude\", Ljubljana (as \"Laybach\") was the capital of the Illyrian Provinces. In 1813, the city returned to Austria and from 1815 to 1849 was the administrative centre of the Kingdom of Illyria in the Austrian Empire. In 1821, it hosted the Congress of Laibach, which fixed European political borders for that period. The first train arrived in 1849 from Vienna and in 1857 the line extended to Trieste.\nIn 1895, Ljubljana, then a city of 31,000, suffered a severe earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum EMS intensity of VIII\u2013IX (\"heavily damaging \u2013 destructive\"). 21 people died due to the earthquake and some 10% of the city's 1,400 buildings were destroyed. During the subsequent reconstruction, some districts were rebuilt in the Vienna Secession style. Public electric lighting arrived in 1898. The rebuilding period between 1896 and 1910 is referred to as the \"revival of Ljubljana\" because of architectural changes that defined the city and for reform of urban administration, health, education and tourism. The rebuilding and quick modernisation of the city were led by the mayor Ivan Hribar.\nIn 1918, following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the region joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1929, Ljubljana became the capital of the Drava Banovina, a Yugoslav province.\nIn 1941, during World War II, Fascist Italy occupied the city, and then on 3 May 1941 made \"Lubiana\" the capital of Italy's Province of Ljubljana with former Yugoslav general Leon Rupnik as mayor. After the Italian capitulation, Nazi Germany with SS-general Erwin R\u00f6sener and Friedrich Rainer took control in 1943, but formally the city remained the capital of an Italian province until 9 May 1945. In Ljubljana, the Axis forces established strongholds and command centres of Quisling organisations, the Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia under Italy and the Home Guard under German control. Starting in February 1942, the city was surrounded by barbed wire, later fortified by bunkers, to prevent co-operation between the resistance movements that operated inside and outside the fence. Since 1985, the commemorative trail has ringed the city where this iron fence once stood. Postwar reprisals filled mass graves.\nAfter World War II, Ljubljana became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It retained this status until Slovene independence in 1991.\nContemporary situation.\nLjubljana is the capital of independent Slovenia, which joined the European Union in 2004.\nGeography.\nThe city covers . It is situated in the Ljubljana Basin in Central Slovenia, between the Alps and the Karst. Ljubljana is located some south of Munich, east of Z\u00fcrich, east of Venice, southwest of Vienna, west of Zagreb and southwest of Budapest. Ljubljana has grown considerably since the 1970s, mainly by merging with nearby settlements.\nGeology.\nThe city stretches out on an alluvial plain dating to the Quaternary era. The mountainous regions nearby are older, dating from the Mesozoic (Triassic) or Paleozoic. Earthquakes have repeatedly devastated Ljubljana, notably in 1511 and 1895.\nTopography.\nLjubljana has an elevation of . The city centre, located along the river, sits at . Ljubljana Castle, which sits atop Castle Hill () south of the city centre, has an elevation of . The highest point of the city, called Grmada, reaches , more than the nearby Mount Saint Mary () peak, a popular hiking destination. These are located in the northern part of the city.\nBodies of water.\nThe main watercourses in Ljubljana are the Ljubljanica, the Sava, the Grada\u0161\u010dica, the Mali Graben, the I\u0161ka and the I\u0161\u010dica rivers. From the Trnovo District to the Moste District, around Castle Hill, the Ljubljanica partly flows through the Gruber Canal, built according to plans by Gabriel Gruber from 1772 until 1780. Next to the eastern border, the rivers Ljubljanica, Sava, and Kamnik Bistrica flow together. The confluence is the lowest point of Ljubljana, with an elevation of .\nThrough its history, Ljubljana has been struck by floods. The latest was in August 2023, when the Sava and Grada\u0161\u010dica rivers flooded in their upper reaches. Southern and western parts of the city are more flood-endangered than northern parts. The Gruber Canal has partly diminished the danger of floods in the Ljubljana Marsh, the largest marsh in Slovenia, south of the city.\nThe two major ponds in Ljubljana are Koseze Pond in the \u0160i\u0161ka District and Tivoli Pond in the southern part of Tivoli City Park. Koseze Pond has rare plant and animal species and is a place of meeting and recreation. Tivoli Pond is a shallow pond with a small volume that was originally used for boating and ice skating, but is now used for fishing.\nClimate.\nLjubljana's climate is oceanic (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), with continental characteristics such as warm summers and moderately cold winters. July and August are the warmest months with daily high temperatures generally between , and January is the coldest month with temperatures mostly around . The city experiences up to 90 days of frost per year, and 11 days with temperatures above (often even more). Precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the seasons, although winter and spring tend to be somewhat drier than summer and autumn. Yearly precipitation is about , making Ljubljana one of the wettest European capitals. Thunderstorms are common from May to September and can occasionally be heavy. Snow is common from December to February; on average, snow cover is recorded for 48 days a year. The city is known for its fog, appearing on average on 64 days per year, mostly in autumn and winter, and can be particularly persistent in conditions of temperature inversion.\nCityscape.\nThe city's architecture is a mix of styles. Large buildings have appeared around the city's edges, while Ljubljana's historic centre remains intact. Some of the oldest architecture dates to the Roman period, while Ljubljana's downtown got its outline in the Middle Ages. After the 1511 earthquake, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style following Italian, particularly Venetian, models.\nAfter the earthquake in 1895, it was again rebuilt, this time in the Vienna Secession style, which is juxtaposed against the earlier Baroque style buildings that remain. Large sectors built in the inter-war period often include a personal touch by the architects Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik and Ivan Vurnik. In the second half of the 20th century, parts of Ljubljana were redesigned by Edvard Ravnikar.\nCentral.\nThe central square in Ljubljana is Pre\u0161eren Square () home to the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation (). Built between 1646 and 1660 (the bell towers followed), it replaced an older Gothic church. It offers an early-Baroque basilica with one nave and two rows of lateral chapels. The Baroque main altar was executed by sculptor Italian Francesco Robba. Much of the original frescos were ruined by ceiling cracks caused by the Ljubljana earthquake in 1895. The new frescos were painted by the Slovene impressionist painter Matej Sternen.\nLjubljana Castle (\"Ljubljanski grad\") is a medieval castle with Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architectural elements, located on the summit of Castle Hill, which dominates the city centre. The area surrounding the castle has been continuously inhabited since 1200 BC. The castle was built in the 12th century and was a residence of the Margraves, later the Dukes of Carniola. Its Viewing Tower dates to 1848; it was manned by a guard whose duty it was to fire cannons announcing fire or important visitors or events, a function the castle still holds. Cultural events and weddings also take place there. In 2006, a funicular linked the city centre to the castle.\nTown Hall (, ), located at Town Square, is the seat of city government. The original, Gothic building was completed in 1484. Between 1717 and 1719, the building underwent a Baroque renovation with a Venetian inspiration by architect Gregor Ma\u010dek Sr. Near Town Hall, at Town Square, stands a replica of the Baroque Robba Fountain. The original was moved into the National Gallery in 2006. The fountain is decorated with an obelisk; at the foot are three figures in white marble symbolising the three chief rivers of Carniola. It is work of Francesco Robba, who designed other Baroque statues there.\nLjubljana Cathedral (), or St. Nicholas's Cathedral (), serves the Archdiocese of Ljubljana. Easily identifiable due to its green dome and twin towers, it is located at Cyril and Methodius Square (, named for Saints Cyril and Methodius). The Diocese was set up in 1461. Between 1701 and 1706, Jesuit architect Andrea Pozzo designed the Baroque church with two side chapels shaped in the form of a Latin cross. The dome was built in the centre in 1841. The interior is decorated with Baroque frescos painted by Giulio Quaglio between 1703\u20131706 and 1721\u20131723.\nNeboti\u010dnik (pronounced , \"Skyscraper\") is a thirteen-story building that rises to a height of . It combines elements of Neoclassical and Art-Deco architecture. Predominantly a place of business, Neboti\u010dnik is home to shops on the ground floor and first story, and offices are located on floors two to five. The sixth to ninth floors are private residences. The top three floors host a caf\u00e9, bar and observation deck. It was designed by Slovenian architect Vladimir \u0160ubic. The building opened on 21 February 1933. It was once the tallest residential building in Europe.\nPublic green spaces.\nTivoli City Park () is the largest park. It was designed in 1813 by French engineer Jean Blanchard and now covers approximately . The park was laid out during the French imperial administration of Ljubljana in 1813 and named after the Parisian Jardins de Tivoli. Between 1921 and 1939, it was renovated by Slovene architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, who unveiled his statue of Napoleon in 1929 in Republic Square and designed a broad central promenade, called the Jakopi\u010d Promenade () after the leading Slovene impressionist painter Rihard Jakopi\u010d. Within the park, there are trees, flower gardens, several statues, and fountains. Several notable buildings stand in the park, among them Tivoli Castle, the National Museum of Contemporary History and the Tivoli Sports Hall.\nTivoli\u2013Ro\u017enik Hill\u2013\u0160i\u0161ka Hill Landscape Park is located in the western part of the city.\nThe Ljubljana Botanical Garden () covers next to the junction of the Gruber Canal and the Ljubljanica, south of the Old Town. It is the central Slovenian botanical garden and the oldest cultural, scientific, and educational organisation in the country. It started operating under the leadership of Franc Hladnik in 1810. Of over 4,500 plant species and subspecies, roughly a third is endemic to Slovenia, whereas the rest originate from other European places and other continents. The institution is a member of the international network Botanic Gardens Conservation International and cooperates with more than 270 botanical gardens all across the world.\nIn 2014, Ljubljana won the European Green Capital Award for 2016 for their environmental achievements.\nBridges, streets and squares.\nLjubljana's best-known bridges, listed from northern to southern ones, include the Dragon Bridge (), the Butchers' Bridge (), the Triple Bridge (), the Fish Footbridge (), the Cobblers' Bridge (), the Hradecky Bridge (), and the Trnovo Bridge (). The last mentioned crosses the Grada\u0161\u010dica, whereas all other bridges cross the Ljubljanica River.\nThe Dragon Bridge.\nThe 1901 Dragon Bridge, decorated with dragon statues on pedestals at four corners of the bridge has become a symbol of the city and is regarded as one of the most beautiful examples of a bridge made in Vienna Secession style. It has a span of and its arch was at the time the third largest in Europe. It is protected as a technical monument.\nThe Butchers' Bridge.\nDecorated with mythological bronze sculptures, created by Jakov Brdar, from Ancient Greek mythology and Biblical stories, the Butchers' Bridge connects the Ljubljana Open Market area and the restaurants-filled Petkov\u0161ek Embankment (). It is also known as the love padlocks-decorated bridge in Ljubljana.\nThe Triple Bridge.\nThe Triple Bridge is decorated with stone balusters and stone lamps on all of the three bridges and leads to the terraces looking on the river and poplar trees. It occupies a central point on the east\u2013west axis, connecting the Tivoli City Park with Ro\u017enik Hill, on one side, and the Ljubljana Castle on the other, and the north\u2013south axis through the city, represented by the river. It was enlarged in order to prevent the historically single bridge from being a bottleneck by adding two side pedestrian bridges to the middle one.\nThe Fish Footbridge.\nThe Fish Footbridge offers a view of the neighbouring Triple Bridge to the north and the Cobbler's Bridge to the South. It is a transparent glass-made bridge, illuminated at night by in-built LEDs. From 1991 to 2014 the bridge was a wooden one and decorated with flowers, while since its reconstruction in 2014, it is made of glass. It was planned already in 1895 by Max Fabiani to build a bridge on the location, in 1913 Alfred Keller planned a staircase, later Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik incorporated both into his own plans which, however, were not realised.\nThe Cobbler's Bridge.\nThe 1930 'Cobblers' Bridge' (, from German \u2013 Shoemaker) is another Ple\u010dnik's creation, connecting two major areas of medieval Ljubljana. It is decorated by two kinds of pillars, the Corinthian pillars which delineate the shape of the bridge itself and the Ionic pillars as lamp-bearers.\nThe Trnovo Bridge.\nThe Trnovo Bridge is the most prominent object of Ple\u010dnik's renovation of the banks of the Grada\u0161\u010dica. It is located in the front of the Trnovo Church to the south of the city centre. It connects the neighbourhoods of Krakovo and Trnovo, the oldest Ljubljana suburbs, known for their market gardens and cultural events. It was built between 1929 and 1932. It is distinguished by its width and two rows of birches that it bears, because it was meant to serve as a public space in front of the church. Each corner of the bridge is capped with a small pyramid, a signature motif of Ple\u010dnik's, whereas the mid-span features a pair of Art-Deco male sculptures. There is also a statue of Saint John the Baptist on the bridge, the patron of the Trnovo Church. It was designed by Nikolaj Pirnat.\nThe Hradecky Bridge.\nThe Hradecky Bridge is one of the first hinged bridges in the world, the first and the only preserved cast iron bridge in Slovenia, and one of its most highly valued technical achievements. It has been situated on an extension of Hren Street (), between the Krakovo Embankment () and the Gruden Embankment (), connecting the Trnovo District and the Prule neighbourhood in the Center District. The Hradecky Bridge was manufactured according to the plans of the senior engineer Johann Hermann from Vienna in the Auersperg iron foundry in Dvor near \u017du\u017eemberk, and installed in Ljubljana in 1867, at the location of today's Cobblers' Bridge.\nStreets and squares.\nHaving already existed in the 18th century, Ljubljana's central square, Pre\u0161eren Square's modern appearance has developed since the end of the 19th century. After the 1895 earthquake, Max Fabiani designed the square as the hub of four streets and four banks, and in the 1980s Edvard Ravnikar proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement. A statue of the Slovene national poet France Pre\u0161eren with a muse stands in the middle of the square. The Pre\u0161eren Monument was created by Ivan Zajec in 1905, whereas the pedestal was designed by Max Fabiani. The square and surroundings have been closed to traffic since 1 September 2007. Only a tourist train leaves Pre\u0161eren Square every day, transporting tourists to Ljubljana Castle.\nRepublic Square, originally named Revolution Square, is the largest square in Ljubljana. It was designed in the second half of the 20th century by Edvard Ravnikar. On 26 June 1991, the independence of Slovenia was declared here. The National Assembly Building stands at its northern side, and Cankar Hall, the largest Slovenian cultural and congress centre, at the southern side. At its eastern side stands the two-storey building of Maximarket, also the work of Ravnikar. It houses one of the oldest department stores in Ljubljana and a cafe, which is a popular meeting place and a place for political talks and negotiations.\nCongress Square () is one of the important centres of the city. It was built in 1821 for ceremonial purposes such as Congress of Ljubljana after which it was named. Since then it has been a centre for political ceremonies, demonstrations, and protests, such as the ceremony for the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, ceremony of the liberation of Belgrade, and protests against Yugoslav authority in 1988. The square also houses several important buildings, such as the University of Ljubljana Palace, Philharmonic Hall, Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity, and the Slovene Society Building. Star Park () is located in the centre of the square. In 2010 and 2011, the square was renovated and is now mostly closed to road traffic on ground area, however, there are five floors for commercial purposes and a parking lot located underground.\n\u010cop Street () is a major thoroughfare in the centre of Ljubljana. The street is named after Matija \u010cop, an early 19th-century literary figure and close friend of the Slovene Romantic poet France Pre\u0161eren. It leads from the Main Post Office () at Slovene Street () downward to Pre\u0161eren Square and is lined with bars and stores, including the oldest McDonald's restaurant in Slovenia. It is a pedestrian zone and regarded as the capital's central promenade.\nCulture.\nAccent.\nThe Ljubljana accent and/or dialect ( ) is considered a border dialect, since Ljubljana is situated where the Upper dialect and Lower Carniolan dialect group meet. Historically, the Ljubljana dialect in the past displayed features more similar with the Lower Carniolan dialect group, but it gradually grew closer to the Upper dialect group, as a direct consequence of mass migration from Upper Carniola into Ljubljana in the 19th and 20th century. Ljubljana as a city grew mostly to the north, and gradually incorporated many villages that were historically part of Upper Carniola and so its dialect shifted away and closer to the Upper dialects. The Ljubljana dialect has also been used as a literary means in novels, such as in the novel \"Nekdo drug\" by Branko Gradi\u0161nik, or in poems, such as \"Pika Nogavi\u010dka\" (Slovene for Pippi Longstocking) by Andrej Rozman - Roza.\nThe central position of Ljubljana and its dialect had crucial impact on the development of the Slovenian language. It was the speech of 16th century Ljubljana that Primo\u017e Trubar a Slovenian Protestant Reformer took as a foundation of what later became standard Slovenian language, with a small addition of his native speech, the Lower Carniolan dialect. While in Ljubljana, he lived in a house, on today's Ribji trg, in the oldest part of the city. Living in Ljubljana had a profound impact on his work; he considered Ljubljana the capital of all Slovenes, not only because of its central position in the heart of the Slovene lands, but also because it always had an essentially Slovene character. Most of its inhabitants spoke Slovene as their mother tongue, unlike other cities in today's Slovenia. It is estimated that in Trubar's time around 70% of Ljubljana's 4000 inhabitants attended mass in Slovene. Trubar considered Ljubljana's speech most suitable, since it sounded much more noble than his own simple dialect of his hometown Ra\u0161ica. Trubar's choice was later adopted also by other Protestant writers in the 16th century, and ultimately led to a formation of a more standard language.\nIn literary fiction.\nLjubljana appears in the 2005 \"The Historian\", written by Elisabeth Kostova, and is called by its Roman name (Emona).\nLjubljana is also the setting of Paulo Coelho's 1998 novel \"Veronika Decides to Die\".\nDuring 2010, Ljubljana was designated as the World Book Capital by UNESCO.\nFestivals.\nEach year, over 10,000 cultural events take place in the city, including ten international theatre, music, and art festivals. The Ljubljana Festival is one of the two oldest festivals in former Yugoslavia (the Dubrovnik Summer Festival was established in 1950, and the Ljubljana Festival one in 1953). Guests have included Dubravka Tom\u0161i\u010d, Marjana Lipov\u0161ek, Toma\u017e Pandur, Katia Ricciarelli, Grace Bumbry, Yehudi Menuhin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Jos\u00e9 Carreras, Slide Hampton, Zubin Mehta, Vadim Repin, Valery Gergiev, Sir Andrew Davis, Danjulo Ishizaka, Midori, Yuri Bashmet, Ennio Morricone, and Manhattan Transfer.

Other cultural venues include Kri\u017eanke, Cankar Hall and the Exhibition and Convention Centre. During Book Week, starting each year on World Book Day, events and book sales take place at Congress Square. A flea market is held every Sunday in the old city. On the evening of International Workers' Day, a celebration with a bonfire takes place on Ro\u017enik Hill.\nMuseums and art galleries.\nLjubljana has numerous art galleries and museums. The first purpose-built art gallery in Ljubljana was the Jakopi\u010d Pavilion, which was in the first half of the 20th century the central exhibition venue of Slovene artists. In the early 1960s, it was succeeded by Ljubljana City Art Gallery, which has presented a number of modern Slovene and foreign artists. In 2010, there were 14 museums and 56 art galleries in Ljubljana. There is for example an architecture museum, a railway museum, a school museum, a sports museum, a museum of modern art, a museum of contemporary art, a brewery museum, the Slovenian Museum of Natural History and the Slovene Ethnographic Museum. The National Gallery (), founded in 1918, and the Museum of Modern Art () exhibit the most influential Slovenian artists. In 2006, the museums received 264,470 visitors, the galleries 403,890 and the theatres 396,440. The Metelkova Museum of Contemporary Art (), opened in 2011, hosts simultaneous exhibitions, a research library, archives, and a bookshop.

After World War II, the Cinema Company Ljubljana, later named \"Ljubljana Cinematographers\", was established and managed a number of already functioning movie theatres in Ljubljana, including the only Yugoslav children's theatre. Cinema festivals took place in the 1960s, and a cinematheque opened its doors in 1963. With the advent of television, video, and recently the Internet, most cinema theatres in Ljubljana closed, and the cinema mainly moved to Kolosej, a multiplex in the BTC City. It features twelve screens, including an IMAX 3D screen. The remaining theatres are Kino Komuna, Kinodvor, where art movies are accompanied by events, and the Slovenian Cinematheque. The Slovenian Cinematheque hosts the international Ljubljana LGBT Film Festival which showcases LGBT-themed films. Founded in 1984, it is the oldest film festival of its sort in Europe (with oldest ex SFRY LGBT+ march in Ljubljana Pride).\nClassical music, opera and ballet.\nThe Slovenian Philharmonics is the central music institution in Ljubljana and Slovenia. It holds classical music concerts of domestic and foreign performers as well as educates youth. It was established in 1701 as part of Academia operosorum Labacensis and is among the oldest such institutions in Europe. The Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre also resides in Ljubljana, presenting a wide variety of domestic and foreign, modern and classic, opera, ballet and concert works. It serves as the national opera and ballet house. Music festivals are held in Ljubljana, chiefly in European classical music and jazz, for instance the Ljubljana Summer Festival (), and Trnfest.\nTheatre.\nIn addition to the main houses, with the SNT Drama Ljubljana as the most important among them, a number of small producers are active in Ljubljana, involved primarily in physical theatre (e.g. Betontanc), street theatre (e.g. Ana Monr\u00f3 Theatre), theatresports championship Impro League, and improvisational theatre (e.g. IGLU Theatre). A popular form is puppetry, mainly performed in the Ljubljana Puppet Theatre. Theatre has a rich tradition in Ljubljana, starting with the 1867 first ever Slovene-language drama performance.\nModern dance.\nThe modern dance was presented in Ljubljana for the first time at the end of the 19th century and developed rapidly since the end of the 1920s. Since the 1930s when in Ljubljana was founded a Mary Wigman dance school, the first one for modern dance in Slovenia, the field has been intimately linked to the development in Europe and the United States. Ljubljana Dance Theatre is today the only venue in Ljubljana dedicated to contemporary dance.\nFolk dance.\nSeveral folk dance groups are active in Ljubljana.\nJazz.\nIn July 2015, the 56th Ljubljana Jazz Festival was held. A participant event in the European Jazz Network, the festival took place over four days and included 19 concerts with artists from 19 countries, including a celebration of the 75th birthday of James \"Blood\" Ulmer.\nPopular urban culture and alternative scene.\nIn the 1980s with the emergence of subcultures in Ljubljana, an alternative culture began to develop in Ljubljana organised around two student organisations. This caused an influx of young people to the city centre, caused political and social changes, and led to the establishment of alternative art centres.\nA Ljubljana equivalent of Copenhagen's Freetown Christiania, a self-proclaimed autonomous Metelkova neighbourhood, was set up in a former Austro-Hungarian barracks that was built in 1882.\nIn 1993, the seven buildings and of space were turned into art galleries, artist studios, and seven nightclubs, including two LGBTQ+ venues, playing host to music from hardcore to jazz to dub to techno. Celica Hostel is adjacent to Metelkova with rooms artistically decorated by Metelkova artists. A new part of the Museum of Modern Art is the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art. Another alternative culture centre is located in the former Rog factory. Both Metelkova and the Rog factory complex are near the city centre.\nIn 2023, the Rog factory underwent a complete renovation and rebranding, and it is now known as Center Rog. Center Rog has nineteen project studios and five residential apartments in addition to a new branch of the Ljubljana City Library (Rog Library), a large exhibition and event hall, a caf\u00e9, bistro, and restaurant, and several shops with local products.\n\u0160i\u0161ka Cultural Quarter hosts art groups and cultural organisations dedicated to contemporary and avant-garde arts. Kino \u0160i\u0161ka Centre for Urban Culture is there, a venue offering concerts of indie, punk, and rock bands as well as exhibitions take place. The Museum of Transitory Art (MoTA) is a museum without a permanent collection or a fixed space. Its programs are realised in temporary physical and virtual spaces dedicated to advancing the research, production and presentation of transitory, experimental, and live art forms. Yearly MoTA organises the Sonica Festival. Ljudmila (since 1994), which strives to connect research practices, technologies, science, and art.\nSports.\nClubs.\nTension between German and Slovene residents dominated the development of sport in Ljubljana in the 19th century. The first sports club in Ljubljana was the South Sokol Gymnastic Club (), established in 1863 and succeeded in 1868 by the Ljubljana Sokol (). It was the parent club of all Slovene Sokol clubs as well as an encouragement for the establishment of the Croatian Sokol club in Zagreb. Members were also active in culture and politics, striving for greater integration of the Slovenes from different Crown lands of Austria-Hungary and for their cultural, political, and economic independence.\nIn 1885, German residents established one of the first sports clubs in the territory of nowadays Slovenia, (\"Ljubljana Cycling Club\"). In 1887, Slovene cyclists established the Slovene Cyclists Club Ljubljana (, \"KSBL\"). In 1893 followed the first Slovene Alpine club, named Slovene Alpine Club (), later succeeded by the Alpine Association of Slovenia (). Several of its branches operate in Ljubljana, the largest of them being the Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club (). In 1900, the sports club (English: \"Ljubljana Sports Club\") was established by the city's German residents and functioned until 1909. In 1906, Slovenes organised themselves in its Slovene counterpart, the Ljubljana Sports Club (). Its members were primarily interested in rowing, but also swimming and football. In 1911, the first Slovenian football club, Ilirija, started operating in the city. Winter sports already started to develop in the area of the nowadays Ljubljana before World War II. In 1929, the first ice hockey club in Slovenia (then Yugoslavia), SK Ilirija, was established.\nNowadays, the city's football teams which play in the Slovenian PrvaLiga are NK Olimpija Ljubljana and NK Bravo.

It is one of the two main venues of the Slovenia national football team. The park also has an indoor arena, used for indoor sports such as basketball, handball and volleyball and is the home venue of KK Olimpija, RK Krim and ACH Volley Bled among others. Besides football, the stadium is designed to host cultural events as well. Another stadium in the Be\u017eigrad district, Be\u017eigrad Stadium, is closed since 2008 and is deteriorating. It was built according to the plans of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik and was the home of the NK Olimpija Ljubljana, dissolved in 2004. Joc Pe\u010de\u010dnik, a Slovenian multimillionaire, plans to renovate it.\n\u0160i\u0161ka Sports Park is located in Spodnja \u0160i\u0161ka, part of the \u0160i\u0161ka District.

The halls are also used for concerts and other cultural events. The Slovenian Olympic Committee has its office in the building.\nThe Tacen Whitewater Course, located on a course on the Sava, northwest of the city centre, hosts a major international canoe/kayak slalom competition almost every year, examples being the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in 1955, 1991, and 2010.\nSince the 1940s, a ski slope has been in use in Gunclje, in the northwestern part of the city. It is long and has two ski lifts, its maximum incline is 60\u00b0 and the difference in height from the top to the bottom is . Five ski jumping hills stand near the ski slope. Several Slovenian Olympic and World Cup medalists trained and competed there. In addition, the Arena Triglav complex of six jumping hills is located in the \u0160i\u0161ka District. A ski jumping hill, built in 1954 to plans by Stanko Bloudek, was located in \u0160i\u0161ka near Vodnik Street () until 1976. International competitions for the Kongsberg Cup were held there, attended by thousands of spectators. The ice rinks in Ljubljana include Koseze Pond and Tivoli Hall. In addition, in the 19th century and the early 20th century, Tivoli Pond and a marshy meadow in Trnovo, named Kern, were used for ice skating.\nEconomy.\nIndustry is the most important employer, notably in the pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and food processing.

It originally accepted only boys; girls were accepted from the beginning of the 16th century. Parochial schools are attested in the 13th century, at St. Peter's Church and at Saint Nicholas's Church, the later Ljubljana Cathedral. Since 1291, there were also trade-oriented private schools in Ljubljana. At the beginning of the 17th century, there were six schools in Ljubljana and later three. A girls' school was established by Poor Clares, followed in 1703 by the Ursulines. Their school was for about 170 years the only public girls' school in Carniola. These schools were mainly private or established by the city.\nIn 1775, the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa proclaimed elementary education obligatory and Ljubljana got its normal school, intended as a learning place for teachers. In 1805, the first state music school was established in Ljubljana. In the time of Illyrian Provinces, \"\u00e9cole primaire\", a unified four-year elementary school program with a greater emphasis on Slovene, was introduced. The first public schools, unrelated to religious education, appeared in 1868.\nSecondary education.\nIn Ljubljana, there are ten public and three private grammar schools. The public schools are divided into general gymnasiums and classical gymnasiums, the latter offering Latin and Greek as foreign languages. Some general schools offer internationally oriented European departments, and some offer sports departments, allowing students to more easily adjust their sport and school obligations. All state schools are free, but the number of students they can accept is limited. The private secondary schools include a Catholic grammar school and a Waldorf grammar school. There are also professional grammar schools in Ljubljana, offering economical, technical, or artistic subjects (visual arts, music). All grammar schools last four years and conclude with the \"matura\" exam.\nHistorically, upon a proposal by Primo\u017e Trubar, the Carniolan Estates' School (1563\u20131598) was established in 1563 in the period of Slovene Reformation. Its teaching languages were mainly Latin and Greek, but also German and Slovene, and it was open for both sexes and all social strata. In 1597, Jesuits established the Jesuit College (1597\u20131773), intended to transmit general education. In 1773, secondary education came under the control of the state. A number of reforms were implemented in the 19th century; there was more emphasis on general knowledge and religious education was removed from state secondary schools. In 1910, there were 29 secondary schools in Ljubljana, among them classical and real gymnasiums and Realschules (technical secondary schools).\nTertiary education.\nIn 2011, the University had 23 faculties and three academies, located around Ljubljana. They offer Slovene-language courses in medicine, applied sciences, arts, law, administration, natural sciences, and other subjects. The university has more than 63,000 students and some 4,000 teaching faculty. Students make up one-seventh of Ljubljana's population, giving the city a youthful character.\nHistorically, higher schools offering the study of general medicine, surgery, architecture, law and theology, started to operate in Ljubljana under the French annexation of Slovene territory, in 1810\u20131811. The Austro-Hungarian Empire never allowed Slovenes to establish their own university in Ljubljana, and the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia's most important university, was founded in 1919 after Slovenes joined the first Yugoslavia. When it was founded, the university comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. From the beginning, the seat of the university has been at Congress Square in a building that served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918.\nLibraries.\nThe National and University Library of Slovenia is the Slovene national and university library. In\u00a02011, it held about 1,307,000\u00a0books, 8,700\u00a0manuscripts, and numerous other textual, visual and multimedia resources, altogether 2,657,000\u00a0volumes.\nThe second largest university library in Ljubljana is the Central Technological Library, the national library and information hub for natural sciences and technology.\nThe Municipal City Library of Ljubljana, established in\u00a02008, is the central regional library and the largest Slovenian general public library. In\u00a02011, it held 1,657,000 volumes, among these 1,432,000 books and a multitude of other resources in 36 branches. Altogether, there are 5\u00a0general public libraries and over 140\u00a0specialised libraries in Ljubljana.\nBesides the two largest university libraries there are libraries at individual faculties, departments and institutes of the University of Ljubljana. The largest among them are the Central Humanist Library in the field of humanities, the Central Social Sciences Library, the Central Economic Library in the field of economics, the Central Medical Library in the field of medical sciences, and the Libraries of the Biotechnical Faculty in the field of biology and biotechnology.\nThe first libraries in Ljubljana were located in monasteries. The first public library was the Carniolan Estates' Library, established in\u00a01569 by Primo\u017e Trubar. In the 17th century, the Jesuit Library collected numerous works, particularly about mathematics. In\u00a01707, the Seminary Library was established; it is the first and oldest public scientific library in Slovenia. Around\u00a01774, after the dissolution of the Jesuits, the Lyceum Library was formed from the remains of the Jesuit Library as well as several monastery libraries.\nScience.\nThe first society of the leading scientists and public workers in Carniola was the Dismas Fraternity (Latin: ), formed in Ljubljana in 1688. In 1693, the \"Academia Operosorum Labacensium\" was founded and lasted with an interruption until the end of the 18th century. The next academy in Ljubljana, the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, was not established until 1938.\nTransport.\nAir transport.\nLjubljana Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik Airport (ICAO code LJLJ; IATA code LJU), located northwest of the city, has flights to numerous European destinations. The destinations are mainly European. This airport has superseded the original Ljubljana airport, in operation from 1933 until 1963. It was located in the Municipality of Polje (nowadays the Moste District), on a plain between Ljubljanica and Sava next to the railroad in Moste. There was a military airport in \u0160i\u0161ka from 1918 until 1929.\nRail transport.\nIn the Ljubljana Rail Hub, the Pan-European railway corridors V (the fastest link between the North Adriatic, and Central and Eastern Europe) and X (linking Central Europe with the Balkans) and the main European lines (E 65, E 69, E 70) intersect. All international transit trains in Slovenia drive through the Ljubljana hub, and all international passenger trains stop there. The area of Ljubljana has six passenger stations and nine stops. For passengers, the Slovenian Railways company offers the possibility to buy a daily or monthly city pass that can be used to travel between them. The Ljubljana railway station is the central station of the hub. The Ljubljana Moste Railway Station is the largest Slovenian railway dispatch. The Ljubljana Zalog Railway Station is the central Slovenian rail yard. There are a number of industrial rails in Ljubljana. At the end of 2006, the Ljubljana Castle funicular started to operate. The rail goes from Krek Square (\"Krekov trg\") near the Ljubljana Central Market to Ljubljana Castle. It is especially popular among tourists. The full trip lasts 60 seconds.\nRoads.\nLjubljana is located where Slovenia's two main motorways intersect, connecting the motorway route from east to west, in line with Pan-European Corridor V, and the motorway in the north\u2013south direction, in line with Pan-European Corridor X. The city is linked to the southwest by A1-E70 to the Italian cities of Trieste and Venice and the Croatian port of Rijeka. To the north, A1-E57 leads to Maribor, Graz and Vienna. To the east, A2-E70 links it with the Croatian capital Zagreb, from where one can go to Hungary or important cities of the former Yugoslavia, such as Belgrade. To the northwest, A2-E61 goes to the Austrian towns of Klagenfurt and Salzburg, making it an important entry point for northern European tourists. A toll sticker system has been in use on the Ljubljana Ring Road since 1 July 2008. The centre of the city is more difficult to access especially in the peak hours due to long arteries with traffic lights and a large number of daily commuters. The core city centre has been closed for motor traffic since September 2007 (except for residents with permissions), creating a pedestrian zone around Pre\u0161eren Square.\nPublic transport.\nThe historical Ljubljana tram system was completed in 1901 and was replaced by buses in 1928, which were in turn abolished and replaced by trams in 1931 with its final length of in 1940. In 1959, it was abolished in favor of automobiles; the tracks were dismantled and tram cars were transferred to Osijek and Subotica. Reintroduction of an actual tram system to Ljubljana has been proposed repeatedly in the 2000s.\nThere are numerous taxi companies in the city.\nThe Ljubljana Bus Station, the Ljubljana central bus hub, is located next to the Ljubljana railway station. The city bus network, run by the Ljubljana Passenger Transport (\"LPP\") company, is Ljubljana's most widely used means of public transport. The fleet is relatively modern. The number of dedicated bus lanes is limited, which can cause problems in peak hours when traffic becomes congested. Bus rides may be paid with the Urbana payment card (also used for the funicular) or with a mobile phone. Sometimes the buses are called \"trole\" (referring to trolley poles), harking back to the 1951\u20131971 days when Ljubljana had trolleybus (\"trolejbus\") service. There were five trolleybus lines in Ljubljana, until 1958 alongside the tram.\nAnother means of public road transport in the city centre is the Cavalier (), an electric shuttle bus vehicle operated by LPP since May 2009. There are three such vehicles in Ljubljana. The ride is free and there are no stations because it can be stopped anywhere. It can carry up to five passengers; most of them are elderly people and tourists. The Cavalier drives in the car-free zone in the Ljubljana downtown. The first line links \u010cop Street, Wolf Street and the Hribar Embankment, whereas the second links Town Square, Upper Square, and Old Square. There is also a trackless train (tractor with wagons decorated to look like a train) for tourists in Ljubljana, linking Cyril and Methodius Square in the city centre with Ljubljana Castle.\nBicycles.\nThere is a considerable amount of bicycle traffic in Ljubljana, especially in the warmer months of the year. It is also possible to rent a bike. Since May 2011, the BicikeLJ, a self-service bicycle rental system offers the residents and visitors of Ljubljana 600 bicycles and more than 600 parking spots at 60 stations in the wider city centre area. The daily number of rentals is around 2,500. There was an option to rent a bike even before the establishment of BicikeLJ.\nThere are still some conditions for cyclists in Ljubljana that have been criticised, including cycle lanes in poor condition and constructed in a way that motorised traffic is privileged. There are also many one-way streets which therefore cannot be used as alternate routes so it is difficult to legally travel by bicycle through the city centre. Through years, some prohibitions have been partially abolished by marking cycle lanes on the pavement. Nevertheless, the situation has been steadily improving; in 2015, Ljubljana placed 13th in a ranking of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities. In 2016, Ljubljana was 8th on the Copenhagenize list.\nWater transport.\nThe river transport on the Ljubljanica and the Sava was the main means of cargo transport to and from the city until the mid-19th century, when railroads were built. Today, the Ljubljanica is used by a number of tourist boats, with wharves under the Butchers' Bridge, at Fish Square, at Court Square, at Breg, at the Poljane Embankment, and elsewhere.\nHealthcare.\nLjubljana has a rich history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology. The majority of secondary and tertiary care in Slovenia takes place in Ljubljana. The Ljubljana University Medical Centre is the largest hospital centre in Slovenia. The Faculty of Medicine (University of Ljubljana) and the Ljubljana Institute of Oncology are the other two central medical institutions in Slovenia. The Ljubljana Community Health Centre is the largest health centre in Slovenia. It has seven units at 11 locations. Since 1986, Ljubljana is part of the WHO European Healthy Cities Network.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nLjubljana is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a type of fipple flute, a class of instrument which also includes the recorder and Native American flute. A tin whistle player is called a whistler. The tin whistle is closely associated with Irish traditional music and Celtic music. Other names for the instrument are the flageolet, English flageolet, Scottish penny whistle, tin flageolet, or Irish whistle (also ).\nHistory.\nThe tin whistle in its modern form is from a wider family of fipple flutes which have been seen in many forms and cultures throughout the world. In Europe, such instruments have a long and distinguished history and take various forms, of which the most widely known are the recorder, tin whistle, Flabiol, Txistu and tabor pipe.\nPredecessors.\nAlmost all early cultures had a type of fipple flute, and it is most likely the first pitched flute-type instrument in existence. Examples found to date include a possible Neanderthal fipple flute from Slovenia, which according to some scientists may date from 81,000 to 53,000 BC; a German flute from 35,000 years ago; and a flute, known as the Malham Pipe, made from sheep's bone in West Yorkshire dating to the Iron Age. (A revised dating of the Malham Pipe now places it within the early medieval period.) Written sources that describe a fipple-type flute include the Roman tibia and Greek aulos. In the early Middle Ages, peoples of northern Europe were playing the instrument as seen in 3rd-century British bone flutes, and Irish Brehon Law describes a flute-like instrument. By the 12th century, Italian flutes came in a variety of sizes, and fragments of 12th-century Norman bone whistles have been found in Ireland, as well as an intact 14\u00a0cm Tusculum clay whistle from the 14th century in Scotland. In the 17th century, whistles were called flageolets, a term to describe a whistle with a French-made fipple headpiece (common to the modern penny whistle); and such instruments are linked to the development of the English flageolet, French flageolet and recorders of the renaissance and baroque period. The term flageolet is still preferred by some modern tin whistlers, who feel that this better describes the instrument, as the term characterises a wide variety of fipple flutes, including penny whistles.\n19th century.\nThe modern penny whistle is indigenous to Great Britain and Ireland, in particular to England, when factory-made \"tin whistles\" were produced by Robert Clarke from 1840 to 1889 in Manchester, and later New Moston, England. Down to 1900, they were also marketed as \"Clarke London Flageolets\" or \"Clarke Flageolets\". The whistle's fingering system is similar to that of the six-hole, \"simple system Irish flutes\" (\"simple\" in comparison to Boehm system flutes). The six-hole, diatonic system is also used on baroque flutes, and was of course well-known before Robert Clarke began producing his tin whistles. Clarke's first whistle, the Meg, was pitched in high A, and was later made in other keys suitable for Victorian parlour music. The company showed the whistles in The Great Exhibition of 1851. The Clarke tin whistle is voiced somewhat on an organ-pipe with a flattened tube forming the lip of the fipple mouthpiece, and is usually made from rolled tin sheet or brass. They were mass-produced and widespread due to their relative affordability.\nAs the penny whistle was generally considered a toy, it has been suggested that children or street musicians were paid a penny by those who heard them playing the whistle. However, in reality, the instrument was so called because it could be purchased for a penny. The name \"tin-whistle\" was also coined as early as 1825 but neither the tin whistle nor the penny whistle name seems to have been common until the 20th century. The instrument became popular in several musical traditions, namely: English, Scottish, Irish and American traditional music.\nDue to its affordability, the tin whistle was a popular household instrument, as ubiquitous as the harmonica. In the second half of the 19th century, some flute manufacturers such as Barnett Samuel and Joseph Wallis also sold whistles. These had cylindrical brass tubes. Like many old whistles, they had lead fipple plugs, and since lead is poisonous, caution should be exercised before playing an old whistle.\nLow whistle.\nWhile whistles have most often been produced in higher pitches, the \"low\" whistle has historically been produced. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in the United States, has in its collection an example of a 19th-century low whistle from the Galpin collection.\nModern tin whistle.\nThe most common whistles today are made of brass or nickel-plated brass, with a plastic mouthpiece, which contains the fipple. Generation, Fead\u00f3g, Oak, Acorn, Soodlum's (now Walton's), and other brands fall in this category.\nThe Generation Whistle was introduced in 1966, and featured a brass tube with a lead fipple. Founded by businessman and engineer Alfred Brown in Oswestry, Shropshire, their most popular whistle, the Generation Flageolet, was introduced in 1968. The design was updated somewhat over the years, most notably the substitution of a plastic fipple for the lead fipple.\nAlthough most whistles have a cylindrical bore, other designs exist, for example a conical sheet metal whistle with a wooden stop in the wide end to form the fipple, the Clarke's brand being the most prevalent. Other less common variants are the all-metal whistle, the PVC whistle, the Flanna square holed whistle, and the wooden whistle.\nGaining popularity as a folk instrument in the early 19th-century Celtic music revivals, penny whistles now play an integral part in several folk traditions. Whistles are a prevalent starting instrument in English traditional music, Scottish traditional music and Irish traditional music, since they are usually inexpensive; relatively easy to play, free of tricky embouchure such as found with the transverse flute; and use fingerings are nearly identical to those on traditional six-holed flutes, such as the Irish flute and the Baroque flute. The tin whistle is a good starting instrument to learn the uilleann pipes, which has similar finger technique, range of notes and repertoire. The tin whistle is the most popular instrument in Irish traditional music today.\nIn recent years, a number of instrument builders have started lines of \"high-end\" hand-made whistles, which can cost dozens of times more than cheap whistles, but nevertheless are cheaper than most other instruments. These companies are typically either a single individual or a very small group of craftsmen who work closely together. The instruments are distinguished from the inexpensive whistles in that each whistle is individually manufactured and \"voiced\" by a skilled person rather than made in a factory.\nTuning.\nWhistle keys.\nThe whistle is tuned diatonically, which allows it to be used to easily play music in every standard mode. The whistle is identified by its lowest note, which is the tonic of the major key. This method of determining the key of the instrument is different from the method used to determine the key of a chromatic instrument, which is based on the relationship between notes on a score and sounded pitch.\nWhistles are available in all 12 chromatic keys; however, the most common whistles are pitched in D, followed by whistles in C and F, G, and then B\u266d and E\u266d, with other keys being somewhat rarer. The D whistle can easily play notes in the keys of D and G major. Since the D major key is lower these whistles are identified as \"D whistles\". The next most common whistle tuning is a \"C whistle\", which can easily play notes in the keys of C and F major. The D whistle is by far the most common choice for Irish and Scottish music.\nAlthough the whistle is essentially a diatonic instrument, it is possible to get notes outside the principal major key of the whistle, either by \"half-holing\" (partially covering the highest open finger hole) or by \"cross-fingering\" (covering some holes while leaving some higher ones open). However, half-holing is somewhat more difficult to do correctly, and whistles are available in all keys, so for other keys a whistler will typically use a different whistle instead, reserving half-holing for accidentals. Some whistle designs allow a single mouthpiece to be used on differently keyed bodies.\nLow whistle.\nDuring the 1960s revival of traditional Irish music, the low whistle was \"recreated\" by Bernard Overton at the request of Finbar Furey.\nThere are larger whistles which, by virtue of being longer and wider, produce tones an octave (or in rare cases two octaves) lower. Whistles in this category are likely to be made of metal or plastic tubing, sometimes with a tuning-slide head, and are almost always referred to as \"low whistles\" but sometimes called \"concert whistles\". The low whistle operates on identical principles to the standard whistles, but musicians in the tradition may consider it a separate instrument.\nThe term \"soprano whistle\" is sometimes used for higher-pitched whistles when it is necessary to distinguish them from low whistles.\nPlaying technique.\nFingering and range.\nThe notes are selected by opening or closing holes with the fingers. Holes are typically covered with the pads of the fingers, but some players, particularly when negotiating the larger holes and spacing in low whistles, may employ the \"piper's grip\". With all the holes closed, the whistle generates its lowest note. This lowest available note is commonly referred to as the whistle\u2019s \u201cbell tone\u201d. Successively opening holes from the bottom upward produces the rest of the notes of the scale in sequence: with the lowest hole open it generates the second, with the lowest two holes open, it produces the third and so on. With all six holes open, it produces the seventh.\nAs with a number of woodwind instruments, the tin whistle's second and higher registers are achieved by increasing the air velocity into the ducted flue windway.\nOn a transverse flute this is generally done by narrowing the lip/embouchure. Since the size and direction of the tin whistle's windway is fixed, like that of the recorder or fipple flute, it is necessary to increase the velocity of the air stream. (See overblowing).\nFingering in the second register is generally the same as in the first/fundamental, though alternate fingerings are sometimes employed in the higher end of the registers to correct a flattening effect caused by higher air column velocity. Also, the tonic note of the second register is usually played with the top hole of the whistle partially uncovered instead of covering all holes as with the tonic note of the first register; this makes it harder to accidentally drop into the first register and helps to correct pitch. Recorders perform this by \"pinching\" open the dorsal thumb hole.\nVarious other notes (relatively flat or sharp with respect to those of the major scale) can be accessed by \"cross fingering\" techniques, and all the notes (except the lowest of each octave/register) can be flattened by \"half holing\". Perhaps the most effective and most used cross fingering is that which produces a flattened form of the seventh note (B\u266d instead of B on a C whistle, for example, or C\u266e instead of C\u266f on a D whistle). This makes available another major scale (F on a C whistle, G on a D whistle).\nThe standard range of the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from D5 to D7; that is, from the second D above middle C to the fourth D above middle C. It is possible to make sounds above this range, by blowing with sufficient force, but, in most musical contexts, the result will be loud and out of tune due to a cylindrical bore.\nOrnamentation.\nTraditional whistle playing uses a number of ornaments to embellish the music, including cuts, strikes and rolls. Most playing is legato with ornaments to create breaks between notes, rather than tongued. The traditional music concept of the word \"ornamentation\" differs somewhat from that of European classical music in that ornaments are more commonly changes in how a note is articulated rather than the addition of separately-perceived notes to the piece. Common ornaments and articulations include:\n* The \"long roll\" is a group of three slurred notes of equal pitch and duration, the first sounded without a cut or strike, the second sounded with a cut, and the third sounded with a strike.\n* The \"short roll\" is a group of two slurred notes of equal pitch and duration, the first sounded with a cut and the second sounded with a strike.\nRepertoire.\nA number of music genres commonly feature the tin whistle.\nIrish and Scottish music.\nTraditional music from Ireland and Scotland is by far the most common music to play on the tin whistle, and comprises the vast majority of published scores suitable for whistle players. The tin whistle is very common in Irish music to the point that it could be called characteristic of the genre and fairly common in Scottish music.\nKwela.\nKwela is a genre of music created in South Africa in the 1950s, and is characterized by an upbeat, jazzy tin whistle lead. Kwela is the only music genre created around the sound of the tin whistle. The low cost of the tin whistle, or jive flute, made it an attractive instrument in the impoverished, apartheid-era townships; the Hohner tin whistle was especially popular in kwela performance. The kwela craze accounted for the sale of more than one million tin whistles.\nIn the late 1950s, mbaqanga music largely superseded kwela in South Africa, and so it followed that the saxophone surpassed the tin whistle as the township people's wind instrument of choice. Kwela master Aaron \"Big Voice Jack\" Lerole continued to perform into the 1990s; a few bands, such as The Positively Testcard of London, continue to record kwela music.\nKwela sheet music is rarely published, and many of the recordings of founding kwela artists are out of print. One representative compilation is \"Drum: South African Jazz and Jive\".\nOther music.\nThe tin whistle is used in many other types of music, including the Tuk band tradition of Barbados. In some Irish music composed for symphonic ensembles, it is often replaced with piccolo. It is not unusual to hear the tin whistle used in praise music and film soundtracks, notably the soundtrack to Lord of the Rings and . Published scores suitable for tin whistle performance are available in both of these genres. The tin whistle also appears in \"crossover\" genres like world music, folk rock, folk metal and folk punk.\nNotation.\nTin whistle music collections are generally notated in one of three different formats.\nStandard musical notation.\nIt is common to score music for the whistle using standard musical notation. The tin whistle is not a transposing instrument - for example, music for the D tin whistle is written in concert pitch, not transposed down a tone as would be normal for transposing instruments. Nevertheless, there is no real consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. However, when music is scored for a soprano whistle it will be written an octave lower than it sounds, to spare ledger lines and make it much easier to read.\nThe traditional music of Ireland and Scotland constitutes the majority of published scores for the whistle. Since the majority of that music is written in D major, G major, or one of the corresponding musical modes, use of the D major or G major key signatures is a \"de facto\" standard. For example, the \"C whistle\" edition of Bill Ochs's popular \"The Clarke Tin Whistle Handbook\" is scored in D and differs from the D edition only in that the accompanying audio CD is played on a C whistle.\nReading directly onto the C whistle is popular for the obvious reason that its \"home key\" or \"name key\" is the \"all-natural\" major key (C major). Some musicians are encouraged to learn to read directly onto one whistle, while others are taught to read directly onto another.\nThe whistle player who wants music to read on to all whistles will need to learn the mechanics of written transposition, taking music with one key signature and rewriting it with another.\nTablature notation for the tin whistle is a graphical representation of which tone holes the player should cover. The most common format is a vertical column of six circles, with holes to be covered for a given note shown filled with black, and a plus sign (+) at the top for notes in the second octave. Tablature is most commonly found in tutorial books for beginners.\nABC notation.\nSince the majority of popular tin whistle music is traditional and out of copyright, it is common to share tune collections on the Internet. ABC notation is the most common means of electronic exchange of tunes. It is also designed to be easy to read by people, and many musicians learn to read it directly instead of using a computer program to transform it into a standard musical notation score.\nWell-known performers.\nDuring the 1960s, Tommy Makem played the tin whistle as a member of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, one of the most influential Irish folk groups, especially popular during the American folk music revival.\nIn 1973, Paddy Moloney (of The Chieftains) and Sean Potts released the album \"Tin Whistles\", which helped to popularise the tin whistle in particular, and Irish music in general. Mary Bergin's \"Fead\u00f3ga St\u00e1in\" (1979) and \"Fead\u00f3ga St\u00e1in 2\" (1993) were similarly influential. Other notable players include Carmel Gunning, Micho Russell, Joanie Madden, Brian Finnegan, Cathal McConnell, and Se\u00e1n Ryan. Many traditional pipers and flute players also play the whistle to a high standard.

Written by Frank Butler and Frank Cavett, based on a story by McCarey, the film is about a new young priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran. Crosby sings five songs with other songs performed onscreen by Metropolitan Opera's star mezzo-soprano Ris\u00eb Stevens and the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir. \"Going My Way\" was the highest-grossing picture of 1944, and was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning seven, including Best Picture. Its success helped to make movie exhibitors choose Crosby as the biggest box-office draw of the year, a record he would hold for the remainder of the 1940s. After World War II, Crosby and McCarey presented a copy of the film to Pope Pius XII at the Vatican. \"Going My Way\" was followed the next year by a sequel, \"The Bells of St. Mary's\".\nIn 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nFather Charles \"Chuck\" O'Malley, an incoming priest from East St. Louis, is transferred to St. Dominic's Catholic Church in New York City.\nOn his first day, his unconventional style gets him into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and casual attitude initially make a poor impression with the elder priest, Father Fitzgibbon. The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O'Malley's recreational habits\u00a0\u2013 particularly his golf-playing\u00a0\u2013 and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O'Dowd. O'Dowd tricks O'Malley into revealing that he was actually sent by the bishop to replace Fitzgibbon and take charge of the parish's affairs, with Fitzgibbon remaining on as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon's feelings, O'Malley pretends that he was sent to serve as the elderly priest's assistant.\nThe difference between O'Malley and Fitzgibbon's styles is openly apparent as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James having run away from home. The most consequential difference arises in their handling of the church youth, many of whom consistently get into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi. Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O'Malley wants to help the boys to improve their lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to form a church choir.\nThe noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who goes to the bishop and asks for O'Malley to be transferred to another parish. In the course of their conversation, Fitzgibbon realizes the bishop sent O'Malley to take charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O'Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate, he informs O'Malley of his new role. Distressed, Fitzgibbon goes walking in a rainstorm for several hours and returns late that night. O'Malley puts the older priest to bed, and the two finally begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon's long unfulfilled desire to go to Ireland to visit his mother, now over 90 years old. O'Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, \"Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral\".\nO'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel, an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career singing with the Metropolitan Opera, under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage in a performance of \"Carmen\", the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss O'Malley's letter explaining he had entered the priesthood.\nO'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr., the son of the church's mortgage holder. O'Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life, to follow the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same, sung as his composition \"Going My Way\". When the junior Haines is later confronted by his father, the father discovers that he and Carol have married, and he has joined the Army Air Corps.\nJenny visits O'Malley at the church, sees the boys' choir, and reads the sheet music of \"Going My Way\". She, O'Malley, and O'Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan Opera House, have the choir perform the song with a full orchestra, then sell the publishing rights, saving the church from its financial woes. When Max Dolan, the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell, the choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings \"Swinging on a Star\". The executive overhears the song and wants to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church's mortgage.\nWith everything settled, O'Malley is transferred to a new assignment; O'Dowd will be Fitzgibbon's new assistant, with Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. However, the church is damaged by a massive fire. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a Mass that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a parting gesture, O'Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon's mother in Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings \"Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral\", as Father O'Malley quietly slips away into the night.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nRis\u00eb Stevens, whose character is seen onscreen performing the lead role in a Metropolitan Opera (the Met) production of \"Carmen\", was an actual performer with the Met when the film was made. A few years later she would earn enormous personal triumph as the Met's Carmen in the famous Tyrone Guthrie production of 1951, becoming the leading Carmen of her generation.\nFilming locations included the following:\nReception.\nCritical response.\nAccording to Bosley Crowther in \"The New York Times\", \"Going My Way\" was \"the best\" of Crosby's career, which is \"saying a lot for a performer who has been one of the steadiest joys of the screen. But, in this Leo McCarey film ... he has definitely found his sturdiest role to date.\" Crowther, however, criticized the film's length while lauding Crosby, and wrote that \"he has been stunningly supported by Barry Fitzgerald, who plays one of the warmest characters the screen has ever known. As a matter of fact, it is a cruel slight to suggest that this is Mr. Crosby's show. It is his and Mr. Fitzgerald's together. And they make it one of the rare delights of the year.\"\n\"Variety\" endorsed the film, saying: \"Bing Crosby gets a tailor-made role in \"Going My Way\", and with major assistance from Barry Fitzgerald and Ris\u00eb Stevens, clicks solidly to provide top-notch entertainment for wide audience appeal. Picture will hit hefty biz on all booking ... Intimate scenes between Crosby and Fitzgerald dominate throughout, with both providing slick characterizations ... Crosby\u2019s song numbers include three new tunes by Johnny Burke and James Van Heusen \u2014 'Going My Way,' 'Would You Like to Swing on a Star' and 'Day After Forever.' Trio are topgrade and due for wide pop appeal due to cinch recording and airings by Bing. He also delivers 'Ave Maria,' 'Adeste Fideles' and 'Silent Night' in addition to a lively Irish-themed song, 'Toora-loora-looral' with boys' choir accompaniment.\"\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 7.0/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald are eminently likable, and film is pleasantly sentimental, but \"Going My Way\" suffers from a surplus of sweetness.\"\nAccolades.\nThe film received ten nominations at the Oscars, winning seven, including Barry Fitzgerald (whose work on the film was nominated for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor). Bing Crosby won for Best Actor, while Fitzgerald won for Best Supporting Actor. (Subsequently, the rules were changed to prevent a recurrence). Its record of six above-the-line wins was matched in 2022 by \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\".\nSoundtrack.\nBing Crosby recorded six of the songs for Decca Records and some of them were issued on a 3-disc 78rpm set titled \"Selections from Going My Way\". \u201cSwinging on a Star\u201d topped the \"Billboard\" charts for nine weeks in a 28-week stay. \"Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral (That's an Irish Lullaby)\" was in the charts for twelve weeks with a peak position of #4. \"The Day After Forever\" and \"Going My Way\" also charted briefly. Crosby's songs were also included in the \"Bing's Hollywood\" series.\nAdaptations and related films.\n\"Going My Way\" was adapted as a radio play for the January 8, 1945, broadcast of \"The Screen Guild Theater\" starring Bing Crosby, Barry Fitzgerald and Paul Lukas. It was also adapted for the May 3, 1954, broadcast of \"Lux Radio Theatre\" with Barry Fitzgerald.\nThe film also inspired an hour-long comedy drama of the same name during the 1962\u201363 television season starring Gene Kelly in the role of Father O'Malley. The series ran on ABC for one season of 30 episodes.\nIn 1962, McCarey directed \"Satan Never Sleeps\", also featuring an old priest and his younger substitute but set in a Chinese mission during the Communist takeover of the country in 1949.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42386", "revid": "1509627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42386", "title": "History of Benin", "text": "The History of Benin since the 16th century, for the geographical area included in 1960 in what was then called the Republic of Dahomey before becoming the People's Republic of Benin.\nEtymology.\nThe Republic of Benin derives its name from one of the most powerful precolonial West African kingdoms, the Kingdom of Benin, which was centered in present-day Benin City, now located in Nigeria. According to some historians, the name \"Benin\" is a Portuguese rendering of the Itsekiri word \"oubinou\", meaning \"seat of royalty\", which referred to the kingdom's capital. The term \"oubinou\" may itself stem from a combination of the Yoruba word oba (\"king\") and \"bini\", the self-designation of the Edo people. Other sources suggest \"Benin\" originated from the Yoruba phrase \"ile-ibinu\", meaning \"land of disputes\", possibly alluding to internal conflicts within the kingdom. A further hypothesis posits that \"bini\" may derive from the Arabic \"bani\", meaning \"sons of\".\nBefore 1975, the country was known as \"Dahomey\", a name referencing one of the major historical kingdoms in the region. According to the political authorities at the time, this name was considered inappropriate for a multiethnic state, as it referred primarily to one of the country's major ethnic groups.\nEarly inhabitants.\nIn the Atakora mountain chain of north-western Benin, systematic surveys and excavations have identified caves, rock shelters and open-air sites with lithic industries spanning the Early, Middle and Later Stone Age. Didier N'Dah's work at sites such as Kumaaku, Tanongou and the Pendjari area has reconstructed a chronocultural sequence from Early Stone Age to Late Stone Age, based on the typology of stone tools and comparisons with better-dated regions of West Africa. These sites have yielded a range of artefacts, including large flakes and cores associated with Middle Stone Age technologies, as well as microliths, grinding stones, polished axes and pottery that point to Later Stone Age and Neolithic occupations in the region. A wider survey of Pleistocene sites in West Africa includes localities in present-day Benin, confirming that the country forms part of the broader regional pattern of Stone Age settlement.\nGenetic studies.\nA 2015 study by Maarten Larmuseau et al. investigated the paternal genetic landscape of populations along the Bight of Benin, focusing on four groups from present-day Benin: the Fon, Yoruba, Bariba, and Dendi. Using Y-chromosomal markers, the research revealed significant genetic diversity among these populations, reflecting complex historical migrations and interactions.\nThe study found that the Beninese Yoruba exhibit notable genetic differentiation not only from neighboring groups but also from the Yoruba in Nigeria, suggesting distinct paternal lineages and historical developments. This diversity underscores the intricate demographic history of the region, shaped by various migration events and cultural exchanges.\nPrecontact period.\nThe Gbe cultural sphere.\nThe Gbe-speaking peoples, ancestors of nearly eight million present-day speakers of the Aja-Ewe language continuum, occupy a central place in the cultural history of the Slave Coast of West Africa. Gbe belongs to the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo language family and is subdivided into five primary clusters: Aja, Ewe, Fon, Gen, and Phla-Phera. These languages are spoken from eastern Ghana to southern Benin, with Phla-Phera speakers dispersed along the coasts of Togo, Benin, and western Nigeria. Oral traditions trace many Gbe-speaking polities back to dynastic dispersals from the town of Tado, believed to have been founded by migrants from Oyo or Ketu in the thirteenth century.\nDynastic claims to descent from Tado appear across kingdoms such as Nots\u00e9, Great Popo, Hueda, and Allada, and extend to Dahomey and Porto-Novo. These oral traditions suggest that regional rulers established new polities through conquest and alliance, rather than reflecting mass population movements. Linguistic evidence, including glottochronological studies, indicates that the differentiation of Gbe languages likely occurred well before the thirteenth century\u2014possibly as early as 3,000 BC\u2014undermining theories of recent, large-scale dispersal.\nRather than reflecting concrete genealogical links, dynastic narratives may have served as ideological tools to legitimize emerging elites by referencing prestigious origins. Thus, communities on the Slave Coast were better understood as part of a shared interaction sphere, characterized by common political myths and cultural practices. Akinjogbin identified at least fifteen small kingdoms on the eve of European contact that were ideologically linked by a kinship-based political order, the \"Ebi social theory,\" which presented monarchs as father figures within federations of autonomous lineages.\nArchaeological perspectives: Sodohom\u00e9 and early settlement.\nArchaeological research on the Abomey Plateau has revealed a long and dynamic settlement history predating Dahomey. Investigations by the Projet B\u00e9nino-Danois d'Arch\u00e9ologie (BDArch), particularly at the Sodohom\u00e9 channel, uncovered cultural remains from the mid-seventh century BC to AD 1200. Scatters of lithics at the southeastern end of the channel may indicate transient Middle Stone Age camps.\nLater remains include ceramic sherds, iron slag, burials, refuse pits, and Dahomean-period subterranean structures. BDArch identified five archaeological phases and three cultural periods prior to Dahomey's rise, with settlement expansion and nucleation occurring from the Yellow Pottery Period (670\u2013540 BC) through the Sodohom\u00e9 Period (AD 870\u20131200). While some gaps in occupation are evident, the material suggests shifting settlements tied to agricultural, political, and economic pressures.\nBy AD 1000, clear evidence of small-scale iron smelting appears, expanding by AD 1400 to industrial-scale production. More than thirty sites have been documented across southern Benin, with induced-draft furnaces and extensive slag heaps indicating massive output\u2014estimated at over four million kilograms of iron between AD 1400 and 1600. This surge likely responded to regional and possibly long-distance demand from Sahelian states.\nPrecontact economic foundations.\nThe precontact economy of the Slave Coast was marked by market-oriented production. Oral and archaeological data suggest that many communities produced goods\u2014including salt, iron, textiles, pottery, and fish\u2014for sale and exchange. Markets at Savi, Apa, and Jakin attracted thousands, and smaller local markets served daily needs. The scale and organization of production, particularly of iron, suggests the emergence of a commodity economy before European arrival.\nThe archaeological and historical record underscores that by the sixteenth century, the region's polities were deeply integrated into interregional exchange networks and already exhibited significant political centralization. With the onset of Atlantic trade and the introduction of new crops and goods, these foundations enabled rapid demographic growth and increased state formation.\nMythic era - 16th and 17th centuries.\nThe origins of most Gbe polities are poorly understood, but historical sources indicate that throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, these polities vied for dominance over Atlantic commercial routes. This resulted in significant political and economic expansion. Colin Renfrew proposed the concept of \"peer polity interaction\" to describe how sociopolitical complexity can emerge not solely from internal developments but also through interaction between neighboring independent polities. This interaction encompassed emulation, competition, warfare, and trade. On the Slave Coast, this dynamic contributed to the rise of two dominant kingdoms: Allada and Hueda.\nThe Kingdom of Allada.\nFounded in the sixteenth century, Kingdom of Allada rose as the dominant coastal polity in present-day southern Benin, leveraging early access to long-distance trade. Although little is known of its pre-European trade role, by the mid-sixteenth century Portuguese merchants were trading at its capital, Grand Ardra, now identified with the archaeological site of Togudo-Awute near modern Allada. From the 1560s, African captives labeled \"Aradas\" were recorded in Peru, and the city appeared on Portuguese charts after 1570.\nBy the seventeenth century, Allada had grown significantly. Grand Ardra was home to approximately 30,000 inhabitants, and the kingdom's military strength suggests a total population exceeding 200,000. The Dutch West India Company acquired around 800 slaves annually from Allada between 1636 and 1647, and by the 1680s, the Slave Coast exported roughly 5,000 captives per year, increasing to 10,000 by the 1710s. Textiles and cowries comprised up to 81% of goods exchanged for captives.\nAllada's governance involved officials such as the Grand Captain (or Caminga), the Captain of the Whites (overseeing European trade), and the Captain of Horses. Royal authority was reinforced through rituals, although descriptions of religious institutions remain sparse and often dismissive. The king's crocodile deity, Tokpodun, may have functioned as a state cult. Grand Customs, involving ritual wealth distribution and limited human sacrifice, were held upon a king's death, paralleling later practices in Dahomey.\nThe influx of European and Asian goods strengthened royal prestige and authority. These goods were showcased and distributed during public rituals, bolstering elite status and political cohesion. The king monopolized high-quality imports and required that foreign traders first purchase goods from the crown before dealing elsewhere. Yet by the late seventeenth century, challenges mounted. Increased slave demand empowered secondary elites and rival ports like Whydah. Inland polities such as Dahomey began supplying captives directly. By 1670, only 17% of captives were sourced by the king himself. The remainder came from caboceers and inland traders.\nAllada's failure to centralize control over trade led to political fragmentation. Succession disputes, including Hussar's attempted usurpation of King Soso (1717\u201324), and revolts in key towns like Offra, destabilized the kingdom. Consequently, European traders increasingly shifted their focus elsewhere by the century's end.\nThe Kingdom of Hueda (Whydah).\nThe kingdom of Hueda was an early beneficiary of Allada's inability to monopolize coastal trade. Oral traditions claim that, like Allada, Hueda was the product of a dynastic dispersal from Tado. A minor kingdom and a client of Allada for much of the seventeenth century, Hueda entered the documentary record in 1671 with the establishment of a French trading lodge in Savi, its royal capital. The English Royal African Company relocated its base to Savi in 1682, leaving the Dutch as the sole European power at Offra. Allada made attempts to reclaim control over trade, including reducing duties and imposing an embargo on Hueda-bound commerce, but these measures were largely unsuccessful.\nAlthough Allada remained an important supplier of captives traded through Hueda, its exclusive control over trade revenues was significantly undermined. Hueda, meanwhile, grew rapidly. Its territory measured roughly 50 km east\u2013west by 35 km north\u2013south, and sources estimate its population exceeded 100,000, with a military potential of 20,000 to 40,000. Savi, the capital, was described as extremely populous, and its hinterland was densely settled with over two dozen provincial centers known as \"Vice-roy's villages\".\nSavi functioned as both political capital and primary marketplace, drawing as many as 5,000 people on market days. Goods sold included locally produced salt, textiles, basketry, and pottery, as well as imported European merchandise. Rural and urban areas were integrated economically, forming a continuous, cultivated landscape.\nTrade shifted decisively to Hueda in the late seventeenth century. European lodges were established in Savi, 15 km inland from the port town of Whydah, making it a central node in Atlantic commerce. One early eighteenth-century account highlighted Hueda's wealth and power, stating that it could hire enough help to destroy any adversary. As Hueda gained economic strength, it asserted political independence from Allada. From the 1670s to the 1710s, tensions escalated in the form of trade disputes, military clashes, and proxy wars.\nHueda's monarchy resembled Allada's, with a hereditary king who wielded judicial authority and controlled taxation and labor. The royal ancestor cult played a legitimizing role but remained minor in scale. The dominant religious institution was the cult of Dangbe, the python deity, led by an independent priesthood.\nBy the early eighteenth century, factionalism and the ambitions of autonomous officials eroded royal power. European merchants often supported competing elites, exacerbating internal divisions. King Haffon (r. 1708\u201333) tried to centralize control by restricting access to trade wealth, provoking opposition. Dissatisfied elites warned of violent consequences should the king continue his \"tyranny\". These internal divisions ultimately enabled Dahomey to conquer Hueda in 1727.\nThe emergence of the kingdom of Dahomey.\nFarther north on the Abomey Plateau, a third polity began to take shape during the seventeenth century: the Fon kingdom of Dahomey. Its origins remain obscure. Oral traditions recount that the ruling dynasty originated from a succession dispute between two princes of Allada, and Dogbari. Teagbanlin allegedly founded Porto-Novo, while Dogbari's son Dakodonu migrated north and secured land at Abomey through interactions with the Guedevi chiefdoms.\nThe famous founding legend recounts how Dakodonu killed Chief Dan, building his palace over Dan's body\u2014hence the name Dahomey, meaning \"in the belly of Dan\". However, modern scholarship casts doubt on this narrative, suggesting it was an eighteenth-century invention aimed at legitimizing the Fon dynasty's authority. Dahomey may have originated as a militarized band, and the link to Allada was likely retroactively constructed.\nIt is also possible that the dynasty emerged during the collapse of the iron economy on the plateau around 1600, creating opportunities for new elites to redirect trade toward the coast. Despite the contested nature of its origins, the Fon monarchy developed ritual and political structures similar to neighboring polities. Kings established legitimacy through vod\u00f9n worship and ancestor veneration, relocating local deities to palace precincts to reinforce royal authority.\nThe \"Grand Customs,\" involving public displays of wealth and sacrifice, served as major political tools. Unlike Allada, Dahomean rulers performed these rites publicly, distributing goods and fostering loyalty among chiefs and subjects. King Wegbaja (ca. 1650\u201380) used feasting and redistribution to build alliances with local elites.\nBy the late seventeenth century, Dahomey expanded rapidly. Oral sources describe the kingdom's control extending across the entire Abomey Plateau by the early eighteenth century. Like Allada and Hueda, Dahomey relied on local elites to administer rural areas but demanded regular tribute flows to the capital.\nEconomic competition played a key role in this expansion. Control of trade routes\u2014both within the plateau and toward the coast\u2014was a major motivation for military campaigns. Conquests were justified by conflicts over trade access and slave raiding. Kings such as Akaba (ca. 1680\u20131716) intervened against rivals who restricted commerce or conducted raids against Dahomean dependents.\nThis early phase of Dahomean expansion, driven by trade competition and reinforced through ritualized redistribution, laid the foundations for the kingdom's emergence as a dominant regional power in the eighteenth century.\nDahomey's access to coastal commerce was strengthened by its control over intra-plateau trade, providing captives to coastal elites at Allada and Whydah. While some captives came from expansionist wars, others were likely acquired from or taxed on northern traders. By the 1690s, European observers noted that inland states like Dahomey were supplying increasing numbers of captives for sale at the coast.\nAdministration under early Dahomean rulers such as Wegbaja and Akaba was unevenly centralized. Wegbaja is credited with establishing a centralized legal code, and Akaba reportedly delegated authority in conquered areas to loyal officials from Abomey. However, royal control remained weak. Chiefs often retained autonomy, and the king's influence depended on tactical support of lesser local elites. Like Allada and Hueda, Dahomey in the seventeenth century functioned as a tributary polity relying on dispersed rural power bases.\nColonial Benin (formerly, Republic of Dahomey).\nDahomey was a French colony of and a part of French West Africa from 1904 to 1959. Under the French, a port was constructed at Cotonou, and railroads were built. School facilities were expanded by Roman Catholic missions. In 1946, Dahomey became an overseas territory with its own parliament and representation in the French national assembly. On December 4, 1958, it became the Republic of Dahomey.\nPost-colonial Benin.\n20th century.\nBetween 1960 and 1972, a succession of military coups brought about many changes of government. The last of these brought to power Major Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou as the head of a regime professing strict Marxist-Leninist principles. By 1975 the Republic of Dahomey changed its name to the People's Republic of Benin. The People's Revolutionary Party of Benin (PRPB) remained in complete power until the beginning of the 1990s. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, encouraged by France and other democratic powers, convened a national conference that introduced a new democratic constitution and held presidential and legislative elections. K\u00e9r\u00e9kou's principal opponent at the presidential poll, and the ultimate victor, was Prime Minister Nic\u00e9phore Soglo. Supporters of Soglo also secured a majority in the National Assembly. Benin was thus the first African country to successfully complete the transition from a dictatorship to a pluralistic political system.\nIn the second round of National Assembly elections held in March 1995, Zoglo's political vehicle, the Parti de la Renaissance du Benin, was the largest single party but lacked an overall majority. The success of a party formed by supporters of ex-president K\u00e9r\u00e9kou, who had officially retired from active politics, allowed him to stand successfully at both the 1996 and 2001 presidential elections.\n2000s.\nDuring the 2001 elections, however, alleged irregularities and dubious practices led to a boycott of the run-off poll by the main opposition candidates. The four top-ranking contenders following the first round presidential elections were Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou (incumbent) 45.4%, Nicephore Soglo (former president) 27.1%, Adrien Houngb\u00e9dji (National Assembly Speaker) 12.6%, and Bruno Amoussou (Minister of State) 8.6%. The second round balloting, originally scheduled for March 18, 2001, was postponed for days because both Soglo and Houngbedji withdrew, alleging electoral fraud. This left K\u00e9r\u00e9kou to run against his own Minister of State, Amoussou, in what was termed a \"friendly match.\"\nIn December 2002, Benin held its first municipal elections since before the institution of Marxism-Leninism. The process was smooth with the significant exception of the 12th district council for Cotonou, the contest that would ultimately determine who would be selected for the mayoralty of the capital city. That vote was marred by irregularities, and the electoral commission was forced to repeat that single election. Nicephore Soglo's Renaissance du Benin (RB) party won the new vote, paving the way for the former president to be elected Mayor of Cotonou by the new city council in February 2002.\nNational Assembly elections took place in March 2003 and were generally considered to be free and fair. Although there were some irregularities, these were not significant and did not greatly disrupt the proceedings or the results. These elections resulted in a loss of seats by RB\u2014the primary opposition party. The other opposition parties, the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD) led by the former Prime Minister Adrien Houngbedji and the Alliance Etoile (AE), joined the government coalition.\nFormer West African Development Bank Director Yayi Boni won the March 2006 election for the presidency in a field of 26 candidates. International observers including the United Nations, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and others called the election free, fair, and transparent. President K\u00e9r\u00e9kou was barred from running under the 1990 constitution due to term and age limitations. President Yayi was inaugurated on April 6, 2006.\nBenin held legislative elections on March 31, 2007, for the 83 seats in the National Assembly. The Force Cowrie for an Emerging Benin (FCBE), a coalition of parties, closely linked to President Yayi, won a plurality of the seats in the National Assembly, providing the president with considerable influence over the legislative agenda.\n2010s.\nIn March 2011, President Boni Yayi was re-elected with 53.13 percent of vote in the first-round of the election. His main rival rejected the results, claiming widespread irregularities.\nIn October 2015, Benin's former President Mathieu Kerekou, who ruled the country a total of 28 years during his two spells as president (1972-1991 and 1996\u20132006), died at the age of 82.\nAfter President Boni Yayi had served maximum two five-year terms, businessman Patrice Talon succeeded him. Talon defeated prime minister Lionel Zinsou, the candidate for Boni Yayi's Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin (FCBE), in the March 2016 presidential election.\n2020s.\nIn April 2021, incumbent Patrice Talon won re-election with 86 percent of the votes in the first round of the election. The change in election laws resulted in total control of parliament by president Talon's supporters.\nIn April 2025, the government of Benin adopted a law, recognizing 16 kingdoms, 80 senior chiefs and 10 traditional chiefs through a new law, adopted in March 2025. The pre-colonial period, set at 1894 for the south and 1897 for the north of Benin, served as a historical reference for the bill to institutionalize chieftaincy in Benin. and to frame the rules on traditional territories.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a type of fipple flute, and may be mouth-operated, or powered by air pressure, steam, or other means. Whistles vary in size from a small slide whistle or nose flute type to a large multi-piped church organ.\nWhistles have been around since early humans first carved out a gourd or branch and found they could make sound with it. In prehistoric Egypt, small shells were used as whistles. Many present day wind instruments are inheritors of these early whistles. With the rise of more mechanical power, other forms of whistles have been developed.\nOne characteristic of a whistle is that it creates a pure, or nearly pure, tone. The conversion of flow energy to sound comes from an interaction between a solid material and a fluid stream. The forces in some whistles are sufficient to set the solid material in motion. Classic examples are Aeolian tones that result in galloping power lines, or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (the so-called \"Galloping Gertie\" of popular media). Other examples are circular disks set into vibration.\nHistory.\nEarly whistles.\nWhistles made of bone or wood have been used for thousands of years. Whistles were used by the Ancient Greeks to keep the stroke of galley slaves. \nArchaeologists have found a terracotta whistle at the ruins of the ancient Greek city of Assos, most probably a child's toy placed in a child's grave as a burial gift.\nThe English used whistles during the Crusades to signal orders to archers. Boatswain pipes were also used in the age of sail aboard naval vessels to issue commands and salute dignitaries.\nJoseph Hudson.\nJoseph Hudson set up J Hudson &amp; Co in Birmingham in 1870. With his younger brother James, he designed the \"Acme City\" brass whistle. This became the first referee whistle used at association football matches during the 1878\u201379 Football Association Cup match between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield. Prior to the introduction of the whistle, handkerchiefs were used by the umpires to signal to the players.\nIn 1883, he began experimenting with pea-whistle designs that could produce an intense sound that could grab attention from over a mile away. His invention was discovered by accident when he dropped his violin and it shattered on the floor. Observing how the discordant sound of the breaking strings travelled (trill effect), Hudson had the idea to put a pea in the whistle. Prior to this, whistles were much quieter and were only thought of as musical instruments or toys for children. After observing the problems that local police were having with effectively communicating with rattles, he realised that his whistle designs could be used as an effective aid to their work.\nHudson demonstrated his whistle to Scotland Yard and was awarded his first contract in 1884. Both rattles and whistles were used to call for back-up in areas where neighbourhood beats overlapped, and following their success in the Metropolitan Police of London, the whistle was adopted by most police forces in the United Kingdom.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I, officers of the British Army and United States Army used whistles to communicate with troops, command charges and warn when artillery pieces were going to fire. Most whistles used by the British were manufactured by J &amp; Hudson Co."}
{"id": "42388", "revid": "49658355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42388", "title": "History of Bermuda", "text": "Bermuda was first documented by a European in 1503 by Spanish explorer Juan de Berm\u00fadez. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent it from sinking, then landed ashore. Bermuda's first capital, St.\u00a0George's, was established in 1612.\nThe Virginia Company administered the island as an extension of Virginia until 1614; its spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, took over in 1615 and managed the island until 1684, when the company's charter was revoked and Bermuda became an English Crown Colony. Following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain, the islands of Bermuda became a British Crown Colony.\nWhen Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, Bermuda became the oldest remaining British colony. It has been the most populous remaining dependent territory since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Bermuda became known as a \"British Overseas Territory\" in 2002, as a result of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002.\nInitial discovery and early colony.\nThe earliest depiction of the island is the inclusion of \"La Bermuda\" in the map of Pedro Martyr's 1511 \"Legatio Babylonica\". The earliest description of the island was Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s' account of his 1515 visit with Juan de Berm\u00fadez aboard \"La Garza\". Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas in 1527 affirms the island was named after the captain who discovered it. Henry Harrisse documents earlier voyages by Juan Berm\u00fadez in 1498, 1502, and 1503, though John Henry Lefroy noted Berm\u00fadez left no account of visiting the island. Samuel Eliot Morison lists a 1505 discovery by Juan Berm\u00fadez, citing the investigation into the \"Archivo de Indias\" by Roberto Barreiro-Meiro. Compounding the confusion is the record of a Francisco Bermudez accompanying Christopher Columbus on his first voyage, a Diego Bermudez accompanying Columbus on his fourth voyage, and Juan's brother Diego Bermudez accompanying Ponce de Le\u00f3n in a 1513 voyage. Thus, the only clearly documented account is of Juan Bermudez visiting the island in 1515, with the implication he had discovered the island on an earlier voyage. The island was definitely on the homeward course for returning Spaniards, as they followed the Gulf Stream north followed by the Westerlies just north of Bermuda. The Spanish avoided the uninhabited island's reefs and hurricanes, calling it Demoniorum Insulam. Yet, Spanish Rock bears the date of 1543, but little further details. A Frenchman called Russell was wrecked there in 1570, followed by the Englishman Henry May in 1593, but both managed to escape. Spanish Capt. Diego Ramirez was stranded on the rocks of Bermuda after a storm in 1603, when he discovered the \"devils reported to be about Bermuda\" were actually the outcry of the Bermuda petrel. He did note the former presence of men, including remnants of a wreck.\nIn late August 1585, an English ship \"Tiger\" commanded by Richard Grenville on his return from the Roanoke Colony, fought and captured a larger Spanish ship \"Santa Maria de San Vicente\" off the shores of Bermuda.\nThe 1609 shipwreck of \"Sea Venture\".\nOn 2 June 1609, Sir George Somers had set sail aboard , the new flagship of the Virginia Company, leading a fleet of nine vessels, loaded with several hundred settlers, food and supplies for the new English colony of Jamestown, in Virginia. Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. The fleet was caught in a storm on 24 July, and \"Sea Venture\" was separated and began to founder. When the reefs to the East of Bermuda were spotted, the ship was deliberately driven on them to prevent its sinking, thereby saving all aboard, 150 sailors and settlers, and one dog. William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\", in which the character Ariel refers to the \"still-vex'd Bermoothes\" (I.ii.229), is thought to have been inspired by William Strachey's and Silvester Jourdain's accounts of the shipwreck.\nThe survivors spent nine months on Bermuda. With ship's supplies mostly gone except for some domestic pigs, the castaways subsisted on rainwater, palm tree pulp, cedar berries, fish, birds (such as Bermuda petrel), and by hunting for the plentiful wild hogs from past Bermuda shipwrecks.\nThe master's mate and 7 other sailors were lost at sea when \"Sea Venture\"'s longboat was rigged with a mast and sent in search of Jamestown to rescue the lot. The sailors were not seen again. The remainder of castaways built two new ships: \"Deliverance\" at and 80\u00a0tons, and \"Patience\" at and 30\u00a0tons, mostly from Bermuda cedar. When the two new vessels were completed, most of the survivors set sail on May 10th, completing their journey to Jamestown on June 8, 1610. Christopher Carter and Edward Waters remained, the latter being accused of murder, while four others had died, including John Rolfe's infant daughter. Later in Jamestown, Rolfe's wife died (and he would eventually marry a native, Pocahontas). The castaways arrived only to find the colony's population almost annihilated by the Starving Time, which had left only sixty survivors. According to Sir William Monson, the \"swine brought from Bermuda\" saved Virginia until the timely arrival of Lord De La Warre.\nSomers returned to Bermuda on \"Patience\" in June and found Carter and Waters alive. Somers soon died, however, and while his heart was buried at Saint Georges, his nephew, Captain Matthew Somers, returned his embalmed body to England for burial at Dorset.\n1612 official settlement.\nTwo years later, in 1612, the Virginia Company's Royal Charter was officially extended to include the island, and a party of sixty settlers was sent on \"Plough\", under the command of Sir Richard Moore, the island's first governor. Joining the two men left behind by \"Deliverance\" and \"Patience\" (who had taken up residence on Smith's Island) and Edward Chard, they founded and commenced construction of the town of St. George, designated as Bermuda's first capital, the oldest continually inhabited English town in the New World.\nBermuda struggled throughout the following seven decades to develop a viable economy. The Virginia Company, finding the colony unprofitable, briefly handed its administration to the Crown in 1614. The following year, 1615, King James I granted a charter to a new company, the Somers Isles Company, formed by the same shareholders, which ran the colony until it was dissolved in 1684. (The Virginia Company itself was dissolved after its charter was revoked in 1624). Representative government was introduced to Bermuda in 1620, when its House of Assembly held its first session, and it became a self-governing colony.\nSomers Isles Company (1615\u20131684).\nIn 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the Somers Isles Company, named after the admiral who saved his passengers from the \"Sea Venture\". Many Virginian place names refer to the archipelago, such as Bermuda City, and Bermuda Hundred. The first British colonial currency was struck in Bermuda.\nBermuda was divided by Richard Norwood into eight equally sized administrative areas west of St. George's called \"tribes\" (today known as \"parishes\"). These \"tribes\" were areas of land partitioned off to the principal \"Adventurers\" (investors) of the company, from east to west \u2013 Bedford, Smiths, Cavendish, Paget, Mansell, Warwick, and Sandys.\nThe company sent 600 settlers in nine ships between 1612 and 1615. Governor Moore dug a well in St. George, then built fortifications including Paget and Smith's batteries at the entrance of the harbour, King's and Charles' at the entrance to Castle Harbour, Pembroke Fort on Cooper's Island, and Gates' Fort, St. Katherine's Fort and Warwick Castle to defend St. George. In 1614, the first English-grown tobacco was exported, the same tobacco variety John Rolfe started to grow in Virginia. The exporting of ambergris was especially lucrative. \nSlavery in Bermuda.\nIn August 1616, plantain, sugarcane, fig, and pineapple plants were imported along with the first Indian and Negro, the first English colony to use enslaved Africans. By 1619, Bermuda had between fifty and a hundred black enslaved persons. These were a mixture of native Africans who were trafficked to the Americas via the African slave trade and Native Americans who were enslaved from the Thirteen Colonies. The first African slaves arrived in Bermuda in 1617, not from Africa but from the West Indies. Bermuda Governor Tucker sent a ship to the West Indies to find black slaves to dive for pearls in Bermuda. More black slaves were later trafficked to the island in large numbers, originating from America and the Caribbean.\nAs the black population grew, so did the fear of insurrection among the white settlers. In 1623, a law to restrain the insolence of the Negroes was passed in Bermuda. It forbade blacks to buy or sell, barter or exchange tobacco or any other produce for goods without the consent of their master. Unrest amongst the slaves predictably erupted several times over the next decades. Major rebellions occurred in 1656, 1661, 1673, 1682, 1730 and 1761. In 1761 a conspiracy was discovered that involved the majority of the blacks on the island. Six slaves were executed and all black celebrations were prohibited.\nAgricultural diversification.\nThough Bermuda exported more tobacco than Virginia until 1625, Bermuda diversified its agriculture to include corn, potatoes, fruit trees, poultry and livestock. This was especially true when prices collapsed in 1630, and tobacco took its toll on soil fertility, though the company continued to use tobacco as a medium of exchange and resist a diversified economy. Tobacco exports peaked in 1684, the last year of company control.\nEnglish immigration essentially ceased by the 1620s when all available land was occupied. Because of its limited land area, Bermuda relied on emigration, especially to the developing English colonies in the Bahamas, the Carolinas, New York and the Caribbean. Between 1620 and 1640, 1200 emigrated, while the population reached 4000 in 1648. Between 1679 and 1690, 2000 emigrated, while the population reached 6248 in 1691.\nThe archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the New World. In 1616 and 1620, acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises.\nEnglish Civil War in the Bermuda.\nIn 1649, the English Civil War was in its seventh year and King Charles I was beheaded in Whitehall, London. In Bermuda, related tensions resulted in civil war on the island; it was ended by militias. The majority of colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the Crown. Dissenters, such as Puritans and Independents, were pushed to settle the Bahamas under William Sayle. However, the Earl of Dorset, a royalist, was replaced by the Earl of Warwick, a Puritan, as governor of the Somers Island Company. Sayle and most of the emigrants were allowed to return to Bermuda in 1656.\nBermuda and Virginia, as well as Antigua and Barbados were, however, the subjects of the September 1650 Prohibitory Act of the Rump Parliament, and the Atlantic fleet was instructed to bring these opposing colonies into obedience. At the same time, John Danvers, governor of the Somers Island Company, and the other adventurers were forced to take the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth. Then in the 1651 Navigation Act, trade was restricted to English ships.\nAn Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego, specified that:\n\"due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.\"\nAll Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprised. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.\nIn 1658, the Company appointed Sayle Governor of Bermuda, and the islanders took the oath of allegiance to the Lord Protector.\nIndentured servitude and slavery in 17th century Bermuda.\nAmong the emigrants after Norwood finished his survey were Bridewell, Newgate and gaol transportees, indentured servants, and \"maids for wives\". Yet most were emigrant families bound for four to five years as tenant farmers, paying half the tobacco they grew as rent to their landlord. This tenantry, indentured servitude of five years in return for passage, and family labor, reduced the need for slaves in growing tobacco and provisions. Thus, though Bermuda was a slave society, slavery was not essential to the agriculture economy, and Bermuda did not actively import slaves, instead relying on those black and Indian adults captured by privateers, then sold as slaves in Bermuda. This was a break in the usual pattern, in which slaves were purchased in Africa from local chiefs who had enslaved them in wars, or for committing crimes. Black indentures were for 99 years or life. The few Scot exiles received after the Civil War were indentured for seven years, while the few Irish exiles from that same period caused the slave trouble of 1664, and were hence forbidden entry onwards. The indentured system importance ceased by 1668. This non-dependence on slavery changed however, when the island moved to a maritime economy in the 1690s, and incorporated slave sailors, carpenters, coopers, blacksmiths, masons, and shipwrights. Hiring out of these skilled slaves became commonplace for their owners, with slaves retaining only a third of the wages they earned. By 1710, slaves were doing much vital work and constituted 3,517 of the total population of 8,366 in 1721.\nSlaves could be obtained by sale or purchase, auction debt, legal seizure or by gift. The price of a slave depended on demand. Throughout the 17th century children sold for \u00a38, women from \u00a310 to \u00a320, and able bodied men for around \u00a326.\nSlave revolts were a threat since 1623, while a revolt in 1656 resulted in executions and banishments. A 1664 revolt was stopped early, as was one in 1673, and again in 1681, which resulted in five executions. These revolts resulted in the orders of 1674 mandating that slaves straying from their premises, wandering at night without permission, or the gathering of two or three slaves from different tribes, be whipped. Any blacks deemed free were required to become slaves again or leave the island. The importation of additional slaves was also banned. A Jamaican slave named Tom was deported in 1682, when his rebellious plot was divulged by two Bermudian slaves.\nThe 18th century.\nThe salt trade and the Turks Islands.\nBermudians were raking sea salt in the Caribbean since the 1630s, an essential ingredient for making cheese, butter, and preserving meat and fish. Rakers would channel sea water in salt pans for evaporation. Salt Cay and Grand Turk Island became salt colonies in the 1680s. According to Jarvis, \"these small, hot, dry, and barren islands\" were perfect for salt production since the limestone, absence of fresh water, and limited rain fall combined to make the soil unfertile. Yet, average temperatures in the eighties Fahrenheit and the eastern trade wind facilitated evaporation of sea water into a saturated brine for salt crystallized. Natural ponds were augmented with sluices and causeways. Salt originating from this province was cherished for its \"brilliant color, purity, and versatility,\" according to Jarvis. In 1708, eighteen vessels were involved in raking salt, and this number grew to 65 in 1716, during the March to November raking season. By 1740, 200 vessels were loading salt annually from Grand Turk and Salt Cay, while a few dozen rakers stayed during the winter to repair pans.\nOutside any colonial jurisdiction, Great Britain nevertheless claimed the islands \"by right of Bermudian discovery, seasonal occupation, and improvement,\" according to Jarvis. Yet, France and Spain disputed Britain's claims with many attacks, coupled with those by pirates. Attacks from France and Spain commenced in 1709 and did not stop until 1764, when Great Britain's sovereignty was recognized. In 1693, Bahamas governor Nicholas Trott taxed the rakers, and renewed those taxes in 1738. Peace transformed the raking business from an almost all white enterprise, to mixed slave and free labor. Seasonal rakers also increased from 300 in 1768 to almost 800 in 1775.\nWhen the Bermudian sloop \"Seaflower\" was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of Bermuda Governor Bennett was to issue letters of marque to Bermudian Privateers. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians, but were driven out themselves three years later by a Bermudian privateer under the command of Captain Lewis Middleton in what was probably Bermuda's only independent military operation. His ship, the \"Rose\", attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the \"Rose\" then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.\nIn 1766, the Board of Trade granted Andrew Symmer, a Bermudian merchant, the Crown Agent for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Symmer then set a residency requirement of six months, modified the rakers elected government of five commissioners, initiated a mandatory militia requirement, and taxed each bushel of salt. Bahamian governor Thomas Shirley then tried to take control in 1772 and drive away the Bermudian rakers. By then, 750 of the 800 Turks Islands' rakers were from Bermuda. In 1774, Bermuda sent a sloop to protect their rakers after a Bahamian tax collector was beaten. A veto of the Bahamian Acts by the Board of Trade prevented escalating violence.\nThe Bahamas, meanwhile, was incurring considerable expense in absorbing loyalist refugees from the now-independent American colonies, and returned to the idea of taxing Turks salt for the needed funds. The Bahamian government ordered that all ships bound for the Turk Islands obtain a license at Nassau first. The Bermudians refused to do this. Following this, Bahamian authorities seized the Bermuda sloops \"Friendship\" and \"Fanny\" in 1786. Shortly after, three Bermudian vessels were seized at Grand Caicos, with $35,000 worth of goods salvaged from a French ship. French privateers were becoming a menace to Bermudian operations in the area, at the time, but the Bahamians were their primary concern.\nThe Bahamian government re-introduced a tax on salt from the Turks, annexed them to the Bahamas, and created a seat in the Bahamian parliament to represent them. The Bermudians refused these efforts also, but the continual pressure from the Bahamians had a negative effect on the salt industry. In 1806, the Bermudian customs authorities went some way toward acknowledging the Bahamian annexation when it ceased to allow free exchange between the Turks and Bermuda (this affected many enslaved Bermudians, who, like the free ones, had occupied the Turks only seasonally, returning to their homes in Bermuda after the year's raking had finished).\nThat same year, French privateers attacked the Turks, burning ships and absconding with a large sloop. The Bahamians refused to help, and the Admiralty in Jamaica claimed the Turks were beyond its jurisdiction. Two hurricanes, the first in August 1813, the second in October 1815, destroyed more than two hundred buildings and significant salt stores; and sank many vessels. By 1815, the United States, the primary client for Turks salt, had been at war with Britain (and hence Bermuda) for three years, and had established other sources of salt.\nWith the destruction wrought by the storm, and the loss of market, many Bermudians abandoned the Turks, and those remaining were so distraught that they welcomed the visit of the Bahamian governor in 1819. The British government eventually assigned political control to the Bahamas, which the Turks and Caicos remained a part of until the 1840s.\nOne Bermudian salt raker, Mary Prince, however, was to leave a scathing record of Bermuda's activities there in \"The History of Mary Prince\", a book which helped to propel the abolitionist cause to the 1834 emancipation of slaves throughout the Empire.\nShipbuilding and the maritime economy.\nWith royal administration commencing under Charles II in 1683, and the end of company control in 1684, the island was able to change the basis of its economy from tobacco to maritime enterprises. The maritime economy included ship building, wrecking, whaling, piloting and fishing in local waters. The population at that time consisted of 5889 whites and 1737 slaves. While Tobacco ceased to be a commercial crop by 1710, Bermuda's fleet had grown from fourteen vessels in 1679 to sixty sloops, six brigantines and four ships in 1700.\nThese \"Bermuda sloops\" had their origin in the ship Jacob Jacobson first built after becoming shipwrecked on the island in 1619, and were based on craft sailing on the Zuiderzee and the Dutch coastal sloep. These two-masted vessels, with the mast \"raked\" or inclined 15\u00a0degrees aft, carried fore-and-aft rigs of triangular Bermuda sails. Large mainsails were fixed to elongated booms, giving the sloop a large sail area for maximum speed, averaging 3 knots, but known to exceed 5 knots. Finally, these sloops were especially adept at sailing into the wind, maneuvering, and close-hauled sailing.\nSmaller vessels were originally built for local use, fishing and hauling freight and passengers about the archipelago. By the 1630s, with dwindling income from tobacco exports, largely due to increased competition as the Virginia and newer colonies in the West Indies turned to tobacco cultivation, many of the absentee landowners in England sold their shares to the managers and tenants that occupied them, who turned increasingly to subsistence crops and raising livestock. Bermuda was quickly producing more food than it could consume, and began to sell the excess to the newer colonies that were cultivating tobacco to the exclusion of food crops required for their own subsistence. As the Somers Isles Company's magazine ship would not carry such cargo, Bermudians began constructing their own larger, ocean-going vessels for this purpose. They favoured single-masted designs, more commonly with a gaff-rigged mainsail, although a single larger sail required a larger, more highly skilled, crew than two or more smaller sails.\nThe sloops were built from Bermuda cedar, considered the best wood for shipping, according to Bermuda Governor Isaac Richier in 1691. This is because this cedar was as strong as American oak, yet weighed only two thirds as much. Long lasting due to its resistance to marine organisms, the cedar also had the advantage of being readily used for ship building, and were even planned as such while still growing. Using enslaved and free labor and year-round construction, a 30-ton sloop could be built in three to four months. Bermudians also adopted a reforestation policy, with groves cultivated as long-term crops, and passed down to future generations as dowries or inheritances.\nThe Bermuda sloop became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the Royal Navy. The Bermuda sloop carried dispatches of the victory at Trafalgar, and news of the death of Admiral Nelson, to England.\nPrivateering.\nBermuda was a center of privateering for most of its early history, with Bermuda governors Nathaniel Butler and Benjamin Bennett actively encouraging the practice. Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick (the namesake of Warwick Parish, was one of the major Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company due primarily to the use he realised could be made of Bermuda as a base for his privateers. Although Bermuda had no merchant or privateering fleet of its own at the time, many Bermudians left farming to work as privateers on English vessels operating from Bermuda, and in 1631 also to settle the short-lived Providence Island colony that was dedicated to privateering. During King George's War, according to Jarvis, \"privateering became widespread, respectable, and even patriotic.\" At least fifteen Bermudian privateers operated in the 1740s. State-licensed, privateers had the authority to capture enemy vessels or British vessels engaged in trading contraband. Alternatively, a letter of marque could be issued to a mariner engaged in trade, giving him the authority to seize any vessel they may come across. Vice admiralty courts reviewed the legality of any capture and subsequent distribution of cargo and prizes. Crews were a mixture of free and enslaved labor.\nDespite close links to the American colonies (and the material aid provided to the continental rebels in the form of a hundred barrels of stolen gunpowder and reportedly numerous Bermudian-built and other ships supplied by Bermudians), Bermudian privateers turned as aggressively on American shipping during the American War of Independence. An American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbour to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels, which had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying \"the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet for every one of ours\". The only attack on Bermuda during the war was carried out by two South Carolina sloops captained by a pair of Bermudian-born brothers (they damaged a fort and spiked its guns before retreating). It greatly surprised the Americans to discover that the crews of Bermudian privateers included Black slaves, as, with limited manpower, Bermuda had legislated that a part of all Bermudian crews must be made up of Blacks. In fact, when the Bermudian privateer \"Regulator\" was captured, virtually all of her crew were found to be Black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but with families in Bermuda all seventy men elected to be treated as Prisoners of War. Sent to New York on the sloop \"Duxbury\", they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda.\nThe American War of 1812 was to be the encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s, due partly to the buildup of the naval base in Bermuda, which reduced the Admiralty's reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits, and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians (unfortunately for the privateers, the British government was trying to woo the United States away from its affiliation with France and so gave a favourable ear to American shipowners). During the course of the American War of 1812, Bermudian privateers were to capture 298 ships (the total captures by \"all\" British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies was 1,593 vessels).\nBermuda and the American War of Independence.\nOn the eve of the American independence, Bermuda faced competition with its maritime economy. Bermudian emigrants to Virginia helped expand the growth of its merchant fleet, enabling it to exceed Bermuda's by 1762. By the 1770s, Virginia was launching more vessels than Bermuda. Only able to grow enough food to feed the population of 11,000 a few months out of the year, Bermudians relied on food imports from North America, and the consequent higher costs. Many Bermudians had emigrated to Belize to harvest mahogany, or to Georgia, East Florida and the Bahamas islands. Bermudians continued to fish the Grand Banks until forbidden by the Palliser's Act.\nPolitically, issues causing protest elsewhere little affected the island, lacking newspapers and an effective local government, which refused to raise public revenue, the island had long relied on smuggling and the circumventing of customs officers. Lacking a permanent garrison made the island immune to the Quartering Acts. Finally, the island had long been ambivalent to events in New England, whom the Bermudians considered their maritime rivals.\nBermuda's ambivalence changed in September 1774, when the Continental Congress resolved to ban trade with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies after 10 September 1775. Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, the Tucker Family met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by Benjamin Franklin when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with Peyton Randolph and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with George Washington.\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while the loyalist Governor George James Bruere slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda thus acquired a reputation for disloyalty. In late 1775, the British Parliament passed the Prohibitory Act to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS \"Scorpion\" to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with St. Eustatius through 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of loyal privateers.\nIn June 1776, HMS \"Nautilus\" secured the island, followed by in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of \"Nautilus\" in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, Sir Henry Clinton refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major William Sutherland. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combination of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and loyalist privateers, such that famine struck the island in 1779.\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780, turned the governorship over to his son, George Bruere Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.\nThe fallout of the war was that Britain lost all of its continental naval bases between the Maritimes and Spanish Florida, ultimately the West Indies. This launched Bermuda into a new prominence with the London Government, as its location, near the halfway point from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean, and off the US Atlantic Seaboard, allowed the Royal Navy to operate fully in the area, protecting British trade routes, and potentially commanding the American Atlantic coast in the event of war. The value of Bermuda in the hands of, or serving as a base for, enemies of the United States was shown by the roles it played in the American War of 1812 and the American Civil War. The blockade of the Atlantic ports by the Royal Navy throughout the first war (described in the US as the \"Second War of Independence\") was orchestrated from Bermuda, and the task force that burned Washington DC in 1814 was launched from the colony. During the latter war, Confederate blockade runners delivered European munitions into Southern harbours from Bermuda, smuggling cotton in the reverse direction.\nConsequently, the very features that made Bermuda such a prized base for the Royal Navy (its headquarters in the North Atlantic and West Indies until after the Second World War), also meant it was perpetually threatened by US invasion, as the US would have liked to both deny the base to an enemy, and use it as a way to extend its defences hundreds of miles out to sea, which would not happen until the Second World War.\nAs a result of the large regular army garrison established to protect the naval facilities, Bermuda's parliament allowed the Bermudian militia to become defunct after the end of the American war in 1815. More profound changes took place, however. The post American independence buildup of Royal Navy facilities in Bermuda meant the Admiralty placed less reliance on Bermudian privateers in the area. Combined with the effects of the American lawsuits, this meant the activity died out in Bermuda until a brief resurgence during the American War of 1812. With the American continental ports having become foreign territory, the Bermudian merchant shipping trade was seriously injured. During the course of American War of 1812, the Americans had developed other sources for salt, and Bermudians salt trade fell upon hard times. Control of the Turks Islands ultimately passed into the hands of Bermuda's sworn enemy, the Bahamas, in 1819. The shipbuilding industry had caused the deforestation of Bermuda's cedar by the start of the 19th century. As ships became larger, increasingly were built from metal, and with the advent of steam power, and with the vastly reduced opportunities Bermudians found for commerce due to US independence and the greater control exerted over their economies by developing territories, Bermuda's shipbuilding industry and maritime trades were slowly strangled.\nThe chief leg of the Bermudian economy became defence infrastructure. Even after tourism began in the later 19th century, Bermuda remained, in the eyes of London, a base more than a colony, and this led to a change in the political dynamics within Bermuda as its political and economic ties to Britain were strengthened, and its independence on the world stage was diminished. By the end of the 19th century, except for the presence of the naval and military facilities, Bermuda was thought of by non-Bermudians and Bermudians alike as a quiet, rustic backwater, completely at odds with the role it had played in the development of the English-speaking Atlantic world, a change that had begun with American independence.\n19th century.\nNaval and military base.\nFollowing the American Revolution and the loss of Britain's ports in its former continental colonies, Bermuda was also used as a stopover point between Canada and Britain's Caribbean possessions, and assumed a new strategic prominence for the Royal Navy. Hamilton, a centrally located port founded in 1790, became the seat of government in 1815. This was partly resultant from the Royal Navy having invested twelve years, following American independence, in charting Bermuda's reefs. It did this in order to locate the deepwater channel by which shipping might reach the islands in, and at the West of, the Great Sound, which it had begun acquiring with a view to building a naval base. However, that channel also gave access to Hamilton Harbour.\nIn 1811, the Royal Navy started building the large dockyard on Ireland Island, in the west of the chain, to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. To guard it, the British Army built up a large Bermuda Garrison, and heavily fortified the archipelago.\nDuring the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States, the British attacks on Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake were planned and launched from Bermuda, where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station had recently been moved from Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nIn 1816, James Arnold, the son of Benedict Arnold, fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible US attacks. Today, the National Museum of Bermuda, which incorporates Bermuda's Maritime Museum, occupies the Keep of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artifacts of the base's military history.\nIn the 1860s, the major build-up of naval and military infrastructure brought vital money into Bermuda at a time when its traditional maritime industries were giving way under the assault of steel hulls and steam propulsion. The American Civil War, also, briefly, provided a shot-in-the-arm to the local economy.\nAs a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern US coast, during the American Civil War Confederate States blockade runners frequently used it as a stopping point base for runs to and from the Southern states or England to evade Union naval vessels on blockade patrol, delivering much needed war goods from England and for transporting much needed cotton back to England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a public museum.\nWith the buildup of the Royal Naval establishment in the first decades of the 19th century, a large number of military fortifications and batteries were constructed, and the numbers of regular infantry, artillery, and support units that composed the British Army garrison were steadily increased. The investment into military infrastructure by the War Office proved unsustainable, and poorly thought out, with far too few artillery men available to man the hundreds of guns emplaced. Many of the forts were abandoned, or removed from use, soon after construction. Following the Crimean War, the trend was towards reducing military garrisons in colonies like Bermuda, partly for economic reasons, and partly as it became recognised that the Royal Navy's own ships could provide a better defence for the Dockyard, and Bermuda. Still, the important strategic location of Bermuda meant that the withdrawal, which began, at least in intent, in the 1870s, was carried out very slowly over several decades, continuing until after World War I. The last Regular Army units were not withdrawn until the Dockyard itself closed in the 1950s.\nTourism and agricultural industries would develop in the latter half of the 19th century. However, it was defence infrastructure that formed the central platform of the economy into the 20th century.\nAnglo-Boer War.\nDuring the Anglo-Boer War (1899\u20131902), Bermuda received and housed a total of 5,000 Boer prisoners of war (POWs) on five of its islands. They were placed related to their views and authorities' assessment of risk. \"Bitterenders\" (), men who refused to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, were interned on Darrell's Island and closely guarded. Other islands were allowed to be nearly self-governing: Morgan's Island held 884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, Burt's Island had 607, and Port's Island held 35.\nIn June 1901, \"The New York Times\" reported an attempted mutiny by 900 Boer prisoners of war en route to Bermuda on \"Armenian\", noting it was suppressed. It described the preparation of the camps for the men and said that martial law would hold on Darrell's Island. Several escapes happened soon after their arrival. A young Boer soldier escaped from Darrell's Island soon after arrival, reached the main docks, and stowed away on the steamship \"Trinidad\", arriving in New York on 9 July. He hoped to be allowed to stay in the US. Three prisoners of war escaped on 10 July from Darrell's Island to mainland Bermuda.\nThe most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne who was serving a life sentence for \"conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage.\" On the night of 25 June 1902, Duquesne slipped out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed wire fence, swam past patrol boats and bright spot lights, through storm-wracked, using the distant Gibbs Hill Lighthouse for navigation until he arrived ashore on the main island. From there he escaped to the port of St. George's and a week later, he stowed away on a boat heading to Baltimore, Maryland. He settled in the US and later became a spy for Germany in both World Wars. He claimed to be responsible for the 1916 death of Lord Kitchener in the sinking of , the head of the British Army who had also commanded British forces in South Africa during the second Boer War, but this had resulted from a mine. In 1942, Colonel Duquesne was arrested by the FBI for leading the Duquesne Spy Ring, which still to this day the largest espionage case in the history of the United States.\nLord Kitchener's brother, Lieutenant General Sir Walter Kitchener, had been the Governor of Bermuda from 1908 until his death in 1912. His son, Major Hal Kitchener, bought Hinson's Island (with his partner, Major Hemming, another First World War aviator). The island had formerly been part of the Boer POW camp, housing teenaged prisoners from 1901 to 1902.\n20th century.\nTourism.\nTourism in Bermuda first developed in Victorian times, catering to a wealthy elite seeking to escape North American winters. Many also came hoping to find young aristocrats among the officers of the Garrison and Naval base to whom they might marry their daughters. Local hoteliers were quick to exploit this, and organised many dances and gatherings during the 'season', to which military and naval officers were given a blanket invitation.\nDue historically to a third of Bermuda's manpower being at sea at any one time, and to many of those seamen being lost at sea or ultimately settling elsewhere, especially as the Bermudian maritime industry began to suffer, the colony was noted for having a high proportion of unmarried women well into the 20th century. Many Bermudian women had traditionally wed naval or military officers. With the arrival of tourism, young local women had to compete with American girls. Most Bermudian women who married officers left Bermuda when their husbands were stationed elsewhere. Enlisted men married Bermudians, and many of those remained in Bermuda when they left the Army.\nBermudian advertisements stated that the island was cooler in the summer than resorts on the north Atlantic coast of North America. In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by sea. The United States 1930 Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act enacted protective tariffs that cut off Bermuda's once-thriving export trade of fresh vegetables to the United States and encouraged its development of tourism as an alternative.\nAfter several failed attempts, the first aeroplane reached Bermuda in 1930. A Stinson Detroiter seaplane flying from New York City, it had to land twice in the ocean: once because of darkness and again to refuel. Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the Royal Air Force (then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm) established a station at the Royal Naval Dockyard to repair (and supply replacement) float planes for the fleet. In 1936, Luft Hansa began to experiment with seaplane flights from Berlin via the Azores with continuation to New York City.\nImperial Airways and Pan American World Airways began operating scheduled flying-boat airline services from New York and Baltimore to Darrell's Island, Bermuda in 1937, by which time the summer had become more important for tourists making briefer visits. It was not until after the Second World War, when the first airport for landplanes was built and the advent of the Jet Age, that tourism fully realised its potential.\nWorld Wars.\nBermuda sent volunteer troops to fight in Europe with the British Army. They suffered severe losses. During the First World War, a number of Bermudians served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.\nDuring World War II, Bermuda's importance as a military base increased because of its location on the major trans-Atlantic shipping route. The Royal Naval dockyard on Ireland Island played a role similar to that it had during World War I, overseeing the formation of trans-Atlantic convoys composed of hundreds of ships. The military garrison, which included four local territorial units, maintained a guard against potential enemy attacks on the Island.\nFrom 1939, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) worked with the RN to establish an anti-submarine training program at Casemates Barracks. In May 1940, Canada was asked to provide garrison support, with one company of The Winnipeg Grenadiers sailing from Halifax to relieve a company of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. The Special Infantry Company of the Pictou Highlanders was mobilized on 10 September 1942 for service in Bermuda from 12 November 1942. In 1944, the RCN established a training base at the former Royal Navy base at Convict's Bay, St. George's, using a shore facility named . HMCS \"Somers Isles\" closed in 1945 and Canadian forces left Bermuda (temporarily) in 1946.\nBermuda became important for British Security Co-ordination operations with the ability to vet radio communication and search passengers and mail using flying boats to transit the Atlantic, with over 1,200 people working on opening packages secretly, finding coded messages, secret writing, micro dots and identifying spies working for Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Vichy France in the Americas, much of the information found being passed to the FBI. The Island was a base for direction finding equipment to help identify locations of German submarines and took down Enigma encoded messages, which were sent for Cryptanalysis of the Enigma to Bletchley Park.\nIn 1941, the United States signed the destroyers-for-bases deal with the United Kingdom, giving the British surplus U.S. Navy destroyers in exchange for 99-year lease rights to establish naval and air bases in certain British territories. Although not included in this trade, Winston Churchill granted the US similar 99-year leases \"freely and without consideration\" in both Bermuda and Newfoundland. (The commonly held belief that the Bermudian bases were part of the trade is not correct.) The advantage for Britain of granting these base rights was that the neutral US effectively took responsibility for the security of these territories, freeing British forces to be deployed to the sharper ends of the War. The terms of the base rights granted for Bermuda provided that the airfield constructed by the US would be used jointly with the Royal Air Force (RAF).\nThe Bermuda bases consisted of of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. The USAAF airfield, Fort Bell (later, US Air Force Base Kindley Field, and, later still, US Naval Air Station Bermuda) was on St. David's Island, while the Naval Operations Base, a Naval Air Station for maritime patrol flying boats, (which became the Naval Air Station Annex after US Naval air operations relocated to ) was at the western end of the island in the Great Sound. These joined two other air stations already operating on Bermuda, the pre-war civil airport on Darrell's Island, which had been taken over by the RAF, and the Fleet Air Arm's Royal Naval Air Station, HMS Malabar, on Boaz Island.\nPost-war history.\nBermuda has prospered economically since World War II, developing into a highly successful offshore financial centre. Although tourism remains important to Bermuda's economy, it has for three decades been second to international business in terms of economic importance to the island.\nThe Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military garrison, continued to be important to Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in World War II, US military installations also were located in Bermuda (see \"Military\" section below and Military of Bermuda).\nEffective 1 September 1995, both US military bases were closed; British and Canadian bases on the island closed at about the same time. Unresolved issues concerning the 1995 withdrawal of US forces\u2014primarily related to environmental factors\u2014delayed the formal return of the base lands to the Government of Bermuda. The United States formally returned the base lands in 2002.\nIn 1948, regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based aeroplanes began to Kindley Field (now L.F. Wade International Airport), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s\u20131970s. By the end of the 1970s, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy (see Economy of Bermuda).\nUniversal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, voting was dependent on a certain level of property ownership. On 10 March 1973, the Governor of Bermuda Richard Sharples was assassinated along with his aide-de-camp by local Black Power militants. Erskine Burrows was found guilty of this assassination. His hanging, on 2 December 1977 was followed by three days of riots. In 1981 the island saw its only general strike.\nThough Bermuda has been classified as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by the establishment of a formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a 1995 independence referendum was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have even heard of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 Gulf War, was the loss of the protection provided by the Royal Navy, especially to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is able to take advantage of its status as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared a large chunk of the money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence \u2013 by means of a general election (that is, the government of the day would have the power to decide whether to go independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) \u2013 by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the United Nations, who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.\n21st century.\nThe island suffered major damage from Hurricane Fabian in 2003. It was also hit by Hurricane Bertha in July 2008, Hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo in September 2014, Hurricane Joaquin in October 2015, and Hurricane Nicole in October 2016.\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, Bermuda became the smallest overseas territory to earn a gold medal, as Flora Duffy won Bermuda\u00b4s first ever olympic gold medal, in the women's triathlon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some of the structures provide evidence that the region has been settled as early as 2000 BC. According to a legend it was ruled by a Cooch-Behar king, Sangaldip, around the 7th century BC, but not much is known prior to the introduction of Tibetan Buddhism in the 8th century, when turmoil in Tibet forced many monks to flee to Bhutan. In the 12th century, the Drukpa Kagyupa school was established and remains the dominant form of Buddhism in Bhutan today. The country's political history is intimately tied to its religious history and relations among the various monastic schools and monasteries.\nSince at least the tenth century, no outside power has ever occupied or governed Bhutan (notwithstanding occasional nominal tributary status).\nThe consolidation of Bhutan occurred in 1616 when Ngawanag Namgyal, a lama from western Tibet known as the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, defeated three Tibetan invasions, subjugated rival religious schools, codified the \"Tsa Yig\", an intricate and comprehensive system of law, and established himself as ruler over a system of ecclesiastical and civil administrators. After his death, infighting and civil war eroded the power of the Zhabdrung for the next 200 years. In 1885, Ugyen Wangchuck was able to consolidate power, and began cultivating closer ties with the British in the subcontinent.\nOn December 1907, Ugyen Wangchuck (Bhutan:\u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f0b\u0f68\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f56\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f55\u0fb1\u0f74\u0f42) was enthroned as the first hereditary king of Bhutan. In 1910, King Ugyen and the British signed the Treaty of Punakha which provided that British India would not interfere in the internal affairs of Bhutan if the country accepted external advice in its external relations. When Ugyen Wangchuck died in 1926, his son Jigme Wangchuck became the second king, and when India gained independence in 1947, the new Indian Government recognized Bhutan as an independent country. In 1949, India and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which provided that India would not interfere in Bhutan's internal affairs, but would guide its foreign policy. Succeeded in 1952 by his son Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, Bhutan began to slowly emerge from its isolation and began a program of planned development. The National Assembly of Bhutan, the Royal Bhutanese Army, and the Royal Court of Justice were established, along with a new code of law. Bhutan became a member of the United Nations in 1971.\nIn 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended the throne at age 16. He emphasized modern education, decentralization of governance, the development of hydroelectricity and tourism and improvements in rural developments. He was perhaps best known internationally for his overarching development philosophy of \"gross national happiness.\" It recognizes that there are many dimensions to development and that economic goals alone are not sufficient. Satisfied with Bhutan's transitioning democratization process, he abdicated in December 2006 rather than wait until the promulgation of the new constitution in 2008. His son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, became King upon his abdication.\nOrigins and early settlement, 600\u20131600.\nA state of Lhomon (literally, southern darkness) or Monyul (dark land, a reference to the Monpa, one of the Tibeto-Burman peoples of Bhutan), possibly a part of Tibet that was then beyond the pale of Buddhist teachings. Monyul is thought to have existed between AD 100 and AD 600. The names Lhomon Tsendenjong (southern Mon sandalwood country) and Lhomon Khashi (southern Mon country of four approaches), found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles, may also have credence and have been used by some Bhutanese scholars when referring to their homeland. Variations of the Sanskrit words Bhota-ant (end of Bhot) or Bhu-uttan (meaning highlands) have been suggested by historians as origins of the name Bhutan, which came into common foreign use in the late 19th century and is used in Bhutan only in English-language official correspondence. The traditional name of the country since the 17th century has been Drukyul\u2014country of the Drukpa, the Dragon people, or the Land of the Thunder Dragon, a reference to the country's dominant Buddhist sect.\nSome scholars believe that during the early historical period the inhabitants were fierce mountain aborigines, the Monpa, who were of neither the Tibetan or Mongol stock that later overran northern Bhutan. The people of Monyul practiced a shamanistic religion, which emphasized worship of nature and the existence of good and evil spirits. During the latter part of this period, historical legends relate that the mighty king of Monyul invaded a southern region known as the Duars, subduing the regions of modern Assam, West Bengal, and Bihar in India.\nArrival of Buddhism.\nBuddhism was possibly first introduced to Bhutan as early as the 2nd century AD. Tibetan Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century. Tibetan king Songts\u00e4n Gampo (reigned 627\u2013649), a Buddhist convert, constructed 108 Buddhist temples in the Himalayan region, including a few temples at Bumthang in central Bhutan, Haa, Lhuentse and at Kyichu (near Paro) in the Paro Valley. Buddhism was propagated in earnest in 746 under King Sindhu R\u0101ja (\"also\" K\u00fcnjom; Sendha Gyab; Jakar Gyalpo), an exiled Indian king who had established a government in Bumthang at Jakar Gutho Palace.\nBuddhism replaced but did not eliminate the Bon religious practices that had also been prevalent in Tibet until the late 6th century. Instead, Buddhism absorbed Bon and its believers. As the country developed in its many fertile valleys, Buddhism matured and became a unifying element. It was Buddhist literature and chronicles that began the recorded history of Bhutan.\nIn 810AD, a Buddhist saint, Padmasambhava (known in Bhutan as Guru Rimpoche and sometimes referred to as the Second Buddha), came to Bhutan from Nepal at the invitation of King Sindhu R\u0101ja. After reportedly subduing eight classes of gods and demons and converting the king, Guru Rimpoche moved on to Tibet. Upon his return from Tibet, he oversaw the construction of new monasteries in the Paro Valley and set up his headquarters in Bumthang. According to tradition, he founded the Nyingmapa sect\u2014also known as the \"old sect\" or Red Hat sect\u2014of Mahayana Buddhism, which became for a time the dominant religion of Bhutan. Guru Rimpoche plays a great historical and religious role as the national patron saint who revealed the tantras\u2014manuals describing forms of devotion to natural energy\u2014to Bhutan. Following the guru's sojourn, Indian influence played a temporary role until increasing Tibetan migrations brought new cultural and religious contributions.\nThere was no central government during this period. Instead, small independent monarchies began to develop by the early 9th century. Each was ruled by a deb (king), some of whom claimed divine origins. The kingdom of Bumthang was the most prominent among these small entities. At the same time, Tibetan Buddhist monks (lam in Dzongkha, Bhutan's official national language) had firmly rooted their religion and culture in Bhutan, and members of joint Tibetan-Mongol military expeditions settled in fertile valleys. By the 11th century, all of Bhutan was occupied by Tibetan-Mongol military forces.\nSectarian rivalry.\nBy the 10th century, Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Following a period in which Buddhism was in decline in Tibet in the 11th century, contention among a number of subsects emerged. The Yuan dynasty overlords of Tibet and Bhutan patronized a sequence of subsects until their own political decline in the 14th century. By that time, the Gelugpa or Yellow Hat school had, after a period of anarchy in Tibet, become a powerful force resulting in the flight to Bhutan of numerous monks of various minor opposing sects. Among these monks was the founder of the Lhapa subsect of the Kargyupa school, to whom is attributed the introduction of strategically built dzong. Although the Lhapa subsect had been successfully challenged in the 12th century by another Kargyupa subsect\u2014the Drukpa\u2014led by Tibetan monk Phajo Drugom Zhigpo, it continued to proselytize until the 17th century. The Drukpa spread throughout Bhutan and eventually became a dominant form of religious practice. Between the 12th century and the 17th century, the two Kargyupa subsects vied with one another from their respective dzong as the older form of Nyingmapa Buddhism was eclipsed.\nTheocratic government, 1616\u20131907.\nConsolidation and defeat of Tibetan invasions, 1616\u201351.\nIn the 17th century, a theocratic government independent of Tibetan political influence was established, and premodern Bhutan emerged. The theocratic government was founded by an expatriate Drukpa monk, Ngawang Namgyal, who arrived in Bhutan in 1616 seeking freedom from the domination of the Gelugpa subsect led by the Dalai Lama (Ocean Lama) in Lhasa. After a series of victories over rival subsect leaders and Tibetan invaders, Ngawang Namgyal took the title \"Zhabdrung\" (At Whose Feet One Submits, or, in many Western sources, \"Dharma Raja\"), becoming the temporal and spiritual leader of Bhutan. Considered the first great historical figure of Bhutan, he united the leaders of powerful Bhutanese families in a land called Drukyul. He promulgated a code of law and built a network of impregnable forts (\"dzong\"), a system that helped bring local lords under centralized control and strengthened the country against Tibetan invasions. Many forts were extant in the late 20th century.\nDuring the first war with Tibet, c. 1627, Portuguese Jesuits Est\u00eav\u00e3o Cacella and Jo\u00e3o Cabral were the first recorded Europeans to visit Bhutan on their way to Tibet. They met with Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, gunpowder and a telescope, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Zhabdrung declined the offer. After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the Chagri Monastery reporting the travel. This is a rare report of the Zhabdrung remaining.\nTibetan armies invaded Bhutan around 1629, in 1631, and again in 1639, hoping to throttle Ngawang Namgyal's popularity before it spread too far. In 1634 Ngawang Namgyal defeated Karma Tenkyong's army in the Battle of Five Lamas. The invasions were thwarted, and the Drukpa subsect developed a strong presence in western and central Bhutan, leaving Ngawang Namgyal supreme. In recognition of the power he accrued, goodwill missions were sent to Bhutan from Cooch Behar in the Duars (present-day northeastern West Bengal), Nepal to the west, and Ladakh in western Tibet. The ruler of Ladakh even gave a number of villages in his kingdom to Ngawang Namgyal.\nBhutan's troubles were not over, however. In 1643, a joint Mongol-Tibetan force sought to destroy Nyingmapa refugees who had fled to Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal. The Mongols had seized control of religious and civil power in Tibet in the 1630s and established Gelugpa as the state religion. Bhutanese rivals of Ngawang Namgyal encouraged the Mongol intrusion, but the Mongol force was easily defeated in the humid lowlands of southern Bhutan. Another Tibetan invasion in 1647 also failed.\nDuring Ngawang Namgyal's rule, administration comprised a state monastic body with an elected head, the Je Khenpo (lord abbot), and a theocratic civil government headed by the Druk Desi (regent of Bhutan, also known as Deb Raja in Western sources). The Druk Desi was either a monk or a member of the laity\u2014by the 19th century, usually the latter; he was elected for a three-year term, initially by a monastic council and later by the State Council (Lhengye Zhungtshog). The State Council was a central administrative organ that included regional rulers, the Zhabdrung's chamberlains, and the Druk Desi. In time, the Druk Desi came under the political control of the State Council's most powerful faction of regional administrators. The Zhabdrung was the head of state and the ultimate authority in religious and civil matters. The seat of government was at Thimphu, the site of a 13th-century dzong, in the spring, summer, and fall. The winter capital was at Punakha Dzong, a dzong established northeast of Thimphu in 1527. The kingdom was divided into three regions (east, central, and west), each with an appointed ponlop, or governor, holding a seat in a major dzong. Districts were headed by dzongpon, or district officers, who had their headquarters in lesser dzong. The ponlop were combination tax collectors, judges, military commanders, and procurement agents for the central government. Their major revenues came from the trade between Tibet and India and from land taxes.\nNgawang Namgyal's regime was bound by a legal code called the Tsa Yig, which described the spiritual and civil regime and provided laws for government administration and for social and moral conduct. The duties and virtues inherent in the Buddhist dharma (religious law) played a large role in the new legal code, which remained in force until the 1960s.\nAdministrative integration and conflict with Tibet, 1651\u20131728.\nTo keep Bhutan from disintegrating, Ngawang Namgyal's death in 1651 apparently was kept a carefully guarded secret for fifty-four years. Initially, Ngawang Namgyal was said to have entered into a religious retreat, a situation not unprecedented in Bhutan, Sikkim, or Tibet during that time. During the period of Ngawang Namgyal's supposed retreat, appointments of officials were issued in his name, and food was left in front of his locked door.\nNgawang Namgyal's son and stepbrother, in 1651 and 1680, respectively, succeeded him. They started their reigns as minors under the control of religious and civil regents and rarely exercised authority in their own names. For further continuity, the concept of multiple reincarnation of the first Zhabdrung\u2014in the form of either his body, his speech, or his mind\u2014was invoked by the Je Khenpo and the Druk Desi, both of whom wanted to retain the power they had accrued through the dual system of government. The last person recognized as the bodily reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal died in the mid-18th century, but speech and mind reincarnations, embodied by individuals who acceded to the position of Zhabdrung Rinpoche, were in the early 1990s. The compulsory admission to monastic life of at least one son from any family having three or more sons was instituted in the late 17th century. In time, however, the State Council became increasingly secular as did the successive Druk Desi, ponlop, and dzongpon, and intense rivalries developed among the ponlop of Tongsa and Paro and the dzongpon of Punakha, Thimphu, and Wangdue Phodrang.\nDuring the first period of succession and further internal consolidation under the Druk Desi government, there was conflict with Tibet and Sikkim. Internal opposition to the central government resulted in overtures by the opponents of the Druk Desi to Tibet and Sikkim. In the 1680s, Bhutan invaded Sikkim in pursuit of a rebellious local lord. In 1700, Bhutan again invaded Sikkim, and in 1714 Tibetan forces, aided by Mongolia, invaded Bhutan but were unable to gain control.\nBhutan exclaves in western Tibet.\nDuring the 17th century Bhutan maintained close relations with Ladakh, and assisted Ladakh in its 1684 war with Tibet. Ladakh had earlier granted Bhutan several enclaves near Mount Kailash in western Tibet; these were monasteries of the Southern branch of the Drukpa sect and so fell under the authority of the Bhutanese Je Khenpo and the Zhabdrung. These enclaves persisted under Bhutanese control even after the rest of western Tibet came under the control of the Dalai Lama and his Gelugpa sect, until 1959 when the Bhutanese enclaves were seized by the Chinese. In addition to these outposts in Tibet, Bhutan for a time held monastic fiefs in Ladakh, Zanskar, and Lahul (now part of India), as well as in Lo Manthang and Dolpo (now part of Nepal).\nCivil conflict, 1728\u20131772.\nThough the invaders were unable to take control, the political system remained unstable. Regional rivalries contributed to the gradual disintegration of Bhutan at the time the first British agents arrived.\nIn the early 18th century, Bhutan had successfully developed control over the principality of Cooch Behar. The raja of Cooch Behar had sought assistance from Bhutan against the Indian Mughals in 1730, and Bhutanese political influence was not long in following. By the mid-1760s, Thimphu considered Cooch Behar its dependency, stationing a garrison force there and directing its civil administration. When the Druk Desi invaded Sikkim in 1770, Cooch Behari forces joined their Bhutanese counterparts in the offensive. In a succession dispute in Cooch Behar two years later, however, the Druk Desi's nominee for the throne was opposed by a rival who invited British troops, and, in effect, Cooch Behar became a dependency of the British East India Company.\nBritish intrusion, 1772\u20131907.\nUnder the Cooch Behari agreement with the British, a British expeditionary force drove the Bhutanese garrison out of Cooch Behar and invaded Bhutan in 1772\u201373. The Druk Desi petitioned Lhasa for assistance from the Panchen Lama, who was serving as regent for the youthful Dalai Lama. In correspondence with the British governor general of India, however, the Panchen Lama instead punished the Druk Desi and invoked Tibet's claim of suzerainty over Bhutan.\nFailing to receive help from Tibet, the Druk Desi signed a Treaty of Peace with the British East India Company on 25 April 1774. Bhutan agreed to return to its pre-1730 boundaries, paid a symbolic tribute of five horses to Britain, and, among other concessions, allowed the British to harvest timber in Bhutan. Subsequent missions to Bhutan were made by the British in 1776, 1777, and 1783, and commerce was opened between British India and Bhutan, and, for a short time, Tibet. In 1784, the British turned over to Bhutanese control Bengal Duars territory, where boundaries were poorly defined. As in its other foreign territories, Bhutan left administration of the Bengal Duars territory to local officials and collected its revenues. Although major trade and political relations failed to develop between Bhutan and Britain, the British had replaced the Tibetans as the major external threat.\nBoundary disputes plagued Bhutanese\u2013British relations. To reconcile their differences, Bhutan sent an emissary to Calcutta in 1787, and the British sent missions to Thimphu in 1815 and 1838. The 1815 mission was inconclusive. The 1838 mission offered a treaty providing for extradition of Bhutanese officials responsible for incursions into Assam, free and unrestricted commerce between India and Bhutan, and settlement of Bhutan's debt to the British. In an attempt to protect its independence, Bhutan rejected the British offer. Despite increasing internal disorder, Bhutan had maintained its control over a portion of the Assam Duars more or less since its reduction of Cooch Behar to a dependency in the 1760s. After the British gained control of Lower Assam in 1826, tension between the countries began to rise as Britain exerted its strength. Bhutanese payments of annual tribute to the British for the Assam Duars gradually fell into arrears. British demands for payment led to military incursions into Bhutan in 1834 and 1835, resulting in defeat for Bhutan's forces and a temporary loss of territory.\nThe British proceeded in 1841 to annex the formerly Bhutanese-controlled Assam Duars, paying a compensation of 10,000 rupees a year to Bhutan. In 1842, Bhutan gave to the British control of some of the troublesome Bengal Duars territory it had administered since 1784.\nCharges and countercharges of border incursions and protection of fugitives led to an unsuccessful Bhutanese mission to Calcutta in 1852. Among other demands, the mission sought increased compensation for its former Duars territories; instead the British deducted nearly 3,000 rupees from the annual compensation and demanded an apology for alleged plundering of British-protected lands by members of the mission. Following more incidents and the prospect of an anti-Bhutan rebellion in the Bengal Duars, British troops deployed to the frontier in the mid-1850s. The Sepoy Rebellion in India in 1857-58 and the demise of the British East India Company's rule prevented immediate British action. Bhutanese armed forces raided Sikkim and Cooch Behar in 1862, seizing people, property, and money. The British responded by withholding all compensation payments and demanding release of all captives and return of stolen property. Demands to the Druk Desi went unheeded, as he was alleged to be unaware of his frontier officials' actions against Sikkim and Cooch Behar.\nBritain sent a peace mission to Bhutan in early 1864, in the wake of the recent conclusion of a civil war there. The dzongpon of Punakha\u2014who had emerged victorious\u2014had broken with the central government and set up a rival Druk Desi, while the legitimate Druk Desi sought the protection of the ponlop of Paro and was later deposed. The British mission dealt alternately with the rival penlop of Paro and the Penlop of Trongsa (the latter acting on behalf of the Druk Desi), but Bhutan rejected the peace and friendship treaty it offered. Britain declared war in November 1864. Bhutan had no regular army, and what forces existed were composed of dzong guards armed with matchlocks, bows and arrows, swords, knives, and catapults. Some of these dzong guards, carrying shields and wearing chainmail armor, engaged the well-equipped British forces.\nThe Duar War (1864\u201365) lasted only five months and, despite some battlefield victories by Bhutanese forces, resulted in Bhutan's defeat, loss of part of its sovereign territory, and forced cession of formerly occupied territories. Under the terms of the Treaty of Sinchula, signed on 11 November 1865, Bhutan ceded territories in the Assam Duars and Bengal Duars, as well as the eighty-three-square-kilometer territory of Dewangiri in southeastern Bhutan, in return for an annual subsidy of 50,000 rupees. The land that was to become Bhutan House was ceded from Bhutan to British India in 1865 at the conclusion the Duar War and as a condition of the Treaty of Sinchula.\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, renewed competition among regional rivals\u2014primarily the pro-British Penlop of Trongsa and the anti-British, pro-Tibetan ponlop of Paro\u2014resulted in the ascendancy of Ugyen Wangchuck, the Penlop of Trongsa. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck had defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions in 1882\u201385. His victory came at a time of crisis for the central government, however. British power was becoming more extensive to the south, and in the west Tibet had violated its border with Sikkim, incurring British disfavor. After 1,000 years of close ties with Tibet, Bhutan faced the threat of British military power and was forced to make serious geopolitical decisions. The British, seeking to offset potential Russian advances in Lhasa, wanted to open trade relations with Tibet. Ugyen Wangchuck, on the advice of his closest adviser Ugyen Dorji, saw the opportunity to assist the British and in 1903-4 volunteered to accompany a British mission to Lhasa as a mediator. For his services in securing the Anglo-Tibetan Convention of 1904, Ugyen Wangchuck was knighted and thereafter continued to accrue greater power in Bhutan. Ugyen Dorji, as well as his descendants, went on to maintain British favor on behalf of the government from Bhutan House in Kalimpong, India.\nEstablishment of the hereditary monarchy, 1907.\nUgyen Wangchuck's emergence as the national leader coincided with the realization that the dual political system was obsolete and ineffective. He had removed his chief rival, the ponlop of Paro, and installed a supporter and relative, a member of the pro-British Dorji family, in his place. When the last Zhabdrung died in 1903 and a reincarnation had not appeared by 1906, civil administration came under the control of Ugyen Wangchuck. Finally, in 1907, the fifty-fourth and last Druk Desi was forced to retire, and despite recognitions of subsequent reincarnations of Ngawang Namgyal, the Zhabdrung system came to an end.\nIn November 1907, an assembly of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families was held to end the moribund 300-year-old dual system of government and to establish a new absolute monarchy. Ugyen Wangchuck was elected its first hereditary Druk Gyalpo (\"Dragon King\") and subsequently reigned from 1907 to 1926. Bhutan's Political Officer John Claude White took photographs of the coronation ceremony. The Dorji family became hereditary holders of the position of Gongzim (Chief Chamberlain), the top government post. The British, wanting political stability on their northern frontier, approved of the entire development.\nBritain's earlier entreaties in Lhasa had unexpected repercussions at this time. The Chinese Qing dynasty, concerned that Britain would seize Tibet, established direct rule in Tibet in 1910 (the Qing dynasty had previously incorporated Tibet in 1720 but placed it under the administration of the Lifan Yuan). The Dalai Lama then fled to India. China laid claim not only to Tibet but also to Bhutan, Nepal, and Sikkim. With these events, Bhutanese and British interests coalesced.\nOn January 8, 1910, Sikkim Political Officer and Tibetologist Sir Charles Alfred Bell engaged Bhutan and signed the Treaty of Punakha. The Treaty of Punakha amended two articles of the 1865 treaty: the British agreed to double their annual stipend to 100,000 rupees and \"to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan.\" In turn, Bhutan agreed \"to be guided by the advice of the British Government in regard to its external relations.\" The Treaty of Punakha guaranteed Bhutan's defense against China; China, in no position to contest British power, conceded the end of the millennium-long Tibetan-Chinese influence. It also assigned land in Motithang (Thimphu) and a hill station between Chukha and Thimphu to the British, assigning a portion of Kalimpong (Bhutan House) to Bhutan.\nMuch of Bhutan's modern development has been attributed by Bhutanese historians to the first Druk Gyalpo. Internal reforms included introducing Western-style schools, improving internal communications, encouraging trade and commerce with India, and revitalizing the Buddhist monastic system. Toward the end of his life, Ugyen Wangchuck was concerned about the continuity of the family dynasty, and in 1924 he sought British assurance that the Wangchuck family would retain its preeminent position in Bhutan. His request led to an investigation of the legal status of Bhutan vis-\u00e0-vis the suzerainty held over Bhutan by Britain and the ambiguity of Bhutan's relationship to India. Both the suzerainty and the ambiguity were maintained.\nDevelopment of centralized government, 1926\u20131952.\nUgyen Wangchuck died in 1926 and was succeeded by his son, Jigme Wangchuck (reigned 1926\u201352). The second Druk Gyalpo continued his father's centralization and modernization efforts and built more schools, dispensaries, and roads. During Jigme Wangchuck's reign, monasteries and district governments were increasingly brought under royal control. However, Bhutan generally remained isolated from international affairs.\nThe issue of Bhutan's status vis-\u00e0-vis the government of India was reexamined by London in 1932 as part of the issue of the status of India itself. It was decided to leave the decision to join an Indian federation up to Bhutan when the time came. When British rule over India ended in 1947, so too did Britain's association with Bhutan. India succeeded Britain as the de facto protector of the Himalayan kingdom, and Bhutan retained control over its internal government. It was two years, however, before a formal agreement recognized Bhutan's independence.\nFollowing the precedent set by the Treaty of Punakha, on August 8, 1949, Thimphu signed the Treaty of Friendship Between the Government of India and the Government of Bhutan, according to which external affairs, formerly guided by Britain, were to be guided by India. Like Britain, India agreed not to interfere in Bhutan's internal affairs. India also agreed to increase the annual subsidy to 500,000 rupees per year. Important to Bhutan's national pride was the return of Dewangiri. Some historians believe that if India had been at odds with China at this time, as it was to be a decade later, it might not have acceded so easily to Bhutan's request for independent status.\nModernization under King Jigme Dorji, 1952\u201372.\nThe third Druk Gyalpo, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, was enthroned in 1952. Earlier he had married the European-educated cousin of the chogyal (king) of Sikkim and with her support made continual efforts to modernize his nation throughout his twenty-year reign. Among his first reforms was the establishment of the National Assembly \u2014 the Tshogdu \u2014 in 1953. Although the Druk Gyalpo could issue royal decrees and exercise veto power over resolutions passed by the National Assembly, its establishment was a major move toward a constitutional monarchy.\nWhen the Chinese communists took over Tibet in 1951, Bhutan closed its frontier with Tibet and sided with its powerful neighbor to the south. To offset the chance of Chinese encroachment, Bhutan began a modernization program. Land reform was accompanied by the abolition of slavery and serfdom and the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch of government. Mostly funded by India after China's Tibetan uprising in 1959, the modernization program also included the construction of roads linking the Indian plains with central Bhutan. An all-weather road was completed in 1962 between Thimphu and Phuntsholing, the overland gateway town on the southwest border with India. Dzongkha was made the national language during Jigme Dorji's reign. Additionally, development projects included establishing such institutions as a national museum in Paro and a national library, national archives, and national stadium, as well as buildings to house the National Assembly, the High Court (Thrimkhang Gongma), and other government entities in Thimphu. The position of gongzim, held since 1907 by the Dorji family, was upgraded in 1958 to lonchen (prime minister) and was still in the hands of the Dorji. Jigme Dorji Wangchuck's reforms, however, although lessening the authority of the absolute monarchy, also curbed the traditional decentralization of political authority among regional leaders and strengthened the role of the central government in economic and social programs.\nModernization efforts moved forward in the 1960s under the direction of the lonchen, Jigme Palden Dorji, the Druk Gyalpo's brother-in-law. In 1962, however, Dorji incurred disfavor with the Royal Bhutan Army over the use of military vehicles and the forced retirement of some fifty officers. Religious elements also were antagonized by Dorji's efforts to reduce the power of the state-supported religious institutions. In April 1964, while the Druk Gyalpo was in Switzerland for medical care, Dorji was assassinated in Phuntsholing by an army corporal. The majority of those arrested and accused of the crime were military personnel and included the army chief of operations, Namgyal Bahadur, the Druk Gyalpo's uncle, who was executed for his part in the plot.\nThe unstable situation continued under Dorji's successor as acting lonchen, his brother Lhendup Dorji, and for a time under the Druk Gyalpo's brother, Namgyal Wangchuck, as head of the army. According to some sources, a power struggle ensued between pro-Wangchuck loyalists and \"modernist\" Dorji supporters. The main issue was not an end to or lessening of the power of the monarchy but \"full freedom from Indian interference.\" Other observers believe the 1964 crisis was not so much a policy struggle as competition for influence on the palace between the Dorji family and the Druk Gyalpo's Tibetan consort, Yanki, and her father. Lhendup Dorji had earlier threatened to kill Yanki\u2014his sister's rival\u2014and ordered her arrest when, fearing for her life and that of her 2-year-old son by the Druk Gyalpo, she sought refuge in India during the political crisis. Lhendup also incurred the disapproval of the Druk Gyalpo by seeking to become sole regent of the kingdom after his brother's death, eliminating the Queen and the king's brother. Before returning to Bhutan from Switzerland, Jigme Dorji met with the Indian Secretary General and Foreign Secretary in Calcutta who offered Indian support, including paratroopers if necessary, to help the Druk Gyalpo restore order in the kingdom. Unable to regain the Druk Gyalpo's trust, Lhendup fled to London, while other supporters in the military and government fled to Nepal and Calcutta. Afterwards, in concurrence of the National Assembly, Lhendup Dorji and other family members were exiled in 1965. However, the exiles continued their attacks on the Druk Gyalpo and India, worsening relations between India and China. The tense political situation continued and in July 1965 there was an assassination attempt on the Druk Gyalpo. The Dorjis were not implicated in the attempt\u2014which was described as a \"private matter\"\u2014and the would-be assassins were pardoned by the Druk Gyalpo.\nIn 1966, to increase the efficiency of government administration, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck made Thimphu the year-round capital. In May 1968, the comprehensive Rules and Regulations of the National Assembly revised the legal basis of the power granted to the National Assembly. The Druk Gyalpo decreed that henceforth sovereign power, including the power to remove government ministers and the Druk Gyalpo himself, would reside with the National Assembly. The following November, the Druk Gyalpo renounced his veto power over National Assembly bills and said he would step down if two-thirds of the legislature passed a no-confidence vote. Although he did nothing to undermine the retention of the Wangchuck dynasty, the Druk Gyalpo in 1969 called for a triennial vote of confidence by the National Assembly (later abolished by his successor) to renew the Druk Gyalpo's mandate to rule.\nDiplomatic overtures also were made during Jigme Dorji Wangchuck's reign. Although always seeking to be formally neutral and nonaligned in relations with China and India, Bhutan also sought more direct links internationally than had occurred previously under the foreign-policy guidance of India. Consequently, in 1962 Bhutan joined the Colombo Plan for Cooperative, Economic, and Social Development in Asia and the Pacific known as the Colombo Plan, and in 1966 notified India of its desire to become a member of the United Nations (UN). In 1971, after holding observer status for three years, Bhutan was admitted to the UN. In an effort to maintain Bhutan as a stable buffer state, India continued to provide substantial amounts of development aid.\nJigme Dorji Wangchuck ruled until his death in July 1972 and was succeeded by his seventeen-year-old son, Jigme Singye Wangchuck. The close ties of the Wangchuck and Dorji families were reemphasized in the person of the new king, whose mother, Ashi Kesang Dorji (Ashi means Queen), was the sister of the lonchen, Jigme Palden Dorji. Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who had been educated in India and Britain, had been appointed ponlop of Tongsa in May 1972 and by July that year had become the Druk Gyalpo. With his mother and two elder sisters as advisers, the new Druk Gyalpo was thrust into the affairs of state. He was often seen among the people, in the countryside, at festivals, and, as his reign progressed, meeting with foreign dignitaries in Bhutan and abroad. His formal coronation took place in June 1974, and soon thereafter the strains between the Wangchucks and Dorjis were relieved with the return that year of the exiled members of the latter family. The reconciliation, however, was preceded by reports of a plot to assassinate the new Druk Gyalpo before his coronation could take place and to set fire to the Tashichho Dzong (Fortress of the Glorious Religion, the seat of government in Thimphu). Yanki (who had four children with the Druk Gyalpo, including two sons, between 1962 and 1972) was the alleged force behind the plot, which was uncovered three months before the coronation; thirty persons were arrested, including high government and police officials. However, Lawrence Sittling, secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, later reported that the assassination plot was a fabrication by a Chinese diplomat designed to alienate Bhutan from India. But the truth was not any more politically acceptable\u2014those arrested were Tibetan Khampas rebels, trained in India, who were traveling through Bhutan on a mission to Tibet. (Encyclopaedia of Saarc Nations, Syed) Under pressure from China, the Bhutanese government demanded that the four thousand Tibetan refugees living in Bhutan either become Bhutanese citizens or go into exile. Most chose exile. (Syed)\nInternational relations, 1972\u2013present.\nWhen civil war broke out in Pakistan in 1971, Bhutan was the first nation to recognize the new government of Bangladesh, and formal diplomatic relations were established in 1973. An event in 1975 may have served as a major impetus to Bhutan to speed up reform and modernization. In that year, neighboring Sikkim's monarchy, which had endured for more than 300 years, was ousted following a plebiscite in which the Nepalese majority outvoted the Sikkimese minority. Sikkim, long a protectorate of India, became India's twenty-second state.\nTo further ensure its independence and international position, Bhutan gradually established diplomatic relations with other nations and joined greater numbers of regional and international organizations. Many of the countries with which Bhutan established relations provided development aid. Modernization of daily life brought new problems to Bhutan in the late 1980s. Television broadcast was official introduced in Bhutan in 1999.\nAssamese separatists.\nSeveral guerrilla groups seeking to establish an independent Assamese state in northeast India have set up guerrilla bases in the forests of southern Bhutan, from which they launched cross-border attacks on targets in Assam. The largest guerrilla group was the ULFA (United Liberation Front of Asom). Negotiations aimed at removing them peacefully from these bases failed in the spring of 2003. Bhutan was faced with the prospect of having to strengthen its token army force to evict the guerrillas.\nMilitary action against Assamese separatists December 2003.\nOn 15 December 2003 the Royal Bhutan Army began military operations against guerrilla camps in southern Bhutan, in coordination with Indian armed forces who lined the border to the south to prevent the guerrillas from dispersing back into Assam. News sources indicated that of the 30 camps that were targeted, 13 campers were controlled by ULFA, 12 camps by the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), and 5 camps by the Kamatapur Liberation Organisation (KLO). By January, government news reports indicated the guerillas had been routed from their bases.\nRefugee community.\nIn 1988, Bhutan evicted some number of Nepali-speaking residents (Bhutanese reports say about 5,000 and Refugee reports says over 100,000) from districts in southern Bhutan, creating a large refugee community that was now being detained in seven temporary United Nations refugee camps in Nepal and Sikkim. The actual numbers were difficult to establish, as many of those in the camps were reported to be holding forged identity papers, and impoverished Nepalese citizens and started to migrate to the Nepalese community leaving their refugee camps. The reason for leaving refugee camps was to find a job, and services to those living in camps. Few of them returned to the refugee camps. As a result, the number of people living in the camps decreased exponentially. Although the Bhutanese government claimed that only about 5000 initially left the country, the number of actual migration was more than that.\nAfter years of negotiations between Nepal and Bhutan, in 2000 Bhutan agreed in principle to allow certain classes of the refugees to return to Bhutan. However the situation was at a standstill, after violence was committed on Bhutanese officials by the angered people in the camps. Significant unrest was now reported to be fomenting in the camps, especially as the United Nations terminated a number of educational and welfare programmes in an effort to force Bhutan and Nepal to come to terms.\nAs the Bhutanese government was unwilling to take them into their country many developed nations offered the refugees to allow them to settle in their own countries which included USA and Australia. As many as 20,000 Bhutanese refugees have been resettled in these countries.\nFormalized democracy.\nConstitution.\nOn March 26, 2005, \"an auspicious day when the stars and elements converge favourably to create an environment of harmony and success\", the king and government distributed a draft of the country's first constitution, requesting that every citizen review it. A new house of parliament, the National Council, is chartered consisting of 20 elected representatives from each of the dzonghags, persons selected by the King. The National Council would be paired with the other already existing house, the National Assembly.\nPer the Constitution, the monarchy is given a leadership role in setting the direction for the government as long as the King shall demonstrate his commitment and ability to safeguard the interests of the kingdom and its people.\nJigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.\nOn December 15, 2006, the fourth Druk Gyalpo, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, abdicated all of his powers as King to his son, Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, with a specific intention to prepare the young King for the country's transformation to a full-fledged, democratic form of government due to occur in 2008.\nThe previous King's abdication in favor of his son was initially set to occur in 2008 as well. Still, there was an apparent concern that the new King should have hands-on experience as the nation's leader before presiding over a transformation in the country's form of government. According to the national newspaper, the Kuensel, the previous King stated to his cabinet that \"as long as he continued to be King, the Crown Prince would not gain the experience of dealing with issues and carrying out the responsibilities of a head of state. With parliamentary democracy to be established in 2008, there was much to be done; so he needed to gain this valuable experience.\"\nThe fourth Druk Gyalpo further stated that: \"Bhutan could not hope for a better time for such an important transition. Today, the country enjoys peace and stability, ensuring its security and sovereignty. After phenomenal development and progress, the country is closer than ever to the goal of economic self-reliance. Bhutan\u2019s relationship with its closest neighbor and friend, India, has reached new heights. International organizations and bilateral development partners are ready to support Bhutan\u2019s development efforts and political transformation.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was established in November 1940 by the German authorities within the new General Government territory of occupied Poland. At its height, as many as 460,000 Jews were imprisoned there, in an area of , with an average of 9.2 persons per room, barely subsisting on meager food rations. Jews were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to Nazi concentration camps and mass-killing centers. In the summer of 1942, at least 254,000 ghetto residents were sent to the Treblinka extermination camp during under the guise of \"resettlement in the East\" over the course of the summer. The ghetto was demolished by the Germans in May 1943 after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising had temporarily halted the deportations. The total death toll among the prisoners of the ghetto is estimated to be at least 300,000 killed by bullet or gas, combined with 92,000 victims of starvation and related diseases, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and the casualties of the final destruction of the ghetto.\nBackground.\nBefore World War II, the majority of Polish Jews lived in the merchant districts of Muran\u00f3w, Pow\u0105zki, and Stara Praga. Over 90% of Catholics lived further away from the commercial center. The Jewish community was the most prominent there, constituting over 88% of the inhabitants of Muran\u00f3w; with the total of about 32.7% of the population of the left-bank and 14.9% of the right-bank Warsaw, or 332,938 people in total according to 1931 census. Many Jews left the city during the Great Depression. Antisemitic legislation, boycotts of Jewish businesses, and the nationalist \"endecja\" post-Pi\u0142sudski Polish government plans put pressure on Jews in the city. In 1938, the Jewish population of the Polish capital was estimated at 270,000 people.\nThe Siege of Warsaw continued until September 29, 1939. On September 10 alone, the Luftwaffe conducted 17 bombing raids on the city; three days later, 50 German planes attacked the city center, targeting specifically Wola and \u017boliborz. In total, some 30,000 people were killed, and 10 percent of the city was destroyed. Along with the advancing Wehrmacht, the \"Einsatzgruppe\" EG IV and the Einsatzkommandos rolled into town. On November 7, 1939, the \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" reorganized them into local Security Service (SD). The commander of EG IV, Josef Meisinger (the \"Butcher of Warsaw\"), was appointed chief of police for the newly formed Warsaw District.\nEstablishment of the ghetto.\n px;\n top: -px;\"&gt;\n Anachronistic map with borders of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940, with location of \"Umschlagplatz\" for awaiting death trains \nBy the end of the September campaign, the number of Jews in and around the capital increased dramatically with thousands of refugees escaping the Polish-German front. In less than a year, the number of refugees in Warsaw exceeded 90,000. On October 12, 1939, the General Government was established by Adolf Hitler in the occupied area of central Poland. The Nazi-appointed Jewish Council (Judenrat) in Warsaw, a committee of 24 people headed by Adam Czerniak\u00f3w, was responsible for carrying out German orders. On October 26, the Jews were mobilized as forced laborers to clear bomb damage and perform other hard labor. One month later, on November 20, the bank accounts of Polish Jews and any deposits exceeding 2,000 z\u0142 were blocked. On November 23, all Jewish establishments were ordered to display a Jewish star on doors and windows. Beginning December 1, all Jews older than ten were compelled to wear a white armband, and on December 11, they were forbidden from using public transit. On January 26, 1940, the Jews were banned from holding communal prayers due to \"the risk of spreading epidemics.\" Food stamps were introduced by the German authorities, and measures were stepped up to liquidate all Jewish communities in the vicinity of Warsaw. The Jewish population of the capital reached 359,827 before the end of the year.\nOn the orders of Warsaw District Governor, Ludwig Fischer, the ghetto wall construction started on April 1, 1940, circling the area of Warsaw inhabited predominantly by Jews. The work was supervised by the Warsaw Judenrat. The Nazi authorities expelled 113,000 ethnic Poles from the neighbourhood, and ordered the relocation of 138,000 Warsaw Jews from the suburbs into the city center. On October 16, 1940, the creation of the ghetto was announced by the German governor-general, Hans Frank. The initial population of the ghetto was 450,000 confined to an area of . Before the Holocaust began the number of Jews imprisoned there was between 375,000 and 400,000 (about 30% of the general population of the capital). The area of the ghetto constituted only about 2.4% of the overall metropolitan area.\nThe Germans closed the Warsaw Ghetto to the outside world on November 15, 1940. The wall around it was high and topped with barbed wire. Escapees were shot on sight. German policemen from Battalion 61 used to hold victory parties on the days when a large number of prisoners were shot at the ghetto fence. The borders of the ghetto changed and its overall area was gradually reduced, as the captive population was decreased by outbreaks of infectious diseases, mass hunger, and regular executions.\nThe ghetto was divided in two along Ch\u0142odna Street \"Ulica Ch\u0142odna w Warszawie\", which was excluded from it, due to its local importance at that time (as one of Warsaw's east\u2013west thoroughfares). The area south-east of Ch\u0142odna was known as the \"Small Ghetto\", while the area north of it became known as the \"Large Ghetto\". The two zones were connected at an intersection of Ch\u0142odna with \u017belazna Street, where a special gate was built. In January 1942, the gate was removed and a wooden footbridge was built over it, which became one of the postwar symbols of the Holocaust in occupied Poland.\nGhetto administration.\nThe first commissioner of the Warsaw Ghetto, appointed by Fischer, was \"SA-Standartenf\u00fchrer\" Waldemar Sch\u00f6n, who also supervised the initial Jewish relocations in 1940. He was an \"attritionist\" best known for orchestrating an \"artificial famine\" (\"k\u00fcnstliche Hungersnot\") in January 1941. Sch\u00f6n had eliminated virtually all food supplies to the ghetto causing an uproar among the SS upper echelon. He was relieved of his duties by Frank himself in March 1941 and replaced by \"Kommissar\" Heinz Auerswald, a \"productionist\" who served until November 1942. Like in all Nazi ghettos across occupied Poland, the Germans ascribed the internal administration to a Judenrat Council of the Jews, led by an \"\" (the Eldest). In Warsaw, this role was relegated to Adam Czerniak\u00f3w, who chose a policy of collaboration with the Nazis in the hope of saving lives. Adam Czerniak\u00f3w confided his harrowing experience in nine diaries. In July 1942, when the Germans ordered him to increase the contingent of people to be deported, he took his own life.\nCzerniak\u00f3w's collaboration with the German occupation policies was a paradigm for attitude of the majority of European Jews vis \u00e0 vis Nazism. Although his personality as president of the Warsaw Judenrat may not become as infamous as Chaim Rumkowski, \"\u00c4ltester\" of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto; the SS policies he had followed were systematically anti-Jewish.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCzerniakow's first draft of October, 1939; for organizing the Warsaw Judenrat, was just a rehash of conventional kehilla departments: chancellery, welfare, rabbinate, education, cemetery, tax department, accounting, vital statistics... But the Kehilla was an anomalous institution. Throughout its history in czarist Russia, it served also as an instrument of the state, obligated to carry out the regime's policies within the Jewish community, even though these policies were frequently oppressive and specifically anti-Jewish. \u2014 Lucy Dawidowicz, \"The War Against the Jews\" \nThe Council of Elders was supported internally by the Jewish Ghetto Police (\"J\u00fcdischer Ordnungsdienst\"), formed at the end of September 1940 with 3,000 men, instrumental in enforcing law and order as well as carrying out German ad hoc regulations, especially after 1941, when the number of refugees and expellees in Warsaw reached 150,000 or nearly one third of the entire Jewish population of the capital.\nCatholics and Poles in the ghetto.\nIn January 1940, there were 1,540 Catholics and 221 individuals of other Christian faiths imprisoned in the ghetto, including Jewish converts. It is estimated that at the time of closure of the ghetto there were around 2,000 Christians, and number possibly rose eventually to over 5,000. Many of these people considered themselves Polish, but due to Nazi racial criteria they were classified by German authorities as Jewish. Within the ghetto, there were three Christian churches, the All Saints Church, St. Augustine's Church, and the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. All Saints Church served Jewish Christians who were detained in the ghetto. At that time, the parish priest, Marceli Godlewski who before the war was connected to Endecja and anti-Jewish actions, now became involved in helping Jews. At the rectory of the parish, the priest sheltered and helped many escape, including Ludwik Hirszfeld, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof and Wanda Zamenhof-Zaleska. For his actions, he was posthumously awarded the Righteous Among the Nations medal in 2009.\nConditions.\nNazi officials, intent on eradicating the ghetto by hunger and disease, limited food and medical supplies. An average daily food ration in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw was limited to 184 calories, compared to 699 calories allowed for gentile Poles and 2,613 calories for the Germans. In August, the rations fell to 177 calories per person. This meager food supply by the German authorities usually consisted of dry bread, flour and potatoes of the lowest quality, groats, turnips, and a small monthly supplement of margarine, sugar, and meat. As a result, black market economy thrived, supplying as much as 80% of the ghetto's food. In addition, the Joint had opened over 250 soup kitchens, which served at one time as many as 100,000 meals per day.\nMen, women and children all took part in smuggling and illegal trade, and private workshops were created to manufacture goods to be sold secretly on the \"Aryan\" side of the city. Foodstuffs were often smuggled by children alone, who crossed the ghetto wall by the hundreds in any way possible, sometimes several times a day, returning with goods that could weigh as much as they did. Unemployment leading to extreme poverty was a major problem in the ghetto, and smuggling was often the only source of subsistence for the ghetto inhabitants, who would have otherwise died of starvation. \"Professional\" smugglers, in contrast, often became relatively wealthy.\nDuring the first year and a half, thousands of Polish Jews as well as some Romani people from smaller towns and the countryside were brought into the ghetto, but as many died from typhus and starvation the overall number of inhabitants stayed about the same. Facing an out-of-control famine and meager medical supplies, a group of Jewish doctors imprisoned in the ghetto decided to use the opportunity to study the physiological and psychological effects of hunger. The Warsaw Ghetto Hunger Study, as it is now known, remains one of the most thorough investigations of semi-starvation done to date.\nEducation and culture.\nDespite grave hardships, life in the Warsaw Ghetto had educational and cultural activities, both legal and those conducted by its underground organizations. Hospitals, public soup kitchens, orphanages, refugee centers and recreation facilities were formed, as well as a school system. Some schools were illegal and operated under the guise of soup kitchens. There were secret libraries, classes for the children and even a symphony orchestra. Rabbi Alexander Friedman, secretary-general of Agudath Israel of Poland, was one of the Torah leaders in the Warsaw Ghetto; he organized an underground network of religious schools, including \"a Yesodei HaTorah school for boys, a Bais Yaakov school for girls, a school for elementary Jewish instruction, and three institutions for advanced Jewish studies\". These schools, operating under the guise of kindergartens, medical centers and soup kitchens, were a place of refuge for thousands of children and teens, and hundreds of teachers. In 1941, when the Germans gave official permission to the local Judenrat to open schools, these schools came out of hiding and began receiving financial support from the official Jewish community. Former cinema \"Femina\" became a theater in this period. The Jewish Symphonic Orchestra performed in several venues, including \"Femina\".\nIsrael Gutman estimates that around 20,000 prisoners (out of more than 400,000) remained at the top of ghetto society, either because they were wealthy before the war, or because they were able to amass wealth during it (mainly through smuggling). Those families and individuals frequented restaurants, clubs and cafes, showing in stark contrast the economic inequalities of ghetto life. Tilar Mazzeo estimates that group at around 10,000 people\u2014\"rich industrialists, many \"Judenrat\" council leaders, Jewish Ghetto Police officers, profiteering smugglers, nightclub owners [and] high-end prostitutes\" who were spending their time at over sixty cafes and nightclubs, \"dancing among the corpses.\"\nManufacture of German military supplies.\nNot long after the ghetto was closed off from the outside world, a number of German war profiteers such as T\u00f6bbens and Schultz appeared in the capital. At first, they acted as middlemen between the high command and the Jewish-run workshops. By spring 1942, the \"Stickerei Abteilung\" Division with headquarters at Nowolipie 44 Street had already employed 3,000 workers making shoes, leather products, sweaters and socks for the Wehrmacht. Other divisions were making furs and wool sweaters also, guarded by the \"Werkschutz\" police. Some 15,000 Jews were working in the ghetto for Walter C. T\u00f6bbens from Hamburg, a convicted war criminal, including at his factories on Prosta and Leszno Streets among other locations. His Jewish labor exploitation was a source of envy for other ghetto inmates living in fear of deportations. In early 1943, T\u00f6bbens gained for himself the appointment of a Jewish deportation commissar of Warsaw in order to keep his own workforce secure, and maximize profits. In May 1943, T\u00f6bbens transferred his businesses, including 10,000 Jewish slave workers to the Poniatowa concentration camp barracks. Fritz Schultz took his manufacture along with 6,000 Jews to the nearby Trawniki concentration camp.\nTreblinka deportations.\nApproximately 100,000 ghetto inmates had already died of hunger-related diseases and starvation before the mass deportations started in the summer of 1942. Earlier that year, during the Wannsee Conference near Berlin, the Final Solution was set in motion. It was a secretive plan to mass-murder Jewish inhabitants of the General Government. The techniques used to deceive victims were based upon experience gained at the Che\u0142mno extermination camp (\"Kulmhof\"). The ghettoised Jews were rounded up, street by street, under the guise of \"resettlement\", and marched to the \"Umschlagplatz\" holding area. From there, they were sent aboard Holocaust trains to the Treblinka death camp, built in a forest northeast of Warsaw. The operation was headed by the German Resettlement Commissioner, \"SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Hermann H\u00f6fle, on behalf of SS-\"Oberf\u00fchrer\" Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, the acting SS and police leader of the Warsaw District. Upon learning of this plan, Adam Czerniak\u00f3w, leader of the Judenrat Council, killed himself. He was replaced by Marek Lichtenbaum, tasked with managing roundups with the aid of Jewish Ghetto Police. No-one was informed about the real state of affairs.\nThe extermination of Jews by means of poisonous gases was carried out at Treblinka II under the auspices of Operation Reinhard, which also included Be\u0142\u017cec, Majdanek, and Sobib\u00f3r death camps. About 254,000 Warsaw Ghetto inmates (or at least 300,000 by different accounts) were sent to Treblinka during the \"Grossaktion Warschau\", and murdered there between \"Tisha B'Av\" (July 23) and \"Yom Kippur\" (September 21) of 1942. The ratio between Jews killed on the spot by Orpo and Sipo during roundups, and those deported was approximately 2 percent.\nFor eight weeks, the deportations of Jews from Warsaw to Treblinka continued on a daily basis via two shuttle trains: each transport carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water; 100 people to a cattle truck. The first daily trains rolled into the camp early in the morning often after an overnight wait at a layover yard; and the second, in mid-afternoon. Dr Janusz Korczak, a famed educator, went to Treblinka with his orphanage children in August 1942. He was offered a chance to escape by Polish friends and admirers, but he chose instead to share the fate of his life's work. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the \"Sonderkommando\" squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. The stripped victims were suffocated to death in batches of 200 with the use of monoxide gas. In September 1942, new gas chambers were built, which could kill as many as 3,000 people in just 2 hours. Civilians were forbidden to approach the camp area. In the last two weeks of the \"Aktion\" ending on September 21, 1942, some 48,000 Warsaw Jews were deported to their deaths. The last transport with 2,200 victims from the Polish capital included the Jewish Ghetto Police involved with deportations, and their families. In October 1942, the Jewish Combat Organization (\u017bOB) was formed and tasked with opposing further deportations. It was led by 24 year\u2013old Mordechai Anielewicz. Meanwhile, between October 1942 and March 1943, Treblinka received transports of almost 20,000 foreign Jews from the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia via Theresienstadt, and from Bulgarian-occupied Thrace, Macedonia, and Pirot following an agreement with the Nazi-allied Bulgarian government.\nBy the end of 1942, it was clear that the deportations were to their deaths. The underground activity of ghetto resistors in the group \"Oyneg Shabbos\" increased after learning that the transports for \"resettlement\" led to the mass killings. Also in 1942, Polish resistance officer Jan Karski reported to the Western governments on the situation in the ghetto and on the extermination camps. Many of the remaining Jews decided to resist further deportations, and began to smuggle in weapons, ammunition and supplies.\nGhetto Uprising and final destruction of the ghetto.\nOn January 18, 1943, after almost four months without deportations, the Germans suddenly entered the Warsaw Ghetto intent upon further roundups. Within hours, some 600 Jews were shot and 5,000 others removed from their residences. The Germans expected no resistance, but the action was brought to a halt by hundreds of insurgents armed with handguns and Molotov cocktails.\nPreparations to resist had been going on since the previous autumn. The first instance of Jewish armed struggle in Warsaw had begun. The underground fighters from \u017bOB (: Jewish Combat Organization) and \u017bZW (: Jewish Military Union) achieved considerable success initially, taking control of the ghetto. They then barricaded themselves in the bunkers and built dozens of fighting posts, stopping the expulsions. Taking further steps, a number of Jewish collaborators from \u017bagiew were also executed.\nThe final assault started on the eve of Passover of April 19, 1943, when a Nazi force consisting of several thousand troops entered the ghetto. The initial offensive against the ghetto underground launched by Sammern-Frankenegg was met with armed resistance and suffered casualties. He was relieved of command by Heinrich Himmler and replaced by SS-\"Brigadef\u00fchrer\" J\u00fcrgen Stroop. After the initial setback, 2,000 Waffen-SS soldiers under the field command of Stroop systematically burned and blew up the ghetto buildings, block by block, rounding up or murdering anybody they could capture. Significant resistance ended on April 28, and the Nazi operation officially ended in mid-May, symbolically culminating with the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw on May 16. According to the official report, at least 56,065 people were killed on the spot or deported to German Nazi concentration and death camps (Treblinka, Poniatowa, Majdanek and Trawniki). The site of the ghetto became the Warsaw concentration camp.\nPreserving remnants of the Warsaw Ghetto.\nThe ghetto was almost entirely leveled during the Uprising; however, a number of buildings and streets survived, mostly in the \"small ghetto\" area, which had been included into the Aryan part of the city in August 1942 and was not involved in the fighting. In 2008 and 2010, Warsaw Ghetto boundary markers were built along the borders of the former Jewish quarter, where, from 1940 to 1943, stood the gates to the ghetto, wooden footbridges over Aryan streets, and the buildings important to the ghetto inmates. The four buildings at 7, 9, 12, and 14 Pr\u00f3\u017cna Street are among the best known original residential buildings that in 1940\u201341 housed Jewish families in the Warsaw Ghetto. They have largely remained empty since the war. The street is a focus of the annual Warsaw Jewish Festival. In 2011\u20132013, buildings at number 7 and 9 underwent extensive renovations and have become office space.\nThe No\u017cyk Synagogue also survived the war. It was used as a horse stable by the German Wehrmacht. The synagogue has today been restored and is once again used as an active synagogue. The best preserved fragments of the ghetto wall are located 55 Sienna Street, 62 Z\u0142ota Street, and 11 Walic\u00f3w Street (the last two being walls of the pre-war buildings). There are two Warsaw Ghetto Heroes' monuments, unveiled in 1946 and 1948, near the place where the German troops entered the ghetto on 19 April 1943. In 1988, a stone monument was built to mark the Umschlagplatz.\nThere is also a small memorial at ul. Mi\u0142a 18 to commemorate the site of the Socialist \u017bOB underground headquarters during the Ghetto Uprising. In December 2012, a controversial statue of a kneeling and praying Adolf Hitler was installed in a courtyard of the ghetto. The artwork by Italian artist, Maurizio Cattelan, entitled \"HIM\", has received mixed reactions worldwide. Many feel that it is unnecessarily offensive, while others, such as Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, feel that it is thought-provoking, even \"educational\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has had permanent settlement since the Neolithic Age. By the early historical period it was inhabited by Illyrians and Celts. Christianity arrived in the 1st century, and by the 4th century the area became part of the Western Roman Empire. Germanic tribes invaded soon after, followed by Slavs in the 6th century.\nIn 1136, B\u00e9la II of Hungary asserted control over Bosnia and created the title \"Ban of Bosnia\" as an honorary title for his son Ladislaus II of Hungary. During this time, Bosnia became virtually autonomous, and was eventually proclaimed a kingdom in 1377. In 1463, Bosnia was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, marking the beginning of more than 400 years of Ottoman rule in the region. They wrought great changes to the political and administrative system, introduced land reforms, and class and religious distinctions. A series of uprisings began in 1831, which culminated in the Herzegovinian rebellion, a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict eventually forced the Ottomans to cede administration of the country to the Habsburg monarchy through the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.\nThe establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 brought the redrawing of administrative regions into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia which purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, and removed any trace of Bosnian identity. The kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Axis forces in World War II, and Bosnia was ceded to the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which led to widespread persecution and genocide.\nFollowing Axis defeat, Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved its current borders by becoming a federal unit within the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, which was later renamed to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, three years of war began in 1992 which caused around 100,000 deaths and 2 million refugees. It was then when the country became an independent state.\nPrehistory and Roman Era.\nBosnia has been inhabited since Neolithic times. In the late Bronze Age, the Neolithic population was replaced by more warlike Indo-European tribes known as the Illyrians. Celtic migrations in the 4th and 3rd century BCE displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\nChristianity had already arrived in the region by the end of the 2nd century, and numerous artefacts and objects from the time testify to this. Following events from the years 337 and 395 when the Empire split, Dalmatia and Pannonia were included in the Western Roman Empire. The region was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 455, and further exchanged hands between the Alans and Huns in the years to follow.\nMiddle Ages.\nEarly Bosnia.\nBy the 6th century, Emperor Justinian had re-conquered the area and large parts of the former Western Empire for the Eastern Roman Empire with its capital in Constantinople. The Slavs, a migratory people from southeastern Europe, were allied by the Eurasian Avars in the 6th century, and together they invaded the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th and 7th centuries, settling in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding lands. More South Slavs came in a second wave, and according to some scholars were invited by Emperor Heraclius to drive the Avars from Dalmatia on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Around this time the Eastern Romans speaking Latin were evolving into what was called in later centuries as the Byzantine Empire, speaking the Greek (named for the ancient city of Byzantium, now the capital of Constantinople since the 330s, established by Emperor Constantine the Great).\nModern knowledge of Bosnia in the western Balkans during the Dark Ages is patchy. Upon the looter invasions by the Avars and Slavs from 6th-9th century, bringing Slavic languages, both probably gave way to feudalism only with the might by the Frankish penetrating into the region in the late 9th century (Bosnia probably originated as one such pre-feudal entity). It was also around this time that the Bosnians were Christianized. Bosnia, due to its geographic position and terrain, was probably one of the last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast.\nIn addition to the Slavic-speaking population, a good number of romanized people remained in south Bosnia by the year 1000. Speaking an Eastern Romance language (related to Romanian), and having retreated into mountainous areas and adopted a pastoralist way of life, they became known as \"Vlachs\". With time they assimilated, though maintaining specific customs, and the word Vlach came to indicate any shepherd. Being well-versed with horse breeding, Vlachs came to dominate trade and caravan from coastal merchant town towards the interior, growing prosperous and coming to dominate entire regions of Hum, thus merging in Bosnia's medieval feudal society.\nBanate of Bosnia.\nIt is only from the 9th century that Frankish and Byzantine sources begin to mention early Slavic polities in the region. In this regard, the earliest widely acknowledged reference to Bosnia dates from the 10th century \"De Administrando Imperio\" written by Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, during which period Bosnia is part of the Serbian state of \u010caslav, after whose death in battle in about 960, much of Bosnia finds itself briefly incorporated into the Croatian state of Kre\u0161imir II. Shortly thereafter, in 997, Samuel of Bulgaria marches through Bosnia and asserts his over-lordship in parts of it, however, only to be defeated by the Byzantine Empire in 1018 which annexes Bulgaria and asserts its suzerainty in Bosnia. This lasted until later in the century when some parts of Bosnia are briefly incorporated into Croatia and others into Duklja from which the latter Bosnia appears to have seceded in about 1101, upon which Bosnia's bans tried to rule for themselves. However, they all too often found themselves in a tug-of-war between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire. In the year of 1137, Hungary annexes most of Bosnia, then briefly losing her in 1167 to the Byzantine Empire before regaining her in 1180. Thus, prior to 1180 and the reign of Ban Kulin parts of Bosnia were briefly found in Serbian or Croatian units, but neither neighbor had held the Bosnians long enough to acquire their loyalty or to impose any serious claim to Bosnia.\nThe first recorded Ban (viceroy) was Ban Bori\u0107, vassal to the Hungarian king. However, he was deposed when he backed the loser in a succession crisis over the Hungarian throne. In 1167, Byzantium reconquered Bosnia and eventually emplaced their own vassal as Ban \u2013 the native Ban Kulin (r. 1180\u20131204). However, this vassalage was largely nominal, and Bosnia had for all practical purposes made itself into an independent state under Kulin. Ban Kulin presided over nearly three decades of peace and stability during which he strengthened the country's economy through treaties with Dubrovnik and Venice. His rule also marked the start of a controversy with the Bosnian Church, an indigenous Christian sect considered heretical by both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254, which also fostered the schism of the Bosnian Church.\nKingdom of Bosnia.\nBosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by the power struggle between the \u0160ubi\u0107 and Kotromani\u0107 families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when Stjepan II Kotromani\u0107 became ban. By the time of his death in 1353, he had succeeded in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his nephew Tvrtko who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. Under Tvrtko, Bosnia grew in both size and power, finally becoming an independent kingdom in 1377. Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The Ottoman Empire had already started its conquest of Europe and posed a major threat to the Balkans throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, Bosnia officially fell in 1463, while resistance was active and fierce for a few more centuries. Southern regions of Bosnia, nowadays known as \"Herzegovina\" would follow in 1483, with a Hungarian-backed reinstated \"Bosnian Kingdom\" being the last to succumb in 1527.\nOttoman Era (1463\u20131878).\nThe Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced tremendous changes in the political and cultural landscape of the region. Although the kingdom had been crushed and its high nobility executed, the Ottomans nonetheless allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity - a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans. Within this sand\u017eak (and eventual vilayet) of Bosnia, the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.\nThe four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest ethno-religious group (mainly as a result of a gradually rising number of conversions to Islam), while a significant number of Sephardi Jews arrived following their expulsion from Spain in the late 15th century. The Bosnian Christian communities also experienced major changes. The Bosnian Franciscans (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decree, although on the ground these guarantees were often disregarded and their numbers dwindled. The Orthodox community in Bosnia, initially confined to Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia, spread throughout the country during this period and went on to experience relative prosperity until the 19th century. Meanwhile, the native schismatic Bosnian Church disappeared altogether.\nAs the Ottoman Empire thrived and expanded into Central Europe, Bosnia was relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province and experienced a prolonged period of general welfare and prosperity. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and Mostar, were established and grew into major regional centers of trade and urban culture. Within these cities, various Sultans and governors financed the construction of many important works of Bosnian architecture (such as the Stari most and Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque). Furthermore, numerous Bosnians played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and political history during this time. Bosnian soldiers formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of Moh\u00e1cs and Krbava field, two decisive military victories, while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military bureaucracy to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals, generals, and grand viziers. Many Bosnians also made a lasting impression on Ottoman culture, emerging as mystics, scholars, and celebrated poets in the Turkish, Arabic, and Persian languages.\nBy the late 17th century, however, the Ottoman Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the Great Turkish War with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 once again made Bosnia the empire's westernmost province. But they allowed some of the Bosnian tribes to immigrate into the Arabian countries (Palestine, Jordan). The following hundred years were marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague.\nAccording to an Ottoman Muslim account of the Austro-Russian\u2013Turkish War (1735\u201339) translated into English by C. Fraser, Bosnian Muslim women fought in battle since they \"acquired the courage of heroes\" against the Austrian Germans at the siege of Osterwitch-atyk (\u00d6strovi\u00e7-i \u00e2t\u0131k) fortress. Bosnian Muslim women and men were among the casualties during the Battle of Osterwitchatyk. Bosnian Muslim women fought in the defense of the fortress of B\u016bzin (B\u00fczin). Women and men resisted the Austrians at the Chetin (\u00c7etin) Fortress. The women of the Bosnians were deemed to be militaristic according to non-Ottoman records of the war between the Ottomans and Austrians and they played a role in the Bosnian success in battle against the Austrian attackers. Yeni Pazar, Izvornik, \u00d6strovi\u00e7-i \u00e2t\u0131k, \u00c7etin, B\u016bzin, Gradi\u015fka, and Banaluka were struck by the Austrians. A French account described the bravery in battle of Bosnian Muslim women who fought in the war.\nThe Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with great hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms. This, combined with frustrations over political concessions to nascent Christian states in the east, culminated in a famous (albeit ultimately unsuccessful) revolt by Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 in 1831. Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850. A renewed effort at Ottoman reforms occurred in the 1860s under the leadership of the governor Topal \u015eerif Osman occurred, as he founded a provincial printing press in 1866 that published in both Ottoman Turkish and Bosnian. Later, agrarian unrest eventually sparked the Herzegovinian rebellion, a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, which eventually forced the Ottomans to cede administration of the country to Austria-Hungary through the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. While violent revolt prompted many to disparage Ottoman rule, it was in fact Ottoman reforms in the realm of cultural production and education that \"created the conditions for greater intellectual production that continued during the Habsburg era.\"\nOccupation by Austria-Hungary (1878\u20131918).\nThough an Austria-Hungary military force quickly subjugated initial armed resistance upon take-over, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly Herzegovina) and a mass emigration of predominantly Muslim dissidents occurred. However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a \"model colony\". With the aim of establishing the province as a stable political model that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and generally to provide for modernization. The Habsburgs took special care to integrate local Muslims into the fabric of empire, continuing, for example, to publish a provincial yearbook\u2014much like the Ottomans\u2014in Turkish for over a decade after the end of Ottoman rule. Many local officials moreover stayed the same, with the Mehmed-Beg Kapetanovi\u0107 Ljubu\u0161ak, for example, remaining the mayor of Sarajevo under both polities and, moreover, obtaining the very same level of honor from both the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, with a Third Class Order of Mecidiye and an Order of the Iron Crown Third Class, respectively. All of this amounted to what one historian has called an \"almost seamless transition from one empire to another.\"\nAlthough successful economically, Austro-Hungarian policy - which focused on advocating the ideal of a pluralist and multi-confessional Bosnian nation (largely favored by the Muslims) - failed to curb the rising tides of nationalism. The concept of Croat and Serb nationhood had already spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholics and Orthodox communities from neighboring Croatia and Serbia in the mid 19th century, and was too well-entrenched to allow for the widespread acceptance of a parallel idea of Bosnian nationhood. By the latter half of the 1910s, nationalism was an integral factor of Bosnian politics, with national political parties corresponding to the three groups dominating elections.\nThe idea of a unified South Slavic state (typically expected to be spearheaded by independent Serbia) became a popular political ideology in the region at this time, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Austro-Hungarian government's decision to formally annex Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 (the Bosnian Crisis) added to a sense of urgency among these nationalists. The political tensions caused by all this culminated on 28 June 1914, when a Young Bosnia revolutionary named Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo. The event set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I. Although 10% of the Bosnian population died serving in the armies or being killed by the various warring states, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.\nKingdom of Yugoslavia (1918\u20131941).\nFollowing World War I, Bosnia was incorporated into the South Slav kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (soon renamed Yugoslavia). \nPolitical life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over the Agrarian Reform of 1918\u201319 manifested through mass colonization and property confiscation; also formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions. The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major ethnic groups and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere. Although the initial split of the country into 33 oblasts erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as Mehmed Spaho ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.\nThe establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into banates that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity. Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration. The famous Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek agreement that created the Croatian banate in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia. However, outside political circumstances forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention to the rising threat posed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. Following a period that saw attempts at appeasement, the joining of the Tripartite Pact, and a coup d'\u00e9tat, Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.\nWorld War II (1941\u20131945).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Bosnia was the geographical mother of the partisan movement, providing ample space amongst its mountains for training and development.\u2014\u200a\nOnce the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in World War II, all of Bosnia was ceded to the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). The NDH rule over Bosnia led to widespread persecution and genocide. The Jewish population was nearly exterminated. Hundreds of thousands of Serbs died either in Usta\u0161e concentration camps or in widespread mass killings by Usta\u0161e militia. Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the Chetniks, a Serb nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an ethnically homogeneous 'Greater Serbian' state.\nThe Chetniks were responsible for widespread persecution and murder of non-Serbs and communist sympathizers, with the Muslim population of Bosnia, Herzegovina and Sand\u017eak being a primary target. Once captured, Muslim villages were systematically massacred by the Chetniks. The total estimate of Muslims killed by Chetniks is between 80,000 and 100,000, most likely about 86,000 or 6.7 percent of their population (8.1 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina alone). Several Bosnian Muslim paramilitary units joined the NDH forces to counter their own persecution in the hands of the Serbs in Bosnia. On 12 October 1941 a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of Sarajevo signed the Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by Usta\u0161e, made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and the wider Muslim population, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity. According to the US Holocaust Museum, 320,000-340,000 ethnic Serbs were murdered. According to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and Research Center, \"More than 500,000 Serbs were murdered in horribly sadistic ways, 250,000 were expelled, and another 200,000 were forced to convert\" during WWII in the Independent State of Croatia (modern day Croatia and Bosnia).\nStarting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the Partisans, who fought against Axis, Usta\u0161e, and Chetnik forces. They too, committed numerous atrocities, mainly against political opponents of all ethnicities. Some Bosnian Muslims joined the Waffen-SS and the SS \"Handschar\" division, an SS division of the Nazis that pledged allegiance to both Adolf Hitler and NDH leader, Ante Paveli\u0107. The division was the first SS division which was constituted of non-Germans. On 25 November 1943 the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in Jajce where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Ottoman borders. Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans. On 6 April 1945 Sarajevo was captured by the Partisans. The end of the war resulted in the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, with the constitution of 1946 officially making Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.\nSocialist Yugoslavia (1945\u20131992).\nBecause of its central geographic position within the People's Republic for much of the 1950s and 1960s, the 1970s saw the ascension of a strong Bosnian political elite. While working within the communist system, politicians such as D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107, Branko Mikuli\u0107 and Hamdija Pozderac reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic could not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time unscathed.\nIndependence and Bosnian War (1992\u20131995).\nThe first multi-party parliamentary elections held on 18 and 25 November 1990 led to a national assembly dominated by three ethnically based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power. Croatia and Slovenia's subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the Yugoslav federation (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats). A declaration of sovereignty on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from Yugoslavia on 29 February and 1 March 1992. The referendum was boycotted by the great majority of Bosnian Serbs, so with a voter turnout of 64%, 98% of which voted in favor of the proposal. Bosnia and Herzegovina became an independent state on 3 March 1992.\nWhile the first casualty of the war is debated, significant Serbian offensives began in March 1992 in Eastern and Northern Bosnia. Following a tense period of escalating tensions the opening shots in the incipient Bosnian conflict were fired when Serb paramilitary forces attacked Bosniak villages around \u010capljina on 7 March 1992 and around Bosanski Brod and Gora\u017ede on 15 March. These minor attacks were followed by much more serious Serb artillery attacks on Neum on 19 March and on Bosanski Brod on 24 March. The killing of a Bosniak civilian woman on 5 April 1992 by a sniper, while she was demonstrating in Sarajevo against the raising of barricades by Bosnian Serbs, is widely regarded as marking the start of warfare between the three major communities. Open warfare began in Sarajevo on 6 April.\nInternational recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina meant that the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officially withdrew from the republic's territory, although their Bosnian Serb members merely joined the Army of Republika Srpska. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers, Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control. By 1993, when an armed conflict erupted between the Sarajevo government and the Croat statelet of Herzeg-Bosnia, about 70% of the country was controlled by the Serbs.\nIn March 1994, the signing of the Washington accords between the Bosniak and ethnic-Croatian leaders led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This, along with international outrage at Serb war crimes and atrocities (most notably the Srebrenica massacre of as many as 8,000 Bosniak males in July 1995) helped turn the tide of war. The signing of the Dayton Agreement in Paris by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Alija Izetbegovi\u0107), Croatia (Franjo Tu\u0111man), and Yugoslavia (Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. The three years of war and bloodshed had left between 90,000 and 110,000 people killed and more than 2 million displaced.\nPost-war Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995\u2013present).\nSince its 1992 independence and the 1995 Constitutional framework of the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina has followed a path of state-building, while remaining under final international supervision through the figure of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a federation of two Entities - the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, as well as the district of Br\u010dko. Each of the Entities has its own Constitution and extensive legislative powers.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a potential candidate country for accession into the EU; the EU-BiH Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) was signed in 2008 and entered into force in June 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its formal application for EU membership on 15 February 2016; the EU Council conditioned its consideration to further progress on the implementation of the Reform Agenda, as well as to the adaptation of the SAA to take into account the EU accession of Croatia, and to an agreement on a functioning Coordination Mechanism on EU matters. These conditions were fulfilled by the Summer 2016.\nThe accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO is in the negotiation phase, and a Membership Action Plan was signed in April 2010. It requires Bosnia and Herzegovina to define the issue of property over defence assets before NATO may consider the next steps. Bosnian political parties have different attitudes towards NATO: while Bosniak and Bosnian Croat parties support it, Bosnian Serb parties are more cautious and, while not opposing it in principle, require it to be put to a referendum first.\nOn 4 February 2014, the protests against the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the country's two entities, began in the northern town of Tuzla. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions. Soon protests spread to the rest of the Federation, with violent clashes reported in close to 20 towns, the biggest of which were Sarajevo, Zenica, Mostar, Biha\u0107, Br\u010dko and Tuzla. The Bosnian news media reported that hundreds of people had been injured during the protests, including dozens of police officers, with bursts of violence in Sarajevo, in the northern city of Tuzla, in Mostar in the south, and in Zenica in central Bosnia. The same level of unrest or activism did not occur in the Republika Srpska, but hundreds of people also gathered in support of protests in the town of Banja Luka against its separate government.\nThe protests marked the largest outbreak of public anger over high unemployment and two decades of political inertia in the country since the end of the Bosnian War in 1995.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It involves both learning and teaching and is the primary means of maintaining social and cultural continuity over time. It is a lifelong process that shapes the behavior, beliefs, and actions of adults as well as of children.\nSocialization is closely linked to developmental psychology and behaviorism. Humans need social experiences to learn their culture and to survive.\nSocialization may lead to desirable outcomes\u2014sometimes labeled \"moral\"\u2014as regards the society where it occurs. Individual views are influenced by the society's consensus and usually tend toward what that society finds acceptable or \"normal. Socialization provides only a partial explanation for human beliefs and behaviors, maintaining that agents are not blank slates predetermined by their environment; scientific research provides evidence that people are shaped by both social influences and genes.\nGenetic studies have shown that a person's environment interacts with their genotype to influence behavioral outcomes.\nHistory.\nNotions of society and the state of nature have existed for centuries. In its earliest usages, socialization was simply the act of socializing or another word for socialism. Socialization as a concept originated concurrently with sociology, as sociology was defined as the treatment of \"the specifically social, the process and forms of socialization, as such, in contrast to the interests and contents which find expression in socialization\". In particular, socialization consisted of the formation and development of social groups, and also the development of a social state of mind in the individuals who associate. Socialization is thus both a cause and an effect of association. The term was relatively uncommon before 1940, but became popular after World War II, appearing in dictionaries and scholarly works such as the theory of Talcott Parsons.\nStages of moral development.\nLawrence Kohlberg studied moral reasoning and developed a theory of how individuals reason situations as right from wrong. The first stage is the pre-conventional stage, where a person (typically children) experience the world in terms of pain and pleasure, with their moral decisions solely reflecting this experience. Second, the conventional stage (typical for adolescents and adults) is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong, even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Finally, the post-conventional stage (more rarely achieved) occurs if a person moves beyond society's norms to consider abstract ethical principles when making moral decisions.\nStages of psychosocial development.\nErik H. Erikson (1901\u20131993) explained the challenges throughout the life course. The first stage in the life course is infancy, where babies learn trust and mistrust. The second stage is toddlerhood where children around the age of two struggle with the challenge of autonomy versus doubt. In stage three, preschool, children struggle to understand the difference between initiative and guilt. Stage four, pre-adolescence, children learn about industriousness and inferiority. In the fifth stage called adolescence, teenagers experience the challenge of gaining identity versus confusion. The sixth stage, young adulthood, is when young people gain insight into life when dealing with the challenge of intimacy and isolation. In stage seven, or middle adulthood, people experience the challenge of trying to make a difference (versus self-absorption). In the final stage, stage eight or old age, people are still learning about the challenge of integrity and despair.&lt; This concept has been further developed by Klaus Hurrelmann and Gudrun Quenzel using the dynamic model of \"developmental tasks\".\nBehaviorism.\nGeorge Herbert Mead (1862\u20131930) developed a theory of social behaviorism to explain how social experience develops an individual's self-concept. Mead's central concept is the self: It is composed of self-awareness and self-image. Mead claimed that the self is not there at birth, rather, it is developed with social experience. Since social experience is the exchange of symbols, people tend to find meaning in every action. Seeking meaning leads us to imagine the intention of others. Understanding intention requires imagining the situation from the other's point of view. In effect, others are a mirror in which we can see ourselves. Charles Horton Cooley (1902-1983) coined the term looking glass self, which means self-image based on how we think others see us. According to Mead, the key to developing the self is learning to take the role of the other. With limited social experience, infants can only develop a sense of identity through imitation. Gradually children learn to take the roles of several others. The final stage is the generalized other, which refers to widespread cultural norms and values we use as a reference for evaluating others.\nContradictory evidence to behaviorism.\nBehaviorism makes claims that when infants are born they lack social experience or self. The social pre-wiring hypothesis, on the other hand, shows proof through a scientific study that social behavior is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings.\nThe social pre-wiring hypothesis refers to the ontogeny of social interaction. Also informally referred to as, \"wired to be social\". The theory questions whether there is a propensity to socially oriented action already present \"before\" birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique genetic wiring to be social.\nCircumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.\nPrincipal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins was not accidental but specifically aimed.\nThe social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, \"The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' are already performed in the second trimester of gestation. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.\"\nTypes.\nPrimary socialization.\nPrimary socialization occurs when a child learns the attitudes, values, and actions appropriate to individuals as members of a particular culture. Primary socialization for a child is very important because it sets the groundwork for all future socialization. It is mainly influenced by immediate family and friends. For example, if a child's mother expresses a discriminatory opinion about a minority or majority group, then that child may think this behavior is acceptable and could continue to have this opinion about that minority or majority group.\nSecondary socialization.\nSecondary socialization refers to the process of learning what is the appropriate behavior as a member of a smaller group within the larger society. Basically, it involves the behavioral patterns reinforced by socializing agents of society. Secondary socialization takes place outside the home. It is where children and adults learn how to act in a way that is appropriate for the situations they are in. Schools require very different behavior from the home, and children must act according to new rules. New teachers have to act in a way that is different from pupils and learn the new rules from people around them. Secondary socialization is usually associated with teenagers and adults and involves smaller changes than those occurring in primary socialization. Examples of secondary socialization may include entering a new profession or relocating to a new environment or society.\nAnticipatory socialization.\nAnticipatory socialization refers to the processes of socialization in which a person \"rehearses\" for future positions, occupations, and social relationships. For example, a couple might move in together before getting married in order to try out, or anticipate, what living together will be like. Research by Kenneth J. Levine and Cynthia A. Hoffner identifies parents as the main source of anticipatory socialization in regard to jobs and careers.\nResocialization.\nResocialization refers to the process of discarding former behavior-patterns and reflexes while accepting new ones as part of a life transition. This can occur throughout the human life-span. Resocialization can be an intense experience, with individuals experiencing a sharp break with their past, as well as a need to learn and be exposed to radically different norms and values. One common example involves resocialization through a total institution, or \"a setting in which people are isolated from the rest of society and manipulated by an administrative staff\". Resocialization via total institutions involves a two step process: 1) the staff work to root out a new inmate's individual identity; and 2) the staff attempt to create for the inmate a new identity.\nOther examples include the experiences of a young person leaving home to join the military, or of a religious convert internalizing the beliefs and rituals of a new faith. Another example would be the process by which a transgender person learns to function socially in a dramatically altered gender-role.\nOrganizational socialization.\nOrganizational socialization is the process whereby an employee learns the knowledge and skills necessary to assume his or her role in an organization. As newcomers become socialized, they learn about the organization and its history, values, jargon, culture, and procedures. Acquired knowledge about new employees' future work-environment affects the way they are able to apply their skills and abilities to their jobs. How actively engaged the employees are in pursuing knowledge affects their socialization process. New employees also learn about their work group, the specific people they will work with on a daily basis, their own role in the organization, the skills needed to do their job, and both formal procedures and informal norms. Socialization functions as a control system in that newcomers learn to internalize and obey organizational values and practices.\nGroup socialization.\nGroup socialization is the theory that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, become the primary influence on personality and behavior in adulthood. Parental behavior and the home environment has either no effect on the social development of children, or the effect varies significantly between children. Adolescents spend more time with peers than with parents. Therefore, peer groups have stronger correlations with personality development than parental figures do. For example, twin brothers with an identical genetic heritage will differ in personality because they have different groups of friends, not necessarily because their parents raised them differently. Behavioral genetics suggest that up to fifty percent of the variance in adult personality is due to genetic differences. The environment in which a child is raised accounts for only approximately ten percent in the variance of an adult's personality. As much as twenty percent of the variance is due to measurement error. This suggests that only a very small part of an adult's personality is influenced by factors which parents control (i.e. the home environment). Harris grants that while siblings do not have identical experiences in the home environment (making it difficult to associate a definite figure to the variance of personality due to home environments), the variance found by current methods is so low that researchers should look elsewhere to try to account for the remaining variance. Harris also states that developing long-term personality characteristics away from the home environment would be evolutionarily beneficial because future success is more likely to depend on interactions with peers than on interactions with parents and siblings. Also, because of already existing genetic similarities with parents, developing personalities outside of childhood home environments would further diversify individuals, increasing their evolutionary success.\nStages.\nIndividuals and groups change their evaluations of and commitments to each other over time. There is a predictable sequence of stages that occur as an individual transitions through a group: investigation, socialization, maintenance, resocialization, and remembrance. During each stage, the individual and the group evaluate each other, which leads to an increase or decrease in commitment to socialization. This socialization pushes the individual from prospective to new, full, marginal, and ex member.\nStage 1: Investigation\nThis stage is marked by a cautious search for information. The individual compares groups in order to determine which one will fulfill their needs (\"reconnaissance\"), while the group estimates the value of the potential member (\"recruitment\"). The end of this stage is marked by entry to the group, whereby the group asks the individual to join and they accept the offer.\nStage 2: Socialization\nNow that the individual has moved from a prospective member to a new member, the recruit must accept the group's culture. At this stage, the individual accepts the group's norms, values, and perspectives (\"assimilation\"), and the group may adapt to fit the new member's needs (\"accommodation\"). The acceptance transition-point is then reached and the individual becomes a full member. However, this transition can be delayed if the individual or the group reacts negatively. For example, the individual may react cautiously or misinterpret other members' reactions in the belief that they will be treated differently as a newcomer.\nStage 3: Maintenance\nDuring this stage, the individual and the group negotiate what contribution is expected of members (\"role negotiation\"). While many members remain in this stage until the end of their membership, some individuals may become dissatisfied with their role in the group or fail to meet the group's expectations (\"divergence\").\nStage 4: Resocialization\nIf the divergence point is reached, the former full member takes on the role of a marginal member and must be resocialized. There are two possible outcomes of resocialization: the parties resolve their differences and the individual becomes a full member again (\"convergence\"), or the group and the individual part ways via expulsion or voluntary \"exit\".\nStage 5: Remembrance\nIn this stage, former members reminisce about their memories of the group and make sense of their recent departure. If the group reaches a consensus on their reasons for departure, conclusions about the overall experience of the group become part of the group's \"tradition\".\nGender socialization.\nHenslin contends that \"an important part of socialization is the learning of culturally defined gender roles\". Gender socialization refers to the learning of behavior and attitudes considered appropriate for a given sex: boys learn to be boys and girls learn to be girls. This \"learning\" happens by way of many different agents of socialization. The behavior that is seen to be appropriate for each gender is largely determined by societal, cultural, and economic values in a given society. Gender socialization can therefore vary considerably among societies with different values. The family is certainly important in reinforcing gender roles, but so are groups - including friends, peers, school, work, and the mass media. Social groups reinforce gender roles through \"countless subtle and not so subtle ways\". In peer-group activities, stereotypic gender-roles may also be rejected, renegotiated, or artfully exploited for a variety of purposes.\nCarol Gilligan compared the moral development of girls and boys in her theory of gender and moral development. She claimed that boys have a justice perspective - meaning that they rely on formal rules to define right and wrong. Girls, on the other hand, have a care-and-responsibility perspective, where personal relationships are considered when judging a situation. Gilligan also studied the effect of gender on self-esteem. She claimed that society's socialization of females is the reason why girls' self-esteem diminishes as they grow older. Girls struggle to regain their personal strength when moving through adolescence as they have fewer female teachers and most authority figures are men.\nAs parents are present in a child's development from the beginning, their influence in a child's early socialization is very important, especially in regard to gender roles. Sociologists have identified four ways in which parents socialize gender roles in their children: Shaping gender related attributes through toys and activities, differing their interaction with children based on the sex of the child, serving as primary gender models, and communicating gender ideals and expectations.\nSociologist of gender R.W. Connell contends that socialization theory is \"inadequate\" for explaining gender, because it presumes a largely consensual process except for a few \"deviants\", when really most children revolt against pressures to be conventionally gendered; because it cannot explain contradictory \"scripts\" that come from different socialization agents in the same society, and because it does not account for conflict between the different levels of an individual's gender (and general) identity.\nRacial socialization.\nRacial socialization, or racial-ethnic socialization, has been defined as \"the developmental processes by which children acquire the behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group, and come to see themselves and others as members of the group\". The existing literature conceptualizes racial socialization as having multiple dimensions. Researchers have identified five dimensions that commonly appear in the racial socialization literature: cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, egalitarianism, and other. Cultural socialization, sometimes referred to as \"pride development\", refers to parenting practices that teach children about their racial history or heritage.\nPreparation for bias refers to parenting practices focused on preparing children to be aware of, and cope with, discrimination. Promotion of mistrust refers to the parenting practices of socializing children to be wary of people from other races. Egalitarianism refers to socializing children with the belief that all people are equal and should be treated with common humanity. In the United States, white people are socialized to perceive race as a zero-sum game and a black-white binary.\nOppression socialization.\nOppression socialization refers to the process by which \"individuals develop understandings of power and political structure, particularly as these inform perceptions of identity, power, and opportunity relative to gender, racialized group membership, and sexuality\". This action is a form of political socialization in its relation to power and the persistent compliance of the disadvantaged with their oppression using limited \"overt coercion\".\nLanguage socialization.\nBased on comparative research in different societies, and focusing on the role of language in child development, linguistic anthropologists Elinor Ochs and Bambi Schieffelin have developed the theory of language socialization.\nThey discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition, but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Members of all societies socialize children both \"to\" and \"through\" the use of language; acquiring competence in a language, the novice is by the same token socialized into the categories and norms of the culture, while the culture, in turn, provides the norms of the use of language.\nOversocialization.\nOversocialization refers to the excess internalization of societal expectations, norms, and values such that a person loses their individuality. Oversocialization operates at both the conscious and unconscious levels, shaping individuals' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in ways that maintain the status quo. Oversocialization can lead to alienation, disempowerment, and a lack of personal autonomy.\nThe term was coined by Dennis Wrong in 1961.\nPlanned socialization.\nPlanned socialization occurs when other people take actions designed to teach or train others. This type of socialization can take on many forms and can occur at any point from infancy onward.\nNatural socialization.\nNatural socialization occurs when infants and youngsters explore, play and discover the social world around them. Natural socialization is easily seen when looking at the young of almost any mammalian species (and some birds).\nOn the other hand, planned socialization is mostly a human phenomenon; all through history, people have made plans for teaching or training others. Both natural and planned socialization can have good and bad qualities: it is useful to learn the best features of both natural and planned socialization in order to incorporate them into life in a meaningful way.\nDigital socialization.\nDigital socialization refers to the process through which individuals acquire cultural norms, values, and behaviors via digital interactions. Unlike traditional socialization, which primarily occurs through face-to-face interaction, digital socialization takes place in online environments such as social media platforms, virtual communities, and other digital communication channels.\nBeneficial aspects.\nThe italian sociologist Antonio Casilli has examined how digital socialization complements rather than replaces offline interactions. He argues that digital environments create a \"hybrid sociability\" where online and offline interactions are interconnected. This perspective challenges the assumption that digital communication isolates individuals, instead emphasizing the ways in which people use digital tools to maintain and expand their social networks. He has highlighted how social capital is built and maintained through digital platforms, as individuals engage in online communities that provide both bonding and bridging connections. Digital interactions have also been described as a form of \"reciprocal grooming,\" where sharing content, commenting, and reacting to posts serve as mechanisms for maintaining social ties.\nThe impact of social media on socialization has also been widely studied, with findings suggesting that digital platforms influence identity formation, belonging, and community participation. The ability to curate digital identities allows individuals to shape their online presence, affecting how they are perceived by others. Digital socialization extends beyond personal relationships to include political engagement, professional networking, and knowledge exchange. As digital interactions become more embedded in daily life, they contribute to the reshaping of social norms and collective behaviors.\nMoreover, relationship between digital and offline sociability within a cultural community in a mid-sized French city has been examined, showing that social media, particularly Facebook, does not radically transform social structures but rather reinforces preexisting social divisions. Online interactions, while broadening access to social networks, tend to mirror and consolidate the boundaries already present in offline spaces. \nChallenging aspects.\nDespite its benefits, digital socialization presents certain challenges. Algorithmic curation plays a central role in shaping digital socialization, offering personalized content but also introducing notable challenges. The rise of algorithm-driven content has been associated with the creation of \"filter bubbles\" where individuals are exposed primarily to information that reinforces their existing beliefs. However, some scholars argue that similar mechanisms exist outside the digital sphere, as individuals in physical social environments also tend to surround themselves with like-minded people, reinforcing their existing perspectives. Social structures such as residential segregation, workplace affiliations, and educational institutions contribute to the formation of ideological and cultural bubbles that limit exposure to diverse viewpoints. This phenomenon raises concerns about ideological polarization and the potential narrowing of perspectives. Additionally, cyberbullying and online harassment have been identified as negative consequences of digital interaction, with some studies linking these experiences to psychological distress and social exclusion. Privacy concerns also play a significant role in discussions about digital socialization, as the collection and use of personal data in digital environments raise ethical questions about surveillance, data security, and the commercialization of social interactions.\nOthers have examined the impact of digital technologies on contemporary sociability from a different lens, showing how online platforms redefine social interactions and shape the construction of social ties. While digital tools facilitate communication and strengthen certain social connections, they also reinforce existing social boundaries. Digital sociability is shaped by preexisting social structures, as online interactions often mirror offline inequalities rather than eliminating them. Factors such as socioeconomic status, education, and cultural capital influence individuals' digital socialization experiences. Furthermore, different digital spaces contribute to varying forms of social interaction, from reinforcing close-knit communities to facilitating weak-tie networks that provide access to new information and opportunities.\nPolitical socialization.\nSocialization produces the economic, social, and political development of any particular country. The nature of the compromise between nature and nurture also determines whether society is good or harmful. Political socialization is described as \"the long developmental process by which an infant (even an adult) citizen learns, imbibes and ultimately internalizes the political culture (core political values, beliefs, norms and ideology) of his political system in order to make him a more informed and effective political participant.\"\nA society's political culture is inculcated in its citizens and passed down from one generation to the next as part of the political socialization process. Agents of socialization are thus people, organizations, or institutions that have an impact on how people perceive themselves, behave, or have other orientations. In contemporary democratic government, political parties are the main forces behind political socialization.\nDeveloping nations can transfer agricultural technology and machinery like tractors, harvesters, and agrochemicals to enhance the agricultural sector of the economy through socialization.\nPositive socialization.\nPositive socialization is the type of social learning that is based on pleasurable and exciting experiences. Individual humans tend to like the people who fill their social learning processes with positive motivation, loving care, and rewarding opportunities. Positive socialization occurs when desired behaviors are reinforced with a reward, encouraging the individual to continue exhibiting similar behaviors in the future.\nNegative socialization.\nNegative socialization occurs when socialialization agents use punishment, harsh criticisms, or anger to try to \"teach us a lesson\"; and often we come to dislike both negative socialization and the people who impose it on us. There are all types of mixes of positive and negative socialization, and the more positive social learning experiences we have, the happier we tend to be\u2014especially if we are able to learn useful information that helps us cope well with the challenges of life. A high ratio of negative to positive socialization can make a person unhappy, leading to defeated or pessimistic feelings about life.\nBullying can examplify negative socialization.\nInstitutions.\nIn the social sciences, institutions are the structures and mechanisms of social order and cooperation governing the behavior of individuals within a given human collectivity. Institutions are identified with a social purpose and permanence, transcending individual human lives and intentions, and with the making and enforcing of rules governing cooperative human behavior.\nProductive processing of reality.\nFrom the late 1980s, sociological and psychological theories have been connected with the term socialization. One example of this connection is the theory of Klaus Hurrelmann. In his book \"Social Structure and Personality Development\",&lt;ref name= \"Hurrelmann 1989/2009\"&gt;Hurrelmann, Klaus (1989, reissued 2009). \"Social Structure and Personality Development\". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; he develops the model of \"productive processing of reality\". The core idea is that socialization refers to an individual's personality development. It is the result of the productive processing of interior and exterior realities. Bodily and mental qualities and traits constitute a person's inner reality; the circumstances of the social and physical environment embody the external reality. Reality processing is productive because human beings actively grapple with their lives and attempt to cope with the attendant developmental tasks. The success of such a process depends on the personal and social resources available. Incorporated within all developmental tasks is the necessity to reconcile personal individuation and social integration and so secure the \"I-dentity\". The process of productive processing of reality is an enduring process throughout the life course.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The law was not consistently enforced, however, and a thriving gay culture existed in major German cities. After the Nazi takeover in 1933, the first homosexual movement's infrastructure of clubs, organizations, and publications was shut down. After the R\u00f6hm purge in 1934, persecuting homosexuals became a priority of the Nazi police state. A 1935 revision of Paragraph 175 made it easier to bring criminal charges for homosexual acts, leading to a large increase in arrests and convictions. Persecution peaked in the years prior to World War\u00a0II and was extended to areas annexed by Germany, including Austria, the Czech lands, and Alsace\u2013Lorraine.\nThe Nazi regime considered the elimination of all manifestations of homosexuality in Germany one of its goals, claiming it was a Jewish conspiracy to undermine the German people. Men were often arrested after denunciation, police raids, and through information uncovered during interrogations of other homosexuals. Those arrested were presumed guilty, and subjected to harsh interrogation and torture to elicit a confession. Between 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals; around 50,000 of these were sentenced by civilian courts, 6,400 to 7,000 by military courts, and an unknown number by special courts. Most of these men served time in regular prisons, and between 5,000 and 6,000 were imprisoned in concentration camps. The death rate of these prisoners has been estimated at 60 percent, a higher rate than those of other prisoner groups. A smaller number of men were sentenced to death or killed at Nazi euthanasia centres. Nazi Germany's persecution of homosexuals is considered to be the most severe episode in a long history of discrimination and violence targeting sexual minorities.\nAfter the war, homosexuals were initially not counted as victims of Nazism because homosexuality continued to be illegal in Nazi Germany's successor states. Few victims came forward to discuss their experiences. The persecution came to wider public attention during the gay liberation movement of the 1970s, and the pink triangle was reappropriated as an LGBT symbol.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nGermany was the home of the first homosexual movement. The word \"homosexual\" was coined by German-language writer Karl Maria Kertbeny; the first periodicals intended for a gay, lesbian, and transgender readership were published in Germany, and the world's first homosexual rights organization was founded in Berlin in 1897. In the 1920s gay culture flourished in Germany's major cities, especially Berlin. Political compromises allowed many homosexuals to live freely in their private lives and in dedicated subcultural spaces, provided they did not significantly infringe on the public sphere. One theory holds the Nazis' rise to power was fueled by a conservative backlash against perceived immorality, but according to historian Laurie Marhoefer, this was not a significant factor.\nParagraph 175 of the German penal code, which was passed after the unification of Germany in 1871, criminalized sexual acts between males. The German supreme court ruled that a conviction required proof the men had had penetrative sex, typically anal but sometimes oral sex; other sexual activities were not punishable. The limited the enforcement of the law because men were not arrested or indicted without concrete evidence. As a consequence, conviction rates were low and a significant number of those convicted were sentenced to pay a fine rather than serve a jail sentence. Terms exceeding one year were rare.\nIn 1928, the Nazi Party responded negatively to a questionnaire about their view of Paragraph 175, saying: \"Anyone who even thinks of homosexual love is our enemy.\" Nazi politicians regularly railed against homosexuality, claiming that it was a Jewish conspiracy to undermine the German people. In 1931 and 1932, the Social Democrats publicized the homosexuality of Ernst R\u00f6hm, a prominent Nazi politician, in an attempt to discredit the Nazis. The R\u00f6hm scandal fuelled the long-lasting but false idea that the Nazi Party was dominated by homosexuals, a recurring theme in 1930s left-wing propaganda. The Nazi Party temporarily tolerated a few known homosexuals, including R\u00f6hm, but never adopted such tolerance as a general principle or changed its views on homosexuality. There is no evidence that homosexuals were over-represented in the Nazi Party.\nHistory.\nNazi takeover and initial crackdown (1933).\nIn mid-1932 a crackdown on homosexual subcultures in Prussia began after Chancellor Franz von Papen deposed the Prussian government. Some homosexual bars and clubs in Berlin had to shut down after police raids. In January 1933 the Nazi Party took power; immediately, their real and perceived enemies were the subject of a violent crackdown. On 23 February of that year the Prussian Ministry of the Interior ordered Berlin police to shut down any remaining establishments catering to \"persons who indulge in unnatural sexual practices\". This order was extended to other parts of Germany. In Cologne, almost all gay bars were forced to close. In Hanover all had closed by the end of the year. In Hamburg police targeted both prostitutes and homosexual spaces, including the main train station, public toilets, and gay bars, leading to a more-than-sixfold increase in indictments under Paragraph 175 by 1934. The anti-homosexual crackdown was intended to please the Nazis' conservative backers, who had put them into power, as well as socially conservative voters. Both the Vatican and Protestant churches praised the crackdown. For example, in October 1933 Clemens August Graf von Galen, the Bishop of M\u00fcnster, wrote approvingly of the Nazis' efforts to \"eradicate\" the \"open propaganda for godlessness and immorality\".\nIn March 1933 the Nazi authorities began to confiscate printed material on homosexual topics. Any LGBT-related magazines that had survived earlier censorship were closed down and copies were burned. Their publishers were targeted; Adolf Brand's house was raided five times and police stole all of his photographs, 6,000 magazine issues, and many books. Friedrich Radszuweit's company was subjected to similar raids. During the Nazi takeover, German\u2013Jewish homosexual-rights campaigner Magnus Hirschfeld was abroad on a lecture tour for the World League for Sexual Reform. On 6 May the Nazis' paramilitary wing, the SA, raided his Institute for Sex Research in coordination with German students. The institute's library of more than 12,000 books was publicly burned on 10 May on the Opernplatz; and its offices, together with those of The World League for Sexual Reform, were destroyed.\nOn 8 June the law-reform organization Scientific-Humanitarian Committee voted to dissolve itself. In 1933, many homosexual organizations attempted to destroy membership lists and other information the Nazis could use to target dissidents. Former activists made agreements to keep quiet to protect others. Some homosexuals, including Thomas and Klaus Mann, went into exile. The Swiss city of Basel in particular was a destination for homosexuals fleeing Nazi Germany. Other homosexuals of a more right-wing inclination, including Hans Bl\u00fcher, who initially welcomed the Nazi takeover, remained in Germany. Some joined the SA, mistakenly believing that R\u00f6hm would protect them.\nThe most-visible members of the LGBT community, including prostitutes, transvestites, and activist leaders, were targeted, and high-profile locations were shut down. The average homosexual's daily life, however, did not change, and some gay bars in Hamburg and smaller cities remained open. Some men were able to adapt to the closures by meeting with gay friends in primarily heterosexual establishments. Most homosexuals were not yet afraid of the Gestapo. They believed they could keep a low profile until the end of the Nazi regime, seen as coming soon. During the initial years of Nazi rule, the number of men sentenced to prison under Paragraph 175 increased, from 464 in 1932 to 575 in 1933 and 635 in 1934. There was no systematic persecution of individual homosexual behavior, and until 1935, convictions remained below the high of 1,107 convictions set in 1925.\nR\u00f6hm purge and expanding persecution (1934\u20131935).\nAfter the 1933 revolution, Hitler began to see R\u00f6hm as a threat to his power and the SA as a liability due to their random acts of violence, which detracted from the Nazis' desired image as the party of law and order. On 30 June 1934 R\u00f6hm and several other SA leaders were suddenly arrested and executed. This event was later justified in Nazi propaganda, mainly through accusations of corruption and scheming with foreign powers, but also citing R\u00f6hm's homosexuality and the fact one of the victims of the purge, Edmund Heines, had allegedly been arrested while in bed with another man. Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, leaders of the SS (a rival of R\u00f6hm's SA), supported the purge to assert their control over the Nazi police state. Eventually Himmler, who is described by historian Nikolaus Wachsmann as \"one of the most obsessive homophobes\" in the Nazi government, became commander of the SS, the Gestapo, and the concentration camp system, making him the second-most-powerful man in Nazi Germany. The purge ended the sense of safety many German homosexuals still felt. Some homosexual Nazis ceased participating in the party while others, themselves former perpetrators of violence against Nazi opponents, became victims.\nAnti-gay repression began immediately after the purge, initially focusing on alleged homosexual cliques in the party and state bureaucracy. In October 1934 Heydrich ordered the police of all large cities to make a list of homosexuals. A separate Gestapo department, the Special Commission for Homosexuality in Berlin, was set up. In late 1934 the Gestapo targeted Berlin and Munich, raiding gay bars and making mass arrests of homosexual men; most of those arrested were not involved in politics. Many men accused of homosexuality would admit to acts that were not punishable under Paragraph 175, expecting to be released; instead, they were mistreated and incarcerated in Columbia-Haus, Lichtenburg, or Dachau concentration camp. By early 1935, 80 percent of the prisoners held in protective custody in the concentration camps were there for alleged homosexuality. To convict these men, it was decided to change the criminal code.\nAlmost exactly a year after R\u00f6hm was killed, Paragraph 175 was amended in line with changes demanded in particular by prosecutors and other legal professionals. The new version of the law punished all homosexual acts, defined broadly; \"objectively when a general sense of shame is harmed and subjectively when there exists the lustful intention to excite either of the two men or a third party\". In theory, it became a crime to look at another man with desire. Men were convicted for mutual masturbation or simply embracing each other, and in a few cases when no physical contact had occurred. Under the new law, typically all participants were viewed as equally guilty, whereas under the previous law, the \"active\" and \"passive\" participants were differentiated. The new law made it much easier to arrest and convict homosexual men, leading to a large increase in convictions. Under a new section 175a, the law also introduced harsher penalties for male prostitution, sex with a man younger than 21, or sex with a student or employee. The change in the law was not publicized for fear of spreading knowledge of homosexuality. Most Germans were unaware the law had changed and many of those arrested under the new law had no knowledge they were committing a crime. The law was also applied retroactively.\nPeak of persecution (1936\u20131939).\nFrom 1936 to 1939, German police focused on homosexuality as a top priority. In 1936 the Special Commission for Homosexuality in Berlin became the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion, working with Gestapo Special Bureau II S. The new office organized conferences and issued directives to increase the effectiveness of anti-homosexual persecution. During the first years of Nazi rule, regional differences in the prosecution of homosexuals reflected pre-Nazi trends in policing but in 1936, the police launched a nationwide campaign against homosexual meeting places. This campaign was less effective in rural than urban areas, which saw a greater number of prosecutions. If the Gestapo believed there were not enough charges for homosexuality being brought in a certain area, they would send in a special unit to train and encourage local criminal police. In March 1937, Himmler ordered police departments to make lists of suspected homosexuals and oblige them to register changes of address, and to monitor suspected homosexual meeting places, hotels, and personal ads in newspapers.\nPolice and courts were not given any additional personnel or resources for the anti-homosexuality campaign, which caused serious operational difficulties. Besides the significant increase in the number of criminal cases to be prosecuted, cases of homosexuality demanded more time and attention because of the difficulty of proving private conduct. To identify homosexuals, some police departments resorted to calling in entire classes of teenage boys and asking them about their sexual experiences. In this manner, it was possible to increase the number of charges of homosexuality brought; by 1939, youthful experiences such as these made up 23.9 percent of total charges. Himmler approved of these methods, arguing that otherwise homosexuality would spread unchecked in all-male Nazi institutions.\nBetween 1937 and 1939 nearly 95,000 men were arrested for homosexuality\u00a0\u2013 more than 600 per week\u00a0\u2013 representing a major investment from the Nazi police state. From 1936 to 1939, nearly 30,000 men were convicted under Paragraph 175. Unlike in the past, these men were virtually guaranteed to receive a jail sentence, and the length of sentences increased; many men were sentenced to years in jail. Prosecutors, judges, and others involved in these cases increasingly cited Nazi ideology to justify harsh punishment, adopting the regime's rhetoric of \"stamping out the plague of homosexuality\". The use of concentration camp imprisonment increased; after 1937, those considered to have seduced others into homosexuality were confined to concentration camps.\nWorld War II.\nFrom 1939 to 1940, the number of men sentenced in civil courts under Paragraph 175 fell from 7,614 to 3,773. More men were subject to military jurisdiction and, with the onset of war, homosexuality was no longer the top priority of the security police. In anticipation of the outbreak of war, at the end of August 1939, Heydrich ordered the Gestapo to transfer most homosexual cases to the \"Kriminalpolizei\" (criminal police or \"Kripo\") to free up resources for the persecution of opposition groups. It is unknown how many Paragraph 175 cases were handled by the special courts.\nAn estimated 6,400 to 7,000 men were convicted by the military courts in Nazi Germany under Paragraph 175. The military considered homosexuals to be predators who disrupted morale and unit cohesion. Prior to the war, homosexuals were offered re-education and if this failed, they could be dismissed and incarcerated in a concentration camp for the duration of their compulsory military service. Under the manpower requirements of war, it was felt necessary to recruit all available men; it was also a concern that rejecting homosexuals from military service could open a loophole for draft evaders. Men considered sex offenders, including homosexuals, rapists, and child molesters, could serve in the German military assuming they were willing to bear arms and remain celibate during their military service. Known homosexuals and some former concentration camp prisoners were conscripted. Even castrated homosexual men could be drafted.\nMilitary courts were generally more lenient than civilian courts with cases involving consensual sex but harsher in cases falling under 175a. Although military courts followed the 1935 version of Paragraph 175, they generally issued a conviction only when there was attempted or actual contact with another man's genitals. More than 90 percent of those convicted were reintegrated into the military. Although innate homosexuals were considered dangerous to the military, the German military assumed that most cases of homosexuality were situational. Younger men, often seen as the victims of homosexual seducers, and one-time offenders were shown leniency. On average, soldiers convicted of homosexuality were sentenced to one-year prison sentences but served only a fraction of this before being paroled to the front. The length of time served decreased because of the increasing manpower shortage. In 1943 Himmler, who believed that the military was not hard enough on homosexuality, demanded a classification system that would see \"incorrigible\" homosexual offenders sent to concentration camps. The military attempted to ensure as many men as possible were retained under military jurisdiction to preserve vital manpower but cooperated with the Gestapo to rid itself of a few men who were seen as a threat to the military. Beginning in 1944 some homosexual concentration camp prisoners were forcibly enlisted in the army, which continued until a week before the unconditional surrender of Germany. These men were typically recruited into penal battalions, especially the Dirlewanger Brigade.\nAnnexed territories.\nThe persecution of homosexuals was extended to the annexed territories but not to the rest of German-occupied Europe; the Nazis were mostly uninterested in punishing homosexuals who were not considered ethnically German. Criminal prosecutions of men for homosexuality in Austria almost doubled under Nazi rule. Both regular and special courts applied draconian punishments, including the death penalty. German law was applied in the Sudetenland after its annexation in late 1938 and, in the case of homosexuals, applied retroactively. German law was imposed in Alsace\u2013Lorraine in January 1942; homosexuals there soon faced a harsh legal crackdown, including retroactive application of the law.\nIn the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, German law applied to ethnic Germans and the old Austrian criminal code, which imposed lower penalties for male homosexuality, applied to non-Germans. Czech men were not deported to concentration camps solely because of conviction for homosexuality, but sometimes they were deported in combination with other reasons, such as anti-Nazi activity. Although prosecutions increased dramatically during the German occupation, the police focused their efforts on breaking up male prostitution rings rather than homosexual relationships between Czechs. In 1945 Edvard Bene\u0161, president of Czechoslovakia, offered an amnesty to those convicted for homosexuality during the occupation, although the law remained in effect.\nNazi views of homosexuality.\nThe Nazis were influenced by earlier ideas conflating homosexuality, child molestation, and the \"seduction of youth\". Before the Nazis' rise to power, there was a widespread belief among Germans that homosexuality is not inborn but instead could be acquired and spread. The Nazis were particularly concerned that their all-male organizations such as the Hitler Youth, SS, and SA must not be seen as hotbeds of homosexual \"recruitment\". Based on the theories of Karl Bonhoeffer and Emil Kraepelin, the Nazis believed homosexuals seduced young men and infected them with homosexuality, permanently changing their sexual orientation. Rhetoric described homosexuality as a contagious disease but not in the medical sense. Rather, homosexuality was a disease of the (national body), a metaphor for the desired national or racial community ().\nThe Nazis, especially Himmler, held conspiratorial beliefs about homosexuals, believing they were more loyal to each other than to the Nazi Party and Germany. After the R\u00f6hm purge, he told Gestapo personnel they had narrowly avoided the capture of the state by homosexuals. In 1937 a headline in the SS magazine \"Das Schwarze Korps\" declared homosexuals \"enemies of the state\", explaining they must be eradicated because \"...they form a state within a state, a secret organization that runs counter to the interests of the people.\" The newspaper argued only two percent of those who engaged in homosexual acts were committed homosexuals and the rest could be turned away from homosexuality. Forty thousand homosexuals were considered capable of \"poisoning\" two million men if left to roam free. Homosexual men were also considered to be shirking their duty to repopulate the German nation after World War\u00a0I and create sons who could be drafted into the military to fight Hitler's planned wars of aggression. On 18 February 1937 Himmler gave a speech about homosexuality in Bad T\u00f6lz that was based on the 1927 book \"Eroticism and Race\" by Herwig Hartner, which claimed homosexuality was a Jewish plot against Germany. According to Himmler, homosexuality could lead to the end of Germany and cause depopulation by reducing the number of men who were available for reproduction.\nThe Nazis distinguished between congenital homosexuals who would require permanent imprisonment and others who had engaged in homosexuality but were thought to be curable with a short stay in a concentration camp or psychiatric treatment. Distinguishing between these categories was a difficulty that preoccupied the Nazis, especially after many cases of homosexuality surfaced in the supposedly racially pure SS. Succumbing to a homosexual act once, especially when drunk, was not necessarily considered evidence of homosexual inclination. The G\u00f6ring Institute offered treatment to homosexuals referred by the Hitler Youth and other Nazi organizations; by 1938 it claimed to have changed the sexual orientation in 341 of 510 patients and by 1944, it claimed to have eliminated homosexuality in more than 500 men. The institute intervened to reduce sentences in some cases. The converse of the Nazis' persecution of homosexuality was their encouragement of heterosexual relations, including extramarital sex, for racially desirable people.\nAfter 1934, homophobia became a regular theme in Nazi propaganda; most Germans came into contact with this homophobic propaganda. Although one of the Nazi regime's goals was to eliminate all manifestations of homosexuality in Germany, there was never a Nazi policy of exterminating all homosexuals in the way the Final Solution targeted Jews.\nMethods.\nIdentification and arrest.\nHomosexuals were more difficult to round up than other groups the Nazis targeted. Police were given detailed instructions on spotting homosexuals; they were instructed to look for flamboyant men, those who avoided women or were seen walking arm-in-arm with other men, and anyone who rented a double room at a hotel. Hairdressers, bathhouse attendants, hotel receptionists, railway station porters, and others were asked to report suspicious behavior. Complicating the Nazis' efforts, many homosexual men did not fit these stereotypes and many effeminate men were not homosexual.\nAccording to one estimate, denunciations resulted in 35 percent of arrests of homosexuals. Men were denounced by neighbors, relatives, coworkers, students, employees, or even ex-boyfriends seeking to settle grievances, passers-by who overheard suspicious conversation, and Hitler Youth and other Nazi supporters who voluntarily acted as the morality police. State employees working in youth welfare and rail stations, Nazi functionaries in the German Labor Front (DAF), the SA, the SS, and the Hitler Youth brought cases to the attention of the authorities. A disproportionate number of denunciations concerned child abuse or \"youth seduction\" because there was an injured party to complain. Some men were falsely denounced as homosexual by other Germans. The snowball method involved arresting one man, interrogating him, and searching his belongings to find additional suspects; this method accounted for thirty percent of arrests. Some men were observed before their arrests or temporarily released in hopes they would lead the police to additional suspects. Some were shown photograph albums of other suspected homosexuals; male prostitutes were often willing to identify other homosexuals this way. Another ten percent of victims were arrested in police raids, which were often conducted in parks, public toilets, and areas frequented by male prostitutes. In Hamburg the police watched restaurants that served a mixed heterosexual and homosexual clientele as well as the most-trafficked public toilets. Entrapment was also used to ensnare homosexuals.\nCharges of homosexuality were sometimes deployed against people who were not guilty. Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels commented: \"When Himmler wants to get rid of someone, he just throws \u00a7175 at him.\" About 250 Catholic clergy were charged with same-sex activity in the mid-1930s. Many of the charges, which included sexual abuse of minors and consensual homosexual sex, were true, but others were probably invented. The trials were of limited efficacy in their intended purpose of discrediting the Catholic Church. Catholic authorities alternated between reprimanding the guilty and covering up the scandal.\nRegional and class-based targeting.\nActive policing tactics were mainly limited to the larger cities; in rural areas, the police relied on denunciation. The difference in policing strategy, and likely over-representation and greater visibility of homosexuals in urban areas, led to vastly different conviction rates in different parts of Germany. Convictions in Bavaria and Mecklenburg were below the national average while in Rhine Province, Hamburg, and Berlin, they exceeded the average. Within states, urban areas had more cases than rural areas. Because of the reliance on denunciation in rural areas, a disproportionate number of cases involved child abuse or \"youth seduction\".\nYoung and working-class men, who may have been less able to evade the authorities, were over-represented among those who were arrested and prosecuted. Half of the suspects were working-class men and another third came from the lower middle class. In Austria, where working-class homosexuals were traditional targets of criminalization, arrests were extended to the middle class but more egregious behavior was required for a higher-class man to be punished for homosexuality. The first homosexuals to be targeted by the Nazis, prior to the R\u00f6hm purge, were also Jewish and left-wing political activists. A considerable number of those persecuted for homosexuality were also targeted for other reasons, for example being Romani, disabled, a sex worker, accused of other criminal offenses, a political opponent of the Nazis, or a deserter.\nInterrogation and trial.\nAfter arresting a man, he was presumed to be guilty, especially if there was a history of homosexual acts or a previous conviction. Police would tell his family the reason for his arrest. With a conviction, the victim could expect a complete life breakdown, often including loss of home and job, expulsion from professional organizations, and revocation of awards and doctorates. Harsh interrogations were aimed at forcing the victim to confess to the acts the police believed him guilty of. Austere cells in temporary detention facilities were sufficient to obtain confessions in some cases. Other suspects would crumple in the face of \"screams, curses, threats, and endless questions\", and some were beaten. Some men were held for weeks with nothing to do but await interrogation, and suffered mental breakdowns. Some men were sent to concentration camps under protective custody either to encourage them to confess, or to incarcerate them when there was not enough evidence to obtain a conviction. The police would tell suspects they would get a lighter punishment if they confessed, and indefinite detention in a concentration camp if they did not.\nBoth the Gestapo and the Kripo targeted homosexuals, a rivalry that may have encouraged the latter to adopt the more-brutal tactics of the former. Torture was regularly used to extract confessions and the use of \"enhanced interrogation\" () was explicitly approved of by Josef Meisinger, head of the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion. After 1936, cases were processed more quickly and the accused rarely had a legal defense. Most had already confessed, guaranteeing a guilty verdict. An unknown number of men who were found unfit to stand trial were confined to psychiatric hospitals.\nPrisons.\nMost men who were persecuted for homosexuality were convicted in the civil legal system and imprisoned. In Germany, it had long been the practice to isolate homosexual prisoners in individual cells but because of the vast increase in arrests, this proved to be impractical. In addition, the economic exploitation of prisoner labor meant many prisoners were held in labor camps and housed in barracks. While some officials built tiny, one-man cells to keep homosexual prisoners isolated, other officials distributed homosexuals among the general prison population and encouraged \"brutal homophobia\" to isolate homosexuals. Homosexual prisoners did not have to wear a badge but could be identified by red underlining on their name tags.\nBefore 1933 prison sex had been common but its prevention and punishment became much more important under Nazi rule. Any prisoner who tried to initiate a same-sex relationship, even if it did not result in any physical contact, could expect harsh punishment. The wardens relied on informers among the inmates to deter same-sex activity. Despite facing discrimination, however, homosexual prisoners were much better off in the prisons than in concentration camps.\nCastration.\nIn June 1935 the Sterilization Law was amended to allow individual convicted criminals to be \"voluntarily\" sterilized to eliminate their \"degenerate sex drive\". During the Nazi era, the regime considered extending the policy of involuntary castration that was previously applied to child molesters and other sex offenders to homosexuals but such a law was never passed. In 1943 Gestapo chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner advocated for a law for involuntary castration of homosexuals and sex offenders but withdrew this request because he believed the Gestapo could ensure castrations were carried out where it desired. Although the fiction of voluntary castration was maintained, some homosexuals were subject to severe pressure and coercion\u2014including the threat of imprisonment in a concentration camp\u2014to agree to castration. An estimated 400 to 800 men and boys\u2014some as young as 16 years\u2014were castrated in this manner.\nConcentration camps.\nUnlike the legal punishment system, prisoners in concentration camps were held in indefinite detention at the mercy of the SS and Gestapo. The use of concentration camp detention for homosexuals began in 1934 and 1935; it was initially seen as a temporary re-education measure. In May 1935, the Prussian police detained 513 accused homosexuals in protective custody. Himmler did not consider a time-limited prison sentence was sufficient to eliminate homosexuality. After 1939, it was a policy to send men who were convicted of multiple homosexual acts to a concentration camp after they served their prison sentences. On 12 July 1940 the Reich Security Main Office formalized this policy, decreeing \"in future, all homosexuals who seduced more than one partner shall be taken into preventive custody by the police after their release from prison\". According to research in some parts of Germany, non-aggravated homosexuality, as a rule, was not punished with concentration camp imprisonment, which was mostly reserved for those who were considered \"youth seducers\", or had been convicted of male prostitution or child molestation. In other cases, men who were convicted with homosexuality combined with other criminal offenses or political opposition could be transferred to a concentration camp.\nHistorian Clayton J. Whisnant states homosexual concentration camp prisoners \"experienced some of the worst conditions that humans have ever been forced to endure\". In the prewar camps, Jewish and homosexual prisoners ranked at the bottom of the prisoner hierarchy, and homosexual Jews fared the worst. Along with Jews, homosexuals were often assigned to segregated labor details and had to perform especially dirty and backbreaking work, and endured worse conditions than the rest of the camp. Homosexual prisoners rarely benefited from solidarity from other prisoners, even Jews, because of widespread homophobia. Surviving the camps often required either building social networks with other prisoners or being promoted to a position of authority. Homosexuals were disadvantaged in both of these aspects; some younger, more attractive men could obtain advantages from a sexual relationship with a \"kapo\" (prison functionary) or SS guard. After 1942, conditions improved because of the need for forced labor, and some homosexual prisoners were promoted because of the influx of non-German prisoners who were ineligible for \"kapo\" positions.\nAbout 5,000 to 6,000 homosexual men were imprisoned in the concentration camps. Sociologist R\u00fcdiger Lautmann examined 2,542 known cases of homosexual concentration camp prisoners and determined their death rate was 60 percent, compared with 42 percent of political prisoners and 35 percent of Jehovah's Witnesses. Assuming a death rate of between 53 and 60 percent, at least 3,100 to 3,600 men died in the camps. SS guards murdered homosexual prisoners out of cruelty or during sadistic games, disguising the deaths as natural causes. At camps like Mauthausen and Flossenb\u00fcrg, it was standard practice to work homosexual prisoners to death. In mid-1942 almost all the homosexual prisoners at Sachsenhausen (at least two hundred) were executed. Many homosexual prisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck died at the same time. The chances of survival depended on which camp the men were incarcerated in; Neuengamme was considered less harsh for homosexual prisoners than Buchenwald, Dachau, or Sachsenhausen.\nInitially, homosexuals were differentiated from other prisoners with a badge bearing capital letter \"A\" that was used at Lichtenberg. The standardized Nazi concentration camp badges that included a pink triangle for homosexual prisoners were adopted in 1938. \nHomosexual prisoners were a preferred target of Nazi human experimentation during the last years of Nazi rule. The best-known experiments involving homosexual men were attempts by endocrinologist Carl Vaernet to change prisoners' sexual orientations by implanting a pellet that released testosterone. Homosexual and Jewish prisoners were also given experimental treatments for typhus at Buchenwald, for phosphorus burns at Sachsenhausen, and were used for testing opiates and Pervitin.\nDeath penalty.\nIn a 1937 speech Himmler argued SS men who had served sentences for homosexuality should be transferred to a concentration camp and \"shot while trying to escape\". This policy was never implemented, although a few death sentences against SS men for homosexual acts were pronounced between 1937 and 1940. In a speech on 18 August 1941 Hitler argued homosexuality in the Hitler Youth should be punished by death. After learning of Hitler's remark, Himmler drafted a decree mandating the death penalty to any member of the SS or police who was found guilty of engaging in a homosexual act. Hitler, who was worried the decree might encourage left-wing propaganda that homosexuality was especially prevalent in Germany, signed the decree on 15 November 1941 on the condition there was no publicity. After the decree, only a few death sentences were pronounced. Himmler often commuted the sentence, especially if he thought the accused was not a committed homosexual. Many of those whose sentences were commuted were sent to serve in the Dirlewanger Brigade, where most were killed. After late 1943, because of military losses, it was policy to send SS men who were convicted of homosexuality into the army.\nThe 1933 law on habitual criminals allowed for execution after the third conviction. On 4 September 1941 a new law allowed the execution of dangerous sex offenders and habitual criminals when \"the protection of the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" or the need for just atonement require it\". This law enabled authorities to pronounce death sentences against homosexuals and is known to have been employed in four cases in Austria. In 1943 Wilhelm Keitel authorized the death penalty for German soldiers who were convicted of homosexuality in \"particularly serious cases\". Only a few such executions are known to have occurred, mostly in conjunction with other charges\u00a0\u2013 especially desertion. Some homosexuals were executed at Nazi euthanasia centers such as Bernburg and Meseritz-Obrawalde. It is difficult to estimate the number of homosexual men who were directly killed during the Nazi era.\nContinued existence.\nHistorian Alexander Zinn estimates about one quarter of German homosexual men were investigated during the Nazi era, and that up to one tenth of those were imprisoned. According to Zinn, this rate is evidence of indifference among the general German population towards homosexuality; denunciation of consensual homosexual relations was less common. Zinn said that while all homosexuals in Nazi Germany suffered from the indirect effects of criminalization, their lives cannot be reduced to fear of arrest, and they retained a limited degree of personal freedom. Even before 1933, many homosexual men married women, and the Nazis' rise to power provided an added incentive, although such marriages were usually unhappy. Homosexual desires did not go away; some men sought homosexual contact outside of marriage, risking denunciation by an unhappy wife. Some men organized lavender marriages with lesbians they had known before 1933. Although nearly all homosexuals tried to avoid the attention of the authorities, men continued to find sexual partners at Kreuzberg bathhouses and M\u00fcnzstrasse movie theaters, and by cruising in places such as Alexanderplatz and the Friedrichstrasse in Berlin. Many suffered from disrupted relationships, loneliness, or loss of self-esteem. A significant number of homosexual and bisexual men, including 25 percent of those persecuted in Hamburg, committed suicide.\nAccording to historian Manfred Herzer, homosexual men and women who avoided persecution \"belonged to the willing subjects and beneficiaries of the Nazi state just like other German men and women\". The likelihood of being persecuted was lower for those who suppressed their sex lives or served the higher goals of Nazism. Some German homosexuals joined the Nazi Party or fought for Germany during World WarII. War and armed service provided an opportunity for sexual encounters with other men, both civilians and members of the armed services. There were also opportunities for sexual assault of other soldiers, subordinates, people from occupied countries, and prisoners. Both might be practiced by men who did not identify as homosexual. During the last years of the war, there were increased opportunities for sexual encounters in bombed-out cities.\nIn October 1937, Himmler ordered that actors and artists should only be detained for homosexual acts with his authorization, unless they were caught in the act.\nAftermath.\nNazi Germany's persecution of homosexuals is considered to be the most-severe episode in a longer history of discrimination and violence against homosexuals; never before or since have so many homosexuals been sentenced to prison in such a short period, even disregarding concentration camp imprisonment. An estimated 100,000 men were arrested and of these, half spent time in prison. Post-war attitudes towards homosexuality were influenced by Nazi propaganda associating homosexuality with criminality and medical illness. Because the various Allied countries considered homosexuality a crime, those prisoners who had not finished serving their sentence under Paragraph 175 had to do so, but those who had never been convicted or who had already served the full time were released. Arrest and incarceration of men for consensual homosexual acts continued to be commonplace in West Germany and Austria through the 1960s; between 1945 and 1969, West Germany convicted about 50,000 men; the same number of men as the Nazis had convicted during their twelve-year rule.\nThe 1935 version of Paragraph 175\u00a0\u2013 one of the few Nazi-era laws that remained in force and unaltered in West Germany\u00a0\u2013 was upheld by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1957. In 1962 historian Hans-Joachim Schoeps commented; \"For the homosexuals the Third Reich has not yet ended.\" Although not entirely accurate, this statement captured the view of many West German homosexuals prior to the partial decriminalization in 1969. In East Germany, homosexuality was rarely prosecuted after 1957 and was decriminalized in 1968; the number of convictions there was much lower. Decriminalization did not result in widespread social acceptance, and Paragraph 175 was not repealed until 1994.\nRecognition as victims of National Socialism.\nHomosexual concentration camp prisoners were not recognized as victims of National Socialism. Just as there was a hierarchy among prisoners in the concentration camps, there was a hierarchy among survivors. Reparations and state pensions available to other groups were refused to gay men, who were still classified as criminals. Political prisoners and persecuted Jews could be disqualified from victim status if they were discovered to be homosexual. In the 1950s Rudolf Klimmer unsuccessfully petitioned the East German government to recognize homosexuals as victims of Nazism and offer them compensation in line with that for other victims. In West Germany in the 1970s activists made similar demands, but these were rejected.\nIn 1985 the Nazi persecution of homosexuals was officially recognized for the first time in a speech by West German president Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker. In 2002, Germany annulled the Nazi-era judgements under Paragraph 175, and in 2017, victims were offered compensation. The 2017 annulment of judgements and compensation extended to men who were convicted after 1945, making this the only case in which the German state offered reparations for acts not considered \"typical Nazi injustice\" that would not be possible in a democratic state.\nLegacy.\nBefore 1970, there were hardly any references to the persecution of homosexuals. This changed in the aftermath of the Stonewall riots and the partial decriminalization of homosexuality in Germany that triggered the era of gay liberation. The memory of the Nazi persecution of homosexuals came to the attention of the LGBT community in the 1970s as large-scale LGBT rights movements developed. The awareness of homosexuals as a separate category of Nazi victims began in the United States and was later adopted by German homosexual activists. The term \"Homocaust\" came into use shortly after \"Holocaust\"; activists claimed there had been 250,000 deaths but historical research soon refuted this number. Martin Sherman's 1979 play \"Bent\" brought additional attention of the Nazi persecution of homosexuals in English-speaking countries. The pink triangle became one of the most-prominent symbols of gay liberation in the United States. Activists use the symbol to connect Nazi persecution to present-day discrimination and violence against LGBT people, and to mobilize opposition against it.\nThe practice of laying memorial wreaths in concentration camps in memory of homosexual victims began in the 1970s. Permanent memorials were added to several concentration camps, including Mauthausen (1984), Sachsenhausen (1992), Dachau (1995), and Buchenwald (2002). This memorialization encountered strong resistance from established survivor associations. Memorials have also been constructed in several German cities, such as Frankfurt (1994), Cologne (1995), Berlin (2008), and L\u00fcbeck (2016). Memorials to Nazi persecution of homosexuals have also been constructed in Amsterdam, Bologna, Turin, Barcelona, San Francisco, New York, Montevideo, Sydney, and Tel Aviv. Hundreds of \"Stolpersteine\" have been installed to commemorate individual victims of the Nazis' anti-homosexual persecution. In the United States there was less emphasis on memorialization and more explicit comparisons between the Jewish Holocaust and persecution of homosexuals. German gay activists tended to see a close parallel to the Nazi persecution of communists and socialists.\nSources attesting to the Nazi persecution of homosexuals are scarce. Most homosexuals, especially those who avoided arrest, never spoke about their experiences. The Nazis destroyed a great number of records, including the archive of the Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion. Remaining sources are mainly in the form of police and court records. In 1972 concentration camp survivor Josef Kohout published his memoir, \"The Men With the Pink Triangle\", which is one of few accounts from a pink-triangle prisoner. The first historical research appeared at the end of the 1970s.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChapters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournal articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to FishBase, 35,800 species of fish had been described as of March 2025.\nHistory.\nThe study of fish dates from the Upper Paleolithic Revolution (with the advent of \"high culture\"). The science of ichthyology was developed in several interconnecting epochs, each with various significant advancements.\nThe study of fish receives its origins from the human desire to feed, clothe, and equip themselves with useful implements. According to Michael Barton, a prominent ichthyologist and professor at Centre College, \"the earliest ichthyologists were hunters and gatherers who had learned how to obtain the most useful fish, where to obtain them in abundance, and at what times they might be the most available\". Early cultures expressed these insights through abstract yet recognizable forms of artistic expression.\n1500 BC\u201340 AD.\nInformal, scientific descriptions of fish are represented within the Judeo-Christian tradition. The Old Testament laws of kashrut forbade the consumption of fish without scales or appendages. Theologians and ichthyologists believe that the apostle Peter and his contemporaries harvested the fish that are today sold in modern industry along the Sea of Galilee, presently known as Lake Kinneret. These fish include cyprinids of the genera \"Barbus\" and \"Mirogrex\", cichlids of the genus \"Sarotherodon\", and \"Mugil cephalus\" of the family Mugilidae.\n335 BC\u201380 AD.\nAristotle incorporated ichthyology into formal scientific study. Between 333 and 322 BC, he provided the earliest taxonomic classification of fish, accurately describing 117 species of Mediterranean fish. Furthermore, Aristotle documented anatomical and behavioral differences between fish and marine mammals. After his death, some of his pupils continued his ichthyological research. Theophrastus, for example, composed a treatise on amphibious fish. The Romans, although less devoted to science, wrote extensively about fish. Pliny the Elder, a notable Roman naturalist, compiled the ichthyological works of indigenous Greeks, including verifiable and ambiguous peculiarities such as the sawfish and mermaid, respectively. Pliny's documentation was the last significant contribution to ichthyology until the European Renaissance.\nEuropean Renaissance.\nThe writings of three 16th-century scholars, Hippolito Salviani, Pierre Belon, and Guillaume Rondelet, signify the conception of modern ichthyology. The investigations of these individuals were based upon actual research in comparison to ancient recitations. This property popularized and emphasized these discoveries. Despite their prominence, Rondelet's \"De Piscibus Marinis\" is regarded as the most influential, identifying 244 species of fish.\n16th\u201317th century.\nThe incremental alterations in navigation and shipbuilding throughout the Renaissance marked the commencement of a new epoch in ichthyology. The Renaissance culminated with the era of exploration and colonization, and upon the cosmopolitan interest in navigation came the specialization in naturalism. Georg Marcgrave of Saxony composed the \"Naturalis Brasilae\" in 1648. This document contained a description of 100 species of fish indigenous to the Brazilian coastline. In 1686, John Ray and Francis Willughby collaboratively published \"Historia Piscium\", a scientific manuscript containing 420 species of fish, 178 of these newly discovered. The fish contained within this informative literature were arranged in a provisional system of classification.\nThe classification used within the \"Historia Piscium\" was further developed by Carl Linnaeus, the \"father of modern taxonomy\". His taxonomic approach became the systematic approach to the study of organisms, including fish. Linnaeus was a professor at the University of Uppsala and an eminent botanist; however, one of his colleagues, Peter Artedi, earned the title \"father of ichthyology\" through his indispensable advancements. Artedi contributed to Linnaeus's refinement of the principles of taxonomy. Furthermore, he recognized five additional orders of fish: Malacopterygii, Acanthopterygii, Branchiostegi, Chondropterygii, and Plagiuri. Artedi developed standard methods for making counts and measurements of anatomical features that are modernly exploited. Another associate of Linnaeus, Albertus Seba, was a prosperous pharmacist from Amsterdam. Seba assembled a cabinet, or collection, of fish. He invited Artedi to use this assortment of fish; in 1735, Artedi fell into an Amsterdam canal and drowned at the age of 30.\nLinnaeus posthumously published Artedi's manuscripts as \"Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus\" (1738). His refinement of taxonomy culminated in the development of the binomial nomenclature, which is in use by contemporary ichthyologists. Furthermore, he revised the orders introduced by Artedi, placing significance on pelvic fins. Fish lacking this appendage were placed within the order Apodes; fish having abdominal, thoracic, or jugular pelvic fins were termed Abdominales, Thoracici, and Jugulares, respectively. However, these alterations were not grounded within evolutionary theory. Therefore, over a century was needed for Charles Darwin to provide the intellectual foundation needed to perceive that the degree of similarity in taxonomic features was a consequence of phylogenetic relationships.\nModern era.\nClose to the dawn of the 19th century, Marcus Elieser Bloch of Berlin and Georges Cuvier of Paris made attempts to consolidate the knowledge of ichthyology. Cuvier summarized all of the available information in his monumental \"Histoire Naturelle des Poissons\". This manuscript was published between 1828 and 1849 in a 22-volume series. This document describes 4,514 species of fish, 2,311 of these new to science. It remains one of the most ambitious treatises of the modern world. Scientific exploration of the Americas advanced knowledge of the remarkable diversity of fish. Charles Alexandre Lesueur was a student of Cuvier. He made a cabinet of fish dwelling within the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River regions.\nAdventurous individuals such as John James Audubon and Constantine Samuel Rafinesque figure in the faunal documentation of North America. They often traveled with one another. Rafinesque wrote \"Ichthyologic Ohiensis\" in 1820. In addition, Louis Agassiz of Switzerland established his reputation through the study of freshwater fish and the first comprehensive treatment of palaeoichthyology, \"Poisson Fossil's\". In the 1840s, Agassiz moved to the United States, where he taught at Harvard University until his death in 1873.\nAlbert G\u00fcnther published his \"Catalogue of the Fish of the British Museum\" between 1859 and 1870, describing over 6,800 species and mentioning another 1,700. Generally considered one of the most influential ichthyologists, David Starr Jordan wrote 650 articles and books on the subject and served as president of Indiana University and Stanford University.\nNotable ichthyologists.\nMembers of this list meet one or more of the following criteria: 1) Author of 50 or more fish taxon names, 2) Author of major ichtyological reference work, 3) Founder of major journal or museum, 4) Person most notable for other reasons who has also worked in ichthyology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike block voting or limited voting, where voters can cast multiple votes, under SNTV each voter casts just one.\nSNTV retains many of the problems of first-past-the-post voting (first-preference plurality voting), and as a result is sometimes viewed skeptically by social choice theorists. However, its relative simplicity and easy vote-counting makes the system particularly popular for small elections to offices such as city councils, particularly when compared to the more-intricate single transferable vote (STV) system, and has resulted in the method becoming commonly used for ordering open party lists.\nVoting.\nIn any election, each voter casts one vote for one candidate in a multi-candidate race for multiple offices. Posts are filled by the candidates with more votes than the others (plurality voting). Thus, in a three-seat constituency, the three candidates receiving the largest numbers of votes would win office.\nSNTV, like single transferable vote, can be used with non-partisan ballots, in election contests where there are no parties.\nExample.\nThree seats are to be filled among five candidates: A, B, C, D and E fielded by 3 parties X, Y and Z.\nE, D and C are the winning candidates. Thus, Party Z gets two seats and Party Y gets one seat. No one party took all the seats as might have been the result under first past the post or plurality block voting.\nBut counting the votes by party gives these vote tallies:\nParty Y has more votes than Party Z, but receives fewer seats because of an inefficient spread of votes across the candidates. If Party Y's two candidates had had more equal vote tallies, it would have won two seats and Party Z only one. Or if Party Z's candidates had received less equal vote tallies, Party Y would have won two seats even if its candidates were not equally popular. (There is more chance in SNTV than a more orderly system of PR, such as list PR or STV.)\nIf either party had risked trying to win all three seats, causing more vote splitting among supporters of Parties Y and Z, then A of Party X might have won a seat and either party Y or Z would then have taken one fewer seat.\nGiven formula_1 candidates to be elected, Candidate A can guarantee success by receiving one more than formula_2 of the votes (the Droop quota), because formula_1+1 other candidates cannot each receive more than Candidate A (too many would not pass Droop quota)\nTo determine the successful candidates, candidates' vote tallies are compared with the vote tallies of others, not with a theoretical threshold or quota. In the 2020 Vanuatuan general election, using SNTV, as few as 5 percent of the vote was enough to be elected in a seven-seat district, where about 13 percent is Droop quota.\nSNTV Compared to Block Voting (multiple non-transferable voting) and Limited Voting.\nFor example, 10,000 voters vote to elect three members. Cumulative voting is not used so each voter may not cast more than one vote for a single candidate.\nParty A has about 35% support among the electorate (with one particularly well-liked candidate), Party B around 25% (with two well-liked candidates) and the remaining voters primarily support independent candidates, but mostly lean towards party B if they have to choose between the two parties. All voters vote sincerely; there is no strategic voting.\nPercent of votes under MNTV and Limited Voting is the percent of voters who voted for the candidate, not the percent of votes cast.\nNon-proportionality.\nSNTV increases political fragmentation and representation of small parties compared to first-past-the-post voting, that is, it produces mixed representation of large and small parties where no party takes all the seats. But not having transfers, SNTV sees more votes wasted than under STV due to votes being placed on un-electable candidate or due to surpluses received by successful candidate over and above the quota used in STV elections that are not able to be transferred under SNTV. In 2007 Scottish local authority elections, only 73 out of 1222 members were not in winning position in the first round, so only 73 owed their wins to vote transfers. (But that is not to say that first past the post or block voting would have produced the same winners. In each district, under SNTV multiple parties elected representatives, not the likely result under those two non-proportional systems.)\nRepresentation elected under SNTV is more proportional when political parties have accurate information about their relative levels of electoral support, and nominate candidates in accordance with their respective levels of electoral support or when all parties suffer from poor information of that sort. Knowing the share of the votes a party will take allows it to avoid vote waste due to lessening the chance of vote splitting and inefficient placement of party support. Under 'perfect' strategic voting and strategic nomination, SNTV would be equivalent to the D'Hondt (Jefferson) method of proportional representation.\nThe number of wasted votes in an SNTV election is generally lower than in first past the post elections.\nSNTV generally does not achieve equal seats-to-votes ratios, because it is difficult to accurately judge their strength when deciding how many candidates to field (strategic nomination) and difficult to direct party supporters as a whole to spread their votes efficiently. If they field too many, supporters' votes might be split across too many candidates. The party votes might spread their vote numbers to the point where all of a party's candidates lose to a less thinly spread opposing party. If a party fields too few candidates, they might elect all their candidates but not win seats proportional to their level of support, and the winning candidates would have more support than necessary and thus wasting votes.\nThe risks of poor strategic nomination are not equal for parties of various strengths. A large party would have much more to lose from the split vote effect than to gain from avoiding the wasted vote effect, and so would likely decide to err on the side of fielding fewer candidates (but probably not less than their existing number of seats). A small party with little representation would be more risk-tolerant and err on the side of too many candidates, hoping to gain as many seats as possible, perhaps even winning more than its proportion of the electorate if they can edge out candidates from larger parties with just a few votes. As well, a small party running just one candidate would not suffer from vote spitting, while a larger party running four or more may suffer from that.\nSNTV electoral systems typically produce more proportional electoral outcomes as the size of the electoral districts (number of seats in each constituency) increases.\nStrategic voting.\nStrategic voting in a single non-transferable vote system is frequent. Casting only one vote, a rational voter wanting to maximize the number of seats captured by his party should vote for a candidate of the party that has a chance of winning, but one that will not win by too great a margin and thus take votes away from party colleagues. This creates opportunities for strategic nominations, with parties nominating candidates similar to their opponents' candidates in order to split the vote. Like all multiple-winner selections, parties find it advantageous to run a range of candidates in SNTV elections.\nSNTV has been measured through the lens of such concepts as \"decision-theoretic analysis\". Professor Gary W. Cox, an expert on SNTV, has studied this system's use in Japan. Cox has an explanation of real-world data finding the, \"two systems [plurality and semi-proportional] are alike in their strategic voting equilibria.\" His research found that voters use the information offered in campaigns (polls, reporting, fundraising totals, endorsements, etc.), to rationally decide who the most viable candidates are and then vote for them.\nSNTV can result in complicated intra-party dynamics because in a SNTV system, a candidate runs against candidates from their own party as well as against candidates from the other party. SNTV elections are not zero-sum contests. Just because one particular candidate is elected does not mean that another specific candidate will not be. They both can be elected.\nBecause running on issues may lead to a situation in which a candidate becomes too popular and therefore draws votes away from other allied candidates, SNTV may encourage legislators to join factions that consist of patron-client relationships in which a powerful legislator can apportion votes to his or her supporters.\nIn addition, parties will do best if their supporters evenly distribute their votes among the party's candidates. Historically, in Taiwan, the Kuomintang did this by sending members a letter telling them which candidate to vote for. With the Democratic Progressive Party, vote sharing is done informally, as members of a family or small group will coordinate their votes. The New Party had a surprisingly effective system by asking party supporters to vote for the candidate whose identification number corresponded to their birthdate. This led to a system of vote allocation which had been adopted by all parties for the 2004 ROC legislative elections.\nHistory.\nSingle Non-transferable Voting was first proposed in solid form by Saint-Just in 1793, in a proposal to the French National Convention. He proposed having the whole country as one multi-seat district; but the idea was not adopted in France at that time.\nJapan was the first country to adopt SNTV for election of government members a hundred years later than Saint-Just's proposal. In 1880s Japan adopted SNTV for provincial politicians and in 1900 for national politicians.\nUsage.\nSNTV is used for elections in Puerto Rico, Kuwait, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Libya, Iraq, Hong Kong and Vanuatu.\nPuerto Rico.\nIn Puerto Rico, SNTV is known as \"at-large representation\" (\"representaci\u00f3n por acumulaci\u00f3n\" in Spanish), SNTV is used to elect the 11 at-large members in each of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Under \"at-large representation\", political parties vary the ballot order of their candidates across electoral divisions, in order to ensure each candidate has a roughly equal chance of success. Since most voters choose the candidates placed at the top of their party lists on their ballots, at-large candidates from the same party usually obtain approximately equal vote totals. When the party's candidates are equally supported, the most-popular party is often able to take six seats of the 11.\nThe two major Puerto Rican political parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the New Progressive Party, usually each run six candidates for the 11 at-large members in each of the House of Representatives and the Senate, while the much smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party runs a single-candidate slate for the at-large members in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The SNTV-elected members are a small part of the chambers compared to the members elected in the sixteen Senate districts, elected by block voting, and the forty House districts, elected by first-past-the-post voting.\nJapan, South Korea and Taiwan.\nSNTV was once used to elect the legislatures of Japan, South Korea and the Republic of China (Taiwan), but its use has been discontinued for the most part. It is still used in Japan for some seats in the House of Councillors (Sangi-in), prefectural assemblies and municipal assemblies.\nIn Taiwan it is used for the six aboriginal seats in the Legislative Yuan (national legislature), as well as local assemblies. The party structure there was complicated by the fact that while members of the Legislative Yuan were elected by SNTV, executive positions were (and still are) elected by a first past the post. This created a party system in which smaller factionalized parties, which SNTV promotes, have formed two large coalitions that resembles the two party system which first past the post rewards. Starting with the 2008 legislative elections, SNTV was discarded in favor of a mixed \"single member district\" (SMD) with proportional representation based on national party votes, similar to Japan. This system was a legacy of its colonial rule inherited from the Meiji Constitution.\nHong Kong.\nFrom 1997 to 2016, the electoral system for up to half of the seats of the Legislative Council of the territory was nominally a party-list proportional representation system with Hare quota. In practice, political parties fielded multiple lists in the same constituency. For example, the Democratic Party fielded three separate lists in the eight-seat New Territories West constituency in the 2008 election, aiming to win three seats (they won two). Split list or split tickets is done in order to win more seats with fewer votes, since the first candidate on each list would require less than the Hare quota to get a seat. Supporters are asked to split their votes among the lists of the same party, usually along geographical location of residence. In the 2012 and 2016 elections, no candidate list won more than one seat in any of the six PR constituencies which returned a total of 40 seats, rendering the result effectively the same as SNTV.\nIn the 2021 Hong Kong electoral reform, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress instituted SNTV in its amendment to Annex 2 of the Basic Law on 30 March 2021. 20 seats of the Legislative Council are returned by geographical constituencies (GC) through single non-transferable vote with a district magnitude of 2. Effect of the district size of 2 under SNTV system in Hong Kong have been compared to that of the binomial voting system.\nLibya.\nIn accordance with its post-Gaddafi electoral law, Libya in 2012 elected 80 members of its 200-seat General National Congress using single non-transferable vote. Some commentators cited the system as a factor in the subsequent return to civil war in 2014.\nChile.\nAfter the 2015 electoral reform, Chileans elect their representatives to both houses of Congress through open lists presented by parties or party coalitions in each of the electoral districts into which the country is divided for the contest, allowing only one vote for one of the candidates inside any list. Once the voting is over, the distribution of seats in each district (which can range from 3 to 8 in the lower house and from 2 to 5 in the upper one) is carried out through the D'Hondt method, ordering the lists from highest to lowest according to the total vote of each one and the candidates within each one of them with the same principle.\nJordan.\nSNTV was used in Jordan from 1993 to 2016. SNTV became the official electoral system for legislature elections in Jordan in 1993, the second election since the country's return to an elected parliament in 1989. The 1993 electoral reform introduced SNTV as the \"one-man, one-vote\", which was argued to be a more egalitarian alternative to the former \"block vote\" (or Multiple non-transferable vote) where constituents could cast as many votes as there were seats in their constituency. (Under SNTV, each voter cast just one.) The Jordanian opposition parties were heavily critical of the voting reform as it significantly hurt their electoral results. The Islamic Action Front was at the forefront of this criticism, boycotting 4 of the 6 elections held under this system. The last election held purely under this system was in 2010, whose parliament was dissolved after the Arab Spring protests in Jordan and a new election was held in 2013 using both SNTV and a national closed list with a proportional system. SNTV was completely abolished after the 2016 electoral reform where it was replaced with open list PR (in 23 constituencies of between three and nine seats each) plus 15 seats reserved for women.\nKuwait.\nKuwait has used SNTV to elect the members of its National Assembly (Majles al-Umma) in five 10-member districts, starting with the 2012 election.\nVanuatu.\nSince independence from Britain and France in 1980, Vanuatu has used SNTV to elect most of the members of its Parliament. Currently, other than eight members elected in single-member constituencies, the 52 members of Parliament are elected in ten multi-member constituencies (of between two and seven seats) by single non-transferable vote. The last election this was done was the 2025 Vanuatuan general election.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The societies he founded became the dominant form of the independent Methodist movement that continues to this day.\nEducated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford, Wesley was elected a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1726 and ordained as an Anglican priest two years later. At Oxford, he led the \"Holy Club\", a society formed for the purpose of the study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life. After an unsuccessful two-year ministry in Savannah, Georgia, he returned to London and joined a religious society led by Moravian Christians. On 24 May 1738, he experienced what has come to be called his evangelical conversion. He left the Moravians and began his own ministry.\nA key step in the development of Wesley's ministry was to travel widely and preach outdoors, embracing Arminian doctrines. Moving across Great Britain and Ireland, he helped form and organise small Christian groups that developed intensive and personal accountability, discipleship, and religious instruction. He appointed itinerant, unordained evangelists\u2014both women and men\u2014to care for these groups of people. Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including the abolition of slavery and support for women preachers.\nAlthough he was not a systematic theologian, Wesley argued against Calvinism and for the notion of Christian perfection, which he cited as the reason that he felt God \"raised up\" Methodists into existence. His evangelicalism, firmly grounded in sacramental theology, maintained that means of grace played a role in sanctification of the believer; however, he taught that it was by faith a believer was transformed into the likeness of Christ. He held that, in this life, Christians could achieve a state where the love of God \"reigned supreme in their hearts\", giving them not only outward but inward holiness. Wesley's teachings, collectively known as Wesleyan theology, continue to inform the doctrine of Methodist churches. In his early ministry years, Wesley was barred from preaching in many parish churches and the Methodists were persecuted; he later became widely respected, and by the end of his life, was described as \"the best-loved man in England\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nJohn Wesley was born on 28 June\u00a0[O.S. 17 June]\u00a01703 in Epworth, 23 miles (37\u00a0km) north-west of Lincoln. He was the 15th child of Samuel Wesley and his wife Susanna Wesley (n\u00e9e Annesley). Samuel Wesley was a graduate of the University of Oxford and a poet who, from 1696, was rector of Epworth. He married Susanna, the 25th child of Samuel Annesley, a dissenting minister, in 1689. Ultimately, she bore 19 children, nine of whom lived beyond infancy. She and Samuel Wesley had become members of the Church of England as young adults.\nAs in many families at the time, Wesley's parents gave their children their early education. Each child, including the girls, was taught to read as soon as they turned five years old. They were expected to become proficient in Latin and Greek and to have learned major portions of the New Testament by heart. Susanna Wesley examined each child before the midday meal and before evening prayers. The children were not allowed to eat between meals and were interviewed singly by their mother one evening each week for the purpose of intensive spiritual instruction. In 1714, at age 11, Wesley was sent to the Charterhouse School in London (under the mastership of John King from 1715), where he lived the studious, methodical and, for a while, religious life in which he had been trained at home.\nApart from his disciplined upbringing, a rectory fire which occurred on 9 February 1709, when Wesley was five years old, left an indelible impression. Some time after 11:00\u00a0pm, the rectory roof caught on fire. Sparks falling on the children's beds and cries of \"fire\" from the street roused the Wesleys who managed to shepherd all their children out of the house except for John who was left stranded on an upper floor. With stairs aflame and the roof about to collapse, Wesley was lifted out of a window by a parishioner standing on another man's shoulders. This childhood deliverance subsequently became part of the Wesley legend, attesting to his special destiny and extraordinary work. Wesley was also influenced by the reported haunting of Epworth Rectory between 1716 and 1717. The Wesley family reported frequently hearing noises and occasionally seeing apparitions which they believed were caused by a ghost called 'Old Jeffery'.\nEducation.\nIn June 1720, Wesley entered Christ Church, Oxford. After graduating in 1724, Wesley stayed on at Christ Church to study for his master's degree.\nHe was ordained a deacon on 19 September 1725\u2014holy orders being a necessary step toward becoming a fellow and tutor at the university. On 17 March 1726, Wesley was unanimously elected a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford; this carried with it the right to a room at the college and regular salary. While continuing his studies, he taught Greek and philosophy, lectured on the New Testament and moderated daily disputations at the university. However, a call to ministry intruded upon his academic career. In August 1727, after completing his master's degree, Wesley returned to Epworth. His father had requested his assistance in serving the neighbouring cure of Wroot. Ordained a priest on 22 September 1728, Wesley served as a parish curate for two years.\nIn the year of his ordination, he read Thomas \u00e0 Kempis and Jeremy Taylor, showed his interest in mysticism, and began to seek the religious truths which underlay the great revival of the 18th century. The reading of William Law's \"Christian Perfection\" and \"A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life\" gave him, he said, a more sublime view of the law of God; and he resolved to keep it, inwardly and outwardly, as sacredly as possible, believing that in obedience he would find salvation. He pursued a rigidly methodical and abstemious life, studied Scripture, and performed his religious duties diligently, depriving himself so that he would have alms to give. He began to seek after holiness of heart and life.\nWesley returned to Oxford in November 1729 at the request of the Rector of Lincoln College and to maintain his status as a junior fellow.\nHoly Club.\nDuring Wesley's absence, his younger brother Charles (1707\u201388) matriculated at Christ Church; along with two fellow students, he formed a small club for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life. On Wesley's return, he became the leader of the group which increased somewhat in number and greatly in commitment. The group met daily from six until nine for prayer, psalms, and reading of the Greek New Testament. They prayed every waking hour for several minutes and each day for a special virtue. While the church's prescribed attendance was only three times a year, they took Communion every Sunday. They fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays until nones (3:00\u00a0pm) as was commonly observed in the ancient church. In 1730, the group began the practice of visiting prisoners in gaol. The men preached, educated, and relieved gaoled debtors whenever possible, and cared for the sick.\nGiven the low ebb of spirituality in Oxford at that time, Wesley's group provoked a negative reaction. They were considered to be religious \"enthusiasts\", which in the context of the time meant religious fanatics. University wits styled them the \"Holy Club\", a title of derision. Currents of opposition became a furore following the mental breakdown and death of a group member, William Morgan. In response to the charge that \"rigorous fasting\" had hastened his death, Wesley noted that Morgan had left off fasting a year and a half since. In the same letter, which was widely circulated, Wesley referred to the name \"Methodist\" with which \"some of our neighbors are pleased to compliment us\". That name was used by an anonymous author in a published pamphlet (1732) describing Wesley and his group, \"The Oxford Methodists\". This ministry, however, was not without controversy. The Holy Club ministered and maintained support for Thomas Blair who in 1732 was found guilty of sodomy. Blair was notorious among the townspeople and his fellow prisoners, and Wesley continued to support him.\nFor all of his outward piety, Wesley sought to cultivate his inner holiness or at least his sincerity as evidence of being a true Christian. A list of \"General Questions\" which he developed in 1730 evolved into an elaborate grid by 1734 in which he recorded his daily activities hour-by-hour, resolutions he had broken or kept, and ranked his hourly \"temper of devotion\" on a scale of 1 to 9. Wesley also regarded the contempt with which he and his group were held to be a mark of a true Christian. As he put it in a letter to his father, \"Till he be thus contemned, no man is in a state of salvation.\"\nJourney to Savannah, Georgia.\nOn 14 October 1735, Wesley and his brother Charles sailed on \"The Simmonds\" from Gravesend in Kent for Savannah in the Province of Georgia in the American colonies at the request of James Oglethorpe, who had founded the colony in 1733 on behalf of the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America. Oglethorpe wanted Wesley to be the minister of the newly formed Savannah parish, a new town laid out in accordance with the famous Oglethorpe Plan.\nIt was on the voyage to the colonies that the Wesleys first came into contact with Moravian settlers. Wesley was influenced by their deep faith and spirituality rooted in pietism. At one point in the voyage, a storm came up and broke the mast off the ship. While the English panicked, the Moravians calmly sang hymns and prayed. This experience led Wesley to believe that the Moravians possessed an inner strength which he lacked. The deeply personal religion that the Moravian pietists practised heavily influenced Wesley and is reflected in his theology of Methodism.\nWesley arrived in the colony in February 1736, and lived for a year at the parsonage that stood on the site of today's Oliver Sturges House. He approached the Georgia mission as a High churchman, seeing it as an opportunity to revive \"primitive Christianity\" in a primitive environment. Although his primary goal was to evangelise the Native American people, a shortage of clergy in the colony largely limited his ministry to European settlers in Savannah. While his ministry has often been judged to have been a failure in comparison to his later success as a leader in the Evangelical Revival, Wesley gathered around him a group of devoted Christians, who met in a number of small group religious societies. At the same time, attendance at Communion increased over the course of nearly two years in which he served as Christ Church's parish priest.\nNonetheless, Wesley's High Church ministry was controversial among the colonists and it ended in disappointment after Wesley fell in love with a young woman named Sophia (or Sophy) Hopkey. He hesitated to marry her because he felt that his first priority in Georgia was to be a missionary to the Native Americans, and he was interested in the practice of clerical celibacy within early Christianity. Following her marriage to William Williamson, Wesley believed Sophia's former zeal for practising the Christian faith declined. In strictly applying the rubrics of the \"Book of Common Prayer\", Wesley denied her Communion after she failed to signify to him in advance her intention of taking it. As a result, legal proceedings against him ensued in which a clear resolution seemed unlikely. On 22 December 1737, Wesley fled the colony and returned to England.\nOne of the most significant accomplishments of Wesley's Georgia mission was his publication of a \"Collection of Psalms and Hymns\". The \"Collection\" was the first Anglican hymnal published in America, and the first of many hymn books Wesley published. It included five hymns he translated from German.\nWesley's \"Aldersgate experience\".\nAs a result of his experience in Georgia, Wesley became depressed. While on his voyage home to England, he had the opportunity to think about his own religious faith. He found that, although he had committed to the life of following Christ, he was dissatisfied with his spiritual soundness and felt inadequate to preach, especially after witnessing the confident way in which the Moravians had preached their faith. Both he and Charles received counsel from Moravian minister Peter Boehler, who was temporarily in England awaiting permission to depart for Georgia himself. Boehler encouraged Wesley to \"preach faith until you have it\".\nWesley's noted \"Aldersgate experience\" of 24 May 1738, at a Moravian meeting in Aldersgate Street, London, in which he heard a reading of Martin Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans, revolutionised the character and method of his ministry. The previous week he had been highly impressed by the sermon of John Heylyn, whom he was assisting in the service at St Mary le Strand. Earlier that day, he had heard the choir at St Paul's Cathedral singing Psalm 130, where the Psalmist calls to God \"Out of the depths.\"\nBut it was still a depressed Wesley who attended a service on the evening of 24 May. Wesley recounted his Aldersgate experience in his journal:\n\"In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was reading Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\"\nA few weeks later, Wesley preached a sermon on the doctrine of personal salvation by faith, which was followed by another, on God's grace \"free in all, and free for all.\" Considered a pivotal moment, Daniel L. Burnett writes: \"The significance of Wesley's Aldersgate Experience is monumental ... Without it, the names of Wesley and Methodism would likely be nothing more than obscure footnotes in the pages of church history.\" Burnett describes this event as Wesley's \"Evangelical Conversion\". 24 May is commemorated in Methodist churches as Aldersgate Day.\nAfter Aldersgate: Working with the Moravians.\nWesley allied himself with the Moravian society in Fetter Lane. In August 1738 Wesley travelled to Germany, specifically to see Herrnhut in Saxony, as he wished to study at the Moravian headquarters there. On his return to England, Wesley drew up rules for the \"bands\" into which the Fetter Lane Society was divided and published a collection of hymns for them. He met frequently with this and other religious societies in London but did not preach often in 1738, because most of the parish churches were closed to him.\nWesley's Oxford friend, the evangelist George Whitefield, was also excluded from the churches of Bristol upon his return from America. When Wesley reached Bristol, the city was booming with new industrial and commercial development. Because of this, there were social uproars with riots and religious troubles. About a fifth of the population were Dissenters, while many of the Anglicans possessed a religious enthusiasm that made them receptive to Wesley's message and approach. Going to the neighbouring village of Kingswood, in February 1739, Whitefield preached in the open air to a company of miners. Later he preached in Whitefield's Tabernacle. Wesley hesitated to accept Whitefield's call to copy this bold step. Overcoming his scruples, he preached the first time at Whitefield's invitation a sermon in the open air, at a brickyard, near St Philip's Marsh, on 2 April 1739. Wesley wrote,\nI could scarce reconcile myself to this strange way of preaching in the fields, of which he [Whitefield] set me an example on Sunday; having been all my life till very lately so tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that I should have thought the saving of souls almost a sin if it had not been done in a church.\nWesley was unhappy about the idea of field preaching as he believed Anglican liturgy had much to offer in its practice. Earlier in his life he would have thought that such a method of saving souls was \"almost a sin.\" He recognised the open-air services were successful in reaching men and women who would not enter most churches. From then on he took the opportunities to preach wherever an assembly could be brought together, more than once using his father's tombstone at Epworth as a pulpit. Wesley preached to create repentance, prayed for conversion, dealt with hysterical behaviour, and preached to upwards of thousands through field preaching. Wesley continued for fifty years\u2014entering churches when he was invited, and taking his stand in the fields, in halls, cottages, and chapels, when the churches would not receive him.\nLate in 1739, Wesley broke with the Moravians in London. Wesley had helped them organise the Fetter Lane Society, and those converted by his preaching and that of his brother and Whitefield had become members of their bands. But he believed they fell into heresy by supporting quietism, so he decided to form his own followers into a separate society. \"Thus,\" he wrote, \"without any previous plan, began the Methodist Society in England.\" He soon formed similar societies in Bristol and Kingswood, and Wesley and his friends made converts wherever they went.\nPersecutions and lay preaching.\nFrom 1739 onward, Wesley and the Methodists were persecuted by clergy and religious magistrates for various reasons. Though Wesley had been ordained an Anglican priest, many other Methodist leaders had not received ordination. And for his own part, Wesley flouted many regulations of the Church of England concerning parish boundaries and who had the authority to preach. This was seen as a social threat that disregarded institutions. Clergy attacked them in sermons and in print, and at times mobs attacked them. Wesley and his followers continued to work among the neglected and needy. They were denounced as promulgators of strange doctrines, fomenters of religious disturbances; as blind fanatics, leading people astray, claiming miraculous gifts, attacking the clergy of the Church of England, and trying to re-establish Catholicism.\nWesley felt that the church failed to call sinners to repentance, that many of the clergy were corrupt, and that people were perishing in their sins. He believed he was commissioned by God to bring about revival in the church, and no opposition, persecution, or obstacles could prevail against the divine urgency and authority of this commission. The prejudices of his High-church training, his strict notions of the methods and proprieties of public worship, his views of the apostolic succession and the prerogatives of the priest, even his most cherished convictions, were not allowed to stand in the way.\nSeeing that he and the few clergy cooperating with him could not do the work that needed to be done, Wesley was led, as early as 1739, to approve local preachers. He evaluated and approved men who were not ordained by the Anglican Church to preach and do pastoral work. This expansion of lay preachers was one of the keys to the growth of Methodism.\nChapels and organisations.\nAs his societies needed houses to worship in, Wesley began to provide chapels, first in Bristol at the New Room, then in London (first The Foundery and then Wesley's Chapel) and elsewhere. The Foundery was an early chapel used by Wesley. The location of the Foundery is shown on an 18th-century map, where it rests between Tabernacle Street and Worship Street in the Moorfields area of London. When the Wesleys spotted the building atop Windmill Hill, north of Finsbury Fields, the structure which previously cast brass guns and mortars for the Royal Ordnance had been sitting vacant for 23 years; it had been abandoned because of an explosion on 10 May 1716.\nThe Bristol chapel (built in 1739) was at first in the hands of trustees. A large debt was contracted, and Wesley's friends urged him to keep it under his own control, so the deed was cancelled and he became sole trustee. Following this precedent, all Methodist chapels were committed in trust to him until by a \"deed of declaration\", all his interests in them were transferred to a body of preachers called the \"Legal Hundred\".\nWhen disorder arose among some members of the societies, Wesley adopted giving tickets to members, with their names written by his own hand. These were renewed every three months. Those deemed unworthy did not receive new tickets and dropped out of the society without disturbance. The tickets were regarded as commendatory letters.\nWhen the debt on a chapel became a burden, it was proposed that one in 12 members should collect offerings regularly from the 11 allotted to him. Out of this grew the Methodist class-meeting system in 1742. To keep the disorderly out of the societies, Wesley established a probationary system. He undertook to visit each society regularly in what became the quarterly visitation, or conference. As the number of societies increased, Wesley could not keep personal contact, so in 1743 he drew up a set of \"General Rules\" for the \"United Societies\". These were the nucleus of the Methodist \"Discipline\", still the basis of modern Methodism.\nWesley laid the foundations of what now constitutes the organisation of the Methodist Church. Over time, a shifting pattern of societies, circuits, quarterly meetings, annual conferences, classes, bands, and select societies took shape. At the local level, there were numerous societies of different sizes which were grouped into circuits to which travelling preachers were appointed for two-year periods. Circuit officials met quarterly under a senior travelling preacher or \"assistant.\" Conferences with Wesley, travelling preachers and others were convened annually for the purpose of co-ordinating doctrine and discipline for the entire connection. Classes of a dozen or so society members under a leader met weekly for spiritual fellowship and guidance. In the early years, there were \"bands\" of the spiritually gifted who consciously pursued perfection. Those who were regarded to have achieved it were grouped in select societies or bands. In 1744, there were 77 such members. There also was a category of penitents which consisted of backsliders.\nAs the number of preachers and preaching-houses increased, doctrinal and administrative matters needed to be discussed; so John and Charles Wesley, along with four other clergy and four lay preachers, met for consultation in London in 1744. This was the first Methodist conference; subsequently, the Conference (with Wesley as its president) became the ruling body of the Methodist movement. Two years later, to help preachers work more systematically and societies receive services more regularly, Wesley appointed \"helpers\" to definitive circuits. Each circuit included at least 30 appointments a month. Believing that the preacher's efficiency was promoted by his being changed from one circuit to another every year or two, Wesley established the \"\" and insisted that his preachers submit to its rules.\nJohn Wesley had strong links with the North West of England, visiting Manchester on at least fifteen occasions between 1733 and 1790. In 1733 and 1738 he preached at St Ann's Church and Salford Chapel, meeting with his friend John Clayton. In 1781 Wesley opened the chapel on Oldham Street\u2014part of the Manchester and Salford Wesleyan Methodist Mission, now the site of Manchester's Methodist Central Hall.\nWesley travelled to Ireland for the first time in 1747 and continued through 1789. He rejected the Catholic Church, so he worked to convert the people of Ireland to Methodism. Overall, the numbers grew to over 15,000 by 1795.\nFollowing an illness in 1748 Wesley was nursed by a class leader and housekeeper, Grace Murray, at an orphan house in Newcastle. Taken with Grace, he invited her to travel with him to Ireland in 1749 where he believed them to be betrothed though they were never married. It has been suggested that his brother Charles Wesley objected to the engagement, though this is disputed. Subsequently, Grace married John Bennett, a preacher.\nOrdination of ministers.\nAs the societies multiplied, they adopted the elements of an ecclesiastical system. The divide between Wesley and the Church of England widened. The question of division from the Church of England was urged by some of his preachers and societies, but most strenuously opposed by his brother Charles. Wesley refused to leave the Church of England, believing that Anglicanism was \"with all her blemishes, [...] nearer the Scriptural plans than any other in Europe\". In 1745 Wesley wrote that he would make any concession which his conscience permitted, to live in peace with the clergy. He could not give up the doctrine of an inward and present salvation by faith itself; he would not stop preaching, nor dissolve the societies, nor end preaching by lay members. In the same year, in correspondence with a friend, he wrote that he believed it wrong to administer sacraments without having been ordained by a bishop.\nWhen, in 1746, Wesley read Lord King's account of the primitive church, he became convinced that apostolic succession could be transmitted through not only bishops, but also presbyters (priests). He wrote that he was \"a scriptural \"episkopos\" as much as many men in England.\" Although he believed in apostolic succession, he also once called the idea of uninterrupted succession a \"fable\".\nEdward Stillingfleet's \"Irenicon\" led him to decide that ordination (and holy orders) could be valid when performed by a presbyter rather than a bishop. Nevertheless, some believe that Wesley was secretly consecrated a bishop in 1763 by Erasmus of Arcadia, and that Wesley could not openly announce his episcopal consecration without incurring the penalty of the \"Pr\u00e6munire\" Act.\nIn 1784, he believed he could no longer wait for the Bishop of London to ordain someone for the American Methodists, who were without the sacraments after the American War of Independence. The Church of England had been disestablished in the United States, where it had been the state church in most of the southern colonies. The Church of England had not yet appointed a United States bishop to what would become the Protestant Episcopal Church in America. Wesley ordained Thomas Coke as superintendent of Methodists in the United States by the laying on of hands, although Coke was already a priest in the Church of England. He also ordained Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey as presbyters; Whatcoat and Vasey sailed to America with Coke. Wesley intended that Coke and Francis Asbury (whom Coke ordained as superintendent by direction of Wesley) should ordain others in the newly founded Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. In 1787, Coke and Asbury persuaded the American Methodists to refer to them as bishops rather than superintendents, overruling Wesley's objections.\nHis brother, Charles, was alarmed by the ordinations and Wesley's evolving view of the matter. He begged Wesley to stop before he had \"quite broken down the bridge\" and not embitter his [Charles'] last moments on earth, nor \"leave an indelible blot on our memory.\" Wesley replied that he had not separated from the church, nor did he intend to, but he must and would save as many souls as he could while alive, \"without being careful about what may possibly be when I die.\" Although Wesley rejoiced that the Methodists in America were free, he advised his English followers to remain in the established church.\nDoctrines, theology and advocacy.\nTheological methodology.\nThe 20th-century Wesleyan scholar Albert Outler argued in his introduction to the 1964 collection \"John Wesley\" that Wesley developed his theology by using a method that Outler termed the Wesleyan Quadrilateral. In this method, Wesley believed that the living core of Christianity was contained in Scripture (the Bible), and that it was the sole foundational source of theological development. The centrality of Scripture was so important for Wesley that he called himself \"a man of one book,\" although he was well-read for his day. However, he believed that doctrine had to be in keeping with Christian orthodox tradition. So, tradition was considered the second aspect of the Quadrilateral. Wesley contended that a part of the theological method would involve experiential faith. In other words, truth would be vivified in the personal experience of Christians (overall, not individually), if it were really truth. And every doctrine must be able to be defended rationally. He did not divorce faith from reason. Tradition, experience and reason, however, were subject always to Scripture, Wesley argued, because only there is the Word of God revealed \"so far as it is necessary for our salvation.\"\nThe doctrines which Wesley emphasised in his sermons and writings are prevenient grace, present personal salvation by faith, the witness of the Spirit, and entire sanctification.\nWitness of the Spirit.\nWesley defined the witness of the Spirit as \"an inward impression on the soul of believers, whereby the Spirit of God directly testifies to their spirit that they are the children of God.\" He inherited this doctrine from the Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin. This doctrine was closely related to his belief that salvation had to be \"personal.\" In his view, a person must ultimately believe the Good News for himself or herself; no one could be in relation to God for another.\nEntire sanctification.\nEntire sanctification, he described in 1790, as the \"grand \"depositum\" which God has lodged with the people called 'Methodists'\" and that the propagation of this doctrine was the reason that He brought Methodists into existence. Wesley taught that entire sanctification was obtainable after justification by faith, between justification and death. Wesley defined it as:\"That habitual disposition of soul which, in the sacred writings, is termed holiness; and which directly implies, the being cleansed from sin, 'from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit;' and, by consequence, the being endued with those virtues which were in Christ Jesus; the being so 'renewed in the image of our mind,' as to be 'perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.\"The term \"sinless perfection\" was one which Wesley avoided using \"because of its ambiguity,\" rather, he contended that a Christian could be made \"perfect in love\". (Wesley studied Eastern Orthodoxy and embraced particularly the doctrine of \"Theosis\"). This love would mean, first of all, that a believer's motives, rather than being self-centred, would be guided by the deep desire to please God. One would be able to keep from committing what Wesley called, \"sin rightly so-called.\" By this, he meant a conscious or intentional breach of God's will or laws.\nSecondly, to be made perfect in love meant, for Wesley, that a Christian could live with a primary guiding regard for others and their welfare. He based this on Christ's quote that the second great command is \"to love your neighbour as you love yourself.\" In Wesley's view, this orientation would cause a person to avoid any number of sins against his neighbour. This love, plus the love for God that could be the central focus of a person's faith, would be what Wesley referred to as \"a fulfilment of the law of Christ.\" He described perfection as a second blessing and instantaneous sanctifying experience; he maintained that individuals could have the assurance of their entire sanctification through the testimony of the Holy Spirit. Wesley collected and published such testimonies.\nAdvocacy of Arminianism.\nWesley entered into controversies as he tried to enlarge church practice, with the most significant being his conflict with Calvinism. His father was of the Arminian school in the church. Wesley came to his own conclusions while in college and expressed himself strongly against the doctrines of unconditional election and reprobation. His system of thought has become known as Wesleyan Arminianism, the foundations of which were laid by Wesley and his fellow preacher John William Fletcher. Although Wesley knew very little about the beliefs of Jacob Arminius and arrived at his religious views independently of Arminius, Wesley acknowledged late in life, with the 1778 publication of \"The Arminian Magazine\", that he and Arminius were in general agreement. He is now regarded as a faithful representative of Arminius' beliefs. Wesley was perhaps the clearest English proponent of Arminianism.\nPrevenient grace was the theological underpinning of his belief that all persons were capable of being saved by faith in Christ. Wesley did not believe in the Calvinist understanding of predestination, that is, that some persons had been elected by God for salvation and others for damnation. He expressed his understanding of humanity's relationship to God as utter dependence upon God's grace. God was at work to spiritually enable all people to be capable of coming to faith.\nBy contrast, Whitefield inclined to Calvinism; in his first tour in America, he embraced the views of the New England School of Calvinism. Whitefield opposed Wesley's advocacy of Arminianism, though the two maintained a strained friendship. When in 1739 Wesley preached a sermon on \"Freedom of Grace\", attacking the Calvinistic understanding of predestination as blasphemous, as it represented \"God as worse than the devil,\" Whitefield asked him not to repeat or publish the discourse, as he did not want a dispute. Wesley published his sermon anyway. Whitefield was one of many who responded. The two men separated their practice in 1741. Wesley wrote that those who held to unlimited atonement did not desire separation, but \"those who held 'particular redemption' would not hear of any accommodation.\"\nWhitefield, Howell Harris (leader of the Welsh Methodist revival), John Cennick, and others, became the founders of Calvinistic Methodism. Whitefield and Wesley, however, were soon back on friendly terms, and their friendship remained unbroken although they travelled different paths. When someone asked Whitefield if he thought he would see Wesley in heaven, Whitefield replied, \"I fear not, for he will be so near the eternal throne and we at such a distance, we shall hardly get sight of him.\"\nIn 1770, the controversy broke out anew with violence and bitterness, as people's view of God related to their views of men and their possibilities. Augustus Toplady, Daniel Rowland, Sir Richard Hill and others were engaged on one side, while Wesley and Fletcher stood on the other. Toplady was editor of \"The Gospel Magazine\", which had articles covering the controversy.\nIn 1778, Wesley began the publication of \"The Arminian Magazine\", not, he said, to convince Calvinists, but to preserve Methodists. He wanted to teach the truth that \"God willeth all men to be saved.\" A \"lasting peace\" could be secured in no other way.\nSome have suggested that later in life, Wesley may have embraced the doctrine of universal salvation. This claim is supported by a letter Wesley wrote in 1787, in which he endorsed a work by Charles Bonnet that concluded in favour of universalism. However, this interpretation is disputed.\nSupport for abolitionism.\nLater in his ministry, Wesley was a keen abolitionist, speaking out and writing against the slave trade. Wesley denounced slavery as \"the sum of all villainies\" and detailed its abuses. He addressed the slave trade in a polemical tract, titled \"Thoughts Upon Slavery,\" in 1774. He wrote, \"Liberty is the right of every human creature, as soon as he breathes the vital air; and no human law can deprive him of that right which he derives from the law of nature\". Wesley influenced George Whitefield to journey to the colonies, spurring the transatlantic debate on slavery. Wesley was a mentor to William Wilberforce, who was also influential in the abolition of slavery in the British Empire.\nIt is thanks to Wesley's abolitionist message that a young African American, Richard Allen, converted to Christianity in 1777 and later founded, in 1816, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), in the Methodist tradition.\nSupport for women preachers.\nWomen had an active role in Wesley's Methodism and were encouraged to lead classes. In 1761, he informally allowed Sarah Crosby, one of his converts and a class leader, to preach. On an occasion where over 200 people attended a class she was meant to teach, Crosby felt as though she could not fulfil her duties as a class leader given the large crowd and decided to preach instead. She wrote to Wesley to seek his advice and forgiveness. He let Crosby continue her preaching so long as she refrained from as many of the mannerisms of preaching as she could. Between 1761 and 1771, Wesley wrote detailed instructions to Crosby and others, with specifics on what styles of preaching they could use. For instance, in 1769, Wesley allowed Crosby to give exhortations.\nIn the summer of 1771, Mary Bosanquet wrote to John Wesley to defend her and Sarah Crosby's work preaching and leading classes at her orphanage, Cross Hall. Bosanquet's letter is considered to be the first full and true defence of women's preaching in Methodism. Her argument was that women should be able to preach when they experienced an 'extraordinary call' or when given permission from God. Wesley accepted Bosanquet's argument and formally began to allow women to preach in Methodism in 1771. Methodist women, including preachers, continued to observe the ancient practice of Christian head covering.\nInterfaith relations and views.\nWesley assumed the superiority of Christianity vis-\u00e0-vis to Islam, based on his commitment to the biblical revelation as \"the book of God\". His theological interpretation of Christianity was seeking its imperative rather than considering other Abrahamic and Eastern religions to be equal. He regarded the righteous lifestyles of Muslims as an \"ox goad\" to prick the collective Christian conscience. Although his \"Letter to a Roman Catholic\" (1749), a conciliatory appeal for understanding and shared Christian faith, is sometimes seen as an act of religious tolerance, Wesley remained rooted in the anti-Catholicism characteristic of 18th-century England.\nPersonal life and activities.\nWesley travelled widely, generally on horseback, preaching two or three times each day. Stephen Tomkins writes that \"[Wesley] rode 250,000 miles, gave away 30,000 pounds, ... and preached more than 40,000 sermons\". He formed societies, opened chapels, examined and commissioned preachers, administered aid charities, prescribed for the sick, helped to pioneer the use of electric shock for the treatment of illness, and superintended orphanages and schools (including Kingswood School).\nWesley practised a vegetarian diet and in later life abstained from wine for health reasons. He wrote, \"thanks be to God, since the time I gave up flesh meals and wine I have been delivered from all physical ills\". Wesley warned against the dangers of alcohol abuse in his famous sermon, \"The Use of Money,\" and in his letter to an alcoholic. In his sermon, \"On Public Diversions\", Wesley says: \"You see the wine when it sparkles in the cup, and are going to drink of it. I tell you there is poison in it! and, therefore, beg you to throw it away\". These statements against alcohol use largely concerned \"hard liquors and spirits\" rather than the low-alcohol beer, which was often safer to drink than the contaminated water of that time. Methodist churches became pioneers in the teetotal temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries, and later it became \"de rigueur\" in British Methodism.\nHe attended music concerts, and was especially an admirer of Charles Avison. After attending a performance in Bristol Cathedral in 1758, Wesley recorded in his journal: \"I went to the cathedral to hear Mr. Handel's \"Messiah\". I doubt if that congregation was ever so serious at a sermon as they were during this performance. In many places, especially several of the choruses, it exceeded my expectation.\"\nHe is described as \"rather under the medium height, well proportioned, strong, with a bright eye, a clear complexion, and a saintly, intellectual face\". Though Wesley favoured celibacy rather than marital bond, he married very unhappily in 1751, at the age of 48, to a widow, Mary Vazeille, described as \"a well-to-do widow and mother of four children.\" The couple had no children. John Singleton writes: \"By 1758 she had left him\u2014unable to cope, it is said, with the competition for his time and devotion presented by the ever-burgeoning Methodist movement. Molly, as she was known, was to return and leave him again on several occasions before their final separation.\" Wesley wryly reported in his journal, \"I did not forsake her, I did not dismiss her, I will not recall her.\"\nIn 1770, at the death of George Whitefield, Wesley wrote a memorial sermon which praised Whitefield's admirable qualities and acknowledged the two men's differences: \"There are many doctrines of a less essential nature ... In these we may think and let think; we may 'agree to disagree.' But, meantime, let us hold fast the essentials...\" Wesley may have been the first to use \"agree to disagree\" in print\u2014in the modern sense of tolerating differences\u2014though he himself attributed the saying to Whitefield, and it had appeared in other senses previously.\nWesley was gravely ill during a visit to Lisburn in Ireland in June 1775. He stayed at the home of a leading Methodist, Henrietta Gayer, where he recovered.\nDeath.\nWesley's health declined sharply towards the end of his life and he ceased preaching. On 28 June 1790, less than a year before his death, he wrote:\nThis day I enter into my eighty-eighth year. For above eighty-six years, I found none of the infirmities of old age: my eyes did not wax dim, neither was my natural strength abated. But last August, I found almost a sudden change. My eyes were so dim that no glasses would help me. My strength likewise now quite forsook me and probably will not return in this world.\nWesley was cared for during his last months by Elizabeth Ritchie and his physician John Whitehead. He died on 2 March 1791, at the age of 87. As he lay dying, his friends gathered around him, Wesley grasped their hands and said repeatedly, \"Farewell, farewell.\" At the end, he said, \"The best of all is, God is with us\", lifted his arms and raised his feeble voice again, repeating the words, \"The best of all is, God is with us.\" He was entombed at his chapel on City Road, London. Ritchie wrote an account of his death which was quoted from by Whitehead at his funeral.\nBecause of his charitable nature, he died poor, leaving as the result of his life's work 135,000 members and 541 itinerant preachers under the name \"Methodist\". It has been said that \"when John Wesley was carried to his grave, he left behind him a good library of books, a well-worn clergyman's gown\" and the Methodist Church.\nLiterary work.\nWesley wrote, edited or abridged some 400 publications. As well as theology he wrote about music, marriage, medicine, abolitionism and politics. Wesley was a logical thinker and expressed himself clearly, concisely and forcefully in writing. Between 1746 and 1760, Wesley compiled several volumes of written sermons, published as \"Sermons on Several Occasions\"; the first four volumes comprise forty-four sermons which are doctrinal in content. His \"Forty-Four Sermons\" and the \"Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament\" (1755) are Methodist doctrinal standards. Wesley was a fluent, powerful and effective preacher; he usually preached spontaneously and briefly, though occasionally at great length.\nIn his \"Christian Library\" (1750), he writes about mystics such as Macarius of Egypt, Ephrem the Syrian, Madame Guyon, Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, Ignatius of Loyola, John of \u00c1vila, Francis de Sales, Blaise Pascal, and Antoinette Bourignon. The work reflects the influence of Christian mysticism in Wesley's ministry from the beginning to the end, although he ever rejected it after the failure in Georgia mission.\nWesley's prose, \"Works\", were first collected by himself (32 vols., Bristol, 1771\u201374, frequently reprinted in editions varying greatly in the number of volumes). His chief prose works are a standard publication in seven octavo volumes of the Methodist Book Concern, New York. The \"Poetical Works\" of John and Charles, ed. G. Osborn, appeared in 13 vols., London, 1868\u201372.\nIn addition to his \"Sermons\" and \"Notes\" are his \"Journals\" (originally published in 20 parts, London, 1740\u201389; new ed. by N. Curnock containing notes from unpublished diaries, 6 vols., vols. i\u2013ii, London and New York, 1909\u201311); \"The Doctrine of Original Sin\" (Bristol, 1757; in reply to John Taylor of Norwich); \"An Earnest Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion\" (originally published in three parts; 2nd ed., Bristol, 1743), an elaborate defence of Methodism, describing the evils of the times in society and the church; and a \"Plain Account of Christian Perfection\" (1766).\nWesley's \"Sunday Service\" was an adaptation of the \"Book of Common Prayer\" for use by American Methodists. In his Watchnight service, he made use of a pietist prayer now generally known as the Wesley Covenant Prayer, perhaps his most famous contribution to Christian liturgy. He was a noted hymn-writer, translator and compiler of a hymnal.\nWesley also wrote on physics and medicine, such as in \"The Desideratum\", subtitled \"Electricity made Plain and Useful by a Lover of Mankind and of Common Sense\" (1759). and \"Primitive Physic, Or, An Easy and Natural Method of Curing Most Diseases\".\nIn spite of the proliferation of his literary output, Wesley was challenged for plagiarism, for borrowing heavily from an essay by Samuel Johnson, published in March 1775. Initially denying the charge, Wesley later apologised officially.\nCommemoration and legacy.\nIn his early ministry years, Wesley was barred from preaching in many parish churches and the Methodists were persecuted; he later became widely respected, and by the end of his life, was described as \"the best-loved man in England\". Wesley continues to be the primary theological influence on Methodists and Methodist-heritage groups the world over; the Methodist movement numbers 75 million adherents in more than 130 countries. Wesleyan teachings also serve as a basis for the Holiness movement, which includes denominations like The Wesleyan Church, Free Methodist Church, the Church of the Nazarene, the Salvation Army, and several smaller groups, and from which Pentecostalism and parts of the Charismatic movement are offshoots. Wesley's call to personal and social holiness continues to challenge Christians who attempt to discern what it means to participate in the Kingdom of God.\nHe is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 2 March with his brother Charles. The Wesley brothers are honoured with a Lesser Feast on 3 March in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church, and on 24 May (Aldersgate Day, with a Lesser Festival) in the Church of England's Calendar. In 2002, Wesley was listed at number 50 on the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons, drawn from a poll of the British public. \nWesley's house and chapel, which he built in 1778 on City Road in London, are still intact today and the chapel has a thriving congregation with regular services as well as the Museum of Methodism in the crypt. A replica of the rectory where Wesley lived as a boy was built in the 1990s at Lake Junaluska, North Carolina. This was an addition to a group of buildings built starting in the 1950s for the World Methodist Council, including a museum which housed letters written by Wesley and a pulpit Wesley used. The museum was already having difficulty staying open, and the COVID-19 pandemic finally made closing the museum necessary. Its contents went to Bridwell Library of Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.\nNumerous schools, colleges, hospitals and other institutions are named after Wesley; additionally, many are named after Methodism. In 1831, Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, was the first institution of higher education in the United States to be named after Wesley. The now secular institution was founded as an all-male Methodist college.\nFilm.\nIn 1954, the Radio and Film Commission of the British Methodist Church, in co-operation with J. Arthur Rank, produced the film \"John Wesley\". This was a live-action re-telling of the story of the life of Wesley, with Leonard Sachs in the title role.\nIn 2009, a more ambitious feature film, \"Wesley\", was released by Foundery Pictures, starring Burgess Jenkins as Wesley. \nMusical theatre.\nIn 1976 the musical \"Ride! Ride!\", composed by Penelope Thwaites and written by Alan Thornhill, premiered at the Westminster Theatre in London's West End. The piece is based on the true story of eighteen-year-old Martha Thompson's incarceration in Bedlam, an incident in Wesley's life. The premier ran for 76 performances. Since then it has had more than 40 productions, both amateur and professional, including a 1999 concert version, issued on the Somm record label, with Keith Michell as Wesley.\nNotes and references.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It primarily uses power line wiring for signaling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts representing digital information. A wireless radio-based protocol transport is also defined.\nX10 was developed in 1975 by Pico Electronics of Glenrothes, Scotland, in order to allow remote control of home devices and appliances. It was the first general purpose home automation network technology and remains the most widely available.\nAlthough a number of higher-bandwidth alternatives exist, X10 remains popular in the home environment with millions of units in use worldwide, and inexpensive availability of new components.\nHistory.\nIn 1970, a group of engineers started a company in Glenrothes, Scotland called Pico Electronics. The company developed the first single chip calculator. When calculator integrated circuit prices started to fall, Pico refocused on commercial products rather than plain ICs.\nIn 1974, the Pico engineers jointly developed an LP record turntable, the ADC Accutrac 4000, with Birmingham Sound Reproducers, at the time the largest manufacturer of record changers in the world. It could be programmed to play selected tracks, and could be operated by a remote control using ultrasound signals, which sparked the idea of remote control for lights and appliances. By 1975, the X10 project was conceived, so named because it was the tenth project. In 1978, X10 products started to appear in RadioShack and Sears stores. Together with BSR a partnership was formed, with the name X10 Ltd. At that time the system consisted of a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.\nIn the 1980s, the CP-290 computer interface was released. Software for the interface runs on the Commodore 64, Apple II, classic Mac OS, MS-DOS, and Microsoft Windows.\nIn 1985, BSR went out of business, and X10 (USA) Inc. was formed. In the early 1990s, the consumer market was divided into two main categories, the ultra-high-end with a budget at US$100,000 and the mass market with budgets at US$2,000 to US$35,000. CEBus (1984) and LonWorks (1991) were attempts to improve reliability and replace X10.\nBrands.\nX10 components have been sold under a variety of brand names:\nMany of these vendors have since exited this business.\nPower line carrier control overview.\nHousehold electrical wiring which powers lights and appliances is used to send digital data between X10 devices. This data is encoded onto a 120 kHz carrier which is transmitted as bursts during the relatively quiet zero crossings of the 50 or 60 Hz AC alternating current waveform. One bit is transmitted at each zero crossing.\nThe digital data consists of an address and a command sent from a controller to a controlled device. More advanced controllers can also query equally advanced devices to respond with their status. This status may be as simple as \"off\" or \"on\", or the current dimming level, or even the temperature or other sensor reading. Devices usually plug into the wall where a lamp, television, or other household appliance plugs in; however some built-in controllers are also available for wall switches and ceiling fixtures.\nThe relatively high-frequency carrier wave carrying the signal cannot pass through a power transformer or across the phases of a multiphase system. For split phase systems, the signal can be passively coupled from leg-to-leg using a passive capacitor, but for three phase systems or where the capacitor provides insufficient coupling, an active X10 repeater can be used. To allow signals to be coupled across phases and still match each phase's zero crossing point, each bit is transmitted three times in each half cycle, offset by 1/6 cycle.\nIt may also be desirable to block X10 signals from leaving the local area so, for example, the X10 controls in one house do not interfere with the X10 controls in a neighboring house. In this situation, inductive filters can be used to attenuate the X10 signals coming into or going out of the local area.\nProtocol.\nWhether using power line or radio communications, packets transmitted using the X10 control protocol consist of a four bit \"house code\" followed by one or more four bit \"unit codes\", finally followed by a four bit command. For the convenience of users configuring a system, the four bit house code is selected as a letter from A through P while the four bit unit code is a number 1 through 16.\nWhen the system is installed, each controlled device is configured to respond to one of the 256 possible addresses (16 house codes \u00d7 16 unit codes); each device reacts to commands specifically addressed to it, or possibly to several broadcast commands.\nThe protocol may transmit a message that says \"select code A3\", followed by \"turn on\", which commands unit \"A3\" to turn on its device. Several units can be addressed before giving the command, allowing a command to affect several units simultaneously. For example, \"select A3\", \"select A15\", \"select A4\", and finally, \"turn on\", causes units A3, A4, and A15 to all turn on.\nNote that there is no restriction that prevents using more than one house code within a single house. The \"all lights on\" command and \"all units off\" commands will only affect a single house code, so an installation using multiple house codes effectively has the devices divided into separate zones.\nOne-way vs two-way.\nInexpensive X10 devices only receive commands and do not acknowledge their status to the rest of the network. Two-way controller devices allow for a more robust network but cost two to four times more and require two-way X10 devices.\nList of X10 house and unit code encodings.\nNote that the binary values for the house and unit codes correspond, but they are not a straight binary sequence. A unit code is followed by one additional \"0\" bit to distinguish from a command code (detailed above).\nPhysical layer details.\nIn the 60\u00a0Hz AC current flow, each bit transmitted requires two zero crossings. A \"1\" bit is represented by an active zero crossing followed by an inactive zero crossing. A \"0\" bit is represented by an inactive zero crossing followed by an active zero crossing. An active zero crossing is represented by a 1 millisecond burst of 120\u00a0kHz at the zero crossing point (nominally 0\u00b0, but within 200 microseconds of the zero crossing point). An inactive zero crossing will not have a pulse of 120\u00a0kHz signal.\nIn order to provide a predictable start point, every data frame transmitted always begins with a \"start code\" of three active zero crossings followed by an inactive crossing. Since all data bits are sent as one active and one inactive (or one inactive and one active) zero crossing, the start code, possessing three active crossings in a row, can be uniquely detected. Many X10 protocol charts represent this start code as \"1110\", but it is important to realize that is in terms of zero crossings, \"not\" data bits.\nImmediately after the start code, a 4-bit \"house code\" (normally represented by the letters A to P on interface units) appears, and after the house code comes a 5-bit \"function code\". Function codes may specify a unit number code (1\u201316) or a command code. The unit number or command code occupies the first 4 of the 5 bits. The final bit is a 0 for a unit code and a 1 for a command code. Multiple unit codes may be transmitted in sequence before a command code is finally sent. The command will be applied to all unit codes sent. It is also possible to send a message with no unit codes, just a house code and a command code. This will apply to the command to the last group of units codes previously sent.\nOne start code, one house code, and one function code is known as an X10 frame and represent the minimum components of a valid X10 data packet.\nEach frame is sent twice in succession to make sure the receivers understand it over any power line noise for purposes of redundancy, reliability, and to accommodate line repeaters. After allowing for retransmission, line control, etc., data rates are around 20 bit/s, making X10 data transmission so slow that the technology is confined to turning devices on and off or other very simple operations.\nWhenever the data changes from one address to another address, from an address to a command, or from one command to another command, the data frames must be separated by at least 6 clear zero crossings (or \"000000\"). The sequence of six zeros resets the device decoder hardware.\nLater developments (1997) of hardware are improvements of the native X10 hardware. In Europe (2001) for the 230 VAC 50\u00a0Hz market. All improved products use the same X10 protocol and are compatible.\nRF protocol.\nTo allow for wireless keypads, remote switches, motion sensors, et cetera, an RF protocol is also defined. X10 wireless devices send data packets that are nearly identical to the NEC IR protocol used by many IR remotes, and a radio receiver then provides a bridge which translates these radio packets to ordinary X10 power line control packets. The wireless protocol operates at a frequency of 310\u00a0MHz in the U.S. and 433.92\u00a0MHz in European systems.\nThe devices available using the radio protocol include: \nHardware support.\nDevice modules.\nDepending on the load that is to be controlled, different modules must be used. For incandescent lamp loads, a \"lamp module\" or \"wall switch\" module can be used. These modules switch the power using a TRIAC solid state switch and are also capable of dimming the lamp load. Lamp modules are almost silent in operation, and generally rated to control loads ranging from approximately 60 to 500 watts.\nFor loads other than incandescent lamps, such as fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and electrical home appliances, the triac-based electronic switching in the lamp module is unsuitable and an \"appliance module\" must be used instead. These modules switch the power using an impulse relay. In the U.S., these modules are generally rated to control loads up to 15 amperes (1800 watts at 120 V).\nMany device modules offer a feature called \"local control\". If the module is switched off, operating the power switch on the lamp or appliance will cause the module to turn on. In this way, a lamp can still be lit or a coffee pot turned on without the need to use an X10 controller. Wall switch modules may not offer this feature. As a result, older Appliance modules may fail to work with, for example, a very low load such as a 5W LED table lamp.\nSome wall switch modules offer a feature called \"local dimming\". Ordinarily, the local push button of a wall switch module simply offers on/off control with no possibility of locally dimming the controlled lamp. If local dimming is offered, holding down the push button will cause the lamp to cycle through its brightness range.\nHigher end modules have more advanced features such as programmable on levels, customizable fade rates, the ability to transmit commands when used (referred to as 2-way devices), and \"scene\" support.\nThere are sensor modules that sense and report temperature, light, infrared, motion, or contact openings and closures. Device modules include thermostats, audible alarms and controllers for low voltage switches.\nControllers.\nX10 controllers range from extremely simple to very sophisticated.\nThe simplest controllers are arranged to control four X10 devices at four sequential addresses (1\u20134 or 5\u20138). The controllers typically contain the following buttons:\nMore sophisticated controllers can control more units and/or incorporate timers that perform preprogrammed functions at specific times each day. Units are also available that use passive infrared motion detectors or photocells to turn lights on and off based on external conditions.\nFinally, there are very sophisticated units are available that can be fully programmed and/or controlled with a piece of software called Active Home, such as the CM11A serial interface. These systems can execute many different timed events, respond to external sensors, and execute, with the press of a single button, an entire \"scene\", turning lights on, establishing brightness levels, and so on. Control programs are available for computers running Microsoft Windows, Apple's Macintosh, Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.\nBurglar alarm systems are also available. These systems contain door/window sensors, as well as motion sensors that use a coded radio frequency (RF) signal to identify when they are tripped or just to routinely check-in and give a heart-beat signal to show that the system is still active. Users can arm and disarm their system via several different remote controls that also use a coded RF signal to ensure security. When an alarm is triggered the console will make an outbound telephone call with a recorded message. The console will also use X10 protocols to flash lights when an alarm has been triggered while the security console sounds an external siren. Using X10 protocols, signals will also be sent to remote sirens for additional security.\nBridges.\nThere are bridges to translate X10 to other home automation standards (e.g., KNX). ioBridge can be used to translate the X10 protocol to a web service API via the X10 PSC04 Powerline Interface Module. The magDomus home controller from magnocomp allows interconnection and inter-operation between most home automation technologies.\nThermostat\nWith X10 being an open standard, companies such as RCS released an x10 controllable thermostat model TX15-B, which is controllable via a web interface or a computer running a X10 software such as HAL or HomeSeer. \nLimitations.\nCompatibility.\nSolid-state switches used in X10 controls pass a very small leakage current. Compact fluorescent lamps may display nuisance blinking when switched off; CFL manufacturers recommend against controlling lamps with solid-state timers or remote controls.\nSome X10 controllers with triac solid-state outputs may not work well with low power devices (below 50 watts) or devices like fluorescent bulbs due to the leakage current of the device. An appliance module, using a relay with metallic contacts may resolve this problem. Many older appliance units have a 'local control' feature whereby the relay is intentionally bypassed with a high value resistor; the module can then sense the appliance's own switch and turn on the relay when the local switch is operated. This sense current may be incompatible with LED or CFL lamps.\nNot all devices can be used on a dimmer. Fluorescent lamps are not dimmable with incandescent lamp dimmers; certain models of compact fluorescent lamps are dimmable but cost more. Motorized appliances such as fans, etc. generally will not operate as expected on a dimmer.\nWiring and interfering sources.\nOne problem with X10 is excessive attenuation of signals between the two live conductors in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one live conductor may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other live conductor. Often, there's simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer leg wire to the other; this failure may come and go as large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an active repeater device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with a coupling device. A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.\nTelevision receivers or household wireless devices may cause spurious \"off\" or \"on\" signals. Noise filtering (as installed on computers as well as many modern appliances) may help keep external noise out of X10 signals, but noise filters not designed for X10 may also attenuate X10 signals traveling on the branch circuit to which the appliance is connected.\nCertain types of power supplies used in modern electronic equipment, such as computers, television receivers and satellite receivers, attenuate passing X10 signals by providing a low impedance path to high frequency signals. Typically, the capacitors used on the inputs to these power supplies short the X10 signal from line to neutral, suppressing any hope of X10 control on the circuit near that device. Filters are available that will block the X10 signals from ever reaching such devices; plugging offending devices into such filters can cure mysterious X10 intermittent failures.\nHaving a backup power supply or standby power supply such as used with computers or other electronic devices can totally kill that leg in a household installation because of the filtering used in the power supply.\nCommands getting lost.\nX10 signals can only be transmitted one command at a time, first by addressing the device to control, and then sending an operation for that device to perform. If two X10 signals are transmitted at the same time they may collide or interleave, leading to commands that either cannot be decoded or that trigger incorrect operations. The CM15A and RR501 Transceiver can avoid these signal collisions that can sometimes occur with other models.\nLack of speed.\nThe X10 protocol is slow. It takes roughly three quarters of a second to transmit a device address and a command. While generally not noticeable when using a tabletop controller, it becomes a noticeable problem when using 2-way switches or when utilizing some sort of computerized controller. The apparent delay can be lessened somewhat by using slower device dim rates. With more advanced modules another option is to use group control (lighting scene) extended commands. These allow adjusting several modules at once by a single command.\nLimited functionality.\nX10 protocol does support more advanced control over the dimming speed, direct dim level setting and group control (scene settings). This is done via extended message set, which is an official part of X10 standard. However support for all extended messages is not mandatory, and many cheaper modules implement only the basic message set. These require adjusting each lighting circuit one after the other, which can be visually unappealing and also very slow.\nInterference and lack of encryption.\nThe standard X10 power line and RF protocols lack support for encryption, and can only address 256 devices. Unfiltered power line signals from close neighbors using the same X10 device addresses may interfere with each other. Interfering RF wireless signals may similarly be received, with it being easy for anyone nearby with an X10 RF remote to wittingly or unwittingly cause mayhem if an RF to power line device is being used on a premises.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Physically, an electrical cable is an assembly consisting of one or more conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual coverings, assembly protection and protective covering.\nOne or more electrical cables and their corresponding connectors may be formed into a cable assembly, which is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product (e.g. to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with a connector mounted to the housing). Cable assemblies can also take the form of a cable tree or cable harness, used to connect many terminals together.\nUses.\nElectrical cables are used to connect two or more devices, enabling the transfer of electrical signals or power from one device to the other. Long-distance communication takes place over undersea communication cables. Power cables are used for bulk transmission of alternating and direct current power, especially using high-voltage cable. Electrical cables are extensively used in building wiring for lighting, power and control circuits permanently installed in buildings. Since all the circuit conductors required can be installed in a cable at one time, installation labor is saved compared to certain other wiring methods.\nPhysically, an electrical cable is an assembly consisting of one or more conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual coverings, assembly protection and protective coverings. Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. Bunching small wires before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. Copper wires in a cable may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often tin, but sometimes gold, silver or another material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to oxidation than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes soldering easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands. Tinning was used to help removal of rubber insulation. Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA \u2013 as in telephone handset cords).\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, electrical cable was often insulated using cloth, rubber or paper. Plastic materials are generally used today, except for high-reliability power cables. The first thermoplastic used was gutta-percha (a natural latex) which was found useful for underwater cables in the 19th century. The first, and still very common, man-made plastic used for cable insulation was polyethylene. This was invented in 1930, but not available outside military use until after World War 2 during which a telegraph cable using it was laid across the English Channel to support troops following D-Day. \nCables can be securely fastened and organized, such as by using trunking, cable trays, cable ties or cable lacing. Continuous-flex or flexible cables used in moving applications within cable carriers can be secured using strain relief devices or cable ties.\nCharacteristics.\nAny current-carrying conductor, including a cable, radiates an electromagnetic field. Likewise, any conductor or cable will pick up energy from any existing electromagnetic field around it. These effects are often undesirable, in the first case amounting to unwanted transmission of energy which may adversely affect nearby equipment or other parts of the same piece of equipment; and in the second case, unwanted pickup of noise which may mask the desired signal being carried by the cable, or, if the cable is carrying power supply or control voltages, pollute them to such an extent as to cause equipment malfunction.\nThe first solution to these problems is to keep cable lengths in buildings short since pick up and transmission are essentially proportional to the length of the cable. The second solution is to route cables away from trouble. Beyond this, there are particular cable designs that minimize electromagnetic pickup and transmission. Three of the principal design techniques are shielding, coaxial geometry, and twisted-pair geometry.\nShielding makes use of the electrical principle of the Faraday cage. The cable is encased for its entire length in foil or wire mesh. All wires running inside this shielding layer will be to a large extent decoupled from external \"electrical\" fields, particularly if the shield is connected to a point of constant voltage, such as earth or ground. Simple shielding of this type is not greatly effective against low-frequency \"magnetic\" fields, however - such as magnetic \"hum\" from a nearby power transformer. A grounded shield on cables operating at 2.5 kV or more gathers leakage current and capacitive current, protecting people from electric shock and equalizing stress on the cable insulation.\nCoaxial design helps to further reduce low-frequency magnetic transmission and pickup. In this design the foil or mesh shield has a circular cross section and the inner conductor is exactly at its center. This causes the voltages induced by a magnetic field between the shield and the core conductor to consist of two nearly equal magnitudes which cancel each other.\nA twisted pair has two wires of a cable twisted around each other. This can be demonstrated by putting one end of a pair of wires in a hand drill and turning while maintaining moderate tension on the line. Where the interfering signal has a wavelength that is long compared to the pitch of the twisted pair, alternate lengths of wires develop opposing voltages, tending to cancel the effect of the interference.\nFire protection.\nElectrical cable jacket material is usually constructed of flexible plastic which will burn. The fire hazard of grouped cables can be significant. Cables jacketing materials can be formulated to prevent fire spread &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Alternately, fire spread amongst combustible cables can be prevented by the application of fire retardant coatings directly on the cable exterior, or the fire threat can be isolated by the installation of boxes constructed of noncombustible materials around the bulk cable installation.\nTypes.\nCENELEC HD 361 is a ratified standard published by CENELEC, which relates to wire and cable marking type, whose goal is to harmonize cables. Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung (DIN, VDE) has released a similar standard (DIN VDE 0292).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some sources say his son Sweyn Forkbeard forcibly deposed him from his Danish throne before his death.\nName.\nHarald's name is written as runic \"haraltr : kunuk\u0280\" (\u16bc\u16c5\u16b1\u16c5\u16da\u16cf\u16b1 \u16ec \u16b4\u16a2\u16be\u16a2\u16b4\u16e6) in the Jelling stone inscription. In normalized Old Norse, this would correspond to \"Haraldr konungr\", i.e. \"Harald king\". The Latinized name as given in the medieval Danish chronicles is \"Haraldus Gormonis filius\" (Harald, Gorm's son). The given name \"Haraldr\" (also \"Haralldr\") is the equivalent of Old English \"Hereweald\", Old High German \"Heriwald\", from \"hari\" \"army\" and \"wald-\" \"rule\". Harald's name is also inscribed on the so-called Curmsun disc, rediscovered in 2014 (but part of a Viking hoard previously discovered in 1841 in the crypt of the Gro\u00df-Weckow village church in Pomerania, close to the Viking Age stronghold of Jomsborg), as \"+ARALD CVRMSVN + REX AD TANER + SCON + JVMN + CIV ALDIN\", i.e. \"Harald Gormson, king of Danes, Scania, Jumne, [in] Bishopric of Aldinburg\".\nThe first documented appearance of Harald's nickname \"Bluetooth\" (as \"blatan\"; Old Norse \"*bl\u00e1t\u01ebnn\") is in the \"Chronicon Roskildense\" (written c. 1140), alongside the alternative nickname \"Clac Harald\". \"Clac Harald\" appears to be a conflation of Harald Bluetooth with the legendary or semi-legendary Harald Klak, son of Halfdan. The byname is given as \"Blachtent\" and explicitly glossed as \"bluish or black tooth\" (\"dens lividus vel niger\") in a chronicle of the late 12th century, \"Wilhelmi abbatis regum Danorum genealogia\". is that Harald must have had a conspicuous bad tooth that appeared \"blue\" (i.e. \"black\", as \"bl\u00e1r\" \"blue\" meant \"blue-black\", or \"dark-coloured\").\nAnother explanation, proposed by (1997), is that he was called \"blue thane\" (or \"dark thane\") in England (with Anglo-Saxon \"thegn\" corrupted to \"tan\" when the name came back into Old Norse).\nReign.\nDuring his reign, Harald oversaw the reconstruction of the Jelling runic stones, and numerous other public works. The most famous is fortifying the fortress of Aros (nowadays Aarhus) which was situated in a central position in his kingdom in the year 979. Some believe these projects were a way for him to consolidate economic and military control of his country and the main city. Ring forts were built in five strategic locations with Aarhus perfectly in the middle: Trelleborg on Zealand, Borrering in eastern Zealand (the inner construction of this fort is still yet to be established), Nonnebakken on Funen, Fyrkat in Himmerland (northern Jutland) and Aggersborg near Limfjord. All five fortresses had similar designs: \"perfectly circular with gates opening to the four corners of the earth, and a courtyard divided into four areas which held large houses set in a square pattern.\" A sixth \"Trelleborg\" of similar design, located at Borgeby, in Scania, has been dated to about 1000 and may have been built by King Harald and a second fort named Trelleborg is located near the modern town of Trelleborg in Scania in present-day Sweden, but is of older date and thus pre-dates the reign of Harald Bluetooth.\nHe constructed the oldest known bridge in southern Scandinavia, the wide and long Ravning Bridge at Ravning meadows.\nWhile quiet prevailed throughout the interior, he turned his energies to foreign enterprises. He came to the help of Richard the Fearless of Normandy in 945 and 963, while his son conquered Samland, and after the assassination of King Harald Greycloak of Norway, managed to force the people of that country into temporary subjugation to himself.\nThe Norse sagas present Harald in a rather negative light. He was forced twice to submit to the renegade Swedish prince Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong of the Jomsvikings- first by giving Styrbj\u00f6rn a fleet and his daughter Thyra, the second time by giving up himself as hostage, along with yet another fleet. When Styrbj\u00f6rn brought this fleet to Uppsala to claim the throne of Sweden, Harald broke his oath and fled with his Danes to avoid facing the Swedish army at the Battle of F\u00fdrisvellir.\nHarald's Rebellion.\nIn the wake of Otto I's death, Harald attacked Saxony in 973. Otto II counter-attacked Harald in 974, conquering Haithabu, Dannevirke and possibly large parts of Jutland. Harald regained some of the seized territory in 983 when Otto II was defeated by the Saracens.\nAs a consequence of Harald's army having lost to the Germans at the Danevirke in 974, he no longer had control of Norway, and Germans settled back into the border area between Scandinavia and Germany. They were driven out of Denmark in 983 by an alliance of Obodrite soldiers and troops loyal to Harald, but soon after, Harald was killed fighting off a rebellion led by his son Sweyn. He is believed to have died in 986, although several accounts claim 985 as his year of death. According to Adam of Bremen he died in Jumne/Jomsborg from his wounds. His body was brought back to the Trinity Church in Roskilde where he was buried.\nThe Curmsun Disc, found in Gro\u00df-Weckow, Pomerania, (after 1945 Wiejkowo) is inscribed with \"ARALD CVRMSVN\" (Harald Gormson), calling him, in abbreviated Latin, \"king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, town of Aldinburg\". Based on this, Swedish archaeologist Sven Rosborn has proposed that Harald is buried at the church there, close to Jomsborg, in what is now Poland.\nFrom 1835 to 1977, it was wrongly believed that Harald ordered the death of the Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman, a bog body previously thought to be Gunnhild, Mother of Kings until radiocarbon dating proved otherwise.\nThe Hiddensee treasure, a large trove of gold objects, was found in 1873 on the German island of Hiddensee in the Baltic Sea. It is believed that these objects belonged to Harald's family.\nHarald introduced the first nationwide coinage in Denmark.\nConversion to Christianity.\nKing Harald's conversion to Christianity is a contested bit of history, not least because medieval writers such as Widukind of Corvey and Adam of Bremen give conflicting accounts of how it came about.\nWidukind of Corvey, writing during the lives of King Harald and Otto I (ruled 962\u2013973), claims that Harald was converted by a \"cleric by the name of Poppa\" who, when asked by Harald to prove his faith in Christ, carried a \"great weight\" of iron heated by a fire without being burned. According to 12th-century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in his work \"Gesta Danorum\", Poppa performed his miracle for Harald's son Sweyn Forkbeard after Sweyn had second thoughts about his own baptism. Harald himself converted to Catholicism after a peace agreement with the Holy Roman Emperor (either Otto I or II).\nAdam of Bremen, writing 100 years after King Harald's death in \"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen\", finished in 1076, describes Harald being forcibly converted by Otto I, after a defeat in battle. However, Widukind does not mention such an event in his contemporary \"Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres\" or \"Deeds of the Saxons\". Some 250 years after the event, the \"Heimskringla\" relates that Harald was converted with Earl Haakon, by Otto II (ruled 973 \u2013 983).\nA cleric named Poppo or Poppa, perhaps the same one, also appears in Adam of Bremen's history, but in connection with Eric of Sweden, who had supposedly conquered Denmark (the fact that Eric conquered Denmark during the realm of Sweyn Forkbeard is explained by Saxo as a punishment of Sweyn's apostasy). The story of this otherwise unknown Poppo or Poppa's miracle and baptism of Harald is also depicted on the gilded altar piece in the Church of Tamdrup in Denmark (see image at top of this article). The altar itself dates to about 1200. Adam of Bremen's claim regarding Otto I and Harald appears to have been inspired by an attempt to manufacture a historical reason for the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen to claim jurisdiction over Denmark (and thus the rest of Scandinavia); in the 1070s, the Danish king was in Rome asking for Denmark to have its own arch-bishop, and Adam's account of Harald's supposed conversion (and baptism of both him and his \"little son\" Sweyn, with Otto serving as Sweyn's godfather) is followed by the unambiguous claim that \"At that time Denmark on this side of the sea, which is called Jutland by the inhabitants, was divided into three dioceses and subjected to the bishopric of Hamburg.\"\nAs noted above, Harald's father, Gorm the Old, had died in 958, and had been buried in a mound with many goods, after the pagan practice. The mound itself was from c. 500 BCE, but Harald had it built higher over his father's grave, and added a second mound to the south. Mound-building was a newly revived custom in the 10th century, perceivably as an \"appeal to old traditions in the face of Christian customs spreading from Denmark's southern neighbors, the Germans\".\nAfter his conversion, around the 960s, Harald had his father's body reburied in the church next to the now empty mound. He had the Jelling stones erected to honour his parents.

{"id": "42423", "revid": "6032993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42423", "title": "Monetarism", "text": "School of thought in monetary economics\nMonetarism is a school of thought in monetary economics that emphasizes the role of policy-makers in controlling the amount of money in circulation. It gained prominence in the 1970s, but was mostly abandoned as a direct guidance to monetary policy during the following decade because of the rise of inflation targeting through movements of the official interest rate.\nThe monetarist theory states that variations in the money supply have major influences on national output in the short run and on price levels over longer periods. Monetarists assert that the objectives of monetary policy are best met by targeting the growth rate of the money supply rather than by engaging in discretionary monetary policy. Monetarism is commonly associated with neoliberalism.\nMonetarism is mainly associated with the work of Milton Friedman, who was an influential opponent of Keynesian economics, criticising Keynes's theory of fighting economic downturns using fiscal policy (e.g. government spending). Friedman and Anna Schwartz wrote an influential book, \"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960\", and argued that inflation is \"always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\".\nAlthough opposed to the existence of the Federal Reserve, Friedman advocated, given its existence, a central bank policy aimed at keeping the growth of the money supply at a rate commensurate with the growth in productivity and demand for goods. Money growth targeting was mostly abandoned by the central banks who tried it, however. Contrary to monetarist thinking, the relation between money growth and inflation proved to be far from tight. Instead, starting in the early 1990s, most major central banks turned to direct inflation targeting, relying on steering short-run interest rates as their main policy instrument. Afterwards, monetarism was subsumed into the new neoclassical synthesis which appeared in macroeconomics around 2000.\nDescription.\nMonetarism is an economic theory that focuses on the macroeconomic effects of the supply of money and central banking. Formulated by Milton Friedman, it argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently inflationary, and that monetary authorities should focus solely on maintaining price stability.\nMonetarist theory draws its roots from the quantity theory of money, a centuries-old economic theory which had been put forward by various economists, among them Irving Fisher and Alfred Marshall, before Friedman restated it in 1956.\nMonetary history of the United States.\nMonetarists argued that central banks sometimes caused major unexpected fluctuations in the money supply. Friedman asserted that actively trying to stabilize demand through monetary policy changes can have negative unintended consequences. In part he based this view on the historical analysis of monetary policy, \"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960\", which he coauthored with Anna Schwartz in 1963. The book attributed inflation to excess money supply generated by a central bank. It attributed deflationary spirals to the reverse effect of a failure of a central bank to support the money supply during a liquidity crunch. In particular, the authors argued that the Great Depression of the 1930s was caused by a massive contraction of the money supply (they deemed it \"the Great Contraction\"), and not by the lack of investment that Keynes had argued. They also maintained that post-war inflation was caused by an over-expansion of the money supply. They made famous the assertion of monetarism that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\"\nFixed monetary rule.\nFriedman proposed a fixed \"monetary rule\", called Friedman's k-percent rule, where the money supply would be automatically increased by a fixed percentage per year. The rate should equal the growth rate of real GDP, leaving the price level unchanged. For instance, if the economy is expected to grow at 2 percent in a given year, the Fed should allow the money supply to increase by 2 percent. Because discretionary monetary policy would be as likely to destabilise as to stabilise the economy, Friedman advocated that the Fed be bound to fixed rules in conducting its policy.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such monetary rules may depend critically on how money is measured and incorporated into macroeconomic models. Traditional simple-sum monetary aggregates, which treat all monetary assets as perfect substitutes, may provide misleading signals for monetary policy, particularly during periods of financial innovation. Studies using theoretically-grounded Divisia monetary aggregates have found more stable relationships between money growth, inflation expectations, and economic activity, suggesting that properly measured money can provide clearer guidance for monetary policy implementation. Moreover, incorporating money into forward-looking macroeconomic models with proper measurement can enhance the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and improve the effectiveness of rules-based approaches.\nOpposition to the gold standard.\nMost monetarists oppose the gold standard. Friedman viewed a pure gold standard as impractical. For example, whereas one of the benefits of the gold standard is that the intrinsic limitations to the growth of the money supply by the use of gold would prevent inflation, if the growth of population or increase in trade outpaces the money supply, there would be no way to counteract deflation and reduced liquidity (and any attendant recession) except for the mining of more gold. But he also admitted that if a government was willing to surrender control over its monetary policy and not to interfere with economic activities, a gold-based economy would be possible.\nRise.\nClark Warburton is credited with making the first solid empirical case for the monetarist interpretation of business fluctuations in a series of papers from 1945.p.\u00a0493 Within mainstream economics, the rise of monetarism started with Milton Friedman's 1956 restatement of the quantity theory of money. Friedman argued that the demand for money could be described as depending on a small number of economic variables.\nThus, according to Friedman, when the money supply expanded, people would not simply wish to hold the extra money in idle money balances; i.e., if they were in equilibrium before the increase, they were already holding money balances to suit their requirements, and thus after the increase they would have money balances surplus to their requirements. These excess money balances would therefore be spent and hence aggregate demand would rise. Similarly, if the money supply were reduced people would want to replenish their holdings of money by reducing their spending. In this, Friedman challenged a simplification attributed to Keynes suggesting that \"money does not matter.\" Thus the word 'monetarist' was coined.\nThe popularity of monetarism picked up in political circles when the prevailing view of neo-Keynesian economics seemed unable to explain the contradictory problems of rising unemployment and inflation in response to the Nixon shock in 1971 and the oil shocks of 1973. On one hand, higher unemployment seemed to call for reflation, but on the other hand rising inflation seemed to call for disinflation. The social-democratic post-war consensus that had prevailed in first world countries was thus called into question by the rising neoliberal political forces.\nMonetarism in the US and the UK.\nIn 1979, United States President Jimmy Carter appointed as Federal Reserve Chief Paul Volcker, who made fighting inflation his primary objective, and who restricted the money supply (in accordance with the Friedman rule) to tame inflation in the economy. The result was a major rise in interest rates, not only in the United States; but worldwide. The \"Volcker shock\" continued from 1979 to the summer of 1982, decreasing inflation and increasing unemployment.\nIn May 1979, Margaret Thatcher, Leader of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, won the general election, defeating the sitting Labour Government led by James Callaghan. By that time, the UK had endured several years of severe inflation, which was rarely below the 10% mark and stood at 10.3% by the time of the election. Thatcher implemented monetarism as the weapon in her battle against inflation, and succeeded at reducing it to 4.6% by 1983. However, unemployment in the United Kingdom increased from 5.7% in 1979 to 12.2% in 1983, reaching 13.0% in 1982; starting with the first quarter of 1980, the UK economy contracted in terms of real gross domestic product for six straight quarters.\nDecline.\nMonetarist ascendancy was brief, however. The period when major central banks focused on targeting the growth of money supply, reflecting monetarist theory, lasted only for a few years, in the US from 1979 to 1982. \nThe money supply is useful as a policy target only if the relationship between money and nominal GDP, and therefore inflation, is stable and predictable. This implies that the velocity of money must be predictable. In the 1970s velocity had seemed to increase at a fairly constant rate, but in the 1980s and 1990s velocity became highly unstable, experiencing unpredictable periods of increases and declines. Consequently, the stable correlation between the money supply and nominal GDP broke down, and the usefulness of the monetarist approach came into question. Many economists who had been convinced by monetarism in the 1970s abandoned the approach after this experience. \nThe changing velocity originated in shifts in the demand for money and created serious problems for the central banks. This provoked a thorough rethinking of monetary policy. In the early 1990s central banks started focusing on targeting inflation directly using the short-run interest rate as their central policy variable, abandoning earlier emphasis on money growth. The new strategy proved successful, and today most major central banks follow a flexible inflation targeting.\nLegacy.\nEven though monetarism failed in practical policy, and the close attention to money growth which was at the heart of monetarist analysis is rejected by most economists today, some aspects of monetarism have found their way into modern mainstream economic thinking. Among them are the belief that controlling inflation should be a primary responsibility of the central bank. It is also widely recognized that monetary policy, as well as fiscal policy, can affect output in the short run. In this way, important monetarist thoughts have been subsumed into the new neoclassical synthesis or consensus view of macroeconomics that emerged in the 2000s.\nNotable proponents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42424", "revid": "12712128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42424", "title": "Treblinka extermination camp", "text": "Nazi extermination camp in Poland (1942\u20131943)\nTreblinka (; ) was the second-deadliest extermination camp to be built and operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II. It was in a forest north-east of Warsaw, south of the village of Treblinka in what is now the Masovian Voivodeship. The camp operated between 23 July 1942 and 19 October 1943 as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Final Solution. During this time, it is estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews were murdered in its gas chambers, along with 2,000 Romani people. More Jews were murdered at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz-Birkenau.\nManaged by the German SS with assistance from Trawniki guards \u2013 recruited from among Soviet POWs to serve with the Germans \u2013 the camp consisted of two separate units. Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp (\"Arbeitslager\") whose prisoners worked in the gravel pit or irrigation area and in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the cremation pits. Between 1941 and 1944, more than half of its 20,000 inmates were murdered via shootings, hunger, disease and mistreatment.\nThe second camp, Treblinka II, was an extermination camp (\"Vernichtungslager\"), referred to euphemistically as the \"SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka\" by the Nazis. A small number of Jewish men who were not murdered immediately upon arrival became members of its \"Sonderkommando\" whose jobs included being forced to bury the victims' bodies in mass graves. These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres along with the bodies of new victims. Gassing operations at Treblinka II ended in October 1943 following a revolt by the prisoners in early August. Several Trawniki guards were killed and 200 prisoners escaped from the camp; almost a hundred survived the subsequent pursuit. The camp was dismantled in late 1943. A farmhouse for a watchman was built on the site and the ground ploughed over in an attempt to hide the evidence of genocide.\nIn the postwar Polish People's Republic, the government bought most of the land where the camp had stood, and built a large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962. In 1964, Treblinka was declared a national monument of Jewish martyrdom in a ceremony at the site of the former gas chambers. In the same year, the first German trials were held regarding the crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of communism in Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.\nBackground.\nFollowing the invasion of Poland in 1939, most of the 3.5\u00a0million Polish Jews were rounded up and confined to newly established ghettos by the Nazis. The system was intended to isolate the Jews from the outside world in order to facilitate their exploitation and abuse. The supply of food was inadequate, living conditions were cramped and unsanitary, and Jews had no way to earn money. Malnutrition and lack of medicine led to soaring mortality rates. In 1941, the initial victories of the Wehrmacht over the Soviet Union inspired plans for the German colonisation of occupied Poland, including all territory within the new district of General Government. At the Wannsee Conference held near Berlin on 20 January 1942, new plans were outlined for the genocide of Jews, known as the \"Final Solution\" to the Jewish Question. The extermination programme was codenamed Operation Reinhard. and was separate from the \"Einsatzgruppen\" mass-murder operations in Eastern Europe, in which half a million Jews had already been murdered.\nTreblinka was one of three secret extermination camps set up for Operation Reinhard; the other two were Be\u0142\u017cec and Sobib\u00f3r. All three were equipped with gas chambers disguised as shower rooms, for the murder of entire transports of people. The method was established following a pilot project of mobile extermination conducted at Soldau and at Che\u0142mno extermination camp that began operating in 1941 and used gas vans. Che\u0142mno (German: \"Kulmhof\") was a testing ground for the establishment of faster methods of murdering and incinerating bodies. It was not a part of Reinhard, which was marked by the construction of stationary facilities for mass murder. Treblinka was the third extermination camp of Operation Reinhard to be built, following Be\u0142\u017cec and Sobib\u00f3r, and incorporated lessons learned from their construction.&lt;ref name=\"Arad-1984/pdf\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Reinhard camps, mass-murder facilities using Zyklon B were developed at the Majdanek concentration camp in March 1942, and at Auschwitz II-Birkenau between March and June.\nNazi plans to murder Polish Jews from across the General Government during \"Aktion Reinhard\" were overseen in occupied Poland by Odilo Globocnik, a deputy of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, in Berlin. The Operation Reinhard camps reported directly to Himmler. The staff of Operation Reinhard, most of whom had been involved in the Action T4 \"involuntary euthanasia\" programme, used T4 as a framework for the construction of new facilities. Most of the Jews who were murdered in the Reinhard camps came from ghettos.\nThe Operation Reinhard camps reported directly to Himmler, and not to the concentration camps inspector Richard Gl\u00fccks.\nLocation.\nThe two parallel camps of Treblinka were built northeast of Warsaw. Before World War II, it was the location of a gravel mining enterprise for the production of concrete, connected to most of the major cities in central Poland by the Ma\u0142kinia\u2013Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski railway junction and the Treblinka village station. The mine was owned and operated by the Polish industrialist Marian \u0141opuszy\u0144ski, who added the new railway track to the existing line. When the German SS took over Treblinka I, the quarry was already equipped with heavy machinery that was ready to use. Treblinka was well-connected but isolated enough, halfway between some of the largest Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe, including the Warsaw Ghetto and the Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto, the capital of the newly formed Bialystok District. The Warsaw Ghetto had 500,000 Jewish inmates, and the Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto had about 60,000.\nTreblinka was divided into two separate camps apart. Two engineering firms, the Sch\u00f6nbronn Company of Leipzig and the Warsaw branch of Schmidt\u2013M\u00fcnstermann, oversaw the construction of both camps. Between 1942 and 1943, the extermination centre was further redeveloped with a crawler excavator. New gas chambers constructed of brick and cement mortar were freshly erected, and mass cremation pyres were also introduced. The perimeter was enlarged to provide a buffer zone, making it impossible to approach the camp from the outside. The number of trains caused panic among the residents of nearby settlements. They would likely have been killed if caught near the railway tracks.\nTreblinka I.\nOpened on 1 September 1941 as a forced-labour camp (\"Arbeitslager\"), Treblinka I replaced an \"ad hoc\" company established in June 1941 by Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Ernst Gramss. A new barracks and barbed wire fencing high were erected in late 1941. To obtain the workforce for Treblinka I, civilians were sent to the camp \"en masse\" for real or imagined offences, and sentenced to hard labour by the Gestapo office in Soko\u0142\u00f3w, which was headed by Gramss. The average length of a sentence was six months, but many prisoners had their sentences extended indefinitely. Twenty thousand people passed through Treblinka I during its three-year existence. About half of them were murdered there via exhaustion, hunger and disease. Those who survived were released after serving their sentences; these were generally Poles from nearby villages.\nAt any given time, Treblinka I had a workforce of 1,000\u20132,000 prisoners, most of whom worked 12- to 14-hour shifts in the large quarry and later also harvested wood from the nearby forest as fuel for the open-air crematoria in Treblinka II. There were German, Czech and French Jews among them, as well as Poles captured in \"\u0142apankas\", farmers unable to deliver food requisitions, hostages trapped by chance, and people who attempted to harbour Jews outside the Jewish ghettos or who performed restricted actions without permits. Beginning in July 1942, Jews and non-Jews were separated. Women mainly worked in the sorting barracks, where they repaired and cleaned military clothing delivered by freight trains, while most of the men worked at the gravel mine. There were no work uniforms, and inmates who lost their own shoes were forced to go barefoot or scavenge them from dead prisoners. Water was rationed, and punishments were regularly delivered at roll-calls. From December 1943 the inmates were no longer carrying any specific sentences. The camp operated officially until 23 July 1944, when the imminent arrival of Soviet forces led to its abandonment.\nDuring its entire operation, Treblinka I's commandant was \"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Theodor van Eupen. He ran the camp with several SS men and almost 100 \"Hiwi\" guards. The quarry, spread over an area of , supplied road construction material for German military use and was part of the strategic road-building programme in the war with the Soviet Union. It was equipped with a mechanical digger for shared use by both Treblinka I and II. Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Z\u0105becki, the local station master, Eupen often murdered prisoners by \"taking shots at them, as if they were partridges\". A widely feared overseer was \"Untersturmf\u00fchrer\" Franz Schwarz, who killed prisoners with a pickaxe or hammer.\nTreblinka II.\nTreblinka II (officially the \"SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka\") was divided into three parts: Camp 1 was the administrative compound where the guards lived, Camp 2 was the receiving area where incoming transports of prisoners were offloaded, and Camp 3 was the location of the gas chambers. All three parts were built by two groups of German Jews recently expelled from Berlin and Hanover and imprisoned at the Warsaw Ghetto (a total of 238 men from 17 to 35 years of age). \"Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer\" Richard Thomalla, the head of construction, brought in German Jews because they could speak German. Construction began on 10 April 1942, when Be\u0142\u017cec and Sobib\u00f3r were already in operation. The entire death camp, which was either or in size (sources vary), was surrounded by two rows of barbed-wire fencing high. This fence was later woven with pine tree branches to obstruct the view of the camp from outside. More Jews were brought in from surrounding settlements to work on the new railway ramp within the Camp 2 receiving area, which was ready by June 1942.\nThe first section of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the \"Wohnlager\" administrative and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named \"Seidel Stra\u00dfe\" after \"Unterscharf\u00fchrer\" Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski, and Kos\u00f3w Lacki. There were a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos, known as \"Sonderkommandos\". \"SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer\" Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, containing two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (introduced in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and for woodworking and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian women who served, cleaned, and worked in the kitchen.\nThe next section of Treblinka II (Camp 2, also called the lower camp or \"Auffanglager\"), was the receiving area where the railway unloading ramp extended from the Treblinka line into the camp. There was a long and narrow platform surrounded by barbed-wire fencing. A new building, erected on the platform, was disguised as a railway station complete with a wooden clock and fake rail terminal signs. SS-\"Scharf\u00fchrer\" Josef Hirtreiter, who worked on the unloading ramp was known for being especially cruel; he grabbed crying toddlers by their feet and smashed their heads against wagons. Behind a second fence, about from the track, there were two large barracks used for undressing, with a cashier's booth where money and jewelry were collected, ostensibly for safekeeping. Jews who resisted were taken away or beaten to death by the guards. The area where the women and children were shorn of their hair was on the other side of the path from the men. All buildings in the lower camp, including the barber barracks, contained the piled up clothing and belongings of the prisoners. Behind the station building, further to the right, there was a Sorting Square where all baggage was first collected by the \"Lumpenkommando\". It was flanked by a fake infirmary called \"Lazarett\", with the Red Cross sign on it. It was a small barracks surrounded by barbed wire, where the sick, old, wounded and \"difficult\" prisoners were taken. Directly behind the \"Lazarett\" shack, there was an open excavation pit seven metres (23\u00a0ft) deep. These prisoners were led to the edge of the pit and shot one at a time by \"Blockf\u00fchrer\" Willi Mentz, nicknamed \"Frankenstein\" by the inmates. Mentz single-handedly killed thousands of Jews, aided by his supervisor, August Miete, who was called the \"Angel of Death\" by the prisoners. The pit was also used to burn old worn-out clothes and identity papers deposited by new arrivals at the undressing area.\nThe third section of Treblinka II (Camp 3, also called the upper camp) was the main killing zone, with gas chambers at its centre. It was completely screened from the railway tracks by an earth bank built with the help of a mechanical digger. This mound was elongated in shape, similar to a retaining wall, and can be seen in a sketch produced during the 1970 trial of Treblinka II commandant Franz Stangl. On the other sides, the zone was camouflaged from new arrivals like the rest of the camp, using tree branches woven into barbed wire fences by the \"Tarnungskommando\" (the work detail led out to collect them). From the undressing barracks, a fenced-off path led through the forested area to the gas chambers. The SS cynically called it \"die Himmelstra\u00dfe\" (\"the road to heaven\") or \"der Schlauch\" (\"the tube\"). For the first eight months of the camp's operation, the excavator was used to dig burial ditches on both sides of the gas chambers; these ditches were long, wide, and deep. In early 1943, they were replaced with cremation pyres up to long, with rails laid across the pits on concrete blocks. The 300 prisoners who operated the upper camp lived in separate barracks behind the gas chambers.\nKilling process.\nUnlike Nazi concentration camps in which prisoners were used as forced labour, extermination camps such as Treblinka had only one function: to murder those sent there. To prevent incoming victims from realising its nature, Treblinka II was disguised as a transit camp for deportations further east, complete with fake train schedules, a fake train-station clock with hands painted on it, names of destinations, a fake ticket window, and the sign \"Ober Majdan\", a code word for Treblinka commonly used to deceive prisoners arriving from Western Europe. Majdan was a prewar landed estate away from the camp.\nPolish Jews.\nThe mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 with the first transportation of 6,000 people. The gas chambers began to be operated the following morning. For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued daily, via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the \"Bahnhofskommando\" squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS-\"Brigadef\u00fchrer\" J\u00fcrgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.\nThe Polish railway was very heavily used. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours on top of internal traffic already in 1941. The Holocaust trains' passage to their destination was routinely delayed; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners were murdered by exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases, such as the Bia\u0142a Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a distance, up to 90 percent of people were already dead when the sealed doors were opened. From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief verbal announcement. An earlier signboard with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient. The deportees were told that they had arrived at a transit point on the way to Ukraine and needed to shower and have their clothes disinfected before receiving work uniforms and new orders.\nForeign Jews and Romani people.\nTreblinka received transports of almost 20,000 foreign Jews between October 1942 and March 1943, including 8,000 from the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia via Theresienstadt, and over 11,000 from Bulgarian-occupied Thrace, Macedonia, and Pirot following an agreement with the Nazi-allied Bulgarian government. They had train tickets and arrived predominantly in passenger carriages with considerable luggage, travel foods and drinks, all of which were taken by the SS to the food storage barracks. The provisions included such items as smoked mutton, speciality breads, wine, cheese, fruit, tea, coffee, and sweets. Unlike Polish Jews arriving in Holocaust trains from nearby ghettos in cities like Warsaw, Radom, and those of \"Bezirk Bialystok\", the foreign Jews received a warm welcome upon arrival from an SS man (either Otto Stadie or Willy M\u00e4tzig), after which they were murdered like the others. Treblinka was mainly used for the murder of Polish Jews, Be\u0142\u017cec was used to murder Jews from Austria and the Sudetenland, and Sobib\u00f3r was used to murder Jews from France and the Netherlands. Auschwitz-Birkenau was used to murder Jews from almost every other country in Europe. The frequency of arriving transports slowed down in winter.\nThe decoupled locomotive went back to the Treblinka station or to the layover yard in Ma\u0142kinia for the next load, while the victims were pulled from the carriages onto the platform by \"Kommando Blau\", one of the Jewish work details forced to assist the Germans at the camp. They were led through the gate amidst chaos and screaming. They were separated by gender behind the gate; women were pushed into the undressing barracks and barber on the left, and men were sent to the right. All were ordered to tie their shoes together and strip. Some kept their own towels. The Jews who resisted were taken to the \"Lazarett\", also called the \"Red Cross infirmary\", and shot behind it. Women had their hair cut off; therefore, it took longer to prepare them for the gas chambers than men. The hair was used in the manufacture of socks for U-boat crews and hair-felt footwear for the \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\".\nMost of those murdered at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 Romani people were also murdered there. Like the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up and sent to the ghettos. At a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be deported to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. As with the Jews, most Romani who went to Treblinka were murdered in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, or Treblinka to be murdered; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were shot on the spot. There were no known Romani escapees or survivors from Treblinka.\nGas chambers.\nAfter undressing, newly arrived Jews were beaten with whips to drive them towards the gas chambers; hesitant men were treated particularly brutally. Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the commandant at Auschwitz, contrasted the practice at Treblinka of deceiving the victims about the showers with his own camp's practice of telling them they had to go through a \"delousing\" process. According to the postwar testimony of some SS officers, men were always gassed first, while women and children waited outside the gas chambers for their turn. During this time, the women and children could hear the sounds of suffering from inside the chambers, and they became aware of what awaited them, which caused panic, distress, and even involuntary defecation.\nMany survivors of the Treblinka camp testified that an officer known as 'Ivan the Terrible' was responsible for operating the gas chambers in 1942 and 1943. While Jews were awaiting their fate outside the gas chambers, Ivan the Terrible allegedly tortured, beat, and murdered many of them. Survivors witnessed Ivan beat victims' heads open with a pipe, cut victims with a sword or a bayonet, cut off noses and ears, and gouge out eyes. One survivor testified that Ivan murdered an infant by bashing it against a wall; another claimed that he raped a young girl before cutting her abdomen open and letting her bleed to death.\nThe gas chambers were completely enclosed by a high wooden fence. Originally, they consisted of three interconnected barracks long and wide, disguised as showers. They had double walls insulated by earth packed down in between. The interior walls and ceilings were lined with roofing paper. The floors were covered with tin-plated sheet metal, the same material used for the roof. Solid wooden doors were insulated with rubber and bolted from the outside by heavy cross-bars.\nAccording to Stangl, a train transport of about 3,000 people could be \"processed\" in three hours. In a 14-hour workday, 12,000 to 15,000 people were murdered. After the new gas chambers were built, the duration of the killing process was reduced to an hour and a half. The victims were murdered via gas, using the exhaust fumes conducted through pipes from an engine of a Red Army tank. SS-\"Scharf\u00fchrer\" Erich Fuchs was responsible for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS at the time of the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of \"Sonderkommandos\", placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Ma\u0142kinia, or W\u00f3lka Okr\u0105glik.\nBetween August and September 1942, a large new building with a concrete foundation was built from bricks and mortar under the guidance of Erwin Lambert, who had supervised the construction of gas chambers for the Action T4 involuntary euthanasia program. It contained 8\u201310 gas chambers, each of which was , and it had a corridor in the centre. Stangl supervised its construction and brought in building materials from the nearby village of Ma\u0142kinia by dismantling factory stock. During this time victims continued to arrive daily and were led naked past the building site to the original gas chambers. The new gas chambers became operational after five weeks of construction, equipped with two fume-producing engines instead of one. The metal doors, which had been taken from Soviet military bunkers around Bia\u0142ystok, had portholes through which it was possible to observe the dead before removing them. Stangl said that the old gas chambers were capable of murdering 3,000 people in three hours. The new ones had the highest possible capacity of any gas chambers in the three Reinhard death camps and could murder up to 22,000 or 25,000 people every day, a fact which Globocnik once boasted about to Kurt Gerstein, a fellow SS officer from Disinfection Services. The new gas chambers were seldom used to their full capacity; 12,000\u201315,000 victims remained the daily average.\nThe killing process at Treblinka differed significantly from the method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobib\u00f3r, and Be\u0142\u017cec, the victims were murdered by suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning from engine exhaust in stationary gas chambers. At Che\u0142mno, they were carried within two specially equipped and engineered trucks, driven at a scientifically calculated speed so as to murder the Jews inside it during the trip, rather than force the drivers and guards to murder them at the destination. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when the doors of the gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the victims were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the \"Sonderkommandos\" later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.\nCremation pits.\nThe Germans became aware of the political danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943 after they discovered the graves of Polish victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre carried out by the Soviets near Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial. The Germans formed the Katyn Commission to prove that the Soviets were solely responsible, and used radio broadcast and newsfilm to alert the Allies to this war crime. Subsequently, the Nazi leadership, concerned about covering up their own crimes, issued the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at death camps and burn them. The cremations began shortly after Himmler's visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.\nTo incinerate bodies, large cremation pits were constructed at Camp 3 within Treblinka II. The burning pyres were used to cremate the new corpses along with the old ones, which had to be dug up as they had been buried during the first six months of the camp's operation. Built under the instructions of Herbert Flo\u00df, the camp's cremation expert, the pits consisted of railroad rails laid as grates on blocks of concrete. The bodies were placed on rails over wood, splashed with petrol, and burned. It was a harrowing sight, according to Jankiel Wiernik, with the bellies of pregnant women exploding from boiling amniotic fluid. He wrote that \"the heat radiating from the pits was maddening.\" The bodies burned for five hours, without the ashing of bones. The pyres operated 24 hours a day. Once the system had been perfected, 10,000\u201312,000 bodies at a time could be incinerated.\nThe open air burn pits were located east of the new gas chambers and refuelled from 4\u00a0a.m. (or after 5\u00a0a.m. depending on work-load) to 6\u00a0p.m. in roughly 5-hour intervals. The current camp memorial includes a flat grave marker resembling one of them. It is constructed from melted basalt and has a concrete foundation. It is a symbolic grave, as the Nazis spread the actual human ashes, mixed with sand, over an area of .\nOrganization of the camp.\nThe camp was operated by 20\u201325 German and Austrian members of the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\" and 80\u2013120 \"Wachm\u00e4nner\" (\"watchmen\") guards who had been trained at a special SS facility in the Trawniki concentration camp near Lublin, Poland; all \"Wachm\u00e4nner\" guards were trained at Trawniki. The guards were mainly ethnic German \"Volksdeutsche\" from the east and Ukrainians, with some Russians, Tatars, Moldovans, Latvians, and Central Asians, all of whom had served in the Red Army. They were enlisted by Karl Streibel, the commander of the Trawniki camp, from the prisoner of war (POW) camps for Soviet soldiers. The degree to which their recruitment was voluntary remains disputed; while conditions in the camps for Soviet POWs were dreadful, some Soviet POWs collaborated with the Germans even before cold, hunger, and disease began devastating the POW camps in mid-September 1941.\nThe work at Treblinka was carried out under threat of death by Jewish prisoners organised into specialised work details. At the Camp 2 \"Auffanglager\" receiving area each squad had a different coloured triangle. The triangles made it impossible for new arrivals to try to blend in with members of the work details. The blue unit (\"Kommando Blau\") managed the rail ramp and unlocked the freight wagons. They met the new arrivals, carried out people who had died en route, removed bundles, and cleaned the wagon floors. The red unit (\"Kommando Rot\"), which was the largest squad, unpacked and sorted the belongings of victims after they had been \"processed\". The red unit delivered these belongings to the storage barracks, which were managed by the yellow unit (\"Kommando Gelb\"), who separated the items by quality, removed the Star of David from all outer garments, and extracted any money sewn into the linings. The yellow unit was followed by the \"Desinfektionskommando\", who disinfected the belongings, including sacks of hair from women who had been murdered there. The \"Goldjuden\" unit (\"gold Jews\") collected and counted banknotes and evaluated the gold and jewellery.\nA different group of about 300 men, called the \"Totenjuden\" (\"Jews for the dead\"), lived and worked in Camp 3 across from the gas chambers. For the first six months they took the corpses away for burial after gold teeth had been extracted. Once cremation began in early 1943 they took the corpses to the pits, refuelled the pyres, crushed the remaining bones with mallets, and collected the ashes for disposal. Each trainload of \"deportees\" brought to Treblinka consisted of an average of sixty heavily guarded wagons. They were divided into three sets of twenty at the layover yard. Each set was processed within the first two hours of backing onto the ramp, and was then made ready by the \"Sonderkommandos\" to be exchanged for the next set of twenty wagons.\nMembers of all work units were continuously beaten by the guards and often shot. Replacements were selected from the new arrivals. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the \"Holzf\u00e4llerkommando\" (\"woodcutter unit\") cut and chopped firewood, and the \"Tarnungskommando\" (\"disguise unit\") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 \"Wohnlager\" residential compound contained barracks for about 700 \"Sonderkommandos\" which, when combined with the 300 \"Totenjuden\" living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.\nMany \"Sonderkommando\" prisoners hanged themselves at night. Suicides in the \"Totenjuden\" barracks occurred at the rate of 15 to 20 per day. The work crews were almost entirely replaced every few days; members of the old work detail were murdered except for the most resilient.\nTreblinka prisoner uprising.\nIn early 1943, an underground Jewish resistance organisation was formed at Treblinka with the goal of seizing control of the camp and escaping to freedom. The planned revolt was preceded by a long period of secret preparations. The clandestine unit was first organised by a former Jewish captain of the Polish Army, Dr. Julian Chor\u0105\u017cycki, who was described by fellow plotter Samuel Rajzman as noble and essential to the action. His organising committee included Zelomir Bloch (leadership), Rudolf Masaryk, Marceli Galewski, Samuel Rajzman, Dr. Irena Lewkowska (\"Irka\", from the sick bay for the \"Hiwis\"), Leon Haberman, Chaim Sztajer, Hershl (Henry) Sperling from Cz\u0119stochowa, and several others. Chor\u0105\u017cycki (who treated the German patients) killed himself with poison on 19 April 1943 when faced with imminent capture, so that the Germans could not discover the plot by torturing him. The next leader was another former Polish Army officer, Dr. Berek Lajcher, who arrived on 1 May. Born in Cz\u0119stochowa, he had practised medicine in Wyszk\u00f3w and was expelled by the Nazis to Wegr\u00f3w in 1939.\nThe date of the revolt was initially set for 15 June 1943, but it had to be postponed. A fighter smuggled a grenade in one of the early May trains carrying captured rebels from the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which had begun on 19 April 1943. When he detonated it in the undressing area, the SS and guards were thrown into a panic. After the explosion, Treblinka received only about 7,000 Jews from the capital for fear of similar incidents; the remaining 42,000 Warsaw Jews were deported to Majdanek instead. The burning of unearthed corpses continued at full speed until the end of July. The Treblinka II conspirators became increasingly concerned about their future as the amount of work for them began to decline. With fewer transports arriving, they realised \"they were next in line for the gas chambers.\"\nDay of the revolt and survivors.\nThe uprising was launched on the hot summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), when a group of Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20\u201325 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45\u00a0p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian \"Trawnikis\" resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the \"Armia Krajowa\" (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived until the end of the war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.\nAmong the Jewish prisoners who escaped after setting fire to the camp, there were two 19-year-olds, Samuel Willenberg and Kalman Taigman, who had both arrived in 1942 and had been forced to work there under the threat of death. Taigman died in 2012 and Willenberg in 2016. Taigman stated of his experience, \"It was hell, absolutely hell. A normal man cannot imagine how a living person could have lived through it \u2013 killers, natural-born killers, who without a trace of remorse just murdered every little thing.\" Willenberg and Taigman emigrated to Israel after the war and devoted their last years to retelling the story of Treblinka. Escapees Hershl Sperling and Richard Glazar both suffered from survivor guilt syndrome and eventually killed themselves. Chaim Sztajer, who was 34 at the time of the uprising, had survived 11 months as a \"Sonderkommando\" in Treblinka II and was instrumental in the coordination of the uprising between the two camps. Following his escape in the uprising, Sztajer survived for over a year in the forest before the liberation of Poland. Following the war, he migrated to Israel and then to Melbourne, Australia where later in life he constructed from memory a model of Treblinka which is currently displayed at the Jewish Holocaust Centre in Melbourne.\nAfter the uprising.\nAfter the revolt, Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) murdered, there would have been little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.\nThe camp's new commandant Kurt Franz, formerly its deputy commandant, took over in August. After the war he testified that gassings had stopped by then. In reality, despite the extensive damage to the camp, the gas chambers were intact, and the murder of Polish Jews continued. Speed was reduced, with only ten wagons rolled onto the ramp at a time, while the others had to wait. The last two rail transports of Jews were brought to the camp for gassing from the Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto on 18 and 19 August 1943. They consisted of 76 wagons (37 the first day and 39 the second), according to a communiqu\u00e9 published by the Office of Information of the \"Armia Krajowa\", based on observation of Holocaust trains passing through the village of Treblinka. The 39 wagons that came to Treblinka on 19 August 1943 were carrying at least 7,600 survivors of the Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising.\nOn 19 October 1943, Operation Reinhard was terminated by a letter from Odilo Globocnik. The following day, a large group of Jewish \"Arbeitskommandos\" who had worked on dismantling the camp structures over the previous few weeks were loaded onto the train and transported, via Siedlce and Che\u0142m, to Sobib\u00f3r to be gassed on 20 October 1943. Franz followed Globocnik and Stangl to Trieste in November. Clean-up operations continued over the winter. As part of these operations, Jews from the surviving work detail dismantled the gas chambers brick-by-brick and used them to erect a farmhouse on the site of the camp's former bakery. Globocnik confirmed its purpose as a secret guard post for a Nazi-Ukrainian agent to remain behind the scenes, in a letter he sent to Himmler from Trieste on 5 January 1944. A \"Hiwi\" guard called Oswald Strebel, a Ukrainian \"Volksdeutscher\" (ethnic German), was given permission to bring his family from Ukraine for \"reasons of surveillance\", wrote Globocnik; Strebel had worked as a guard at Treblinka II. He was instructed to tell visitors that he had been farming there for decades, but the local Poles were well aware of the existence of the camp.\nOperational command of Treblinka II.\nIrmfried Eberl.\nSS-\"Obersturmf\u00fchrer\" Irmfried Eberl was appointed the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre and the only physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others point out that the number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to \"process\" these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague \"Unterscharf\u00fchrer\" Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: \"So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled.\" On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed what was going to happen to them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to away.\nOskar Berger, a Jewish eyewitness, one of about 100 people who escaped during the 1943 uprising, told of the camp's state when he arrived there in August 1942:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen Globocnik made a surprise visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Be\u0142\u017cec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among the reasons for dismissal were: incompetently disposing of the tens of thousands of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of murder, and not properly concealing the mass-murder. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up the pace of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had been the commandant of the Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.\nFranz Stangl.\nStangl arrived at Treblinka in late August 1942. He replaced Eberl on 1 September. Years later, Stangl described what he first saw when he came on the scene, in a 1971 interview with Gitta Sereny:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The road ran alongside the railway. When we were about fifteen, twenty minutes' drive from Treblinka, we began to see corpses by the line, first just two or three, then more, and as we drove into Treblinka station, there were what looked like hundreds of them \u2013 just lying there \u2013 they'd obviously been there for days, in the heat. In the station was a train full of Jews, some dead, some still alive\u00a0... that too, looked as if it had been there for days.\nStangl reorganised the camp, and the transports of Warsaw and Jews from the Radom Ghetto began to arrive again on 3 September 1942. According to Israeli historian Yitzhak Arad, Stangl wanted the camp to look attractive, so he ordered the paths paved in the \"Wohnlager\" administrative compound. Flowers were planted along \"Seidel Stra\u00dfe\" as well as near the SS living quarters. He ordered that all arriving prisoners should be greeted by the SS with a verbal announcement translated by the working Jews. The deportees were told that they were at a transit point on the way to Ukraine. Some of their questions were answered by Germans wearing lab coats as tools for deception. At times Stangl carried a whip and wore a white uniform, so he was nicknamed the \"White Death\" by prisoners. Although he was directly responsible for the camp's operations, according to his own testimony Stangl limited his contact with Jewish prisoners as much as possible. He claimed that he rarely interfered with the cruel acts perpetrated by his subordinate officers at the camp. He became desensitised to the murders, and came to perceive prisoners not as humans but merely as \"cargo\" that had to be destroyed, he said.\nTreblinka song.\nAccording to postwar testimonies, when transports were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote lyrics to a song meant to celebrate the Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned to work in the \"Sonderkommando\". They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. \"Unterscharf\u00fchrer\" Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: \"We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time. Hurrah!\"\nA musical ensemble was formed, under duress, by Artur Gold, a popular Jewish prewar composer from Warsaw. He arranged the theme to the Treblinka song for the 10-piece prisoner orchestra which he conducted. Gold arrived in Treblinka in 1942 and played music in the SS mess hall at the \"Wohnlager\" on German orders. He died during the uprising.\nKurt Franz.\nAfter the Treblinka revolt in August 1943, and termination of Operation Reinhard in October 1943, Stangl went with Globocnik to Trieste in northern Italy where SS reinforcements were needed. The third and last Treblinka II commandant was Kurt Franz, nicknamed \"Lalka\" by the prisoners () because he had \"an innocent face\".&lt;ref name=\"Berliner/Biala\"&gt; \"Also in:\" .&lt;/ref&gt; According to survivor testimonies, Franz shot and beat prisoners to death for minor infractions or had his dog Barry tear them to pieces. He managed Treblinka II until November 1943. The subsequent clean-up of the Treblinka II perimeter was completed by prisoners of nearby Treblinka I \"Arbeitslager\" in the following months. Franz's deputy was \"Hauptscharf\u00fchrer\" Fritz K\u00fcttner, who maintained a network of informers among the prisoners and did the hands-on murders.\nKurt Franz maintained a photo album against orders never to take photographs inside Treblinka. He named it \"Sch\u00f6ne Zeiten\" (\"Good Times\"). His album is a rare source of images illustrating the mechanised grave digging, brickworks in Ma\u0142kinia and the Treblinka zoo, among others. Franz was careful not to photograph the gas chambers.\nThe Treblinka I gravel mine functioned at full capacity under the command of Theodor van Eupen until July 1944, with new forced labourers sent to him by \"Kreishauptmann\" Ernst Gramss from Soko\u0142\u00f3w. The mass shootings continued into 1944. With Soviet troops closing in, the last 300 to 700 prisoners disposing of the incriminating evidence were executed by \"Trawnikis\" in late July 1944, long after the camp's official closure. Strebel, the ethnic German who had been installed in the farmhouse built in place of the camp's original bakery using bricks from the gas chambers, set fire to the building and fled to avoid capture.\nArrival of the Soviets.\nIn late July 1944, Soviet forces approached from the east. The departing Germans, who had already destroyed most direct evidence of genocidal intent, burned surrounding villages to the ground, including 761 buildings in Poniatowo, Prosty\u0144, and Gr\u0105dy. Many families were murdered. The fields of grain that had once fed the SS were burned. On 19 August 1944, German forces blew up the church in Prosty\u0144 and its bell tower, the last defensive strongpoint against the Red Army in the area.&lt;ref name=\"Rytel-Andrianik/Prosty\u0144\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviets entered Treblinka on 16 August, the extermination zone had been levelled, ploughed over, and planted with lupins. What remained, wrote visiting Soviet war correspondent Vasily Grossman, were small pieces of bone in the soil, human teeth, scraps of paper and fabric, broken dishes, jars, shaving brushes, rusted pots and pans, cups of all sizes, mangled shoes, and lumps of human hair. The road leading to the camp was pitch black. Until mid-1944 human ashes (up to 20 carts every day) had been regularly strewn by the remaining prisoners along the road for in the direction of Treblinka\u00a0I. When the war ended, destitute and starving locals started walking up the Black Road (as they began to call it) in search of man-made nuggets shaped from melted gold in order to buy bread.\nEarly attempts at preservation.\nThe new Soviet-installed government did not preserve evidence of the camp. The scene was not legally protected at the conclusion of World War II. In September 1947, 30 students from the local school, led by their teacher Feliks Szturo and priest J\u00f3zef Ruci\u0144ski, collected larger bones and skull fragments into farmers' wicker baskets and buried them in a single mound. The same year the first remembrance committee \"Komitet Uczczenia Ofiar Treblinki\" (KUOT; Committee for the Remembrance of the Victims of Treblinka) formed in Warsaw, and launched a design competition for the memorial.\nStalinist officials allocated no funding for the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, after the end of Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to be a place of martyrology. Over the next four years, of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prosty\u0144, Gr\u0105dy, W\u00f3lka Okr\u0105glik and Nowa Maliszewa.\nConstruction of the memorial.\nThe construction of a monument in height designed by sculptor Franciszek Dusze\u0144ko was inaugurated on 21 April 1958 with the laying of the cornerstone at the site of the former gas chambers. The sculpture represents the trend toward large avant-garde forms introduced in the 1960s throughout Europe, with a granite tower cracked down the middle and capped by a mushroom-like block carved with abstract reliefs and Jewish symbols. Treblinka was declared a national monument of martyrology on 10 May 1964 during an official ceremony attended by 30,000 people. The monument was unveiled by Zenon Kliszko, the Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, in the presence of survivors of the Treblinka uprising from Israel, France, Czechoslovakia and Poland. The camp custodian's house (built nearby in 1960) was turned into an exhibition space following the collapse of communism in Poland in 1989 and the retirement of the custodian; it opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.\nVictims.\nThere are many estimates of the total number of people murdered at Treblinka; most scholarly estimates range from 700,000 to 900,000, meaning that more Jews were murdered at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp except for Auschwitz. The Treblinka museum in Poland states that at least 800,000 people were murdered at Treblinka; Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, puts the number at 870,000; and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gives a range of 870,000 to 925,000.\nFirst estimates.\nThe first estimate of the number of people murdered at Treblinka came from Vasily Grossman, a Soviet war reporter who visited Treblinka in July 1944 as the Soviet forces marched westward across Poland. He published an article called \"The Hell Called Treblinka\", which appeared in the November 1944 issue of \"Znamya\", a monthly Russian literary magazine. In the article, he claimed that 3\u00a0million people had been murdered at Treblinka. He may not have been aware that the short station platform at Treblinka II greatly reduced the number of wagons that could be unloaded at one time, and may have been adhering to the Soviet trend of exaggerating Nazi crimes for propaganda purposes. In 1947, the Polish historian Zdzis\u0142aw \u0141ukaszkiewicz gave an estimate of 780,000 murders, based on the accepted record of 156 transports with an average of 5,000 prisoners each.\nCourt exhibits and affidavits.\nThe Treblinka trials of the 1960s took place in D\u00fcsseldorf and produced the two official West German estimates. During the 1965 trial of Kurt Franz, the Court of Assize in D\u00fcsseldorf concluded that at least 700,000 people were murdered at Treblinka, following a report by Dr. Helmut Krausnick, director of the Institute of Contemporary History. During Franz Stangl's trial in 1969, the same court reassessed the number to be at least 900,000 after new evidence from Dr. Wolfgang Scheffler.\nA chief witness for the prosecution at D\u00fcsseldorf in the 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1970 trials was Franciszek Z\u0105becki, who was employed by the \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" as a rail traffic controller at Treblinka village from 22 May 1941. In 1977 he published his book \"Old and New Memories\", in which he used his own records to estimate that at least 1,200,000 people were murdered at Treblinka. His estimate was based on the maximum capacity of a trainset during the \"Grossaktion\" Warsaw of 1942 rather than its yearly average. The original German waybills in his possession did not have the number of prisoners listed. Z\u0105becki, a Polish member of railway staff before the war, was one of the few non-German witnesses to see most transports that came into the camp; he was present at the Treblinka station when the first Holocaust train arrived from Warsaw. Z\u0105becki was a member of the \"Armia Krajowa\" (Polish: Home Army), which formed most of the Polish resistance movement in World War II, and kept a daily record of the extermination transports. He also clandestinely photographed the burning Treblinka II perimeter during the uprising in August 1943. Z\u0105becki witnessed the last set of five enclosed freight wagons carrying \"Sonderkommandos\" to the Sobib\u00f3r gas chambers on 20 October 1943. In 2013, his son Piotr Z\u0105becki wrote an article about him for \"\u017bycie Siedleckie\" that revised the number to 1,297,000. Z\u0105becki's daily records of transports to the camp, and demographic information regarding the number of people deported from each ghetto to Treblinka, were the two main sources for estimates of the death toll.\nIn his 1987 book \"Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps\", Israeli historian Yitzhak Arad stated that at least 763,000 people were murdered at Treblinka between July 1942 and April 1943. A considerable number of other estimates followed: see table (below).\nH\u00f6fle Telegram.\nA further source of information became available in 2001. The H\u00f6fle Telegram was an encrypted message sent to Berlin on 31 December 1942 by Operation Reinhard deputy commander Hermann H\u00f6fle, detailing the number of Jews deported by DRB to each of the Operation Reinhard death camps up to that point. Discovered among declassified documents in Britain, it shows that by the official count of the German Transport Authority 713,555 Jews were sent to Treblinka in 1942. The number of murders was probably higher, according to the \"Armia Krajowa\" communiqu\u00e9s. On the basis of the telegram and additional undated German evidence for 1943 listing 67,308 people deported, historian Jacek Andrzej M\u0142ynarczyk calculated that by the official DRB count, 780,863 people were brought by \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" to Treblinka.\nTreblinka trials.\nThe first major trial for war crimes committed at Treblinka was held in D\u00fcsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of \"SS-Scharf\u00fchrer\" Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed due to the decreased interest by the United States and the Soviet Union in prosecuting German war crimes with the onset of the Cold War. Many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965, eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (\"Totenlager\") and Willi Mentz and August Miete (both from \"Lazarett\"). Gustav M\u00fcnzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (\"Totenlager\") 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.\nThe second commandant of Treblinka II, Franz Stangl, escaped with his wife and children from Austria to Brazil in 1951. Stangl found work at a Volkswagen factory in S\u00e3o Paulo. His role in the mass murder of Jews was known to the Austrian authorities, but Austria did not issue a warrant for his arrest until 1961. Stangl was registered under his real name at the Austrian consulate in Brazil. It took another six years before Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal tracked him down and triggered his arrest. After his extradition from Brazil to West Germany, Stangl was tried for the murders of around 900,000 people. He admitted to the murders but argued: \"My conscience is clear. I was simply doing my duty.\" Stangl was found guilty on 22 October 1970, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of heart failure in prison in D\u00fcsseldorf on 28 June 1971.\nBetween the 1940s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union prosecuted 21 people for crimes committed at Treblinka. All of them were executed or died in prison. In 1986, the Soviet Union tried another Treblinka guard, Feodor Fedorenko. Fedorenko had been deported to the Soviet Union after his crimes were exposed, resulting in him being stripped of his American citizenship. Fedorenko was sentenced to death and executed in 1987.\nMaterial gain.\nThe theft of cash and valuables, collected from the victims of gassing, was conducted by the higher-ranking SS men on an enormous scale. It was a common practice among the concentration camps' top echelon everywhere; two Majdanek concentration camp commandants, Koch and Florstedt, were tried and executed by the SS for the same offence in April 1945. When the top-ranking officers went home, they would sometimes request a private locomotive from Klinzman and Emmerich at the Treblinka station to transport their personal \"gifts\" to Ma\u0142kinia for a connecting train. Then, they would drive out of the camp in cars without any incriminating evidence on their person, and later arrive at Ma\u0142kinia to transfer the goods.\nThe overall amount of material gain by Nazi Germany is unknown except for the period between 22 August and 21 September 1942, when there were 243 wagons of goods sent and recorded. Globocnik delivered a written tally to Reinhard headquarters on 15 December 1943 with the SS profit of \u211b\u2133 178,745,960.59, including of gold, of silver, of platinum, and 249,771.50 American dollars, as well as 130 diamond solitaires, of brilliants, of diamonds, and of pearls. The amount of loot Globocnik stole is unknown; Suchomel claimed in court to have filled a box with one million Reichsmarks for him.\nArchaeological studies.\nNeither the Jewish religious leaders in Poland nor the authorities allowed archaeological excavations at the camp out of respect for the dead. Approval for a limited archaeological study was issued for the first time in 2010 to a British team from Staffordshire University using non-invasive technology and Lidar remote sensing. The soil resistance was analysed at the site with ground-penetrating radar. Features that appeared to be structural were found, two of which were thought to be the remains of the gas chambers, and the study was allowed to continue.\nThe archaeological team performing the search discovered three new mass graves. The remains were reinterred out of respect for the victims. At the second dig the findings included yellow tiles stamped with a pierced mullet star resembling a Star of David, and building foundations with a wall. The star was soon identified as the logo of Polish ceramics factory manufacturing floor tiles, founded by Jan Dziewulski and brothers J\u00f3zef and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Lange (Dziewulski i Lange \u2013 D\u2721L since 1886), nationalised and renamed under communism after the war. As explained by forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls, the new evidence was important because the second gas chambers built at Treblinka were housed in the only brick building in the camp; Colls claimed that this provides the first physical evidence for their existence. In his memoir describing his stay in the camp, survivor Jankiel Wiernik says that the floor in the gas chambers (which he helped build) was made of similar tiles. The discoveries became a subject of the 2014 documentary by the Smithsonian Channel. More forensic work has been planned.\nMarch of the Living.\nTreblinka museum receives most visitors per day during the annual March of the Living educational programme which brings young people from around the world to Poland, to explore the remnants of the Holocaust. The visitors whose primary destination is the march at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, visit Treblinka in the preceding days. In 2009, 300 Israeli students attended the ceremony led by Eli Shaish from the Ministry of Education. In total 4,000 international students visited. In 2013 the number of students who came, ahead of the Auschwitz commemorations, was 3,571. In 2014, 1,500 foreign students visited.\n\nFootnotes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The area is highly mineralized (the Colorado Mineral Belt) and figured in the gold and silver mining industry of early Colorado. Major towns, all old mining camps, include Creede, Lake City, Silverton, Ouray, and Telluride. Large scale mining has ended in the region, although independent prospectors still work claims throughout the range. The last large-scale mines were the Sunnyside Mine near Silverton, which operated until late in the 20th century, and the Idarado Mine on Red Mountain Pass, which closed in the 1970s. Famous old San Juan mines include the Camp Bird and Smuggler Union mines, both located between Telluride and Ouray.\nThe Summitville mine was the scene of a major environmental disaster in the 1990s when the liner of a cyanide-laced tailing pond began leaking heavily. Summitville is in the Summitville caldera, one of many extinct volcanoes making up the San Juan volcanic field. One, La Garita Caldera, is in diameter. Large beds of lava, some extending under the floor of the San Luis Valley, are characteristic of the eastern slope of the San Juans. The eruption of the La Garita Caldera shaped the San Juan Mountains by completely obliterating the volcanoes that once stood in the area.\nTourism is a major part of the regional economy, with the narrow gauge railway between Durango and Silverton being an attraction mostly in the summer and fall. Off-roading is popular on the old trails which linked the historic mining camps, including the notorious Black Bear Road. Visiting old ghost towns is popular, as is wilderness trekking and mountain climbing. Many of the old mining camps are popular sites of summer homes. Though the San Juans are extremely steep and receive much snow, so far only Telluride has made the transition to a major ski resort. Purgatory Resort, once known as Durango Mountain Resort, is a small ski area 26 miles north of Durango. There is also skiing on Wolf Creek Pass at the Wolf Creek ski area. Recently Silverton Mountain ski area has begun operation near Silverton. The range is also a popular destination for endurance sports like trail running and mountain biking; Silverton is home to the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run one of the most difficult and technical ultra-marathons in the world.\nThe Rio Grande drains the east side of the range. The other side of the San Juans, the western slope of the continental divide, is drained by tributaries of the San Juan, Dolores and Gunnison rivers, which all flow into the Colorado River.\nThe San Juan and Uncompahgre National Forests cover a large portion of the San Juan Mountains. The Continental Divide Trail, a long-distance hiking trail follows the crest of the San Juan Mountains. The Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado's largest wilderness area, with an area of is in the San Juans. 152 miles of the Continental Divide trail are located on Trail #813 which follow through the San Juan wilderness and Weminuche Wilderness.\nThe San Juan Mountains are also distinctive for their high altitude plateaus and peaks. As a result, facilities in the towns and cities of the region are among the highest in the nation. Telluride Airport, at an elevation of 9,070 feet, is the highest in the United States with regularly scheduled commercial service.\nHistory of the area.\nHuman history at the eastern edge of the San Juan Mountains dates back thousands of years. Smithsonian archaeologists have identified paleo-Indian sites that are about 5,000 years old, located near Great Sand Dunes National Park and at the northern edge of the San Luis Valley, close to Poncha Pass. This suggests that early human presence in the region dates back to ancient times, long before the establishment of modern landmarks.\nMining operators in the San Juan mountain area formed the San Juan District Mining Association (SJDMA) in 1903, as a direct result of a Western Federation of Miners proposal to the Telluride Mining Association for the eight-hour day, which had been approved in a referendum by 72 percent of Colorado voters. The new association consolidated the power of thirty-six mining properties in San Miguel, Ouray, and San Juan counties. The SJDMA refused to consider any reduction in hours or increase in wages, helping to provoke a bitter strike.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Incorporating this, a larger model would simulate the properties of the membrane (mass density, stiffness, etc.), its coupling with the resonance of the cylindrical body of the drum, and the conditions at its boundaries (a rigid termination to the drum's body), describing its movement over time and thus its generation of sound.\nSimilar stages to be modelled can be found in instruments such as a violin, though the energy excitation in this case is provided by the slip-stick behavior of the bow against the string, the width of the bow, the resonance and damping behavior of the strings, the transfer of string vibrations through the bridge, and finally, the resonance of the soundboard in response to those vibrations.\nIn addition, the same concept has been applied to simulate voice and speech sounds. In this case, the synthesizer includes mathematical models of the vocal fold oscillation and associated laryngeal airflow, and the consequent acoustic wave propagation along the vocal tract. Further, it may also contain an articulatory model to control the vocal tract shape in terms of the position of the lips, tongue and other organs.\nAlthough physical modelling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis, having been implemented using finite difference approximations of the wave equation by Hiller and Ruiz in 1971, it was not until the development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm, the subsequent refinement and generalization of the algorithm into the extremely efficient digital waveguide synthesis by Julius O. Smith III and others, and the increase in DSP power in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible.\nYamaha contracted with Stanford University in 1989 to jointly develop digital waveguide synthesis; subsequently, most patents related to the technology are owned by Stanford or Yamaha.\nThe first commercially available physical modelling synthesizer made using waveguide synthesis was the Yamaha VL1 in 1994.\nWhile the efficiency of digital waveguide synthesis made physical modelling feasible on common DSP hardware and native processors, the convincing emulation of physical instruments often requires the introduction of non-linear elements, scattering junctions, etc. In these cases, digital waveguides are often combined with FDTD, finite element or wave digital filter methods, increasing the computational demands of the model.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There have been attacks on civilian targets and tourists, and there was a cargo-plane bomb plot in 2010. Counter-terrorism operations have been conducted by the Yemeni police, the Yemeni military, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Department of Defense - U.S. Special Operations Forces and United States Central Command.\nAttacks on civilian targets.\nLimburg attack.\nIn October 2002, near the port of Mukalla, suicide bombers rammed an explosive-laden boat into the \"Limburg\", a French oil tanker, killing a Bulgarian crew member and spilling of oil into the Gulf of Aden. Saudi born Abdulraheem al-Nashiri, prime suspect of the USS Cole bombing, paid $40,000 to fund the Limburg attack. With that money, the former al-Qaeda leader Abu Ali al-Harithi bought the explosives and transported them from his house in Shabwa to Mukalla in Hadramut.\nCivil Aviation, Meteorological Authority and helicopter attacks.\nOn November 3, 2002, there was an attack on a helicopter carrying Hunt Oil Co. Employees shortly after taking off from Sana'a. A missile and a machine gun were fired at the helicopter injuring two American citizens. One person was jailed for the helicopter attack as well as for bombing the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority building in Sana'a.\nJibla hospital.\nOn December 30, 2002, a suspected Islamic fundamentalist terrorist killed three US workers and wounded one in a hospital in Jibla with a semi-automatic rifle. Two men were eventually convicted and executed for the attack - the gunman Abid Abdulrazzaq Al-Kamil, and the 'mastermind' Ali Ahmed Mohamed al-Jarallah, who had also been convicted of the 2002 murder of Yemeni politician Jarallah Omar.\nAl-Salem letter threats.\nTeimani Jews reportedly fled their homes due to threats from Muslim extremists. Al-Qaeda members sent letters to 45 al-Salem Jews on January 19, 2007, accusing them of involvement in an \"International Zionist conspiracy\". The Jews sent a complaint to Yemenite president Ali Abdullah Saleh and temporarily moved to a hotel near Sana'a. The Yemenite government promised to protect their homes and reassured them that they could return.\nUS Embassy.\nOn September 17, 2008, Al-Qaeda militants attacked the US Embassy in Sana'a. 20 people were killed, including six militants, six policemen and seven civilians. One American was also among those killed.\nAttacks on tourists.\nA suicide bomber killed eight Spanish tourists and their two Yemeni drivers in Ma'rib on July 2, 2007. On January 18, 2008, Al-Qaeda militants opened fire on a convoy of tourists in Hadhramaut, killing two Belgian tourists, two Yemenis, the tourists' driver and their guide. In March 2009, four South Korean tourists and their local Yemeni guide were killed. Two attackers also died.\nUAE-run secret prisons.\nIn the name of punishment, Yemenis are tortured at the hands of Houthis and Saudi Arabia-led military. According to a report published by the Associated Press, the United Arab Emirates runs a network of secret prisons across southern Yemen, where several hundreds of Yemenis on suspicion of being al-Qaida or Islamic State militants are held.\nAccording to former detainees, families of prisoners, civil rights lawyers and Yemeni military officials, there are at least 18 lock-ups hidden away in military bases, air and seaports, the basements of private villas and even a nightclub. Prisoners are held without any charges, with the Yemeni government having no control over these UAE-run prisons.\nBeir Ahmed prison in the southern city of Aden is one such prison, where detainees are tortured and sexually assaulted by the UAE officers. Prisoners are electrocuted by their genitals and rocks are hung from their testicles. They are also sexually violated with wooden and steel poles. In March 2018, Emirati officers blind-folded and handcuffed all the detainees of Beir Ahmed prison and made them stand under the sun until noon. The detainees were asked to undress and lie down with their legs spread open. The Emirati forces then touched their genitals and probed their rectums in search of mobile phones.\nBin Salman mosque bombing.\nThe Bin Salman mosque was bombed on May 2, 2008, at the Bin Salman Mosque in Sa'dah, and killed 15 and injured 55. Local officials believed the bomb was hidden in a car or a motorcycle.\nSome witnesses said the target may have been the mosque's imam, or prayer leader, a Salafi army officer. Witnesses said he was not hurt. Military personnel are among those who usually pray at the Bin Salman mosque, which like others in Yemen caters for both the majority Sunni community and Shia Zaidis.\nWadi Dawan attack.\nOn January 18, 2008, there was an ambush attack on Belgian tourists traveling in a convoy through Hadhramaut in the Wadi Dawan desert valley A convoy of four jeeps carrying 15 tourists to Shibam was ambushed by gunmen in a hidden pickup truck. Two Belgian women, Claudine Van Caillie, of Bruges, 63, and Katrine Glorie, from East Flanders, 54, as well as two Yemenis, a driver and a guide, were killed; another man was also heavily wounded, several others suffered minor wounds. The tourists were repatriated to Belgium on January 19, except the injured man, who remained in Sanaa.\nIn the wake of the attack, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel De Gucht originally rejected that Al-Qaeda might be responsible, explaining that although the possibility could be avoided, internecine disputes and latent Islamism also to be taken into account. A number of arrests were made on January 21. President of the European Council Slovenia released a statement saying \"The EU Presidency strongly condemns all forms of violence and calls on the government of Yemen to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.\"\nMilitary and police counter-terrorism operations.\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, President Ali Abdullah Saleh attempted to eliminate the Islamist militant presence. By November 2002, Yemeni government troops had detained 104 suspected al-Qaeda members.\nIn December 2001 a search by government forces for two Yemenis believed to be senior al-Qaeda members hiding near Ma'rib led to a gun battle with tribesmen which ended in the deaths of 34 people, including 18 soldiers. To defuse the situation, ten Ma'rib sheikhs were detained as hostages of the state in the presidential palace for 35 days, until 43 lesser tribesmen took their place.\nAt the request of the United States, Spanish troops boarded and detained a ship transporting Scud missiles from North Korea to Yemen in December 2002. After two days, when the United States determined that it had no right under international law to continue detaining the shipment, it was allowed to continue on its way to Yemen.\nOn July 30, 2009, three soldiers were killed in a clash with al-Qaeda militants in Marib province. On December 17 the village of Al Ma`jalah was hit by a cruise missile which killed 41 people, including 14 women and 21 children; 14 were alleged al-Qaeda members. While the Yemeni government initially took responsibility, photographs of American components and a leaked diplomatic cable suggested that it was carried out by the United States. ABC News reported that US cruise missiles were part of the camp bombardment targeting Abu Hureira Qasm al-Rimi. According to local sources, 49 civilians (including 23 women and 17 children) were among those killed in the strike. That day, a clash between security forces and al-Qaeda members in Abhar left four militants dead.\nAn air raid targeted an al-Qaeda meeting in Wadi Rafadh, Shabwa province on December 24, 2009. Thirty-four suspected al-Qaeda militants were killed in the attack. According to security forces, Saudis and Iranians were among those killed.\nUS air attacks.\nThe US first said that it used targeted killing in November 2002, with the cooperation and approval of the Yemeni government.\nIn 2004, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC-TV) international-affairs program \"Foreign Correspondent\" investigated the targeted killing and the involvement of the US ambassador as part of a report entitled \"The Yemen Option\". The report examined evolving tactics and countermeasures in dealing with al-Qaeda-inspired attacks.\nAn estimated 98 US drone attacks were conducted in Yemen from 2002 to 2015: 41 in 2012, 26 in 2013 and 14 in 2014.\n2002 Al-Harethi killing.\nEarly in 2002 the Bush administration approved sending about 100 Special Operations Forces to Yemen.\nSix Yemeni suspected al-Qaeda members were blown up in their car in Marib province in November 2002 by a Hellfire missile from an unmanned CIA Predator drone. Among the dead were Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi (aka Abu Ali al-Harithi), a suspected senior al-Qaeda lieutenant believed to have helped mastermind the October 2000 USS \"Cole\" bombing. Al-Harethi was on a list of targets whose capture or death had been ordered by US President George W. Bush. and Kamal Derwish (aka Ahmed Hijazi), an American.\n2010 al-Shabwani killing.\nIn May 2010 an errant US drone attack targeting al-Qaeda terrorists in Wadi Abida killed five people, including Ma'rib deputy governor Jaber al-Shabwani (who was mediating between the government and the militants). The killing angered Shabwani's tribesmen and in subsequent weeks they fought government security forces, twice attacking a major oil pipeline in the province.\n2011 airstrikes.\nOn May 5, 2011, a missile fired from a US drone killed Abdullah and Mosaad Mubarak, brothers who may have been al-Qaeda militants. The missile struck their car, and both died instantly. The strike intended to kill al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, but he was not hit in the strike.\nOn June 3, 2011, American manned jets (or drones) killed Ali Abdullah Naji al-Harithi, a mid-level al-Qaeda operative, and several other militant suspects, including Ammar Abadah Nasser al-Wa'eli, in a strike in southern Yemen. Four civilians were also reportedly killed in the strike, reportedly coordinated by American special forces and CIA operatives based in Sanaa. According to the Associated Press, in 2011 the US government began building an air base near Yemen from which the CIA and the US military planned to fly drones over Yemen. This base is located at Umm Al Melh, just north of Yemen inside Saudi Arabia. \"The Washington Post\" reported that the US previously used a base in Djibouti to fly drones over Yemen, while \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that a US drone base in the Seychelles could be used to fly drones over Yemen.\nAccording to local residents and unnamed American and Yemeni government officials, on July 14, 2011, US manned aircraft (or drones) attacked and destroyed a police station in Mudiya, Abyan Governorate which had been occupied by al-Qaeda militants. Yemeni media and government accounts conflicted on the number of fatalities, estimated at between 6 and 50. The same day and nearby, drone missiles reportedly hit a car belonging to Yemeni al-Qaeda leader Fahd al-Quso, but al-Quso survived the attack.\nOn August 1, 2011, US drones and reported Yemeni aircraft attacked three targets with bombs and missiles in southern Yemen, killing 15 suspected al-Qaeda militants and wounding 17 others. Targeted locations included al-Wahdah, al-Amodiah, and al-Khamilah in Abyan Governorate. One of those killed was reportedly militant leader Naser al-Shadadi. According to the \"Yemen Post\" online newspaper, \"At least 35 US drone attacks were reported in Yemen over the last two months\". On August 24, unidentified aircraft attacked suspected al-Qaeda militants near Zinjibar. The strikes reportedly killed 30 militants and wounded 40 others.\nAccording to Yemeni officials, as reported in the \"Long War Journal\", US airstrikes in southeast Abyan province from August 30 to September 1 killed 30 AQAP militants reportedly engaged in combat with Yemeni military forces. Two airstrikes by US-operated aircraft on September 21 reportedly killed four AQAP fighters in Abyan and seven AQAP fighters in Shaqra. On September 30 US drone-launched missiles killed four people, including al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, in Al Jawf Governorate. The strike also killed Samir Kahn, the American-born editor of \"Inspire\" magazine. It was the first known time that the US deliberately targeted US citizens in a drone attack.\nA reported drone strike in Zinjibar on October 5 killed five AQAP militants. Yemeni government officials said that an October 14 US airstrike killed seven AQAP militants, including Egyptian-born AQAP media chief Ibrahim al-Bana. Eight militants were reportedly killed in an airstrike near Jaar on December 17; a December 22 drone strike near Zinjibar reportedly killed Abdulrahman al-Wuhayshi, a relative of Yemeni al-Qaeda leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi.\n2012 airstrikes.\nA reported US airstrike on January 31, 2012, near the city of Lawder in Abyan province killed 11 AQAP militants. The dead reportedly included Abdul Monem al-Fahtani, a participant in the USS \"Cole\" bombing.\nDrones engaged in three attacks in three days on March 9\u201311, 2012. The first strike targeted an AQAP hideout near Al Baydah, Baydah province, reportedly killing local AQAP leader Abdulwahhab al-Homaiqani and 16 of followers. The second strike, on Jaar in Abyan province, reportedly killed 20 AQAP fighters. The third strike, also on Jaar, reportedly killed three AQAP militants and targeted a storage location for weapons seized by AQAP after it overran a Yemeni military base in Al Koud the previous week. A fourth drone strike, on March 14 in Al Bydah, reportedly killed four AQAP militants in a vehicle.\nOn April 11, 14 militants were killed in a drone strike in the town of Lauder (northeast of Zinjibar in Abyan province). An April 22 drone strike in the Al Samadah area, near the border of Marib and Al Jawf provinces, killed AQAP senior leader Mohammed Saeed al Umda (also known as Ghareeb al Taizi). A suspected US drone strike killed Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso and another al-Qaida militant in southern Shabwa province on May 6.\n2013 Rada' wedding convoy strike.\nOn December 12, 2013, 17 people in a wedding convoy were killed in the Rada' District of the Governorate of Al-Bayda'. The US drone mistakenly targeted the wedding convoy after intelligence reports identified the vehicles as carrying suspected AQAP members. Although five of the killed were suspects, the remainder were civilians.\n2014 airstrikes.\nOn March 3, 2014, an airstrike believed carried out by an American drone killed three suspected AQAP members. Mujahid Gaber Saleh al Shabwani, one of Yemen's 25 most-wanted AQAP operatives, was thought to have been one of those killed. According to a statement released by the Yemeni Interior Ministry, on April 20\u201321 three US drone strikes killed at least two dozen suspected AQAP members and destroyed one of the group's training camps in southern Yemen. Five civilians were wounded and three killed in the attack. A June 13 suspected US drone strike targeted a car in the Mafraq al-Saeed region of Shabwah province, killing the five alleged AQAP operatives inside.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with SI. The word \"unified\" emphasizes that the definition was accepted by both IUPAP and IUPAC. The atomic mass constant, denoted \"m\"u, is an atomic-scale reference mass, defined identically, but it is not a unit of mass. Expressed in terms of \"m\"a(12C), the atomic mass of carbon-12: \"m\"u = \"m\"a(12C)/12 = 1 Da. The dalton's numerical value in terms of the fixed-\"h\" kilogram is an experimentally determined quantity that, along with its inherent uncertainty, is updated periodically. As listed in the 9th edition, version 3.02, of the SI Brochure, the 2022 CODATA recommended value of the atomic mass constant expressed in the SI base unit kilogram is:\"m\"u\u00a0=\u00a0. The previous value given for the dalton (1 Da = 1 u = \"m\"u) was the 2018 CODATA recommended value:1 Da = \"m\"u = kg. \nThis was the value used in the calculation of g/Da, the traditional definition of the Avogadro number. This resulted in the value\ng/Da = 6.022 140 7620(18) \u00d7 1023, which was then\nrounded to 9 significant figures (thus guaranteeing continuity, to the precision indicated) and fixed at exactly that value for the 2019 redefinition of the mole.\nThe value serves as a conversion factor of mass from daltons to kilograms, which can easily be converted to grams and other metric units of mass. The 2019 revision of the SI redefined the kilogram by fixing the value of the Planck constant (\"h\"), improving the precision of the atomic mass constant expressed in SI units by anchoring it to fixed physical constants. Although the dalton remains defined via carbon-12, the revision enhances traceability and accuracy in atomic mass measurements.\nThe mole is a unit of amount of substance used in chemistry and physics, such that the mass of one mole of a substance expressed in grams (i.e., the molar mass in g/mol or kg/kmol) is numerically equal to the average mass of an elementary entity of the substance (atom, molecule, or formula unit) expressed in daltons. For example, the average mass of one molecule of water is about 18.0153\u00a0Da, and the mass of one mole of water is about 18.0153\u00a0g. A protein whose molecule has an average mass of would have a molar mass of . However, while this equality can be assumed for practical purposes, it is only approximate, because of the 2019 redefinition of the mole.\nUsage.\nThe dalton is commonly used in physics and chemistry to express the mass of atomic-scale objects, such as atoms, molecules, and elementary particles, both for discrete instances and multiple types of ensemble averages. For example, an atom of helium-4 has a mass of . This is an intrinsic property of the isotope and all helium-4 atoms have the same mass. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), C9H8O4, has an average mass of about . However, there are no acetylsalicylic acid molecules with this mass. The two most common masses of individual acetylsalicylic acid molecules are , having the most common isotopes, and , in which one carbon is carbon-13.\nThe molecular masses of proteins, nucleic acids, and other large polymers are often expressed with the unit kilodalton (kDa) and megadalton (MDa). Titin, one of the largest known proteins, has a molecular mass of between 3 and 3.7 megadaltons. The DNA of chromosome 1 in the human genome has about 249 million base pairs, each with an average mass of about , or total.\nIn general, the mass in daltons of an atom is numerically close but not exactly equal to the number of nucleons in its nucleus. It follows that the molar mass of a compound (grams per mole) is numerically close to the average number of nucleons contained in each molecule. By definition, the mass of an atom of carbon-12 is 12\u00a0daltons, which corresponds with the number of nucleons that it has (6\u00a0protons and 6\u00a0neutrons). However, the mass of an atomic-scale object is affected by the binding energy of the nucleons in its atomic nuclei, as well as the mass and binding energy of its electrons. Therefore, this equality holds only for the carbon-12 atom in the stated conditions, and will vary for other substances. For example, the mass of an unbound atom of the common hydrogen isotope (hydrogen-1, protium) is , the mass of a proton is , the mass of a free neutron is , and the mass of a hydrogen-2 (deuterium) atom is . In general, the difference (absolute mass excess) is less than 0.1%; exceptions include hydrogen-1 (about 0.8%), helium-3 (0.5%), lithium-6 (0.25%) and beryllium (0.14%).\nThe dalton differs from the unit of mass in the system of atomic units, which is the electron rest mass (\"m\"e).\nEnergy equivalents.\nThe atomic mass constant can also be expressed as its energy-equivalent, \"m\"u\"c\"2. The CODATA recommended values are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"m\"u\"c\"2\u00a0=\u00a0\u200d \nThe mass-equivalent is commonly used in place of a unit of mass in particle physics, and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses.\nHistory.\nOrigin of the concept.\nThe interpretation of the law of definite proportions in terms of the atomic theory of matter implied that the masses of atoms of various elements had definite ratios that depended on the elements. While the actual masses were unknown, the relative masses could be deduced from that law. In 1803 John Dalton proposed to use the (still unknown) atomic mass of the lightest atom, hydrogen, as the natural unit of atomic mass. This was the basis of the atomic weight scale.\nFor technical reasons, in 1898, chemist Wilhelm Ostwald and others proposed to redefine the unit of atomic mass as the mass of an oxygen atom. That proposal was formally adopted by the International Committee on Atomic Weights (ICAW) in 1903. That was approximately the mass of one hydrogen atom, but oxygen was more amenable to experimental determination. This suggestion was made before the discovery of isotopes in 1912. Physicist Jean Perrin had adopted the same definition in 1909 during his experiments to determine the atomic masses and the Avogadro constant. This definition remained unchanged until 1961. Perrin also defined the \"mole\" as an amount of a compound that contained as many molecules as 32 grams of oxygen (O2). He called that number the Avogadro number in honor of physicist Amedeo Avogadro.\nIsotopic variation.\nThe discovery of isotopes of oxygen in 1929 required a more precise definition of the unit. Two distinct definitions came into use. Chemists choose to define the AMU as of the average mass of an oxygen atom as found in nature; that is, the average of the masses of the known isotopes, weighted by their natural abundance. Physicists, on the other hand, defined it as of the mass of an atom of the isotope oxygen-16 (16O).\nJoint definition by IUPAP and IUPAC.\nThe existence of two distinct units with the same name was confusing, and the difference (about in relative terms) was large enough to affect high-precision measurements. Moreover, it was discovered that the isotopes of oxygen had different natural abundances in water and in air. \nIn April 1957 Alfred O. C. Nier suggested to Josef Mattauch that the carbon-12 be adopted as mass scale because of carbon's use as a secondary standard in mass spectrometry. Also, carbon-12 implied acceptable relative changes in the atomic weight scale, i.e., 42 parts-per-million (ppm) compared to 275 ppm for oxygen-16 which would not be acceptable to chemists. \nFollowing the approval of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) General Assembly at Ottawa, Canada in 1960 and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) General Assembly at Montreal, Canada in 1961, the atomic weights were officially given on the carbon-12 scale for the first time.\nThe new unit was named the \"unified atomic mass unit\" and given a new symbol \"u\", to replace the old \"amu\" that had been used for the oxygen-based unit. However, the old symbol \"amu\" has sometimes been used, after 1961, to refer to the new unit, particularly in lay and preparatory contexts.\nWith this new definition, the standard atomic weight of carbon is about , and that of oxygen is about . These values, generally used in chemistry, are based on averages of many samples from Earth's crust, its atmosphere, and organic materials.\nAdoption by BIPM.\nThe IUPAC 1961 definition of the unified atomic mass unit, with that name and symbol \"u\", was adopted by the International Bureau for Weights and Measures (BIPM) in 1971 as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI.\nUnit name.\nIn 1993, the IUPAC proposed the shorter name \"dalton\" (with symbol \"Da\") for the unified atomic mass unit. As with other unit names such as watt and newton, \"dalton\" is not capitalized in English, but its symbol, \"Da\", is capitalized. The name was endorsed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) in 2005.\nIn 2003 the name was recommended to the BIPM by the Consultative Committee for Units, part of the CIPM, as it \"is shorter and works better with [SI] prefixes\". In 2006, the BIPM included the dalton in its 8th edition of the SI brochure of formal definitions as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI. The name was also listed as an alternative to \"unified atomic mass unit\" by the International Organization for Standardization in 2009. It is now recommended by several scientific publishers, and some of them consider \"atomic mass unit\" and \"amu\" deprecated. In 2019, the BIPM retained the dalton in its 9th edition of the SI brochure, while dropping the unified atomic mass unit from its table of non-SI units accepted for use with the SI, but secondarily notes that the dalton\u00a0(Da) and the unified atomic mass unit\u00a0(u) are alternative names (and symbols) for the same unit.\n2019 revision of the SI.\nThe definition of the dalton was not affected by the 2019 revision of the SI, that is, 1\u00a0Da in the SI is still of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, a quantity that must be determined experimentally in terms of SI units. However, the definition of a mole was changed to be the amount of substance consisting of exactly entities, and the definition of the kilogram was changed as well. As a consequence, the molar mass constant (\"M\"u) remains close to but no longer exactly 1\u00a0g/mol, meaning that the mass in grams of one mole of any substance remains nearly but no longer exactly numerically equal to the average mass of an entity in daltons, although the relative standard uncertainty of at the time of the redefinition is insignificant for all practical purposes. Letting ent denote one entity, the smallest amount of any substance (retaining its chemical properties), one mole is an aggregate of an Avogadro number of entities, i.e. 1\u00a0mol\u00a0=\u00a0\"N\"0\u00a0ent\u00a0\u2248\u00a0(g/Da)\u00a0ent. This means that the appropriate atomic-scale unit for molar mass is dalton per entity (Da/ent), equal to the constant \"M\"u, very nearly equal to 1\u00a0g/mol. For Da/ent to be exactly equal to g/mol, the dalton would need to be redefined exactly in terms of the (fixed-\"h\") kilogram and the Avogadro number so that 1\u00a0Da\u00a0=\u00a0(1/\"N\"0)\u00a0g, satisfying the relationships \"N\"0\u00a0=\u00a0g/Da and 1\u00a0mol\u00a0=\u00a0\"N\"0\u00a0ent\u00a0=\u00a0(g/Da)\u00a0ent, thus conforming to the original mole concept\u2014that the Avogadro number is the gram-to-dalton mass unit ratio. \nMeasurement.\nThough relative atomic masses are defined for neutral atoms, they are measured (by mass spectrometry) for ions: hence, the measured values must be corrected for the mass of the electrons that were removed to form the ions, and also for the mass equivalent of the electron binding energy, \"E\"b/\"m\"u\"c\"2. The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon-12 atom is \u00a0= : \"E\"b/\"m\"u\"c\"2\u00a0=\u00a0, or about one part in 10\u00a0million of the mass of the atom.\nBefore the 2019 revision of the SI, experiments were aimed to determine the value of the Avogadro constant for finding the value of the unified atomic mass unit.\nJosef Loschmidt.\nA reasonably accurate value of the atomic mass unit was first obtained indirectly by Josef Loschmidt in 1865, by estimating the number of particles in a given volume of gas.\nJean Perrin.\nPerrin estimated the Avogadro number by a variety of methods, at the turn of the 20th century. He was awarded the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, largely for this work.\nCoulometry.\nThe electric charge per mole of elementary charges is a constant called the Faraday constant, \"F\", whose value had been essentially known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis. In 1910, Robert Millikan obtained the first measurement of the charge on an electron, \u2212\"e\". The quotient \"F\"/\"e\" provided an estimate of the Avogadro constant.\nThe classic experiment is that of Bower and Davis at NIST, and relies on dissolving silver metal away from the anode of an electrolysis cell, while passing a constant electric current \"I\" for a known time \"t\". If \"m\" is the mass of silver lost from the anode and \"A\"r the atomic weight of silver, then the Faraday constant is given by:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe NIST scientists devised a method to compensate for silver lost from the anode by mechanical causes, and conducted an isotope analysis of the silver used to determine its atomic weight. Their value for the conventional Faraday constant was \"F\"90\u00a0=\u00a0, which corresponds to a value for the Avogadro constant of : both values have a relative standard uncertainty of .\nElectron mass measurement.\nIn practice, the atomic mass constant is determined from the electron rest mass \"m\"e and the electron relative atomic mass \"A\"r(e) (that is, the mass of electron divided by the atomic mass constant). The relative atomic mass of the electron can be measured in cyclotron experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants.\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light, \"h\" is the Planck constant, \"\u03b1\" is the fine-structure constant, and \"R\"\u221e is the Rydberg constant.\nAs may be observed from the old values (2014 CODATA) in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant was the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant, as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation were known more precisely.\nThe power of having defined values of universal constants as is presently the case can be understood from the table below (2018 CODATA).\nX-ray crystal density methods.\nSilicon single crystals may be produced today in commercial facilities with extremely high purity and with few lattice defects. This method defined the Avogadro constant as the ratio of the molar volume, \"V\"m, to the atomic volume \"V\"atom:\nformula_1\nwhere \"V\"atom = and \"n\" is the number of atoms per unit cell of volume \"V\"cell.\nThe unit cell of silicon has a cubic packing arrangement of 8 atoms, and the unit cell volume may be measured by determining a single unit cell parameter, the length \"a\" of one of the sides of the cube. The CODATA value of \"a\" for silicon is .\nIn practice, X-ray crystallography measurements are carried out on a distance known as \"d\"220(Si), which is the distance between the planes denoted by the Miller indices {220}, and is equal to \"a\"/\u221a8.\nThe isotope proportional composition of the sample used must be measured and taken into account. Silicon occurs in three stable isotopes (28Si, 29Si, 30Si), and the natural variation in their proportions is greater than other uncertainties in the measurements. The atomic weight \"A\"r for the sample crystal can be calculated, as the standard atomic weights of the three nuclides are known with great accuracy. This, together with the measured density \"\u03c1\" of the sample, allows the molar volume \"V\"m to be determined:\nformula_2\nwhere \"M\"u is the molar mass constant. The CODATA value for the molar volume of silicon is , with a relative standard uncertainty of .\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, religion, science, language, and mathematics, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality, although the latter is more about its application.\nReasoning involves using more-or-less rational processes of thinking and cognition to extrapolate from one's existing knowledge to generate new knowledge, and involves the use of one's intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments and true conclusions. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning.\nAristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning,https:// in which the reasoning process through intuition\u2014however valid\u2014may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand the significance of sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or good and evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.\nEtymology and related words.\nIn the English language and other modern European languages, \"reason\", and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in their philosophical sense.\nThe earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words \", \", \"\" and \"reason\" as interchangeable. The meaning of the word \"reason\" in senses such as \"human reason\" also overlaps to a large extent with \"rationality\" and the adjective of \"reason\" in philosophical contexts is normally \"rational\", rather than \"reasoned\" or \"reasonable\". Some philosophers, Hobbes for example, also used the word ratiocination as a synonym for \"reasoning\".\nIn contrast to the use of \"reason\" as an abstract noun, \"a\" reason is a consideration that either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena, and reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.\nThe words are connected in this way: using reason, or reasoning, means providing good reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, \"morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by \"reason\"\u2014that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing\u2014while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.\"\nPhilosophical history.\nThe proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of Western philosophy and later Western science, starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, while reason has been among the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be reflexive, or \"self-correcting\", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.\nClassical philosophy.\nFor many classical philosophers, nature was understood teleologically, meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose that fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos was even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just a characteristic that people happen to have. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, because it is something people share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos. Within the human mind or soul (), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness () and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He described the highest human happiness or well being () as a life which is lived consistently, excellently, and completely in accordance with reason.I\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way that is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neoplatonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all people are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings people's souls back into line with their source.\nChristian and Islamic philosophy.\nThe classical view of reason was adopted by the early Church. The greatest among the early Church Fathers and Doctors of the Church such as Augustine of Hippo, Basil of Caesarea, and Gregory of Nyssa were as much Neoplatonic philosophers as they were Christian theologians, and they adopted the Neoplatonic view of human reason and its implications for our relationship to creation, to ourselves, and to God.\nThe Neoplatonic conception of the rational aspect of the human soul was widely adopted by medieval Islamic philosophers and continues to hold significance in Iranian philosophy. As European intellectual life reemerged from the Dark Ages, the Christian Patristic tradition and the influence of esteemed Islamic scholars like Averroes and Avicenna contributed to the development of the Scholastic view of reason, which laid the foundation for our modern understanding of this concept.\nAmong the Scholastics who relied on the classical concept of reason for the development of their doctrines, none were more influential than Saint Thomas Aquinas, who put this concept at the heart of his Natural Law. In this doctrine, Thomas concludes that because humans have reason and because reason is a spark of the divine, every single human life is invaluable, all humans are equal, and every human is born with an intrinsic and permanent set of basic rights. On this foundation, the idea of human rights would later be constructed by Spanish theologians at the School of Salamanca.\nOther Scholastics, such as Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus, following the example of Islamic scholars such as Alhazen, emphasised reason an intrinsic human ability to decode the created order and the structures that underlie our experienced physical reality. This interpretation of reason was instrumental to the development of the scientific method in the early Universities of the high Middle Ages.\nSubject-centred reason in early modern philosophy.\nThe early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in Europe. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world. Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same \"laws of nature\" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.\nAccordingly, in the 17th century, Ren\u00e9 Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as \"rational animals\", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than \"thinking things\" along the lines of other \"things\" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.\nIn his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes brought into doubt \"all\" knowledge\u2014\"except\" that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:\nAt this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason\u2014words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.\nThis eventually became known as epistemological or \"subject-centred\" reason, because it is based on the \"knowing subject\", who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered, by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and with many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them instead as one indivisible incorporeal entity.\nA contemporary of Descartes, Thomas Hobbes described reason as a broader version of \"addition and subtraction\" which is not limited to numbers. This understanding of reason is sometimes termed \"calculative\" reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that \"No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come\" but that \"sense and memory\" is absolute knowledge.\nIn the late 17th century through the 18th century, John Locke and David Hume developed Descartes's line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.\nHume famously remarked that, \"We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing, unlike his predecessors, that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas, or from judgments associating two ideas, and that \"reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations.\" It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.\nIn the 18th century, Immanuel Kant attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a \"transcendental\" self, or \"I\", was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge (epistemology), and understanding.\nSubstantive and formal reason.\nIn the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason () is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical, and aesthetic reasoning on \"universal\" laws.\nHere, practical reasoning is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal norms, and theoretical reasoning is the way humans posit universal laws of nature.\nUnder practical reason, the moral autonomy or freedom of people depends on their ability, by the proper exercise of that reason, to behave according to laws that are given to them. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on religious understanding and interpretation, or on nature, for their substance.\nAccording to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, as long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the \"categorical imperative\", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:\nAct only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\nIn contrast to Hume, Kant insisted that reason itself (German ) could be used to find solutions to metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that these solutions could be found with his \"transcendental logic\", which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument that can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.\nAccording to J\u00fcrgen Habermas, the \"substantive unity\" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question \"How should I live?\" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or \"procedural\". He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):\nFor Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the \"lifeworld\" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.\nThe critique of reason.\nHamann, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Rorty, and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity, or \"spirit\" in human life, and they attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.\nSome thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other \"forms\" of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason. Others suggest that there is not just one reason or rationality, but multiple possible systems of reason or rationality which may conflict (in which case there is no super-rational system one can appeal to in order to resolve the conflict).\nIn the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to \"re-orient\" this critique of reason, or to recognize the \"other voices\" or \"new departments\" of reason:\nFor example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity.\nNikolas Kompridis proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as \"that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness\" in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.\nThe philosopher Charles Taylor, influenced by the 20th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger, proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure, which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new \"department\" of reason.\nIn the essay \"What is Enlightenment?\", Michel Foucault proposed a critique based on Kant's distinction between \"private\" and \"public\" uses of reason:\nReason compared to related concepts.\nReason compared to logic.\nThe terms \"logic\" or \"logical\" are sometimes used as if they were identical with \"reason\" or \"rational\", or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason: \"Logic is about reasoning\u2014about going from premises to a conclusion.\u00a0... When you do logic, you try to clarify reasoning and separate good from bad reasoning.\" In modern economics, rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice.\nHowever, reason and logic can be thought of as distinct\u2014although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter, in \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\", characterizes the distinction in this way: Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system. Psychologists Mark H. Bickard and Robert L. Campbell argue that \"rationality cannot be simply assimilated to logicality\"; they note that \"human knowledge of logic and logical systems has developed\" over time through reasoning, and logical systems \"can't construct new logical systems more powerful than themselves\", so reasoning and rationality must involve more than a system of logic. Psychologist David Moshman, citing Bickhard and Campbell, argues for a \"metacognitive conception of rationality\" in which a person's development of reason \"involves increasing consciousness and control of logical and other inferences\".\nReason is a type of thought, and logic involves the attempt to describe a system of formal rules or norms of appropriate reasoning. The oldest surviving Western writings to explicitly consider and systematically codify the rules by which reason operates, are the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, especially \"Prior Analytics\" and \"Posterior Analytics\". Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's newly coined word \"syllogism\" () identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to \"the logical\" (), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.\nReason compared to cause-and-effect thinking, and symbolic thinking.\nAs pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of \"associative thinking\", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.\nHuman reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas\u2014even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect\u2014perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way that can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.\nMore generally, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols, as well as indices and icons, the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either (for example) smoke or fire. One example of such a system of symbols and signs is language.\nThe connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. Thomas Hobbes described the creation of \"Markes, or Notes of remembrance\" as \"speech\". He used the word \"speech\" as an English version of the Greek word so that speech did not need to be communicated. When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called \"Signes\" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and , and even uses the word \"\" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.\nReason, imagination, mimesis, and memory.\nReason and imagination rely on similar mental processes. Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle asserted that (imagination: that which can hold images or ) and (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or . But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.\nTerrence Deacon and Merlin Donald, writing about the origin of language, connect reason not only to language, but also mimesis. They describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality, and specific to humankind. Other results are consciousness, and imagination or fantasy. Modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker.\nIf reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of \"icons\" or images and the real things they represent. Merlin Donald writes:\nA dog might perceive the \"meaning\" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight)... Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early\u2014hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself\nIn classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is , in the philosophy of Plato.Ch.5 This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as is the concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, \", and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible \"objects of thought\" as \"foundations\" ( in Ancient Greek). This thinking () is \"...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' \".122\nBoth Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of , often translated as \"imitation\" or \"representation\". Donald writes:169\nImitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [...but...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations... Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.\n is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works. In Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the \"Poetics\". In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in that work:\nIt is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...\nDonald, like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in \"On Memory and Recollection\"), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek , normally translated as \"recollection\" was opposed to or \"memory\". Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also \"that\" something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of 109 \"...but nothing except man is able to recollect.\" Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, \"To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.\"112 Donald calls the same thing \"autocueing\", which he explains as follows:173 \"Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues\u2014probably the earliest form of representational \"thinking\".\"\nIn a celebrated paper, the fantasy author and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his essay \"On Fairy Stories\" that the terms \"fantasy\" and \"enchantment\" are connected to not only \"the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires\" but also \"the origin of language and of the mind\".\nLogical reasoning methods and argumentation.\nA subdivision of philosophy and a variety of reasoning is logic. The traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Formal logic has been described as \"the science of deduction\". The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.\nDeductive reasoning.\nDeduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the name for the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process. A classic example of deductive reasoning is evident in syllogisms like the following:\nThe reasoning in this argument is deductively valid because there is no way in which both premises could be true and the conclusion be false.\nInductive reasoning.\nInduction is a form of inference that produces properties or relations about unobserved objects or types based on previous observations or experiences, or that formulates general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns.\nInductive reasoning contrasts with deductive reasoning in that, even in the strongest cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. For this reason also, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.\nA classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist David Hume:\nAnalogical reasoning.\nAnalogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular. It is often used in case-based reasoning, especially legal reasoning. An example follows:\nAnalogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general. Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:\nAbductive reasoning.\nAbductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of reasoning that does not fit in either the deductive or inductive categories, since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations. The conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by subjective judgement or by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.\nFallacious reasoning.\nFlawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning. Bad reasoning within arguments can result from either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy.\nFormal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word \"formal\" refers to this link to the \"form\" of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.\nAn informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the \"content\", rather than the form or structure, of the argument.\nUnreasonable decisions and actions.\nIn law relating to the actions of an employer or a public body, a decision or action which falls outside the range of actions or decision available when acting in good faith can be described as \"unreasonable\". Use of the term is considered in the English law cases of \"Short v Poole Corporation\" (1926), \"Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation\" (1947) and \"Braganza v BP Shipping Limited\" (2015).\nTraditional problems raised concerning reason.\nPhilosophy is often characterized as a pursuit of rational understanding, entailing a more rigorous and dedicated application of human reasoning than commonly employed. Philosophers have long debated two fundamental questions regarding reason, essentially examining reasoning itself as a human endeavor, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question delves into whether we can place our trust in reason's ability to attain knowledge and truth more effectively than alternative methods. The second question explores whether a life guided by reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to lead to greater happiness compared to other approaches to life.\nReason versus truth, and \"first principles\".\nSince classical antiquity a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (sometimes seen as a conflict between Platonism and Aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic, deduction, and induction to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.\nThis leads to the question of what types of first principles, or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, \"first principles\" are , \"starting points\", and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle and Plato as which was close in meaning to \"awareness\" or \"consciousness\".\nEmpiricism (sometimes associated with Aristotle but more correctly associated with British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume, as well as their ancient equivalents such as Democritus) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable. Idealism, (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a \"higher\" reality, within which certain people can directly discover truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.\nPhilosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas, and Hegel argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable\u2014perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. Religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and \u00c9tienne Gilson attempted to show that reason and revelation are compatible. According to Hegel, \"...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process.\"\nSince the 17th century rationalists, reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty, or rather the unaided ability (pure reason) to form concepts. For Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, this was associated with mathematics. Kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts (time and space) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.\nReason versus emotion or passion.\nAfter Plato and Aristotle, Western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites. Stoic philosophy, by contrast, claimed most emotions were merely false judgements. According to the Stoics the only good is virtue, and the only evil is vice, therefore emotions that judged things other than vice to be bad (such as fear or distress), or things other than virtue to be good (such as greed) were simply false judgements and should be discarded (though positive emotions based on true judgements, such as kindness, were acceptable). After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or were conflated with the passions. Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say reason should oppose passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that passion displaces reason, as in the maxim \"follow your heart\".\nReason has been seen as cold, an \"enemy of mystery and ambiguity\", a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably in the work of David Hume. More recently, Freud wrote, \u201cIt seems as though the activity of the other agencies of the mind is able only to modify the pleasure principle but not to nullify it; and it remains a question of the greatest theoretical importance, and one that has not yet been answered, when and how it is ever possible for the pleasure principle to be overcome.\u201d \nReasoning that claims the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called \"rationalization\".\nRousseau first proposed, in his second \"Discourse\", that reason and political life is not natural and is possibly harmful to mankind. He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, \"best suits his constitution\"? Rousseau saw \"two principles prior to reason\" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves. These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Richard Velkley, \"Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the \"Contrat Social\" and the moral education in \"\". All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.\"\nThis quandary presented by Rousseau led to Kant's new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways, German Idealism after Kant, and major later figures such Nietzsche, Bergson, Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or urges of reason. Rousseau and these later writers also exerted a large influence on art and politics. Many writers (such as Nikos Kazantzakis) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern nationalism comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state.\nIn \"Descartes' Error\", Antonio Damasio presents the \"Somatic Marker Hypothesis\" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as \"gut feelings\") are \"intuitive signals\" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.\nReason versus faith or tradition.\nThere are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality; they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.). Though theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not admit to being irrational, there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of wisdom, law, and truth.\nReligious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism:\nSome commentators have claimed that Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between \"unaided\" reason and faith in \"revealed\" truths\u2014figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem, respectively. Leo Strauss spoke of a \"Greater West\" that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation, including the Muslim lands. He was particularly influenced by the Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi. To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature ( in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the \"discovery or invention of nature\" and the \"pre-philosophical equivalent of nature\" was supplied by \"such notions as 'custom' or 'ways'\", which appear to be really universal in all times and places. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.\nReason in particular fields of study.\nPsychology and cognitive science.\nScientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.\nAssessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning and cognitive science of reasoning. Rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts.\nBehavioral experiments on human reasoning.\nExperimental cognitive psychologists research reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals like \"if A then B\" and how they make inferences about alternatives like \"A or else B\". They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations like \"A is to the left of B\" or \"A happens after B\", and about quantified assertions like \"all the A are B\". Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.\nDevelopmental studies of children's reasoning.\nDevelopmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.\nNeuroscience of reasoning.\nThe biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and neuropsychologists. This includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, as well as of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists\u2014for example clinical psychologists and psychotherapists\u2014work to alter people's reasoning habits when those habits are unhelpful.\nComputer science.\nAutomated reasoning.\nIn artificial intelligence and computer science, scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages, and formal specification in software engineering.\nMeta-reasoning.\nMeta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when reasoning about its operation. This requires a programming language capable of reflection, the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.\nEvolution of reason.\nA species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict, and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier argue that, aside from these benefits, other forces could have been driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs (confirmation bias). Reasoning is most effective when done as a collective\u2014as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. They suggest that there are pressures not just individual, but group selection at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Sperber's &amp; Mercier's argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than searching for the truth.\nReason in political philosophy and ethics.\nAristotle famously described reason (with language) as a part of human nature, because of which it is best for humans to live \"politically\" meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state ( in Greek). For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [ = of the ] animal [] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech []. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city []... By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the ], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just.I.2, 1253a\nIf human nature is fixed in this way, we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical, and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseau's Second Discourse, and secondly, the Theory of Evolution. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the had not always existed and had to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.I.2, 1252b15\nFriendship seems to prevail in man and woman according to nature []; for people are by nature [] pairing more than political [], in as much as the household [] is prior and more necessary than the and making children is more common [] with the animals. In the other animals, community [] goes no further than this, but people live together [] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [] are divided, and are different for man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common []. It is for these reasons that both utility and pleasure seem to be found in this kind of friendship.https://\nRousseau in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language, and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation\u2014often only to defend themselves from each other.\nIn other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language, and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.\nThe two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language, and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that led to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply (for example by Karl Marx) a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.\nHowever, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as Geneva, and rural living.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol, and is structurally very similar to nitroglycerin. Penta refers to the five carbon atoms of the neopentane skeleton. PETN is a very powerful explosive material with a relative effectiveness factor of 1.66. When mixed with a plasticizer, PETN forms a plastic explosive. Along with RDX it is the main ingredient of Semtex.\nPETN is also used as a vasodilator drug to treat certain heart conditions, such as for management of angina.\nHistory.\nPentaerythritol tetranitrate was first prepared and patented in 1894 by the explosives manufacturer Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Sprengstoff A.G. of Cologne, Germany. The production of PETN started in 1912, when the improved method of production was patented by the German government. PETN was used by the German Military in World War I. It was also used in the MG FF/M autocannons and many other weapon systems of the Luftwaffe in World War II.\nProperties.\nPETN is practically insoluble in water (0.01\u00a0g/100\u00a0mL at 50\u00a0\u00b0C), weakly soluble in common nonpolar solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons (like gasoline) or tetrachloromethane, but soluble in some other organic solvents, particularly in acetone (about 15\u00a0g/100\u00a0g of the solution at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, 55\u00a0g/100\u00a0g at 60\u00a0\u00b0C) and dimethylformamide (40\u00a0g/100\u00a0g of the solution at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, 70\u00a0g/100\u00a0g at 70\u00a0\u00b0C). It is a non-planar molecule that crystallizes in the space group \"P\"421\"c\". PETN forms eutectic mixtures with some liquid or molten aromatic nitro compounds, \"e.g.\" trinitrotoluene (TNT) or tetryl. Due to the steric hindrance of the adjacent neopentyl-like moiety, PETN is resistant to attack by many chemical reagents; it does not hydrolyze in water at room temperature or in weaker alkaline aqueous solutions. Water at 100\u00a0\u00b0C or above causes hydrolysis to dinitrate; the presence of 0.1% nitric acid accelerates the reaction.\nThe chemical stability of PETN is of interest, because of the presence of PETN in aging weapons. Neutron radiation degrades PETN, producing carbon dioxide and some pentaerythritol dinitrate and trinitrate. Gamma radiation increases the thermal decomposition sensitivity of PETN, lowers melting point by few degrees Celsius, and causes swelling of the samples. Like other nitrate esters, the primary degradation mechanism is the loss of nitrogen dioxide; this reaction is autocatalytic. Studies were performed on thermal decomposition of PETN.\nIn the environment, PETN undergoes biodegradation. Some bacteria denitrate PETN to trinitrate and then dinitrate, which is then further degraded. PETN has low volatility and low solubility in water, and therefore has low bioavailability for most organisms. Its toxicity is relatively low, and its transdermal absorption also seems to be low. It poses a threat for aquatic organisms. It can be degraded to pentaerythritol by iron.\nProduction.\nProduction is by the reaction of pentaerythritol with concentrated nitric acid to form a precipitate which can be recrystallized from acetone to give processable crystals.\nVariations of a method first published in US Patent 2,370,437 by Acken and Vyverberg (1945 to Du Pont) form the basis of all current commercial production.\nPETN is manufactured by numerous manufacturers as a powder, or together with nitrocellulose and plasticizer as thin plasticized sheets (e.g. Primasheet 1000, Detasheet and Durasheet 1). PETN residues are easily detectable in hair of people handling it. The highest residue retention is on black hair; some residues remain even after washing.\nExplosive use.\nThe most common use of PETN is as an explosive with high brisance. It is a secondary explosive, meaning it is more difficult to detonate than primary explosives, so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at standard atmospheric pressure it is difficult to ignite and burns vigorously), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other secondary explosives such as TNT or tetryl. Under certain conditions a deflagration to detonation transition can occur, just like that of ammonium nitrate.\nIt is rarely used alone in military operations due to its lower stability, but is primarily used in the main charges of plastic explosives (such as C4) along with other explosives (especially RDX), booster and bursting charges of small caliber ammunition, in upper charges of detonators in some land mines and shells, as the explosive core of detonation cord. PETN is the least stable of the common military explosives, but can be stored without significant deterioration for longer than nitroglycerin or nitrocellulose.\nDuring World War II, PETN was most importantly used in exploding-bridgewire detonators for the atomic bombs. These exploding-bridgewire detonators gave more precise detonation compared to primacord. PETN was used for these detonators because it was safer than primary explosives like lead azide: while it was sensitive, it would not detonate below a threshold amount of energy. Exploding bridgewires containing PETN remain in use in current nuclear weapons. In spark detonators, PETN is used to avoid the need for primary explosives; the energy needed for a successful direct initiation of PETN by an electric spark ranges between 10\u201360 mJ.\nIts basic explosion characteristics are:\nIn mixtures.\nPETN is used in a number of compositions. It is a major ingredient of the Semtex plastic explosive. It is also used as a component of pentolite, a castable mixture with TNT (usually 50/50 but may contain more TNT), which is, along with pure PETN, a common explosive for boosters for the blasting work (as in mining). The XTX8003 extrudable explosive, used in the W68 and W76 nuclear warheads, is a mixture of 80% PETN and 20% of Sylgard 182, a silicone rubber. It is often phlegmatized by addition of 5\u201340% of wax, or by polymers (producing polymer-bonded explosives); in this form it is used in some cannon shells up to 30 mm caliber, though it is unsuitable for higher calibers. It is also used as a component of some gun propellants and solid rocket propellants. Nonphlegmatized PETN is stored and handled with approximately 10% water content. PETN alone cannot be cast as it explosively decomposes slightly above its melting point, but it can be mixed with other explosives to form castable mixtures.\nPETN can be initiated by a laser. A pulse with duration of 25 nanoseconds and 0.5\u20134.2 joules of energy from a Q-switched ruby laser can initiate detonation of a PETN surface coated with a 100\u00a0nm thick aluminium layer in less than half of a microsecond.\nPETN has been replaced in many applications by RDX, which is thermally more stable and has a longer shelf life. PETN can be used in some ram accelerator types. Replacement of the central carbon atom with silicon produces Si-PETN, which is extremely sensitive.\nTerrorist and military use.\nTen kilograms of PETN was used in the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing.\nIn 1983, 307 people were killed after a truck bomb filled with PETN was detonated at the Beirut barracks.\nIn 1983, the \"Maison de France\" house in Berlin was brought to a near-total collapse by the detonation of of PETN by terrorist Johannes Weinrich.\nIn 1999, Alfred Heinz Reumayr used PETN as the main charge for his fourteen improvised explosive devices that he constructed in a thwarted attempt to damage the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.\nIn 2001, al-Qaeda member Richard Reid, the \"Shoe Bomber\", used PETN in the sole of his shoe in his unsuccessful attempt to blow up American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. He had intended to use the solid triacetone triperoxide (TATP) as a detonator.\nIn 2009, PETN was used in an attempt by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Deputy Minister of Interior Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, by Saudi suicide bomber Abdullah al-Asiri. The target survived and the bomber died in the blast. The PETN was hidden in the bomber's rectum, which security experts described as a novel technique.\nOn 25 December 2009, PETN was found in the underwear of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the \"Underwear bomber\", a Nigerian with links to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. According to US law enforcement officials, he had attempted to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 while approaching Detroit from Amsterdam. Abdulmutallab had tried, unsuccessfully, to detonate approximately of PETN sewn into his underwear by adding liquid from a syringe; however, only a small fire resulted.\nIn the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula October 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, two PETN-filled printer cartridges were found at East Midlands Airport and in Dubai on flights bound for the US on an intelligence tip. Both packages contained sophisticated bombs concealed in computer printer cartridges filled with PETN. The bomb found in England contained of PETN, and the one found in Dubai contained of PETN. Hans Michels, professor of safety engineering at University College London, told a newspaper that of PETN\u2014\"around 50 times less than was used\u2014would be enough to blast a hole in a metal plate twice the thickness of an aircraft's skin\". In contrast, according to an experiment conducted by a BBC documentary team designed to simulate Abdulmutallab's Christmas Day bombing, using a Boeing 747 plane, even 80\u00a0grams of PETN was not sufficient to materially damage the fuselage.\nOn 12 July 2017, 150 grams of PETN was found in the Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state.\nPETN was used by Israel in the manufacturing of pagers provided to Hezbollah. On September 17, 2024, the pagers detonated, killing 12 people and injuring thousands.\nDetection.\nIn the wake of terrorist PETN bomb plots, an article in \"Scientific American\" noted PETN is difficult to detect because it does not readily vaporize into the surrounding air. The \"Los Angeles Times\" noted in November 2010 that PETN's low vapor pressure makes it difficult for bomb-sniffing dogs to detect.\nMany technologies can be used to detect PETN, including chemical sensors, X-rays, infrared, microwaves and terahertz, some of which have been implemented in public screening applications, primarily for air travel. PETN is one of the explosive chemicals typically of interest in that area, and it belongs to a family of common nitrate-based explosive chemicals which can often be detected by the same tests.\nOne detection system in use at airports involves analysis of swab samples obtained from passengers and their baggage. Whole-body imaging scanners that use radio-frequency electromagnetic waves, low-intensity X-rays, or T-rays of terahertz frequency that can detect objects hidden under clothing are not widely used because of cost, concerns about the resulting traveler delays, and privacy concerns.\nBoth parcels in the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot were x-rayed without the bombs being spotted. Qatar Airways said the PETN bomb \"could not be detected by x-ray screening or trained sniffer dogs\". The Bundeskriminalamt received copies of the Dubai x-rays, and an investigator said German staff would not have identified the bomb either. New airport security procedures followed in the U.S., largely to protect against PETN.\nMedical use.\nLike nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) and other nitrates, PETN is also used medically as a vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions. These drugs work by releasing the signaling gas nitric oxide in the body. The heart medicine \"Lentonitrat\" is nearly pure PETN.\nMonitoring of oral usage of the drug by patients has been performed by determination of plasma levels of several of its hydrolysis products, pentaerythritol dinitrate, pentaerythritol mononitrate and pentaerythritol, in plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42453", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42453", "title": "Kirkendall effect", "text": "Differential diffusion\nThe Kirkendall effect is the motion of the interface between two metals that occurs due to the difference in diffusion rates of the metal atoms. The effect can be observed, for example, by placing insoluble markers at the interface between a pure metal and an alloy containing that metal, and heating to a temperature where atomic diffusion is reasonable for the given timescale; the boundary will move relative to the markers.\nThis process was named after Ernest Kirkendall (1914\u20132005), assistant professor of chemical engineering at Wayne State University from 1941 to 1946. The paper describing the discovery of the effect was published in 1947.\nThe Kirkendall effect has important practical consequences. One of these is the prevention or suppression of voids formed at the boundary interface in various kinds of alloy-to-metal bonding. These are referred to as Kirkendall voids.\nHistory.\nThe Kirkendall effect was discovered by Ernest Kirkendall and Alice Smigelskas in 1947, in the course of Kirkendall's ongoing research into diffusion in brass. The paper in which he discovered the famous effect was the third in his series of papers on brass diffusion, the first being his thesis. His second paper revealed that zinc diffused more quickly than copper in alpha-brass, which led to the research producing his revolutionary theory. Until this point, substitutional and ring methods were the dominant ideas for diffusional motion. Kirkendall's experiment produced evidence of a vacancy diffusion mechanism, which is the accepted mechanism to this day. At the time it was submitted, the paper and Kirkendall's ideas were rejected from publication by Robert Franklin Mehl, director of the Metals Research Laboratory at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). Mehl refused to accept Kirkendall's evidence of this new diffusion mechanism and denied publication for over six months, only relenting after a conference was held and several other researchers confirmed Kirkendall's results.\nKirkendall's experiment.\nA bar of brass (70% Cu, 30% Zn) was used as a core, with molybdenum wires stretched along its length, and then coated in a layer of pure copper. Molybdenum was chosen as the marker material due to it being very insoluble in brass, eliminating any error due to the markers diffusing themselves. Diffusion was allowed to take place at 785\u00a0\u00b0C over the course of 56 days, with cross-sections being taken at six times throughout the span of the experiment. Over time, it was observed that the wire markers moved closer together as the zinc diffused out of the brass and into the copper. A difference in location of the interface was visible in cross sections of different times. Compositional change of the material from diffusion was confirmed by x-ray diffraction.\nDiffusion mechanism.\nEarly diffusion models postulated that atomic motion in substitutional alloys occurs via a direct exchange mechanism, in which atoms migrate by switching positions with atoms on adjacent lattice sites. Such a mechanism implies that the atomic fluxes of two different materials across an interface must be equal, as each atom moving across the interface causes another atom to move across in the other direction.\nAnother possible diffusion mechanism involves lattice vacancies. An atom can move into a vacant lattice site, effectively causing the atom and the vacancy to switch places. If large-scale diffusion takes place in a material, there will be a flux of atoms in one direction and a flux of vacancies in the other.\nThe Kirkendall effect arises when two distinct materials are placed next to each other and diffusion is allowed to take place between them. In general, the diffusion coefficients of the two materials in each other are not the same. This is only possible if diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism; if the atoms instead diffused by an exchange mechanism, they would cross the interface in pairs, so the diffusion rates would be identical, contrary to observation. By Fick's 1st law of diffusion, the flux of atoms from the material with the higher diffusion coefficient will be larger, so there will be a net flux of atoms from the material with the higher diffusion coefficient into the material with the lower diffusion coefficient. To balance this flux of atoms, there will be a flux of vacancies in the opposite direction\u2014from the material with the lower diffusion coefficient into the material with the higher diffusion coefficient\u2014resulting in an overall translation of the lattice relative to the environment in the direction of the material with the lower diffusion constant.\nMacroscopic evidence for the Kirkendall effect can be gathered by placing inert markers at the initial interface between the two materials, such as molybdenum markers at an interface between copper and brass. The diffusion coefficient of zinc is higher than the diffusion coefficient of copper in this case. Since zinc atoms leave the brass at a higher rate than copper atoms enter, the size of the brass region decreases as diffusion progresses. Relative to the molybdenum markers, the copper\u2013brass interface moves toward the brass at an experimentally measurable rate.\nDarken's equations.\nShortly after the publication of Kirkendall's paper, L.\u00a0S.\u00a0Darken published an analysis of diffusion in binary systems much like the one studied by Smigelskas and Kirkendall. By separating the actual diffusive flux of the materials from the movement of the interface relative to the markers, Darken found the marker velocity formula_1 to be\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 and formula_4 are the diffusion coefficients of the two materials, and formula_5 is an atomic fraction.\nOne consequence of this equation is that the movement of an interface varies linearly with the square root of time, which is exactly the experimental relationship discovered by Smigelskas and Kirkendall.\nDarken also developed a second equation that defines a combined chemical diffusion coefficient formula_6 in terms of the diffusion coefficients of the two interfacing materials:\nformula_7\nThis chemical diffusion coefficient can be used to mathematically analyze Kirkendall effect diffusion via the Boltzmann\u2013Matano method.\nKirkendall porosity.\nOne important consideration deriving from Kirkendall's work is the presence of pores formed during diffusion. These voids act as sinks for vacancies, and when enough accumulate, they can become substantial and expand in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Porosity occurs due to the difference in diffusion rate of the two species.\nPores in metals have ramifications for mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, and thus control over their formation is often desired. The equation\nformula_8\nwhere formula_9 is the distance moved by a marker, formula_10 is a coefficient determined by intrinsic diffusivities of the materials, and formula_11 is a concentration difference between components, has proven to be an effective model for mitigating Kirkendall porosity. Controlling annealing temperature is another method of reducing or eliminating porosity. Kirkendall porosity typically occurs at a set temperature in a system, so annealing can be performed at lower temperatures for longer times to avoid formation of pores.\nExamples.\nIn 1972, C. W. Horsting of the RCA Corporation published a paper which reported test results on the reliability of semiconductor devices in which the connections were made using aluminium wires bonded ultrasonically to gold-plated posts. His paper demonstrated the importance of the Kirkendall effect in wire bonding technology, but also showed the significant contribution of any impurities present to the rate at which precipitation occurred at the wire bonds. Two of the important contaminants that have this effect, known as Horsting effect (Horsting voids) are fluorine and chlorine. Both Kirkendall voids and Horsting voids are known causes of wire-bond fractures, though historically this cause is often confused with the purple-colored appearance of one of the five different gold\u2013aluminium intermetallics, commonly referred to as \"purple plague\" and less often \"white plague\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss.\nThe poem tells of the mariner stopping a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony so that the mariner can share his story. The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from amusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style; Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.\nThe \"Rime\" is Coleridge's longest major poem. It is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.\nSynopsis.\nThe poem begins with an old grey-bearded sailor, the Mariner, stopping a guest at a wedding ceremony to tell him a story of a sailing voyage he took long ago. The Wedding-Guest is at first reluctant to listen, as the ceremony is about to begin, but the mariner's glittering eye captivates him.\nThe mariner's tale begins with his ship departing on its journey. Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches the icy waters of the Antarctic. An albatross appears and leads the ship out of the ice jam where it is stuck, but even as the albatross is fed and praised by the ship's crew, the mariner shoots the bird:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe crew is angry with the mariner, believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the Antarctic. However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThey soon find that they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship \"from the land of mist and snow\"; the south wind that had initially blown them north now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is becalmed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAfter a \"weary time\", the ship encounters a ghostly hulk. On board are Death (a skeleton) and the \"Night-mare Life-in-Death\", a deathly pale woman, who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue to the mariner's fate: he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross. One by one, all of the crew members die, but the mariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crew's corpses, whose last expressions remain upon their faces:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nEventually, this stage of the mariner's curse is lifted after he begins to appreciate the many sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as \"slimy things\" earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them (\"A spring of love gush'd from my heart, And I bless'd them unaware\"). As he manages to pray, the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated. It then starts to rain, and the bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and help steer the ship. In a trance, the mariner hears two spirits discussing his voyage and penance, and learns that the ship is being powered supernaturally:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nFinally the mariner wakes from his trance and comes in sight of his homeland, but is initially uncertain as to whether or not he is hallucinating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe rotten remains of the ship sink in a whirlpool, leaving only the mariner behind. A hermit on the mainland who has spotted the approaching ship comes to meet it in a boat, rowed by a pilot and his boy. When they pull the mariner from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot shrieks with fright. The hermit prays, and the mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy laughs, thinking the mariner is the devil, and cries, \"The Devil knows how to row\". Back on land, the mariner is compelled by \"a woful agony\" to tell the hermit his story.\nAs penance for shooting the albatross, the mariner, driven by the agony of his guilt, is now forced to wander the earth, telling his story over and over, and teaching a lesson to those he meets:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAfter finishing his story, the mariner leaves, and the wedding-guest returns home, waking the next morning \"a sadder and a wiser man\".\nThe poem received mixed reviews from critics, and Coleridge was once told by the publisher that most of the book's sales were to sailors who thought it was a naval songbook. Coleridge made several modifications to the poem over the years. In the second edition of \"Lyrical Ballads\", published in 1800, he replaced many of the archaic words.\nInspiration for the poem.\nThe poem may have been inspired by James Cook's second voyage of exploration (1772\u20131775) of the South Seas and the Pacific Ocean; Coleridge's tutor, William Wales, was the astronomer on Cook's flagship and had a strong relationship with Cook. On this second voyage Cook crossed three times into the Antarctic Circle to determine whether the fabled great southern continent Terra Australis existed. Critics have also suggested that the poem may have been inspired by the voyage of Thomas James into the Arctic.\nAccording to Wordsworth, the poem was inspired while Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Wordsworth's sister Dorothy were on a walking tour through the Quantock Hills in Somerset. The discussion had turned to a book that Wordsworth was reading, that described a privateering voyage in 1719 during which a melancholy sailor, Simon Hatley, shot a black albatross.\nAs they discussed Shelvocke's book, Wordsworth proffered the following developmental critique to Coleridge, which importantly contains a reference to tutelary spirits: \"Suppose you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea, and the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime.\" By the time the trio finished their walk, the poem had taken shape.\nBernard Martin argues in \"The Ancient Mariner and the Authentic Narrative\" that Coleridge was also influenced by the life of Anglican clergyman John Newton, who had a near-death experience aboard a slave ship.\nThe poem may also have been inspired by the legends of the Wandering Jew, who was forced to wander the earth until Judgement Day for a terrible crime, found in Charles Maturin's \"Melmoth the Wanderer\", M. G. Lewis' \"The Monk\" (a 1796 novel Coleridge reviewed), and the legend of the \"Flying Dutchman\".\nIt is argued that the harbour at Watchet in Somerset was the primary inspiration for the poem, although some time before, John Cruikshank, a local acquaintance of Coleridge's, had related a dream about a skeleton ship crewed by spectral sailors. In September 2003, a commemorative statue, by Alan B. Herriot of Penicuik, Scotland, was unveiled at Watchet harbour.\nColeridge's comments.\nIn \"Biographia Literaria\", Coleridge wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The thought suggested itself (to which of us I do not recollect) that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts. In the one, incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural, and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions, as would naturally accompany such situations, supposing them real. And real in this sense they have been to every human being who, from whatever source of delusion, has at any time believed himself under supernatural agency. For the second class, subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life ... In this idea originated the plan of the \"Lyrical Ballads\"; in which it was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least Romantic; yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. ... With this view I wrote the \"Ancient Mariner\".\nIn \"Table Talk\", Coleridge was reported as saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mrs. Barbauld once told me that she admired \"The Ancient Mariner\" very much, but that there were two faults in it \u2013 it was improbable, and had no moral. As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some question; but as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own judgement the poem had too much; and that the only, or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination. It ought to have had no more moral than the \"Arabian Nights\"' tale of the merchant's sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well, and throwing the shells aside, and lo! a genie starts up, and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant, because one of the date shells had, it seems, put out the eye of the genie's son.\nWordsworth's comments.\nWordsworth wrote to Joseph Cottle in 1799:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From what I can gather it seems that the Ancient Mariner has upon the whole been an injury to the volume, I mean that the old words and the strangeness of it have deterred readers from going on. If the volume should come to a second Edition I would put in its place some little things which would be more likely to suit the common taste.\nHowever, when \"Lyrical Ballads\" was reprinted, Wordsworth included it despite Coleridge's objections, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Poem of my Friend has indeed great defects; first, that the principal person has no distinct character, either in his profession of Mariner, or as a human being who having been long under the control of supernatural impressions might be supposed himself to partake of something supernatural; secondly, that he does not act, but is continually acted upon; thirdly, that the events having no necessary connection do not produce each other; and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously accumulated. Yet the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed the passion is every where true to nature, a great number of the stanzas present beautiful images, and are expressed with unusual felicity of language; and the versification, though the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully varied, exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of which it is capable. It therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the first of which, namely that of the passion, is of the highest kind) gave to the Poem a value which is not often possessed by better Poems.\nEarly criticisms.\nUpon its release, the poem was criticized for being obscure and difficult to read. The use of archaic spelling of words was seen as not in keeping with Wordsworth's claims of using common language. Criticism was renewed again in 1815\u20131816, when Coleridge added marginal notes to the poem that were also written in an archaic style. These notes or glosses, placed next to the text of the poem, ostensibly interpret the verses much like marginal notes found in the Bible. There were many opinions on why Coleridge inserted the gloss.\nCharles Lamb, who had deeply admired the original for its attention to \"Human Feeling\", claimed that the gloss distanced the audience from the narrative, weakening the poem's effects. The entire poem was first published in the collection of \"Lyrical Ballads\". Another version of the poem was published in the 1817 collection entitled \"Sibylline Leaves\" (see 1817 in poetry).\nInterpretations.\nOn a surface level the poem explores a violation of nature and the resulting psychological effects on the mariner and on all those who hear him. According to Jerome McGann the poem is like a salvation story. The poem's structure is multi-layered text based on Coleridge's interest in higher criticism. \"Like the \"Iliad\" or \"Paradise Lost\" or any great historical product, the \"Rime\" is a work of trans-historical rather than so-called universal significance. This verbal distinction is important because it calls attention to a real one. Like The Divine Comedy or any other poem, the \"Rime\" is not valued or used always or everywhere or by everyone in the same way or for the same reasons.\"\nWhalley (1947) suggests that the Ancient Mariner is an autobiographical portrait of Coleridge himself, comparing the mariner's loneliness with Coleridge's own feelings of loneliness expressed in his letters and journals.\nIn \"\" (1990), Camille Paglia applies a conventionally gendered sexual Freudian psychoanalysis and suggests that the Bridegroom, Wedding-Guest and Mariner all represent aspects of Coleridge: \"The Bridegroom is a masculine persona\" that is \"integrated with society\", and that the Wedding-Guest is an adolescent seeking \"sexual fulfilment and collective joy\", that must merge with the Bridegroom but is unable to because of the appearance of a spectre-self, a \"male heroine\" who \"luxuriates in passive suffering\".\nVersions of the poem.\nColeridge often made changes to his poems and \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" was no exception \u2013 he produced at least eighteen different versions over the years. He regarded revision as an essential part of creating poetry.(p138) The of the poem was in \"Lyrical Ballads\" in 1798. The included a revised text, requested by Coleridge, in which some of the language and many of the archaic spellings were modernised. He also reduced the title to \"The Ancient Mariner\" but for later versions the longer title was restored. The 1802 and 1805 editions of \"Lyrical Ballads\" had minor textual changes. In 1817 included a new version with an extensive marginal gloss, written by the poet. The last version he produced was in 1834.\nTraditionally literary critics regarded each revision of a text by an author as producing a more authoritative version and Coleridge published somewhat revised versions of the poem in his \"Poetical Works\" anthology editions of 1828, 1829, and lastly in 1834\u2014the year of his death. More recently scholars look to the earliest version, even in manuscript, as the most authoritative but for this poem no manuscript is extant. Hence the editors of the edition of \"Collected Poems\" published in 1972 used the 1798 version but made their own modernisation of the spelling and they added some passages taken from later editions.\nThe 1817 edition, the one most used today and the first to be published under Coleridge's own name rather than anonymously, added a new Latin epigraph but the major change was the addition of the gloss that has a considerable effect on the way the poem reads.(p186) Coleridge's grandson E.H. Coleridge produced a detailed study of the published versions of the poem. Over all, Coleridge's revisions resulted in the poem losing thirty-nine lines and an introductory prose \"Argument\", and gaining fifty-eight glosses and a Latin epigraph.(p134)\nIn general the anthologies included printed lists of \"errata\" and, in the case of the particularly lengthy list in \"Sibylline Leaves\", the list was included at the beginning of the volume. Such changes were often editorial rather than merely correcting errors. Coleridge also made handwritten changes in printed volumes of his work, particularly when he presented them as gifts to friends.\nIn popular culture.\nIn addition to being referred to in several other notable works, due to the popularity of the poem, the phrase \"albatross around one's neck\" has become an English-language idiom referring to \"a heavy burden of guilt that becomes an obstacle to success\".\nThe phrase \"Water, water, every where, / Nor any drop to drink\" has appeared widely in popular culture, but usually given in a more natural modern phrasing as \"Water, water, everywhere / \"But not a\" drop to drink\"; some such appearances have, in turn, played on the frequency with which these lines are misquoted.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson, Nick Stahl, Marisa Tomei, and William Mapother. The film centers on the inner dynamics of a family in transition. Matt Fowler (Wilkinson) is a doctor practicing in Maine and is married to Ruth Fowler (Spacek), a music teacher. Their son Frank (Stahl) is involved in a love affair with an older single mother, Natalie Strout (Tomei).\nThe title refers to the rear compartment of a lobster trap known as the \"bedroom\" and how it can hold only two lobsters before the lobsters begin to turn on each other. \"In the Bedroom\" premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. It was theatrically released in limited theatres on November 23, 2001, and grossed $44.8 million against a $1.7 million budget. The film was praised for Field's direction, its screenplay and the performances (particularly those of Spacek, Wilkinson, Stahl and Tomei).\n\"In the Bedroom\" received 5 nominations at the 74th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (for Spacek), Best Actor (for Wilkinson) and Best Supporting Actress (for Tomei). The film also earned Spacek and Wilkinson nominations for Best Actress and Best Actor respectively at the 55th British Academy Film Awards and the 8th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Spacek's performance in the film earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. Moreover, the film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of the year while Spacek's performance was named the best female performance of the year.\nPlot.\nIn coastal Camden, Maine, Matt and Ruth Fowler enjoy a happy marriage and a good relationship with their son Frank, a recent college graduate home for the summer. Frank has fallen in love with a divorced older woman with children, Natalie Strout; Ruth is concerned about the relationship, while Matt thinks it is only a fling. The family struggles to communicate their feelings to one another, especially regarding Frank's relationship and schooling.\nFrank is about to begin graduate school for architecture but is considering staying in town to continue working as a fisherman and to be near Natalie and her kids. Natalie's ex-husband, Richard Strout, tries to find a way into his ex-wife and children's lives, going to increasingly violent lengths to get his intentions across to Natalie, including assaulting Frank.\nFrank rushes to Natalie's home one evening after receiving a frightened phone call from one of her children. He arrives to find the living room trashed and Natalie in distress. She tells him Richard just left, but he returns almost immediately. Natalie takes the boys upstairs, and Frank insists through the locked front door that Richard leave. He feigns doing so, only to break in through the back door with a handgun; in the ensuing scuffle, Frank is shot and killed.\nThough equally devastated, Matt and Ruth grieve in different ways, with Matt putting on a brave face and quickly returning to work, while Ruth becomes reclusive and quiet. The couple retreat with friends Willis and Katie Grinnel to a secluded cottage for a weekend, but Ruth is distant and Matt begins to drink heavily.\nAt Richard's bail hearing, Natalie is pressed by his lawyer over whether she saw the shooting, as she initially testified when police arrived on the scene, and she tearfully shakes her head, as she only heard what happened. The tension between Matt and Ruth increases when their lawyer informs them that because of the change from Natalie's original testimony, Richard was allowed out on bail, and his defense will argue that Frank's death was an accident, meaning Richard will most likely be charged with accidental manslaughter and only serve five to ten years in prison. The couple begin to see Richard around town.\nMatt approaches Natalie at work to check in on her and the two have a well-intentioned but strained conversation. Matt takes the boat out to catch lobsters to feel a connection with Frank, but he struggles with it and is pinched by a lobster, leaving a bleeding wound on one finger which Matt bandages. Natalie approaches Ruth at work and attempts to apologize, but Ruth slaps her before dismissively returning to her work. Natalie leaves in tears. Later that day, Ruth runs into Richard at the grocery store.\nWhen she returns home, an argument erupts between the couple in which they emotionally savage each other; Matt lambastes Ruth for being overbearing in Frank's youth, while Ruth chastises Matt for showing little grief for their deceased son and encouraging his relationship with Natalie because of his own vicarious lust for her. After a young girl selling candy for a fundraiser interrupts them, Matt takes back what he said to Ruth, who apologizes in turn and, breaking down, tells Matt about seeing Natalie and Richard. They embrace and find common ground in their grief. Matt and Willis spend the evening drinking and lamenting the injustice, and Willis asks if the couple have considered moving or doing anything about Richard.\nMatt abducts Richard at gunpoint, saying he's arranged for Richard to jump bail and leave the state, so as to spare them the pain of seeing him in Camden. He forces Richard to pack clothes for warm weather and plants a train schedule in his apartment. He then makes Richard drive them to the Grinnel cabin, where Willis is waiting with another vehicle. He begins to load Richard's belongings, but Matt hesitates, then shoots Richard, killing him. Willis admonishes Matt for not following their plan to kill Richard in the woods, and Matt responds that he couldn't wait. They bury Richard's body deep in the woods but are stuck unexpectedly at a bridge crossing on their return home. Willis laments that this cost them nearly an hour, meaning they will arrive back in town just after sunrise instead of in darkness.\nMatt returns home to find Ruth awake. She asks, \"Did you do it?\" Matt appears troubled and unresponsive. He climbs into bed and turns away from her. She asks if he's okay, and Matt haltingly describes a photo he saw in Richard's apartment of him with Natalie in a loving embrace, but cannot explain why it affected him. At length Ruth gets up to make coffee, calling \"Matt, do you want coffee?\" from the kitchen, but he doesn't answer. Matt removes the bandage from his finger and finds the wound scabbed over.\nProduction.\nPrincipal photography began on 1 June 2000 and completed on 6 July 2000.\nRelease.\n\"In the Bedroom\" made its debut at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. In a 2022 \"The New Yorker\" profile, director Todd Field recalled that when the film was acquired by Miramax Films, he was devastated, concerned that his film would be heavily re-edited by Harvey Weinstein. Field called Tom Cruise, a personal friend (and cousin of \"In the Bedroom\" actor William Mapother), who advised him not to give Weinstein any pushback, allow him to extensively re-edit, wait until the film tested poorly, then remind Weinstein of how well the film was initially received at Sundance. Field followed Cruise's advice and it worked.\nCritic Dennis Lim wrote in \"Village Voice\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Todd Field's debut feature, \"In the Bedroom\", alighted on the snowy peaks of Sundance last January as if from another universe. Here was a small miracle of patience and composure, so starkly removed from everything the festival had come to represent that it seemed almost to herald the overdue coming-of-age of American independent film.\n\"In the Bedroom\" was the first film that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It also received nominations for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Adapted screenplay, more nominations than any film to premiere at Sundance until \"Precious\" in 2009.\nBox office.\n\"In the Bedroom\" was the second highest-grossing film that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival from 2000 to 2009, after \"Napoleon Dynamite\". The film grossed a worldwide total of $44.8 million. It went on to become, at the time, the highest-grossing non-IMAX film in history never to reach the top 10 in a given week, and also one of the most successful films in history, with an expense-to-profit ratio of 1:25.\nCritical reception.\nUpon its release, the film received critical acclaim for its direction, script, and performances, notably from Wilkinson and Spacek. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 141 reviews, with an average score of 8.2/10. The site's consensus states \"Expertly crafted and performed, \"In the Bedroom\" is a quietly wrenching portrayal of grief.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nDavid Edelstein of \"Slate Magazine\" in his review of the film wrote that \"it is the best movie of the last several years\" and described it \"the most evocative, the most mysterious, the most inconsolably devastating\" film. He further mentioned that the effect of the film \"isn't over when you leave the theater\" and that it's \"always going to be there\". He also called \"In the Bedroom\" a \"masterpiece\".\nNeil Norman of \"The Evening Standard\" stated \"It is apparent that Field has not only studied the masters of cinematic understatement, such as Ozu and Bergman, but that he fully understands their processes... Field's achievement is such a perfectly consummated marriage of intent and execution that he need never make another movie. I would not be alone, I think, in hoping he will make many more.\"\nWilliam Arnold of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" compared Field's direction to Kubrick's, saying that it \"manages to feel both highly controlled and effortlessly spontaneous at the same time; and his lifting of the facade of this picturesque, Norman Rockwell setting is carried out with surgical precision\". He further mentioned that \"like Kubrick, Field doesn't make any moral judgments about his characters, and his film remains stubbornly enigmatic. It can be read as a high-class revenge thriller, an ode to the futility of vengeance or almost anything in between.\"\nStanley Kauffmann of \"The New Republic\" wrote, \"\"In the Bedroom\" leaves us with the happy knowledge that with Field the American film scene, continually deplored as scraggly, can boast another admirable directing talent.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" stated in his review that it is \"one of the best-directed films of the year\" and that \"every performance has a perfect tone\". He listed \"In the Bedroom\" as his third best film of the year 2001.\n\"Rolling Stone\"'s Peter Travers called the film \"an uncommonly good movie\" that \"will hit you hard.\" He also mentioned that \"Oscar would be a fool\" if it ignores Spacek and Wilkinson's \"career-crowning performances\".\nAmong the negative reviews of the film include Paul Tatara of CNN mentioning that the film \"flounders\" despite the good performances. Stephen Hunter of \"The Washington Post\" said \"it opens brilliantly\" but goes on to \"self-negating absurdity.\"\nRetrospective lists.\nA. O. Scott included the film in his \"New York Times\" essay \"The most important films of the past decade\u2014and why they mattered.\"\n\"In the Bedroom\" was also chosen by the New York Times Film Critics for their \"Best 1,000 Films of All Time\" list.\nThe March 2023 issue of \"New York\" magazine listed \"In the Bedroom\" alongside \"Citizen Kane\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Dr. Strangelove\", \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", \"The Conversation\", \"Nashville\", \"Taxi Driver\", \"The Elephant Man\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"There Will Be Blood\", \"Roma\", and \"T\u00e1r\", also directed by Field, as \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars\".\nThe March 2024 issue of \"IndieWire\" listed \"In the Bedroom\" and \"T\u00e1r\", also directed by Field, as two of the \"Best Picture Nominees that Deserved to win the Oscar.\"\nHome media.\nThe film was released on DVD in 2002 in a bare-bones edition containing no extras or director's commentary. When Field was asked by the \"New York Times\" why this was the case, he said, \"Once a film is made available to the public, the right of interpretation belongs to the viewer. Unless it's something historical\u2014like \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Raging Bull\"\u2014it seems really silly to have that kind of thing.\"\nFilm archives.\nA 35mm safety print is housed in the permanent collection of the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive.\nPopular culture.\nDuring season four (episode eight, \"Mergers and Acquisitions\") of \"The Sopranos\", Tony shows Carmela the new media center he has installed in the pool house, and she replies that she will pick up \"In the Bedroom\" for them to watch.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42515", "revid": "42341400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42515", "title": "Infinite monkey theorem", "text": "Counterintuitive result in probability\nThe infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys independently and at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, including the complete works of William Shakespeare. More precisely, under the assumption of independence and randomness of each keystroke, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. The theorem can be generalized to state that any infinite sequence of independent events whose probabilities are uniformly bounded below by a positive number will almost surely have infinitely many occurrences.\nIn this context, \"almost surely\" is a mathematical term meaning the event happens with probability 1, and the \"monkey\" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols. Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many independent typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence.\nOne of the earliest instances of the use of the \"monkey metaphor\" is that of French mathematician \u00c9mile Borel in 1913, but the first instance may have been even earlier. Jorge Luis Borges traced the history of this idea from Aristotle's \"On Generation and Corruption\" and Cicero's \"De Natura Deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods), through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, up to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Borel and Arthur Eddington used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of statistical mechanics.\nSolution.\nDirect proof.\nThere is straightforward proof of this theorem. As an introduction, recall that if two events are statistically independent, then the probability of both happening equals the product of the first and second events' probability. For example, if the chance of rain in Moscow on a particular day in the future is 0.4, and the chance of an earthquake in San Francisco on any particular day is 0.00003, then the chance of both happening on the same day is 0.4 \u00d7 0.00003 = 0.000012, assuming that they are indeed independent.\nConsider the probability of typing the word \"banana\" on a typewriter with 50 keys. Suppose that the keys are pressed independently and uniformly at random, meaning that each key has an equal chance of being pressed regardless of what keys had been pressed previously. The chance that the first letter typed is 'b' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter typed is 'a' is also 1/50, and so on. Therefore, the probability of the first six letters spelling \"banana\" is:\n(1/50) \u00d7 (1/50) \u00d7 (1/50) \u00d7 (1/50) \u00d7 (1/50) \u00d7 (1/50) = (1/50)6 = 1/15,625,000,000.\nThe result is less than one in 15\u00a0billion, but \"not\" zero.\nFrom the above, the chance of \"not\" typing \"banana\" in a given block of 6 letters is 1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0(1/50)6. Because each block is typed independently, the chance \"X\"\"n\" of not typing \"banana\" in any of the first \"n\" blocks of 6 letters is:\nformula_1\nAs \"n\" grows, \"X\"\"n\" gets smaller. For \"n\" = 1 million, \"X\"\"n\" is roughly 0.9999, but for \"n\" = 10\u00a0billion \"X\"\"n\" is roughly 0.53 and for \"n\" = 100\u00a0billion it is roughly 0.0017. As \"n\" approaches infinity, the probability \"X\"\"n\" approaches zero; that is, by making \"n\" large enough, \"X\"\"n\" can be made as small as is desired, and the chance of typing \"banana\" approaches 100%. Thus, the probability of the word \"banana\" appearing at some point in an infinite sequence of keystrokes is equal to one.\nThe same argument applies if we replace one monkey typing \"n\" consecutive blocks of text with \"n\" monkeys each typing one block (simultaneously and independently). In this case, \"X\"\"n\" = (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0(1/50)6)\"n\" is the probability that none of the first \"n\" monkeys types \"banana\" correctly on their first try. Therefore, at least one of infinitely many monkeys will (\"with probability equal to one\") produce a text using the same number of keystrokes as a perfectly accurate human typist copying it from the original.\nInfinite strings.\nThis can be stated more generally and compactly in terms of strings, which are sequences of characters chosen from some finite alphabet:\nBoth follow easily from the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma. For the second theorem, let \"E\"\"k\" be the event that the \"k\"th string begins with the given text. Because this has some fixed nonzero probability \"p\" of occurring, the \"E\"\"k\" are independent, and the below sum diverges,\nformula_2\nthe probability that infinitely many of the \"E\"\"k\" occur is 1. The first theorem is shown similarly; one can divide the random string into nonoverlapping blocks matching the size of the desired text and make \"E\"\"k\" the event where the \"k\"th block equals the desired string.\nProbabilities.\nHowever, for physically meaningful numbers of monkeys typing for physically meaningful lengths of time the results are reversed. If there were as many monkeys as there are atoms in the observable universe typing extremely fast for trillions of times the life of the universe, the probability of the monkeys replicating even a \"single page\" of Shakespeare is unfathomably small.\nIgnoring punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, a monkey typing letters uniformly at random has a chance of one in 26 of correctly typing the first letter of \"Hamlet.\" It has a chance of one in 676 (26\u00a0\u00d7\u00a026) of typing the first two letters. Because the probability shrinks exponentially, at 20\u00a0letters it already has only a chance of one in 2620 = 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376 (almost 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01028). In the case of the entire text of \"Hamlet\", the probabilities are so vanishingly small as to be inconceivable. The text of \"Hamlet\" contains approximately 130,000\u00a0letters. Thus, there is a probability of one in 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010183,946 to get the text right at the first trial. The average number of letters that needs to be typed until the text appears is also 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010183,946, or including punctuation, 4.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010360,783.\nEven if every proton in the observable universe (which is estimated at roughly 1080) were a monkey with a typewriter, typing from the Big Bang until the end of the universe (when protons might no longer exist), they would still need a far greater amount of time \u2013 more than three hundred and sixty thousand \"orders of magnitude\" longer \u2013 to have even a 1 in 10500 chance of success. To put it another way, for a one in a trillion chance of success, there would need to be 10360,641 observable universes made of protonic monkeys. As Kittel and Kroemer put it in their textbook on thermodynamics, the field whose statistical foundations motivated the first known expositions of typing monkeys, \"The probability of \"Hamlet\" is therefore zero in any operational sense of an event\u00a0...\", and the statement that the monkeys must eventually succeed \"gives a misleading conclusion about very, very large numbers.\"\nIn fact, there is less than a one in a trillion chance of success that such a universe made of monkeys could type any particular document a mere 79\u00a0characters long.\nAn online demonstration showed that short random programs can produce highly structured outputs more often than classical probability suggests, aligning with Gregory Chaitin's modern theorem and building on Algorithmic Information Theory and Algorithmic probability by Ray Solomonoff and Leonid Levin. The demonstration illustrates that the chance of producing a specific binary sequence is not shorter than the base-2 logarithm of the sequence length, showing the difference between Algorithmic probability and classical probability, as well as between random programs and random letters or digits.\nAlmost surely.\nThe probability that an infinite randomly generated string of text will contain a particular finite substring is\u00a01. However, this does not mean the substring's absence is \"impossible\", despite the absence having a prior probability of 0. For example, the immortal monkey \"could\" randomly type G as its first letter, G as its second, and G as every single letter, thereafter, producing an infinite string of Gs; at no point must the monkey be \"compelled\" to type anything else. (To assume otherwise implies the gambler's fallacy.) However long a randomly generated finite string is, there is a small but nonzero chance that it will turn out to consist of the same character repeated throughout; this chance approaches zero as the string's length approaches infinity. There is nothing special about such a monotonous sequence except that it is easy to describe; the same fact applies to any nameable specific sequence, such as \"RGRGRG\" repeated forever, or \"a-b-aa-bb-aaa-bbb-...\", or \"Three, Six, Nine, Twelve\u2026\".\nIf the hypothetical monkey has a typewriter with 90 equally likely keys that include numerals and punctuation, then the first typed keys might be \"3.14\" (the first three digits of pi) with a probability of (1/90)4, which is 1/65,610,000. Equally probable is any other string of four characters allowed by the typewriter, such as \"GGGG\", \"mATh\", or \"q%8e\". The probability that 100 randomly typed keys will consist of the first 99 digits of pi (including the separator key), or any other \"particular\" sequence of that length, is much lower: (1/90)100. If the monkey's allotted length of text is infinite, the chance of typing only the digit of pi is 0, which is just as \"possible\" (mathematically probable) as typing nothing but Gs (also probability 0).\nThe same applies to the event of typing a particular version of \"Hamlet\" followed by endless copies of itself; or \"Hamlet\" immediately followed by all the digits of pi; these specific strings are equally infinite in length, they are not prohibited by the terms of the thought problem, and they each have a prior probability of 0. In fact, \"any\" particular infinite sequence the immortal monkey types will have had a prior probability of 0, even though the monkey must type something.\nThis is an extension of the principle that a finite string of random text has a lower and lower probability of \"being\" a particular string the longer it is (though all specific strings are equally unlikely). This probability approaches 0 as the string approaches infinity. Thus, the probability of the monkey typing an endlessly long string, such as all of the digits of pi in order, on a 90-key keyboard is (1/90)\u221e which equals (1/\u221e) which is essentially 0. At the same time, the probability that the sequence \"contains\" a particular subsequence (such as the word MONKEY, or the 12th through 999th digits of pi, or a version of the King James Bible) increases as the total string increases. This probability approaches 1 as the total string approaches infinity, and thus the original theorem is correct.\nCorrespondence between strings and numbers.\nIn a simplification of the thought experiment, the monkey could have a typewriter with just two keys: 1 and 0. The infinitely long string thusly produced would correspond to the binary digits of a particular real number between 0 and 1. A countably infinite set of possible strings end in infinite repetitions, which means the corresponding real number is rational. Examples include the strings corresponding to one-third (010101...), five-sixths (11010101...) and five-eighths (1010000...). Only a subset of such real number strings (albeit a countably infinite subset) contains the entirety of \"Hamlet\" (assuming that the text is subjected to a numerical encoding, such as ASCII).\nMeanwhile, there is an \"uncountably\" infinite set of strings that do not end in such repetition; these correspond to the irrational numbers. These can be sorted into two uncountably infinite subsets: those that contain \"Hamlet\" and those that do not. However, the \"largest\" subset of all the real numbers is that which not only contains \"Hamlet\", but that also contains every other possible string of any length, and with equal distribution of such strings. These irrational numbers are called normal. Because almost all numbers are normal, almost all possible strings contain all possible finite substrings. Hence, the probability of the monkey typing a normal number is 1. The same principles apply regardless of the number of keys from which the monkey can choose; a 90-key keyboard can be seen as a generator of numbers written in base 90.\nHistory.\nStatistical mechanics.\nIn one of the forms in which probabilists now know this theorem, with its \"dactylographic\" [i.e., typewriting] monkeys (; the French word \"singe\" covers both the monkeys and the apes), appeared in \u00c9mile Borel's 1913 article \"M\u00e9canique Statique et Irr\u00e9versibilit\u00e9\" (\"Static mechanics and irreversibility\"), and in his book \"Le Hasard\" in 1914. His \"monkeys\" are not actual monkeys; rather, they are a metaphor for an imaginary way to produce a large, random sequence of letters. Borel said that if a million monkeys typed ten hours a day, it was extremely unlikely that their output would exactly equal all the books of the richest libraries of the world; and yet, in comparison, it was even more unlikely that the laws of statistical mechanics would ever be violated, even briefly.\nThe physicist Arthur Eddington drew on Borel's image further in \"The Nature of the Physical World\" (1928), writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events. Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen. It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term \"improbable\" is functionally equivalent to \"impossible\".\nOrigins and \"The Total Library\".\nIn a 1939 essay entitled \"The Total Library\", Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges traced the infinite-monkey concept back to Aristotle's \"Metaphysics.\" Explaining the views of Leucippus, who held that the world arose through the random combination of atoms, Aristotle notes that the atoms themselves are homogeneous and their possible arrangements only differ in shape, position and ordering. In \"On Generation and Corruption\", the Greek philosopher compares this to the way that a tragedy and a comedy consist of the same \"atoms\", \"i.e.\", alphabetic characters. Three centuries later, Cicero's \"De natura deorum\" (\"On the Nature of the Gods\") argued against the Epicurean atomist worldview:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Is it possible for any man to behold these things, and yet imagine that certain solid and individual bodies move by their natural force and gravitation, and that a world so beautifully adorned was made by their fortuitous concourse? He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the \"Annals\" of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them.\nBorges follows the history of this argument through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, then observes that in his own time, the vocabulary had changed. By 1939, the idiom was \"that a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.\" (To which Borges adds, \"Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice.\") Borges then imagines the contents of the Total Library which this enterprise would produce if carried to its fullest extreme:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Everything would be in its blind volumes. Everything: the detailed history of the future, Aeschylus' \"The Egyptians\", the exact number of times that the waters of the Ganges have reflected the flight of a falcon, the secret and true name of Rome, the encyclopedia Novalis would have constructed, my dreams and half-dreams at dawn on August 14, 1934, the proof of Pierre Fermat's theorem, the unwritten chapters of \"Edwin Drood\", those same chapters translated into the language spoken by the Garamantes, the paradoxes Berkeley invented concerning Time but didn't publish, Urizen's books of iron, the premature epiphanies of Stephen Dedalus, which would be meaningless before a cycle of a thousand years, the Gnostic Gospel of Basilides, the song the sirens sang, the complete catalog of the Library, the proof of the inaccuracy of that catalog. Everything: but for every sensible line or accurate fact there would be millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings. Everything: but all the generations of mankind could pass before the dizzying shelves \u2013 shelves that obliterate the day and on which chaos lies \u2013 ever reward them with a tolerable page.\nBorges' total library concept was the main theme of his widely read 1941 short story \"The Library of Babel\", which describes an unimaginably vast library consisting of interlocking hexagonal chambers, together containing every possible volume that could be composed from the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation characters.\nActual monkeys.\nIn 2002, lecturers and students from the University of Plymouth MediaLab Arts course used a \u00a32,000\u00a0grant from the Arts Council to study the literary output of real monkeys. They left a computer keyboard in the enclosure of six Celebes crested macaques in Paignton Zoo in Devon, England from May 1 to June 22, with a radio link to broadcast the results on a website.\nNot only did the monkeys produce nothing but five total pages largely consisting of the letter \"S\", the lead male began striking the keyboard with a stone, and other monkeys followed by urinating and defecating on the machine. Mike Phillips, director of the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technology (i-DAT), said that the artist-funded project was primarily performance art, and they had learned \"an awful lot\" from it. He concluded that monkeys \"are not random generators. They're more complex than that. ... They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there.\"\nApplications and criticisms.\nEvolution.\nIn his 1931 book \"The Mysterious Universe\", Eddington's rival James Jeans attributed the monkey parable to a \"Huxley\", presumably meaning Thomas Henry Huxley. This attribution is incorrect. Today, it is sometimes further reported that Huxley applied the example in a now-legendary debate over Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" with the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, held at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford on 30 June 1860. This story suffers not only from a lack of evidence, but the fact that in 1860 the typewriter was not yet commercially available.\nDespite the original mix-up, monkey-and-typewriter arguments are now common in arguments over evolution. As an example of Christian apologetics Doug Powell argued that even if a monkey accidentally types the letters of \"Hamlet\", it has failed to produce \"Hamlet\" because it lacked the intention to communicate. His parallel implication is that natural laws could not produce the information content in DNA. A more common argument is represented by Reverend John F. MacArthur, who claimed that the genetic mutations necessary to produce a tapeworm from an amoeba are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamlet's soliloquy, and hence the odds against the evolution of all life are impossible to overcome.\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins employs the typing monkey concept in his book \"The Blind Watchmaker\" to demonstrate the ability of natural selection to produce biological complexity out of random mutations. In a simulation experiment Dawkins has his weasel program produce the Hamlet phrase \"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\", starting from a randomly typed parent, by \"breeding\" subsequent generations and always choosing the closest match from progeny that are copies of the parent with random mutations. The chance of the target phrase appearing in a single step is extremely small, yet Dawkins showed that it could be produced rapidly (in about 40 generations) using cumulative selection of phrases. The random choices furnish raw material, while cumulative selection imparts information. As Dawkins acknowledges, however, the weasel program is an imperfect analogy for evolution, as \"offspring\" phrases were selected \"according to the criterion of resemblance to a \"distant ideal\" target.\" In contrast, Dawkins affirms, evolution has no long-term plans and does not progress toward some distant goal (such as humans). The weasel program is instead meant to illustrate the difference between non-random cumulative selection, and random single-step selection. In terms of the typing monkey analogy, this means that \"Romeo and Juliet\" could be produced relatively quickly if placed under the constraints of a nonrandom, Darwinian-type selection because the fitness function will tend to preserve in place any letters that happen to match the target text, improving each successive generation of typing monkeys.\nA different avenue for exploring the analogy between evolution and an unconstrained monkey lies in the problem that the monkey types only one letter at a time, independently of the other letters. Hugh Petrie argues that a more sophisticated setup is required, in his case not for biological evolution but the evolution of ideas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In order to get the proper analogy, we would have to equip the monkey with a more complex typewriter. It would have to include whole Elizabethan sentences and thoughts. It would have to include Elizabethan beliefs about human action patterns and the causes, Elizabethan morality and science, and linguistic patterns for expressing these. It would probably even have to include an account of the sorts of experiences which shaped Shakespeare's belief structure as a particular example of an Elizabethan. Then, perhaps, we might allow the monkey to play with such a typewriter and produce variants, but the impossibility of obtaining a Shakespearean play is no longer obvious. What is varied really does encapsulate a great deal of already-achieved knowledge.\nJames W. Valentine, while admitting that the classic monkey's task is impossible, finds that there is a worthwhile analogy between written English and the metazoan genome in this other sense: both have \"combinatorial, hierarchical structures\" that greatly constrain the immense number of combinations at the alphabet level.\nZipf's law.\nZipf's law states that the frequency of words is a power law function of its frequency rank:formula_3where formula_4 are real numbers. Assuming that a monkey is typing randomly, with fixed and nonzero probability of hitting each letter key or white space, then the text produced by the monkey follows Zipf's law.\nLiterary theory.\nR. G. Collingwood argued in 1938 that art cannot be produced by accident, and wrote as a sarcastic aside to his critics,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0some ... have denied this proposition, pointing out that if a monkey played with a typewriter ... he would produce ... the complete text of Shakespeare. Any reader who has nothing to do can amuse himself by calculating how long it would take for the probability to be worth betting on. But the interest of the suggestion lies in the revelation of the mental state of a person who can identify the 'works' of Shakespeare with the series of letters printed on the pages of a book\u00a0...\nNelson Goodman took the contrary position, illustrating his point along with Catherine Elgin by the example of Borges' \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\",\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What Menard wrote is simply another inscription of the text. Any of us can do the same, as can printing presses and photocopiers. Indeed, we are told, if infinitely many monkeys ... one would eventually produce a replica of the text. That replica, we maintain, would be as much an instance of the work, \"Don Quixote\", as Cervantes' manuscript, Menard's manuscript, and each copy of the book that ever has been or will be printed.\nIn another writing, Goodman elaborates, \"That the monkey may be supposed to have produced his copy randomly makes no difference. It is the same text, and it is open to all the same interpretations.\u00a0...\" G\u00e9rard Genette dismisses Goodman's argument as begging the question.\nFor Jorge J. E. Gracia, the question of the identity of texts leads to a different question, that of author. If a monkey is capable of typing \"Hamlet\", despite having no intention of meaning and therefore disqualifying itself as an author, then it appears that texts do not require authors. Possible solutions include saying that whoever finds the text and identifies it as \"Hamlet\" is the author; or that Shakespeare is the author, the monkey his agent, and the finder merely a user of the text. These solutions have their own difficulties, in that the text appears to have a meaning separate from the other agents: What if the monkey operates before Shakespeare is born, or if Shakespeare is never born, or if no one ever finds the monkey's typescript?\nSimulated and limited conditions.\nIn 1979, William R. Bennett Jr., a professor of physics at Yale University, brought fresh attention to the theorem by applying a series of computer programs. Dr. Bennett simulated varying conditions under which an imaginary monkey, given a keyboard consisting of twenty-eight characters, and typing ten keys per second, might attempt to reproduce the sentence, \"To be or not to be, that is the question.\" Although his experiments agreed with the overall conclusion that even such a short string of words would require many times the current age of the universe to reproduce, he noted that by modifying the statistical probability of certain letters to match the ordinary patterns of various languages and of Shakespeare in particular, seemingly random strings of words could be made to appear. But even with several refinements, the English sentence closest to the target phrase remained gibberish: \"TO DEA NOW NAT TO BE WILL AND THEM BE DOES DOESORNS CAI AWROUTROULD.\"\nRandom document generation.\nThe theorem concerns a thought experiment which cannot be fully carried out in practice, since it is predicted to require prohibitive amounts of time and resources. Nonetheless, it has inspired efforts in finite random text generation.\nOne computer program run by Dan Oliver of Scottsdale, Arizona, according to an article in \"The New Yorker\", came up with a result on 4\u00a0August 2004: After the group had worked for 42,162,500,000\u00a0billion billion monkey-years, one of the \"monkeys\" typed, \"&lt;samp&gt;VALENTINE. Cease toIdor:eFLP0FRjWK78aXzVOwm)-\u2018;8.t&lt;/samp&gt;\" The first 19\u00a0letters of this sequence can be found in \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\". Other teams have reproduced 18\u00a0characters from \"Timon of Athens\", 17 from \"Troilus and Cressida\", and 16 from \"Richard II\".\nA website entitled \"The Monkey Shakespeare Simulator\", launched on 1\u00a0July 2003, contained a Java applet that simulated a large population of monkeys typing randomly, with the stated intention of seeing how long it takes the virtual monkeys to produce a complete Shakespearean play from beginning to end. For example, it produced this partial line from \"Henry IV, Part 2\", reporting that it took \"2,737,850\u00a0million billion billion billion monkey-years\" to reach 24 matching characters:\n&lt;samp&gt;RUMOUR. Open your ears; 9r\"5j5&amp;?OWTY Z0d&lt;/samp&gt;\nDue to processing power limitations, the program used a probabilistic model (by using a random number generator or RNG) instead of actually generating random text and comparing it to Shakespeare. When the simulator \"detected a match\" (that is, the RNG generated a certain value or a value within a certain range), the simulator simulated the match by generating matched text.\nTesting of random-number generators.\nQuestions about the statistics describing how often an ideal monkey is expected to type certain strings translate into practical tests for random-number generators; these range from the simple to the \"quite sophisticated\". Computer-science professors George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman report that they used to call one such category of tests \"overlapping m-tuple tests\" in lectures, since they concern overlapping m-tuples of successive elements in a random sequence. But they found that calling them \"monkey tests\" helped to motivate the idea with students. They published a report on the class of tests and their results for various RNGs in 1993.\nIn popular culture.\nThe infinite monkey theorem and its associated imagery is considered a popular and proverbial illustration of the mathematics of probability, widely known to the general public because of its transmission through popular culture rather than through formal education. This is helped by the innate humor stemming from the image of literal monkeys rattling away on a set of typewriters, and is a popular visual gag.\nScience fiction author R. A. Lafferty used this idea as the basis for his 1970 short story \"https://\" in which a group of immortal monkeys are tasked with typing randomly to write the complete works of Shakespeare. After several billion cycles of the universe expanding, contracting, and repeating the Big Bang, they nearly complete the task.\nA quotation attributed to a 1996 speech by Robert Wilensky stated, \"We've heard that a million monkeys at a million keyboards could produce the complete works of Shakespeare; now, thanks to the Internet, we know that is not true.\"\nThe enduring, widespread popularity of the theorem was noted in the introduction to a 2001 paper, \"Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks: The Internet in the Light of the Theory of Accidental Excellence\". In 2002, an article in \"The Washington Post\" said, \"Plenty of people have had fun with the famous notion that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time could eventually write the works of Shakespeare\". In 2003, the previously mentioned Arts Council\u2212funded experiment involving real monkeys and a computer keyboard received widespread press coverage. In 2007, the theorem was listed by \"Wired\" magazine in a list of eight classic thought experiments.\nAmerican playwright David Ives' short one-act play \"Words, Words, Words\", from the collection \"All in the Timing\", pokes fun of the concept of the infinite monkey theorem.\nIn 2015 Balanced Software released Monkey Typewriter on the Microsoft Store. The software generates random text using the Infinite Monkey theorem string formula. The software queries the generated text for user inputted phrases. However the software should not be considered true to life representation of the theory. This is a more of a practical presentation of the theory rather than scientific model on how to randomly generate text.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was prominent among the Vikings who besieged Paris in 885\u2013886, and he emerged as a war leader among the Norsemen who had secured a permanent foothold on Frankish soil in the valley of the lower Seine after the Siege of Chartres in 911. Charles the Simple, king of West Francia, agreed to the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, which granted Rollo lands between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for Rollo agreeing to end his brigandage, swear allegiance to Charles, convert to Christianity, and pledge to defend the Seine estuary from other Viking raiders.\nRollo's life was recorded by Dudo of St. Quentin. Historians such as W. Vogel, Alexander Bugge, and Henri Prentout have debated whether Dudo's account is historically accurate, and Rollo's origin and life are heavily disputed.\nRollo is first recorded in a charter of 918 as the leader of a group of Viking settlers, and he reigned over the region of Normandy until at least 928. He was succeeded as ruler of the new Duchy of Normandy by his son William Longsword. The offspring of Rollo and his followers, through their intermingling with the local Frankish and Gallo-Roman population, became known as the \"Normans\". After the Norman conquest of England and of southern Italy and Sicily over the following two centuries, their descendants came to rule England, much of Ireland, Sicily and Antioch from the 11th to 13th centuries, leaving behind an enduring legacy in the histories of Europe and the Near East.\nName.\nThe \"Heimskringla\" (written in the 13th century) records that Rolf the Ganger went to Normandy and ruled it, so Rollo is generally presumed to be a Latinisation of the Old Norse name Hr\u00f3lfr, a theory that is supported by the rendition of Hr\u00f3lfr as \"Roluo\" in the \"Gesta Danorum\" by Saxo Grammaticus. It is also sometimes suggested that Rollo may be a Latinised version of another Norse name, \"Hrollaugr\".\nThe 10th-century French historian Dudo in his \"Historia Normannorum\" records that Rollo took the baptismal name Robert. A variant spelling, \"Rou\", is used in the 12th-century Norman French verse chronicle \"Roman de Rou\", which was compiled by Wace and commissioned by King Henry II of England, a descendant of Rollo.\nOrigins and historiography.\nRollo was born in the mid-9th century, as his tomb states he was in his eighties when he died in 933; he was almost certainly born in Scandinavia, either in Denmark or Norway. In part, this uncertainty may result from the unspecific contemporary usage of terms such as \"Vikings\", \"Northmen\", \"Norse\", \"Swedes\", \"Danes\", and \"Norwegians\" ( in medieval Latin).\nThe earliest well-attested historical event associated with Rollo is his part in leading the Vikings who besieged Paris in 885\u2013886 but were fended off by Odo of France.\nSources do not make clear the year of Rollo's birth, but from his activity, marriage, children, and death, the mid-9th century may be inferred.\nAmong biographical remarks about Rollo written by the cleric Dudo of Saint-Quentin in the late 10th century, he claimed that Rollo \"the Dane\" was from \"Dacia\", and had moved from there to the island of Scandza. \"Dacia\" originally referred to the region near the Black Sea, but Dudo identified it with Denmark by making a false etymology between \"Daci\" (Dacians) and \"Dani\" (Danes). One of Rollo's great-grandsons and a contemporary of Dudo was known as Robert the Dane. However, Dudo's \"Historia Normannorum\" (or \"Libri III de moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum\") was commissioned by Rollo's grandson, Richard I of Normandy and while Dudo likely had access to family members and/or other people with a living memory of Rollo, this fact must be weighed against the text's potential biases, as an official biography.\nAccording to Dudo, an unnamed king of Denmark was antagonistic to Rollo's family, including his father \u2013 an unnamed Danish nobleman \u2013 and Rollo's brother Gurim. Following the death of their father, Gurim was killed and Rollo was forced to leave Denmark. Dudo appears to have been the main source for William of Jumi\u00e8ges (after 1066) and Orderic Vitalis (early 12th century), although both include additional details.\nA Norwegian background for Rollo was first explicitly claimed by Goffredo Malaterra (Geoffrey Malaterra), an 11th-century Benedictine monk and historian, who wrote: \"Rollo sailed boldly from Norway with his fleet to the Christian coast.\" Likewise, the 12th-century English historian William of Malmesbury stated that Rollo was \"born of noble lineage among the Norwegians\".\nA chronicler named Beno\u00eet (probably Beno\u00eet de Sainte-More) wrote in the mid-12th-century \"Chronique des ducs de Normandie\" that Rollo had been born in a town named \"Fasge\". This has since been variously interpreted as referring to Faxe in Sj\u00e6lland (Denmark), Fauske in Sykkylven (Norway), or perhaps a more obscure settlement that has since been abandoned or renamed. Beno\u00eet also repeated the claim that Rollo had been persecuted by a local ruler and had fled from there to \"Scanza island\", by which Beno\u00eet probably means Scania (Swedish ). Beno\u00eet says elsewhere in the \"Chronique\" that Rollo is Danish.\nSnorri Sturluson identified Rollo with Hr\u00f3lfr the Walker (Norse ; Danish ) from the 13th-century Icelandic sagas, \"Heimskringla\" and \"Orkneyinga Saga\". Hr\u00f3lf the Walker was so named because he \"was so big that no horse could carry him\". The Icelandic sources claim that Hr\u00f3lfr was from M\u00f8re in western Norway, in the late 9th century and that his parents were the Norwegian jarl Rognvald Eysteinsson ('Rognvald the Wise') and a noblewoman from M\u00f8re named Hildr Hr\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir. However, these claims were made three centuries after the history commissioned by Rollo's own grandson.\nThere may be circumstantial evidence for kinship between Rollo and his historical contemporary Ketill Flatnose, King of the Isles \u2013 a Norse realm centred on the Western Isles of Scotland. Both Irish and Icelandic sources suggest that Rollo, as a young man, visited or lived in northern Scotland, where he had a daughter named Cadlinar ( Kathleen). Icelandic sources name Ketill Flatnose's father as Bj\u00f6rn Gr\u00edmsson, which would imply that the name of Ketill Flatnose's paternal grandfather was . That would be limited, onomastic evidence for a connection to Rollo, whose father (according to Richer) was named Ketill, while Rollo also (according to Dudo) had a brother named Gurim \u2013 a name likely cognate with . In addition, Icelandic sources report that Rollo's ancestral home was M\u00f8re, where Ketill Flatnose's ancestors were also said to have originated. However, there \nare no surviving sources explicitly claiming a connection; was a common name in Norse societies, as were names like Gurim/.\nBiography.\nDudo's chronicle about Rollo seizing Rouen in 876 is supported by the contemporary chronicler Flodoard, who records that Robert of the Breton March waged a campaign against the Vikings, nearly levelling Rouen and other settlements. Eventually, he conceded \"certain coastal provinces\" to them. Although, scholars have debated this and have said that Rollo did not even arrive in West Francia until after the year 876, making this timeline given in Dudo wrong.\nAccording to Dudo, Rollo struck up a friendship in England with a king called \u201c\"Alstem\"\u201d. This has puzzled many historians, but recently this person has been identified as Guthrum, the Danish leader whom Alfred the Great baptised with the name \u201c\"Athelstan\"\u201d, and was recognised as King of the East Angles in 880.\nDudo recorded that when Rollo controlled Bayeux by force, he carried off the beautiful Popa or Poppa, a daughter of Berenger, Count of Rennes. He married her, and she bore his son and heir, William Longsword. Her parentage is uncertain, and may have been invented after the fact to legitimize her son's lineage, as many of the fantastic genealogical claims made by Dudo were. She may have come from any country with which the Norse had contact, as Dudo is a highly unreliable source who may have written his chronicle primarily as a didactic tool to teach courtly values.\nThere are few contemporary mentions of Rollo. In 911, Robert I of France, brother of Odo, again defeated another band of Viking warriors in Chartres with his well-trained horsemen. This victory paved the way for Rollo's baptism and settlement in Normandy. In return for formal recognition of the lands he possessed, Rollo agreed to be baptised and assisted the king in defending the realm. As was custom, Rollo took the baptismal name \u201cRobert\u201d, after his godfather, Robert I.\nThe seal of the agreement was to be a marriage between Rollo and Gisela, daughter of Charles, possibly her legitimate father. Since Charles first married in 907, that would mean that Gisela was at most 5 years old at the time of the treaty of 911 which offered her in marriage. It has therefore been speculated that she could have been an illegitimate daughter. However, a diplomatic child betrothal need not be doubted.\nThe earliest record of Rollo is from 918, in a charter of Charles III to an abbey, which referred to an earlier grant to \"the Normans of the Seine\", namely \"Rollo and his associates\" for \"the protection of the kingdom\". Dudo retrospectively stated that this pact took place in 911 at Saint-Clair-sur-Epte.\nDudo narrates a humorous story not found in other primary sources about Rollo's pledge of fealty to Charles III as part of the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. The attendant bishops urged Rollo to kiss the king's foot to prove his allegiance. Rollo refused, saying \"I will never bow my knees at the knees of any man, and no man's foot will I kiss.\" Instead, Rollo commanded one of his warriors to kiss the king's foot. The warrior complied by raising the king's foot to his mouth as the king was standing, which \"caused the king to topple backward\" much to the amusement of their entourage. On taking his oath of fealty, Rollo divided the lands between the rivers Epte and Risle among his chieftains and settled in the \"de facto\" capital of Rouen.\nGiven Rouen and its hinterland in return for the alliance with the Franks, it was agreed upon that it was in the interests of both Rollo himself and his Frankish allies to extend his authority over Viking settlers. This would appear to be the motive for later concessions to the Vikings of the Seine, which are mentioned in other records of the time. When Charles III was being deposed by Rudolph of France he appealed to Rollo and Ragenold, another one of his Norman allies. With their combined army they marched to his aid in fulfilment of their pledge to the Carolingians, but were stopped at the Oise River by Charles' opponents who traded their cooperation for more territorial concessions. The need for an agreement was particularly urgent when Robert I, successor of Charles III, was killed in 923.\nRudolph was recorded as sponsoring a new agreement by which a group of Norsemen conceded the provinces of the Bessin and Maine. These settlers were presumed to be Rollo and his associates, moving their authority westward from the Seine valley. It is still unclear as to whether Rollo was being given lordship over the Vikings already settled in the region to domesticate and restrain them, or the Franks around Bayeux to protect them from other Viking leaders settled in eastern Brittany and the Cotentin peninsula.\nRollo died sometime between a final mention of him by Flodoard in 928, and 933 \u2013 the year in which a third grant of land, usually identified as being the Cotentin and Avranchin areas, was given to his son and successor William.\nRollo's Role in Norman Conversion to Christianity.\nIn Dudo's story of Rollo, he had a vision in which he was on a high mountain on a Frankish dwelling, where he washed himself in a stream and rid himself of the diseases with which he was infected. He then saw birds of all kinds gather around the mountain and wash themselves in this stream, which remained together as a whole group and found twigs to build nests. This dream was interpreted to mean that the mountain was the church of Christianity, the diseases of which he rid himself were his sins being washed away and his being born again in the baptism of Christianity. The birds of different types represented the different armies and common people having their sins washed away and communities joined. The nests were the walls of the city to be rebuilt, and all were to bow down to Rollo to serve him. Rollo carried this vision with him throughout his journey to Normandy. Once he arrived and was granted land, he dedicated different sections of land to God, saints, and various churches. He was baptised and spread the word of Christianity to his followers.\nThis account of Rollo's role in Christianity has been long debated by scholars. In his 1752 work Microm\u00e9gas, Voltaire wrote that \"peaceful Rollo was the only legislator of his time on the Christian continent\". Recently, Scholars have said that Rollo's law-making was the cause of the civilization of Normandy, not his actual conversion to Christianity. While it has been supported that Rollo and his companions did get baptized, it has been argued that this conversion was only formal at first and paganism was still practiced.\nDescendants.\nRollo's son and heir, William Longsword, and grandchild, Richard the Fearless, forged the Duchy of Normandy into West Francia's most cohesive and formidable principality. The descendants of Rollo and his men assimilated with the Frankish culture and became known as the Normans, lending their name to the region of Normandy.\nRollo was the great-great-great-grandfather of William the Conqueror, the progenitor of House of Normandy in England. As such, Charles III and the current British royal family are descendants of Rollo, albeit not in the direct male line. Henry I of England was the last monarch of the House of Normandy; but his daughter Empress Matilda was ancestral to the English House of Plantagenet and subsequent English monarchs.\nA genetic investigation into the remains of Rollo's grandson Richard the Fearless, and his great-grandson Richard the Good, was announced in 2011 to discern the origins of the historic Viking leader. On 29 February 2016, Norwegian researchers opened Richard the Good's tomb and found a lower jaw with eight teeth in it. However, the skeletal remains in both graves turned out to significantly predate Rollo and therefore are not related to him.\nLegacy.\nRollo's dynasty survived through a combination of ruthless military action and infighting among the 10th-century Frankish aristocracy, which left them severely weakened and unable to resist the Rouen Vikings' growing determination to stay put. After Rollo's death, his direct male descendants continued to rule Normandy until Stephen of Blois became King of England and Duke of Normandy in 1135. The duchy was later absorbed into what became the Angevin Empire following its conquest by Geoffrey of Anjou, who in 1128 had married Matilda of England, herself a descendant of Rollo.\nRollo left a legacy as the founder of Normandy, and his leadership and integration of Viking settlers into the region transformed it into a stable political entity. \nHis lineage played a key role in shaping medieval Europe, as it was William the Conqueror, another descendant of Rollo, who famously led the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Rollo's baptism also marked a significant point in the assimilation of Viking settlers into Frankish society.\nDepictions in fiction.\nRollo is the subject of the 17th-century play \"Rollo Duke of Normandy\", also known as \"The Bloody Brother\", written by John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, Ben Jonson, and George Chapman. The similarities to Rollo are slim, as the play draws inspiration from Herodian's account of the rivalry between Emperor Severus's sons, Geta and Antonine. However, the setting shifts from ancient Rome to medieval France, with the brothers reimagined as Otto and Rollo. Initially appointed as co-rulers of the kingdom, Rollo seizes sole power by killing Otto. His reign, marked by tyranny, ultimately ends when he is killed in retribution for his oppressive rule.\nA character, broadly inspired by the historical Rollo but including many events predating the historical Rollo's birth, played by Clive Standen, is Ragnar Lothbrok's brother in the History Channel television series \"Vikings\". Rollo was staying in West Francia to maintain the Viking's hold on the Seine, as a spot to lead future raids. But, the Franks are able to sway him to betray his brother and go through with an acceptance of land and a marriage to the princess Gisla. There are similarities in this story seen in Dudo's, as Rollo settled in West Francia, although there is no mention of betrayal to his brother. He also in the Dudo account marries Charles the Simple's daughter, which is similar to his marriage of princess Gisla.\nRollo is a character in the video game \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
