The more technical name is sonofusion.\nThe term was coined in 2002 with the release of a report by Rusi Taleyarkhan and collaborators that claimed to have observed evidence of sonofusion. The claim was quickly surrounded by controversy, including allegations ranging from experimental error to academic fraud. Subsequent publications claiming independent verification of sonofusion were also highly controversial.\nEventually, an investigation by Purdue University found that Taleyarkhan had engaged in falsification of independent verification, and had included a student as an author on a paper when he had not participated in the research. He was subsequently stripped of his professorship. One of his funders, the Office of Naval Research reviewed the report by Purdue and barred him from federal funding for 28 months.\nOriginal experiments.\nUS patent 4,333,796, filed by Hugh Flynn in 1978, appears to be the earliest documented reference to a sonofusion-type reaction.\nIn the March 8, 2002 issue of the peer-reviewed journal \"Science\", Rusi P. Taleyarkhan and colleagues at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) reported that acoustic cavitation experiments conducted with deuterated acetone () showed measurements of tritium and neutron output consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with the sonoluminescence pulse, a key indicator that its source was fusion caused by the heat and pressure inside the collapsing bubbles.\nOak Ridge failed replication.\nThe results were so startling that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two independent researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, to repeat the experiment using more sophisticated neutron detection equipment. They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence. A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan \"et al.\", when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.\nAs early as 2002, while experimental work was still in progress, Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University, in a letter to the journal \"Science\"\nexpressed doubts about the claim made by the Taleyarkhan team. In Galonsky's opinion, the observed neutrons were too high in energy to be from a deuterium-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In their response (published on the same page), the Taleyarkhan team provided detailed counter-arguments and concluded that the energy was \"reasonably close\" to that which was expected from a fusion reaction.\nIn February 2005 the documentary series \"Horizon\" commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers, Seth Putterman and Kenneth S. Suslick, to reproduce Taleyarkhan's work. Using similar acoustic parameters, deuterated acetone, similar bubble nucleation, and a much more sophisticated neutron detection device, the researchers could find no evidence of a fusion reaction.\nSubsequent reports of replication.\nIn 2004, new reports of bubble fusion were published by the Taleyarkhan group, claiming that the results of previous experiments had been replicated under more stringent experimental conditions. These results differed from the original results in that fusion was claimed to occur over longer times than previously reported. The original report only claimed neutron emission from the initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas this report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later.\nIn July 2005, two of Taleyarkhan's students at Purdue University published evidence confirming the previous result. They used the same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid and a similar bubble nucleation system. In this report, no neutron-sonoluminescence coincidence was attempted. An article in \"Nature\" raised issues about the validity of the research and complaints from his Purdue colleagues (see full analysis elsewhere in this page). Charges of misconduct were raised, and Purdue University opened an investigation. It concluded in 2008 that Taleyarkhan's name should have appeared in the author list because of his deep involvement in many steps of the research, that he added one author that had not really participated in the paper just to overcome the criticism of one reviewer, and that this was part of an attempt of \"an effort to falsify the scientific record by assertion of independent confirmation\". The investigation did not address the validity of the experimental results.\nIn January 2006, a paper published in the journal \"Physical Review Letters\" by Taleyarkhan in collaboration with researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute reported statistically significant evidence of fusion.\nIn November 2006, in the midst of accusations concerning Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan's equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of LeTourneau University presented two papers at the American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, deuterated benzene, tetrachloroethylene and uranyl nitrate. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of neutron detectors. They claimed a liquid scintillation detector measured neutron levels at 8 standard deviations above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated control liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid. William M. Bugg, emeritus physics professor at the University of Tennessee also traveled to Taleyarkhan's lab to repeat the experiment with his equipment. He also reported neutron emission, using plastic neutron detectors. Taleyarkhan claimed these visits counted as independent replications by experts, but Forringer later recognized that he was not an expert, and Bugg later said that Taleyarkhan performed the experiments and he had only watched.\n\"Nature\" report.\nIn March 2006, \"Nature\" published a special report that called into question the validity of the results of the Purdue experiments. The report quotes Brian Naranjo of the University of California, Los Angeles to the effect that neutron energy spectrum reported in the 2006 paper by Taleyarkhan, et al. was statistically inconsistent with neutrons produced by the proposed fusion reaction and instead highly consistent with neutrons produced by the radioactive decay of Californium 252, an isotope commonly used as a laboratory neutron source.\nThe response of Taleyarkhan \"et al.\", published in \"Physical Review Letters\", attempts to refute Naranjo's hypothesis as to the cause of the neutrons detected.\nTsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of his colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication. In the 2006 \"Nature\" report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he did not give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they should not publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university's press release present his experiment as \"peer-reviewed\" and \"independent\", when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data. In summary, Taleyarkhan's colleagues at Purdue said he placed obstacles to peer review of his experiments, and they had serious doubts about the validity of the research.\n\"Nature\" also revealed that the process of anonymous peer-review had not been followed, and that the journal \"Nuclear Engineering and Design\" was not independent from the authors. Taleyarkhan was co-editor of the journal, and the paper was only peer-reviewed by his co-editor, with Taleyarkhan's knowledge.\nIn 2002, Taleyarkhan filed a patent application on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, while working in Oak Ridge. \"Nature\" reported that the patent had been rejected in 2005 by the US Patent Office. The examiner called the experiment a variation of discredited cold fusion, found that there was \"no reputable evidence of record to support any allegations or claims that the invention is capable of operating as indicated\", and found that there was not enough detail for others to replicate the invention. The field of fusion suffered from many flawed claims, thus the examiner asked for additional proof that the radiation was generated from fusion and not from other sources. An appeal was not filed because the Department of Energy had dropped the claim in December 2005.\nDoubts prompt investigation.\nDoubts among Purdue University's Nuclear Engineering faculty as to whether the positive results reported from sonofusion experiments conducted there were truthful prompted the university to initiate a review of the research, conducted by Purdue's Office of the Vice President for Research. In a March 9, 2006 article entitled \"Evidence for bubble fusion called into question\", \"Nature\" interviewed several of Taleyarkhan's colleagues who suspected something was amiss.\nOn February 7, 2007, the Purdue University administration determined that \"the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted\". Their report also stated that \"vigorous, open debate of the scientific merits of this new technology is the most appropriate focus going forward.\" In order to verify that the investigation was properly conducted, House Representative Brad Miller requested full copies of its documents and reports by March 30, 2007. His congressional report concluded that \"Purdue deviated from its own procedures in investigating this case and did not conduct a thorough investigation\"; in response, Purdue announced that it would re-open its investigation.\nIn June 2008, a multi-institutional team including Taleyarkhan published a paper in Nuclear Engineering and Design to \"clear up misconceptions generated by a webposting of UCLA which served as the basis for the \"Nature\" article of March 2006\", according to a press release.\nOn July 18, 2008, Purdue University announced that a committee with members from five institutions had investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct against Rusi Taleyarkhan. It concluded that two allegations were founded\u2014that Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations were done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as \"independent\" as Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included a colleague's name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research (\"the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Bugg was a desire to overcome a reviewer's criticism\", the report concluded).\nTaleyarkhan's appeal of the report's conclusions was rejected. He said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying science, and that \"all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without merit \u2014 thereby supporting the underlying science and experimental data as being on solid ground\". A researcher questioned by the LA Times said that the report had not clarified whether bubble fusion was real or not, but that the low quality of the papers and the doubts cast by the report had destroyed Taleyarkhan's credibility with the scientific community.\nOn August 27, 2008, he was stripped of his named Arden Bement Jr. Professorship, and forbidden to be a thesis advisor for graduate students for at least the next 3 years.\nDespite the findings against him, Taleyarkhan received a $185,000 grant from the National Science Foundation between September 2008 and August 2009 to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding. During that period his name was listed in the 'Excluded Parties List' to prevent him from receiving further grants from any government agency.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In January 2010, MAS relocated from its longtime home in the historic Villard Houses on 457 Madison Avenue to Steinway Hall on West 57th Street (across the street and east of Carnegie Hall). In July 2014, MAS moved into the Look Building at 488 Madison Avenue, across the street from its former Villard home. In February 2025, MAS moved into one of the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings in the Financial District.\nHistory.\nMAS's advocacy efforts have shaped the city a great deal since its inception in 1893. Some of their early accomplishments include passage of the city's first zoning laws, contributing input to the planning of the city's subway line, and the commissioning of public art throughout the city.\nBy the 1950s, scores of notable Manhattan buildings were lost to redevelopment around the city, and the mission of MAS broadened to include historical preservation. In 1956, the Society successfully lobbied for the passage of the Bard Law, which for the first time allowed cities to take aesthetics, history, and cultural associations into account for zoning laws. The law, named after longtime MAS board member and chief advocate, Albert S. Bard, provided a legal foundation for the New York City Landmarks Law, enacted in 1965.\nIn 1965, public outrage over the destruction of Pennsylvania Station and the Brokaw Mansion helped fuel the Society's mission towards preservation. With like-minded groups, they finally succeeded in establishing New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission, and New York's Landmarks Law.\nIn 2001, after the demise of Trans World Airlines, the original Trans World Flight Center, completed in 1962 and designed by Eero Saarinen, fell into disuse. During this period, the Municipal Art Society succeeded in 2004 in nominating the facility to the National Trust for Historic Preservation\u2019s list of the 11 Most Endangered Places.\nIn June 2007, MAS released with the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance a new documentary about the future of the New York waterfront titled City of Water. In September 2007, the Society opened a major exhibition about Jane Jacobs sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation.\nUrban Center.\nThe Municipal Art Society used to operate out of the Urban Center, a gallery on Madison Avenue. The gallery, founded in 1980, served to champion the fields of urban planning and design in New York, and was also the site of MAS' community development workshops, seminars, lectures, and other educational programs. The Urban Center also included a book store, called Urban Center Books, which specialized in architecture, urban planning, urban design, and environmental studies.\nThe Urban Center was located in Villard Houses from 1980 to 2010 whereupon it moved to West 57th Street.\nThe Center stopped operating when the Municipal Art Society moved to 488 Madison Avenue in 2014.\nAdvocacy.\nThrough its advocacy, MAS protects New York\u2019s legacy spaces, encourages thoughtful planning and urban design, and fosters complete neighborhoods across the five boroughs. Since 2007, the organization has hosted the Livable Neighborhoods Program (LNP). This program helps local leaders in under-resourced communities throughout New York City develop the knowledge and tools that they need to participate effectively in public land use review processes, plus engage in creative, community-based design and planning. Past alumni of the program include, Landmark East Harlem, Brownsville Community Justice Center, and Asian Americans for Equality.\nMAS organizes advocacy campaigns to address issues facing the city, including comprehensive, community-based urban planning, open space, and affordable housing. Recent advocacy campaigns include Fight For Light, Towards Comprehensive Planning, and Greener Corridors for a More Resilient City. MAS is a part of the Alliance for Public Space Leadership (APSL), founded in 2022 along with New York City's chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Open Plans, New Yorkers for Parks, and the Design Trust for Public Space. The alliance, which now includes more than 50 organizations, advocated for the appointment of New York City's first Chief Public Realm Officer. Mayor Erin Adams appointed Ya-Ting Liu to the position in 2023.\nA notable project supported and funded by the Society was the 1980 documentary film \"The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces\" by William H. Whyte. The film was digitally by Anthology Film Archives in 2025, in collaboration with MAS and the Project for Public Spaces. \nTours and programs.\nSince 1956, the Municipal Art Society has offered walking tours about architecture and history across the five boroughs. MAS offers both virtual and in-person tours throughout the year. Additionally, the Municipal Art Society produces programming all across the city throughout the year, including book talks and panel conversations. \nSince 2011, MAS has hosted the New York City chapter of the global Jane's Walk festival, which celebrates the legacy of urbanist Jane Jacobs. Jane's Walk occurs annually the first weekend in May. For the New York City festival, the walks range from any New York City topic, including culture, history, nature and more. There were over 200 walks across the five boroughs included in the 2025 festival, which occurred May 2-4.\nAwards.\nSince 1987, the Municipal Art Society of New York has annually awarded the Brendan Gill Prize to the creator of a creative work that \"best captures the spirit and energy of New York City.\" The award was established in honor of Brendan Gill, New Yorker theater and architecture critic and long-time MAS Board Member. Past honorees have included Sufjan Stevens, Kara Walker, Julia Wolfe, Michael Kimmelman, Questlove, Louis Malle, Andr\u00e9 Gregory, Stephen Maing, John Wilson, Rebecca Solnit, Linda Goode Bryant, Ang Lee, and Gran Fury.\nSince 2001, MAS has annually awarded six MASterworks Awards to exceptional New York City architecture and landscape architecture projects from the previous year. The list of past winners includes Weeksville Heritage Center, David Geffen Hall, Tenement Museum, Domino Park, Brooklyn Public Library, Powerhouse Arts, Little Island, and Moynihan Train Hall.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is part of the Los Angeles Community College District and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges. It serves 22,000 students each semester.\nThe college began with 70 students and 18 faculty members on September 15, 1947. Originally known as the Clarence W. Pierce School of Agriculture, the institution's initial focus was crop cultivation and animal husbandry. Nine years later, in 1956, the school was renamed to Los Angeles Pierce Junior College, retaining the name of its founder, Dr. Pierce, as well as his commitment to agricultural and veterinary study. (Pierce still maintains a working farm for hands-on training.)\nAcademics.\nPierce College offers courses on more than 100 subjects in 92 academic disciplines, and has transfer alliances with most of the universities in the state. Students at the school successfully transfer to UC and CSU schools.\nStudents can pursue any of the 44 associate's degrees or 78 Certificates of Achievement the school offers directly.\nCampus.\nPierce College comprises amidst a dense metropolis, an area larger than many university campuses, including that of UCLA. The grounds are landscaped with more than 2,200 trees, thousands of roses and a botanical garden. The Pierce College farm houses small herds of cattle, sheep, goats, and a small poultry flock for its students to learn from.\nIn June 2017, the Los Angeles Community College District Board Of Trustees voted to grant San Francisco Bay Area-based Pacific Dining a concession for dining services, replacing several small vendors at the five LACCD colleges including Pierce. Pacific Dining has not offered food at Pierce since 2020, resulting in few food options on campus.\nJohn Shepard Stadium.\nBesides hosting the Brahmas' football and women's soccer teams, John Shepard Stadium (current capacity 5,500) also has hosted many outdoor professional sporting events in San Fernando Valley history.\nFrom 1976 to 1979, the San Fernando Valley's first professional sports team, the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League, played their home games at the Pierce College stadium.\nThe Los Angeles Express of the USFL played their last home game here on June 15, 1985. The stadium was expanded to 16,000-person capacity for the game.\nShepard Stadium hosts Nuts for Mutts, an annual dog show and pet fair that raises funds for the New Leash on Life Animal Rescue.\nThe stadium is also the former home stadium of the San Fernando Valley Quakes men's soccer team, which competed in the USL Premier Development League.\nTransport.\nPierce College has its own stop on the Metro G/Orange Line, the Pierce College station, on Winnetka Avenue near Victory Boulevard. It is additionally served by Los Angeles Metro Bus lines 164 and 244.There is also multiple stands for the Access Paratransit service. Pierce College students are eligible for the Metro GoPass program, providing free transportation on the Metro system and several other partner transportation agencies. Pierce College also offers an on-campus shuttle bus for transportation within the campus limits.\nSolar power.\nPierce College has a 191-kilowatt solar generation system that has 1,274 photovoltaic panels and a 360-kilowatt, natural gas co-generation system. This project is the largest of its kind to be undertaken by a U.S. community college, yielding around 4.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1,500 tons over its operating lifetime. The college also has a water retention pond beneath its soccer field, collecting run-off from the adjacent parking lot. The Los Angeles River is nearby to the north. Under propositions A and AA, a new water reclamation facility is also being planned, and the new facilities will meet rigorous Silver-level guidelines set by the U.S. Green Building Council for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.\nOld Trapper's Lodge.\nThe campus is home to Old Trapper's Lodge, California Historical Landmark No. 939.5, an outsider art environment that pays homage to the pioneer upbringing of its creator John Ehn. It represents the life work of John Ehn (1897\u20131981), a self-taught artist who wished to pass on a sense of the Old West, derived from personal experiences, myths, and tall tales. From 1951 to 1981, using his family as models, and incorporating memorabilia, the 'Old Trapper' followed his dreams and visions to create the Lodge and its 'Boot Hill.' The artwork was moved from the original site in Sun Valley, CA, and relocated to the college.\nPierce College Farm and Farm Center.\nThe Pierce College Farm covers of the college with several units for their animals. The farm has a $13 million equestrian center used for agricultural students' education that offers UC transferable courses for important animal and veterinary science programs.\nIn April of every year, the Foundation for Pierce College hosts Farmwalk, an outdoor festival including animals, activities, displays, games and music. The Farmwalk also includes face-painting, a petting-zoo and hayrides for children, all to benefit the Pierce College farm.\nThe Farm Center on the corner of Victory Boulevard and De Soto Avenue is a parcel that was partnered between the Foundation for Pierce College and the McBroom family. The McBroom family have invested nearly $3.5 million to operate the Farm Center which covered utility, labor, insurance, and other operational costs. In October the Foundation sponsored an annual Harvest Festival, featuring pumpkins grown on the Pierce farm, a corn maze, rock climbing, games and rides for the children, a petting zoo, live music and Halloween frights for the whole family. In late December 2014, the Farm Center was evicted from Pierce College, and closed to the public.\nThe college also serves as a Los Angeles County large animal emergency evacuation center. During a slew of fires in Southern California in 2007, Pierce College sheltered and fed more than 150 horses under the direction of the L.A. County Volunteer Equine Response team. The horses were taken in for free at Pierce, and a veterinarian was onsite. Trained volunteers from Pierce's equestrian program assisted the county rescue effort.\nWeather station.\nThe Pierce College weather station was one of the first to cooperate with the government to provide archived data online as well as being one of the oldest operational cooperative weather stations in the country. It was founded under the direction of Professor A. Lee Haines on July 1, 1949, two years after the college was founded. In 2009, the Pierce College Weather Station was awarded $85,000 used to provide the station with new sensors that are rare for co-op stations in the U.S. The Weather Station organizes tours showing their equipment and their functions upon request.\nAthletics.\nThe college athletic teams are nicknamed the Brahmas and currently fields six men's and six women's varsity teams. Pierce competes as a member of the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) in the Western State Conference (WSC) for all sports except football, which competes in Southern California Football Association (SCFA). In 2009 the Pierce Brahmas won the American Pacific Conference, losing in the first round of bowl playoffs to the National Champs Mt. San Antonio College.\nStudent government.\nThe students of Pierce College have established a student body association named Los Angeles Pierce College Associated Student Organization (ASO). The association is required by law to \"encourage students to participate in the governance of the college\".\nThe ASO periodically participates in meetings sponsored by a statewide community college student organization named Student Senate for California Community Colleges. The statewide Student Senate is authorized by law \"to advocate before the Legislature and other state and local governmental entities\".\nNotable alumni and staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42750", "revid": "612852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42750", "title": "Jakarta Enterprise Beans", "text": "Java API for modular construction of enterprise software\nJakarta Enterprise Beans (EJB; formerly Enterprise JavaBeans) is one of several Java APIs for modular construction of enterprise software. EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic of an application. An EJB web container provides a runtime environment for web related software components, including computer security, Java servlet lifecycle management, transaction processing, and other web services. The EJB specification is a subset of the Jakarta EE specification.\nSpecification.\nThe EJB specification was originally developed in 1997 by IBM and later adopted by Sun Microsystems (EJB 1.0 and 1.1) in 1999 and enhanced under the Java Community Process as http:// (EJB 2.0), http:// (EJB 2.1), http:// (EJB 3.0), http:// (EJB 3.1) and http:// (EJB 3.2).\nThe EJB specification provides a standard way to implement the server-side (also called \"back-end\") 'business' software typically found in enterprise applications (as opposed to 'front-end' user interface software). Such software addresses the same types of problem, and solutions to these problems are often repeatedly re-implemented by programmers. Jakarta Enterprise Beans is intended to handle such common concerns as persistence, transactional integrity and security in a standard way, leaving programmers free to concentrate on the particular parts of the enterprise software at hand.\nGeneral responsibilities.\nThe EJB specification details how an application server provides the following responsibilities:\nAdditionally, the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification defines the roles played by the EJB container and the EJBs as well as how to deploy the EJBs in a container. Note that the EJB specification does not detail how an application server provides persistence (a task delegated to the JPA specification), but instead details how business logic can easily integrate with the persistence services offered by the application server.\nHistory.\nBusinesses found that using EJBs to encapsulate business logic brought a performance penalty. This is because the original specification allowed only for remote method invocation through CORBA (and optionally other protocols), even though the large majority of business applications actually do not require this distributed computing functionality. The EJB 2.0 specification addressed this concern by adding the concept of local interfaces which could be called directly without performance penalties by applications that were not distributed over multiple servers.\nThe EJB 3.0 specification (JSR 220) was a departure from its predecessors, following a new light-weight paradigm. EJB 3.0 shows an influence from Spring in its use of plain Java objects, and its support for dependency injection to simplify configuration and integration of heterogeneous systems. EJB 3.0 along with the other version of the EJB can be integrated with MuleSoft-v4 using MuleSoft certified https://. Gavin King, the creator of Hibernate, participated in the EJB 3.0 process and is an outspoken advocate of the technology. Many features originally in Hibernate were incorporated in the Java Persistence API, the replacement for entity beans in EJB 3.0. The EJB 3.0 specification relies heavily on the use of annotations (a feature added to the Java language with its 5.0 release) and convention over configuration to enable a much less verbose coding style. Accordingly, in practical terms EJB 3.0 is much more lightweight and nearly a completely new API, bearing little resemblance to the previous EJB specifications. \nExample.\nThe following shows a basic example of what an EJB looks like in code:\n@Stateless \npublic class CustomerService { \n private EntityManager entityManager; \n public void addCustomer(Customer customer) { \n entityManager.persist(customer); \nThe above defines a service class for persisting a Customer object (via O/R mapping). The EJB takes care of managing the persistence context and the addCustomer() method is transactional and thread-safe by default. As demonstrated, the EJB focuses only on business logic and persistence and knows nothing about any particular presentation.\nSuch an EJB can be used by a class in e.g. the web layer as follows:\n@Named \n@RequestScoped\npublic class CustomerBacking {\n @EJB \n private CustomerService customerService;\n public String addCustomer(Customer customer) {\n customerService.addCustomer(customer);\n context.addMessage(...); // abbreviated for brevity\n return \"customer_overview\";\nThe above defines a JavaServer Faces (JSF) backing bean in which the EJB is injected by means of the codice_1 annotation. Its addCustomer method is typically bound to some UI component, such as a button. Contrary to the EJB, the backing bean does not contain any business logic or persistence code, but delegates such concerns to the EJB. The backing bean does know about a particular presentation, of which the EJB had no knowledge.\nTypes of Enterprise Beans.\nAn EJB container holds two major types of beans:\nSession beans.\nStateful Session Beans.\nStateful Session Beans are business objects having state: that is, they keep track of which calling client they are dealing with throughout a session and of the history of its requests, and thus access to the bean instance is strictly limited to only one client during its lifetime. If concurrent access to a single bean is attempted anyway the container serializes those requests, but via the codice_2 annotation the container can instead throw an exception. Stateful session beans' state may be persisted (passivated) automatically by the container to free up memory after the client hasn't accessed the bean for some time. The JPA extended persistence context is explicitly supported by Stateful Session Beans.\nStateless Session Beans.\nStateless Session Beans are business objects that do not have state associated with them. However, access to a single bean instance is still limited to only one client at a time, concurrent access to the bean is prohibited. If concurrent access to a single bean is attempted, the container simply routes each request to a different instance. This makes a stateless session bean automatically thread-safe. Instance variables can be used during a single method call from a client to the bean, but the contents of those instance variables are not guaranteed to be preserved across different client method calls. Instances of Stateless Session beans are typically pooled. If a second client accesses a specific bean right after a method call on it made by a first client has finished, it might get the same instance. The lack of overhead to maintain a conversation with the calling client makes them less resource-intensive than stateful beans. \nSingleton Session Beans.\nSingleton Session Beans are business objects having a global shared state within a JVM. Concurrent access to the one and only bean instance can be controlled by the container (Container-managed concurrency, CMC) or by the bean itself (Bean-managed concurrency, BMC). CMC can be tuned using the codice_3 annotation, that designates whether a read lock or a write lock will be used for a method call. Additionally, Singleton Session Beans can explicitly request to be instantiated when the EJB container starts up, using the codice_4 annotation. \nMessage driven beans.\nMessage Driven Beans are business objects whose execution is triggered by messages instead of by method calls. The Message Driven Bean is used among others to provide a high level ease-of-use abstraction for the lower level JMS (Java Message Service) specification. It may subscribe to JMS message queues or message topics, which typically happens via the activationConfig attribute of the codice_5 annotation. They were added in EJB to allow event-driven processing. Unlike session beans, an MDB does not have a client view (Local/Remote/No-interface), i.\u00a0e. clients cannot look-up an MDB instance. An MDB just listens for any incoming message on, for example, a JMS queue or topic and processes them automatically. Only JMS support is required by the Java EE spec, but Message Driven Beans can support other messaging protocols. Such protocols may be asynchronous but can also be synchronous. Since session beans can also be synchronous or asynchronous, the prime difference between session- and message driven beans is not the synchronicity, but the difference between (object oriented) method calling and messaging. \nExecution.\nEJBs are deployed in an EJB container, typically within an application server. The specification describes how an EJB interacts with its container and how client code interacts with the container/EJB combination. The EJB classes used by applications are included in the package. (The package is a service provider interface used only by EJB container implementations.)\nClients of EJBs do not instantiate those beans directly via Java's new operator, but instead have to obtain a reference via the EJB container. This reference is usually not a reference to the implementation bean itself, but to a proxy, which dynamically implements either the local or remote business interface that the client requested or a sub-type of the actual bean. The proxy can then be directly cast to the interface or bean respectively. A client is said to have a 'view' on the EJB, and the local interface, remote interface and bean sub-type itself respectively correspond to the local view, remote view and no-interface view.\nThis proxy is needed in order to give the EJB container the opportunity to transparently provide cross-cutting (AOP-like) services to a bean like transactions, security, interceptions, injections, and remoting. As an example, a client invokes a method on a proxy, which will first start a transaction with the help of the EJB container and then call the actual bean method. When the bean method returns, the proxy ends the transaction (i.e. by committing it or doing a rollback) and transfers control back to the client.\nThe EJB Container is responsible for ensuring the client code has sufficient access rights to an EJB. Security aspects can be declaratively applied to an EJB via annotations.\nTransactions.\nEJB containers must support both container managed ACID transactions and bean managed transactions.\nContainer-managed transactions (CMT) are by default active for calls to session beans. That is, no explicit configuration is needed. This behavior may be declaratively tuned by the bean via annotations and if needed such configuration can later be overridden in the deployment descriptor. Tuning includes switching off transactions for the whole bean or specific methods, or requesting alternative strategies for transaction propagation and starting or joining a transaction. Such strategies mainly deal with what should happen if a transaction is or isn't already in progress at the time the bean is called. The following variations are supported:\nAlternatively, the bean can also declare via an annotation that it wants to handle transactions programmatically via the JTA API. This mode of operation is called Bean Managed Transactions (BMT), since the bean itself handles the transaction instead of the container.\nEvents.\nJMS (Java Message Service) is used to send messages from beans to clients, to let clients receive asynchronous messages from these beans. \nMDBs can be used to receive messages from clients asynchronously using either a JMS \nQueue or a Topic.\nNaming and directory services.\nAs an alternative to injection, clients of an EJB can obtain a reference to the session bean's proxy object (the EJB stub) using Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). This alternative can be used in cases where injection is not available, such as in non-managed code or standalone remote Java SE clients, or when it's necessary to programmatically determine which bean to obtain.\nJNDI names for EJB session beans are assigned by the EJB container via the following scheme:\n\"(entries in square brackets denote optional parts)\"\nA single bean can be obtained by any name matching the above patterns, depending on the 'location' of the client. Clients in the same module as the required bean can use the module scope and larger scopes, clients in the same application as the required bean can use the app scope and higher, etc.\nE.g. code running in the same module as the CustomerService bean \"(as given by the example shown earlier in this article)\" could use the following code to obtain a (local) reference to it:\nCustomerServiceLocal customerService =\n (CustomerServiceLocal) new InitialContext().lookup(\"java:module/CustomerService\");\nRemoting/distributed execution.\nFor communication with a client that's written in the Java programming language a session bean can expose a remote-view via an interface annotated with codice_6. This allows those beans to be called from clients in other JVMs which may be running on other systems (from the point of view of the EJB container, any code in another JVM is remote).\nStateless and Singleton session beans may also expose a \"web service client view\" for remote communication via WSDL and SOAP or plain XML. This follows the JAX-RPC and JAX-WS specifications. JAX-RPC support however is proposed for future removal. To support JAX-WS, the session bean is annotated with codice_7, and methods that are to be exposed remotely with codice_8.\nAlthough the EJB specification does not mention exposure as RESTful web services in any way and has no explicit support for this form of communication, the JAX-RS specification does explicitly support EJB. Following the JAX-RS spec, Stateless and Singleton session beans can be declared as root resources via the codice_9 annotation and EJB business methods can be mapped to resource methods via the codice_10, codice_11, codice_12 and codice_13 annotations. This however does not count as a \"web service client view\", which is used exclusively for JAX-WS and JAX-RPC.\nCommunication via web services is typical for clients not written in the Java programming language, but is also convenient for Java clients who have trouble reaching the EJB server via a firewall. Additionally, web service based communication can be used by Java clients to circumvent the arcane and ill-defined requirements for the so-called \"client-libraries\"; a set of jar files that a Java client must have on its class-path in order to communicate with the remote EJB server. These client-libraries potentially conflict with libraries the client may already have (for instance, if the client itself is also a full Java EE server) and such a conflict is deemed to be very hard or impossible to resolve.\nLegacy.\nHome interfaces and required business interface.\nWith EJB 2.1 and earlier, each EJB had to provide a Java implementation class and two Java interfaces. The EJB container created instances of the Java implementation class to provide the EJB implementation. The Java interfaces were used by client code of the EJB.\nRequired deployment descriptor.\nWith EJB 2.1 and earlier, the EJB specification required a deployment descriptor to be present. This was needed to implement a mechanism that allowed EJBs to be deployed in a consistent manner regardless of the specific EJB platform that was chosen. Information about how the bean should be deployed (such as the name of the home or remote interfaces, whether and how to store the bean in a database, etc.) had to be specified in the deployment descriptor.\nThe deployment descriptor is an XML document having an entry for each EJB to be deployed. This XML document specifies the following information for each EJB:\nOld EJB containers from many vendors required more deployment information than that in the EJB specification. They would require the additional information as separate XML files, or some other configuration file format. An EJB platform vendor generally provided their own tools that would read this deployment descriptor, and possibly generated a set of classes that would implement the now deprecated Home and Remote interfaces.\nSince EJB 3.0 (http://), the XML descriptor is replaced by Java annotations set in the Enterprise Bean implementation (at source level), although it is still possible to use an XML descriptor instead of (or in addition to) the annotations. If an XML descriptor and annotations are both applied to the same attribute within an Enterprise Bean, the XML definition overrides the corresponding source-level annotation, although some XML elements can also be additive (e.g., an activation-config-property in XML with a different name than already defined via an codice_14 annotation will be added instead of replacing all existing properties).\nContainer variations.\nStarting with EJB 3.1, the EJB specification defines two variants of the EJB container; a full version and a limited version. The limited version adheres to a proper subset of the specification called EJB 3.1 Lite and is part of Java EE 6's web profile (which is itself a subset of the full Java EE 6 specification).\nEJB 3.1 Lite excludes support for the following features:\nEJB 3.2 Lite excludes less features. Particularly it no longer excludes codice_17 and codice_15/codice_16, but for codice_15 it does not support the \"persistent\" attribute that full EJB 3.2 does support. The complete excluded list for EJB 3.2 Lite is:\nVersion history.\nEJB 4.0, final release (2020-05-22)\nhttps://, as a part of Jakarta EE 9, was a tooling release that mainly moved API package names from the top level package to the top level package.\nOther changes included removal of deprecated APIs that were pointless to move to the new top level package and the removal of features that depended on features that were removed from Java or elsewhere in Jakarta EE 9. The following APIs were removed:\nOther minor changes include marking the Enterprise Beans 2.x API Group as \"Optional\" and making the annotation repeatable.\nEJB 3.2.6, final release (2019-08-23)\nhttps://, as a part of Jakarta EE 8, and despite still using \"EJB\" abbreviation, this set of APIs has been officially renamed to \"Jakarta Enterprise Beans\" by the Eclipse Foundation so as not to tread on the Oracle \"Java\" trademark.\nEJB 3.2, final release (2013-05-28)\nhttp://. Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2 was a relatively minor release that mainly contained specification clarifications and lifted some restrictions that were imposed by the spec but over time appeared to serve no real purpose. A few existing full EJB features were also demanded to be in EJB 3 lite and functionality that was proposed to be pruned in EJB 3.1 was indeed pruned (made optional).\nThe following features were added:\nEJB 3.1, final release (2009-12-10)\nhttp://. The purpose of the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1 specification is to further simplify the EJB architecture by reducing its complexity from the developer's point of view, while also adding new functionality in response to the needs of the community:\nEJB 3.0, final release (2006-05-11)\nhttp:// - \"Major changes\":\nThis release made it much easier to write EJBs, using 'annotations' rather than the complex 'deployment descriptors' used in version 2.x. The use of home and remote interfaces and the ejb-jar.xml file were also no longer required in this release, having been replaced with a business interface and a bean that implements the interface.\nEJB 2.1, final release (2003-11-24)\nhttp:// - \"Major changes\":\nEJB 2.0, final release (2001-08-22)\nhttp:// - \"Major changes\":\n\"Overall goals\":\nEJB 1.1, final release (1999-12-17)\n\"Major changes\":\n\"Goals\" for Release 1.1:\nEJB 1.0 (1998-03-24)\nAnnounced at JavaOne 1998, Sun's third Java developers conference (March 24 through 27)\n\"Goals\" for Release 1.0:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Michael Straczynski", "text": "American writer and filmmaker (born 1954)\nJoseph Michael Straczynski, known as J. Michael Straczynski (; born July 17, 1954) is an American filmmaker and comic book writer. He is the founder of Synthetic Worlds Ltd. and Studio JMS and is known as the creator of the science fiction television series \"Babylon 5\" (1993\u20131998) and its spinoff \"Crusade\" (1999), as well as the series \"Jeremiah\" (2002\u20132004) and \"Sense8\" (2015\u20132018). He is the executor of the estate of Harlan Ellison.\nStraczynski wrote the psychological drama film \"Changeling\" (2008) and was co-writer on the martial arts thriller \"Ninja Assassin\" (2009), was one of the key writers for (and had a cameo in) Marvel's \"Thor\" (2011), as well as the horror film ' (2012), and the apocalyptic horror film \"World War Z\" (2013). From 2001 to 2007, Straczynski wrote Marvel Comics' \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", followed by runs on \"Thor\" and \"Fantastic Four\". He is the author of the ' trilogy of graphic novels, and he has written \"Superman\", \"Wonder Woman\", and \"Before Watchmen\" for DC Comics. Straczynski is the creator and writer of several original comic book series such as \"Rising Stars\", \"Midnight Nation\", \"Dream Police\", and \"Ten Grand\" through Joe's Comics.\nA prolific writer across a variety of media and former journalist, Straczynski is the author of the autobiography \"Becoming Superman\" (2019) for HarperVoyager, the novel \"Together We Will Go\" (2021) for Simon &amp; Schuster, the instructional \"Becoming a Writer, Staying a Writer\" (2021) for Benbella Books, and the novel \"The Glass Box\" (2024) for Blackstone Publishing. In 2020 he was named Head of the Creative Council for the comics publishing company Artists, Writers and Artisans.\nStraczynski is a long-time participant in Usenet and other early computer networks, interacting with fans through various online forums (including GEnie, CompuServe, and America Online) since 1984. He is credited as being the first TV producer to directly engage with fans on the Internet and to allow viewer viewpoints to influence the look and feel of his show (see \"Babylon 5\"'s use of the Internet). Two prominent areas where he had a presence were GEnie and the newsgroup rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated.\nEarly and personal life.\nStraczynski was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and is the son of Charles Straczynski, a manual laborer, and Evelyn Straczynski (n\u00e9e Pate). He was raised in Newark, New Jersey; Kankakee, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Chula Vista, California, where he graduated from high school; and San Diego, California. Straczynski's family religion was Catholic although he is an atheist. He has Polish ancestry and his grandparents lived in the area which today belongs to Belarus and fled to the United States from the Russian Revolution; his father was born in the United States and has lived in Poland, Germany and Russia.\nStraczynski began his postsecondary education at Southwestern College, where he was mentored by Bill Virchis and received an Associate of Arts degree. (Additionally, the two-year institution later awarded him an honorary degree.) Thereafter, he transferred to nearby San Diego State University (SDSU), where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in psychology and sociology (and minors in philosophy and literature). While at SDSU, he wrote for the student newspaper, \"The Daily Aztec\".\nStraczynski met Kathryn M. Drennan while they were at SDSU. They moved to Los Angeles in 1981, married in 1983, separated in 1999, and they were divorced in 2001. Sometime after his separation from Drennan, Straczynski entered into a relationship with Patricia Tallman, whom he had met when she was acting in his 1990s series \"Babylon 5\". She served as CEO and executive producer of Studio JMS in partnership with him; both their relationship and partnership ended in 2013.\nStraczynski has Asperger syndrome. Straczynski had a voluntary vasectomy when he turned 21, and wrote about the experience in the January 28, 1983 edition of the \"Los Angeles Reader\".\nCareer.\n1970s\u20131980s.\nEarly work.\nStraczynski began writing plays, having several produced at Southwestern College and San Diego State University before publishing his adaptation of \"Snow White\" with Performance Publishing. Several other plays were produced around San Diego, including \"The Apprenticeship\" for the Marquis Public Theater. During the late 1970s, Straczynski became the on-air entertainment reviewer for KSDO-FM and wrote several radio plays before being hired as a scriptwriter for the radio drama \"Alien Worlds\". He produced his first television project in San Diego, \"Marty Sprinkle\" for KPBS-TV as well as worked on the XETV-TV project \"Disasterpiece Theatre\". He worked as a journalist for the \"Los Angeles Times\" as a special San Diego correspondent and worked for \"San Diego Magazine\" and \"The San Diego Reader\", and wrote for the \"Los Angeles Herald-Examiner\", the \"Los Angeles Reader, TV-Cable Week,\" and 'People' magazine. Straczynski wrote \"The Complete Book of Scriptwriting\" for \"Writer's Digest\". Published in 1982, the book is often used as a text in introductory screenwriting courses, and is in its third edition.\nHe spent five years from 1987 to 1992 co-hosting the \"Hour 25\" radio talk show on KPFK-FM Los Angeles with Larry DiTillio. During his tenure, he interviewed John Carpenter, Neil Gaiman, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison and other writers, producers, actors and directors. In 2000, Straczynski returned to radio drama with \"The City of Dreams\" for scifi.com.\nWork in animation.\nStraczynski was a fan of the cartoon \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\". He wrote a spec script in 1984 and sent it directly to Filmation. Filmation purchased his script and several others, and hired him on staff. During this time he became friends with Larry DiTillio, and when Filmation produced the \"He-Man\" spinoff \"\", they worked as story editors on the show.\nStraczynski and DiTillio worked to create an animated version of \"Elfquest\", but that project fell through when CBS attempted to retool the show to appeal to younger audiences.\nWhile working on \"Jayce\", Straczynski was hired to come aboard the Len Janson and Chuck Menville project to adapt the movie \"Ghostbusters\" to an animated version called \"The Real Ghostbusters\". When Janson and Menville learned that there was not only a 13-episode order but a 65-episode syndication order as well, they decided that the workload was too much and that they would only work on their own scripts. DIC head Jean Chalopin asked Straczynski to take on the task of story editing the entire 78-episode block as well as writing his own scripts. After the show's successful first season, consultants were brought in to make suggestions for the show, including changing Janine to a more maternal character, giving every character a particular \"job\" (Peter is the funny one, Egon is the smart one, and Winston, the only black character, was to be the driver), and to add kids into the show. Straczynski left at this point, Janson and Menville resuming the story editing job for the second network season. Straczynski then began development on a show called \"Spiral Zone\" but left after only one script, taking his name off the series, because management drastically altered his conception of the show.\nLive action and network shows.\nAfter leaving animation, Straczynski freelanced for \"The Twilight Zone\" writing an episode entitled \"What Are Friends For\" and, for Shelley Duvall's \"Nightmare Classics\", adapting \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", which was nominated for a Writer's Guild Award.\nStraczynski was offered the position of story editor on the syndicated live-action science fiction series \"Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future\". Straczynski constructed a season long arc with lasting character changes and wrote a third of the scripts himself. After one season, the toy company Mattel demanded more input into the show, causing Straczynski to quit. He recommended DiTillio to take over the job as story editor for a second season, but the toy company financing fell through and that season was never produced.\nSoon after, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike began. Straczynski met Harlan Ellison during this time and later became friends with him. Straczynski is an executor of Ellison's collected works.\nAfter the strike ended, the producers of the new \"Twilight Zone\" needed to create more episodes to be able to sell the series into syndication with a complete 65-episode package. They hired Straczynski as executive story editor to fill in the remaining number of needed episodes.\nAfter leaving \"Twilight Zone\", his agent of the time asked him to pitch for the show \"Jake and the Fatman\". Initially wary, Straczynski finally did and was hired on as an executive story consultant under Jeri Taylor and David Moessinger. When Taylor and Moessinger left the show, Straczynski left too as an act of solidarity.\nWhen Moessinger was hired as executive producer for \"Murder, She Wrote\", he offered Straczynski a job as co-producer. Straczynski joined \"Murder, She Wrote\" for two seasons and wrote seven produced episodes. Moessinger and Straczynski moved the protagonist, Jessica Fletcher, from the sleepy Maine town of Cabot Cove to New York City to revitalize the show. The move effectively brought the show back into the top ten from the mid-thirties where it had fallen.\nStraczynski wrote one episode of \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" for Moessinger between the pilot episode for \"Babylon 5\" and the start of its first season.\nStraczynski wrote an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" for the Showtime network, which was nominated for a Writers Guild of America award, and a \"Murder, She Wrote\" movie, \"\", which he produced.\n1990s.\n\"Babylon 5\" and \"Crusade\".\nIn late 1991, Warner Bros. contracted with Straczynski and Doug Netter as partners to produce \"Babylon 5\" as the flagship program for the new Prime Time Entertainment Network.\nStraczynski and Netter hired many of the people from \"Captain Power\", as well as hiring Ellison as a consultant and DiTillio as a story editor. \"Babylon 5\" won two Emmy Awards, back-to-back Hugo Awards, and dozens of other awards. Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes, as well as the pilot and five television movies. The show is a character-driven space opera and features an intentional emphasis on realism in its portrayal of space operations. It pioneered extensive use of CGI for its special effects. \"Babylon 5\" was produced and broadcast for five seasons completing Stracynski's planned story arc.\nHe wrote the outlines for nine of the canonical \"Babylon 5\" novels, supervised the three produced \"Babylon 5\" telefilm novelizations (\"In the Beginning\", \"Thirdspace\", and \"A Call to Arms\"), and is the author of four \"Babylon 5\" short stories published in magazines, not yet reprinted (as of 2008[ [update]]).\nIn 2005, Straczynski began publishing his \"Babylon 5\" scripts. This process ended in June 2008, with the scripts no longer being available from the end of July of that year. His scripts for the television movies were published for a limited time in January 2009.\nJoe's Comics.\nStraczynski has long been a comic fan and began writing comics in the late 1980s. His work in comics includes the adaptations of \"Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Star Trek\", and \"Babylon 5\". In 1999 he created \"Rising Stars\" for Top Cow/Image Comics.\n2000s.\nMarvel Comics.\nMarvel Comics signed him to an exclusive contract, beginning with a run on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", from 2001 to 2007. He took over the series with Volume 2 issue #30 (cover dated June 2001). Straczynski and artist John Romita Jr. crafted an acclaimed story for \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #36 (Dec. 2001) in response to the September 11 attacks. He wrote or co-wrote several major Spider-Man story arcs including \"\", \"\", and the infamous \"One More Day\". He later wrote several other Marvel titles including \"Supreme Power\", \"Strange\", \"Fantastic Four\", \"Thor\", and mini-series featuring the Silver Surfer and a \"What If\" scenario, \"Bullet Points\".\n\"Jeremiah\".\nStraczynski ran \"Jeremiah\", loosely based on the Belgian post-apocalyptic comic \"Jeremiah\", from 2002\u20132004. Straczynski ran the series for two seasons but was frustrated with the conflicting directions that MGM and Showtime wanted from the show, and even used the pseudonym \"Fettes Grey\" for the first time since \"Spiral Zone\" on one of the scripts. In the second season, Straczynski decided to leave the show if things did not improve, and the show ended after two seasons.\n\"Changeling\".\nStraczynski wrote \"Changeling\", a psychological drama film based partly on the \"Wineville Chicken Coop\" kidnapping and murder case in Los Angeles, California. Directed by Clint Eastwood, produced by Ron Howard, and starring Angelina Jolie, the film premiered in 2008 and subsequently received eight nominations for the BAFTA Award, including a nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The first draft script was written in eleven days, after Straczynski figured out \"how to tell\" the story, which ended up being the shooting draft, after Eastwood declined to make any changes. It was optioned immediately by Howard, who at first intended to direct the film but later stepped down after scheduling conflicts.\nAt first, Straczynski expressed disbelief at the story, but spent a year researching the case, compiling over six thousands pages of documentation. Straczynski claimed that 95% of the script's content came from the historical record, and went through the script with Universal Studios's legal department, providing attribution for every scene so the film would be described as \"a true story\" rather than \"based on\" one. On how his journalistic background helped him write the film, Straczynski stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was hugely important. Usually, when you're asked to tell a true story in film, there's already an article or something where the legwork's been done. In this case, there was nothing available. It was all primary research\u2014City Hall archives, county courthouse archives, criminal records, hospital records. I just sifted through stuff, often spending a whole day paging through records just to find one reference.\nFeature screenwriter.\nStraczynski announced on February 23, 2007, that he had been hired to write the feature film adaptation of Max Brooks's novel \"World War Z\" for Paramount Pictures and production company Plan B Entertainment, taking screen story credit on the finished film.\nIn 2008, Straczynski wrote a draft of \"Ninja Assassin\" for Joel Silver, which he completed in just 53 hours. The film was produced by The Wachowskis and released on November 25, 2009.\nStraczynski is credited as \"story writer\" along with Mark Protosevich for the 2011 film, \"Thor\". He makes a cameo appearance in the film, his first appearance in a movie and his second appearance as an actor (the first being \"Sleeping in Light\", the final episode of \"Babylon 5\"). Straczynski was part of the writers room (along with Terry Rossio, Patrick McKay, J. D. Payne, Lindsey Beer, Cat Vasko, T. S. Nowlin, and Jack Paglen) to develop \"Godzilla vs. Kong\", though was uncredited on the final script.\nDC Comics.\nWhen his exclusive contract with Marvel ended, he was announced as the writer for a run on \"The Brave and the Bold\" for DC Comics. He collaborated with artist Shane Davis on an out-of-continuity original graphic novel starring Superman titled \"\". The story features a young Superman and focus on his decision about the role he wants to assume in life. On March 8, 2010, it was announced he would be taking over writing duties for the monthly \"Superman\" title with a story arc entitled \"\", and the \"Wonder Woman\" title, beginning with issues 701 and 601 respectively. Less than a year later he was asked by DC to step away from both titles in order to concentrate on the second volume of \"Superman: Earth One\" and handed them over to Chris Roberson and Phil Hester to finish his Superman and Wonder Woman stories respectively. In 2012, Straczynski wrote \"Before Watchmen: Dr. Manhattan\" drawn by Adam Hughes and \"Before Watchmen: Nite Owl\" drawn by Andy Kubert and Joe Kubert. A second volume of \"Superman: Earth One\" was released later that same year.\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in 2015, DC Comics announced \"The Flash: Earth One\", a new graphic novel of its Earth One line to be written by Straczynski, set to be published in 2016. As of 2023, it has still not been published.\nStudio JMS.\nIn July 2012, J. Michael Straczynski announced the launch of Studio JMS to produce TV series, movies, comics and, in the future, games and web series. On March 27, 2013, Netflix announced they would produce the show \"Sense8\" with Studio JMS and The Wachowskis, which aired on June 5, 2015, and earned a season 2 announcement by August 10, 2015.\nJoe's Comics revival.\nThe Joe's Comics line was revived at Image Comics in 2013 with the launch of \"Ten Grand\" drawn by Ben Templesmith and \"Sidekick\" drawn by Tom Mandrake.\nDynamite Entertainment announced in July 2013 a new 12 issue \"The Twilight Zone\" comic book series penned by Straczynski. The series ran for its projected 12 issues, from December 2013 to February 2015, with art by Guiu Vilanova. Straczynski was announced as the writer of \"\", a 12 issue comic book series from Dark Horse Comics, along with artist Pete Woods.\n\"Sense8\".\n\"Sense8\", a science fiction television series created by Straczynski and The Wachowskis was ordered straight-to-series by Netflix in March 2013. \"Sense8\"'s first season debuted in June 2015 on Netflix, from Studio JMS and Georgeville Television. Straczynski executive produced and co-wrote all 12 episodes of the first season with fellow creators, executive producers, and directors Lilly and Lana Wachowski. In August 2015, Netflix renewed \"Sense8\" for a second season.\n2020s.\nArtists Writers and Artisans.\nIn 2020, Straczynski was named head of the Creative Council for the new comics publishing company AWA, where he was responsible for creating the shared universe used by many of its writers.\nFollowing the publication of his autobiography \"Becoming Superman\" in 2019 from HarperVoyager, the novel \"Together We Will Go\" was published in 2021 by Simon &amp; Schuster's Scout Press, and the instructional \"Becoming A Writer, Staying A Writer\" was published in 2021 by Benbella Books. In 2024 he published the novel The Glass Box (2024) Blackstone Publishing.\nReturn to \"Babylon 5\".\nIn 2022, Straczynski announced that a reboot of his series \"Babylon 5\" was in the works at The CW, with the pilot script written by him. Following a buy-out of the CW by NextStar and strike action by the WGA, work on the project was stalled.\nIn 2023, it was announced by Straczynski that a fully animated \"Babylon 5\" feature film, \"\", had been produced in secret and was scheduled for release in the summer of that year, reunited the surviving members of the original cast. It was released in August 2023.\nReturn to Marvel Comics.\nAcross 2021 and 2022, Straczynski contributed short stories to several anthology and milestone editions of comics published by Marvel Comics, this led to him writing a mystery six issue event mini-series for the publisher. In June 2023, it was announced Straczynski would write the next volume of \"Captain America\", beginning in September of that year. Straczynski also returned to the \"Spider-Man\" franchise around this time, contributing a short story to the anthology mini-series \"Spider-Man: Black Suit &amp; Blood\" as well as penning guest appearances by the character in storylines for \"Captain America\".\nIn October of 2024, Straczynski confirmed on social media that he would be departing \"Captain America\" in December of that year, while the mystery six-part event announced some years back was ultimately revealed that same month as being an anthology series pairing up two different 'unlikely' Marvel characters per issue.\nStrazynski would announce in spring of 2025 that he would be returning to Spider-Man to pen a five issue mini-series, \"Torn\", set during Peter Parker's days spent at Empire State University. The book would launch in October.\nUnrealized projects.\nIn 2004, Straczynski was approached by Paramount Studios to become a producer of the \"\" series. He declined, believing that he would not be allowed to take the show in the direction he felt it should go. He did write a treatment for a new \"Star Trek\" series with colleague Bryce Zabel.\nAfter both \"Babylon 5\" and \"Jeremiah\" ended, Straczynski transitioned to working as a feature film screenwriter. In 2006, he was hired to write a feature film based on the story of King David for Universal by producers Erwin Stoff and Akiva Goldsman. In June 2007, it was announced that Straczynski had written a feature screenplay for the \"Silver Surfer\" movie for Fox, the production of which would depend on the success of the \"\". Additionally, he has written a script for Tom Hanks' Playtone Productions and Universal Pictures called \"They Marched into Sunlight\" based upon the Pulitzer nominated novel of the same name and an outline by Paul Greengrass, for Greengrass to direct, should it get a greenlight.\nIn June 2008, \"Daily Variety\" named Straczynski one of the top Ten Screenwriters to Watch. They announced Straczynski was writing \"Lensman\" for Ron Howard (to whom he had sold a screenplay entitled \"The Flickering Light\"), that he was selling another spec, \"Proving Ground\", to Tom Cruise and United Artists. In October 2008, it was announced that Straczynski was engaged to pen a remake of the science fiction classic \"Forbidden Planet\". In the fall of 2009, it was reported that Straczynski was writing a movie titled \"Shattered Union\" for Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney. The screenplay, based on the video game of that name, concerns itself with a present-day American civil war.\nIn October 2012, Valiant Entertainment announced a live-action feature film adaptation on its comic book series \"Shadowman\", written and executive produced by Straczynski. \"The Flickering Light\", Straczynski's directorial debut, was announced in February 2013, with the World War II drama set to be written and produced by Straczynski through his Studio JMS. Straczynski and Studio JMS optioned Harlan Ellison's short story \"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman, who granted the option only after reading a finished screenplay written by Straczynski.\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in 2014, it was announced that Straczynski and Graphic India would team up with Chernin Entertainment to produce a feature film adaptation of his upcoming graphic novel \"Titans\", to be written and produced by Straczynski, through Studio JMS.\nStraczynski was hired to adapt \"Red Mars\" for Spike TV, based on the Kim Stanley Robinson novels, with Vince Gerardis as producer. In December 2015, Spike TV gave a 10-episode straight-to-series order to \"Red Mars\", set to premiere in January 2017, with Straczynski serving as writer, executive producer, and showrunner through Studio JMS, and production set to begin in Summer 2016. On March 25, 2016 \"Deadline\" reported that Straczynski had left his position as showrunner with Peter Noah replacing him but he too left due to creative differences with Spike. Spike has put the series on hold for further development.\nOn July 30, 2021, Straczynski expressed an interest in becoming showrunner of the BBC Television series \"Doctor Who\", following the departure of Chris Chibnall, confirming his representatives had been contacting the BBC. On August 19, Straczynski confirmed contact had been made with the BBC, but that the organization had already begun their own selection process and were not seeking new candidates. On September 24, 2021, the BBC confirmed former showrunner Russell T Davies would return, which Straczynski commended.\nSelected accolades.\nAn asteroid, discovered in 1992 at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, was honorarily named 8379 Straczynski.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It occurs when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly, emitting a burst of light. The phenomenon can be observed in stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) and multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL). In 1960, Peter Jarman proposed that sonoluminescence is thermal in origin and might arise from microshocks within collapsing cavities. Later experiments revealed that the temperature inside the bubble during SBSL could reach up to . The exact mechanism behind sonoluminescence remains unknown, with various hypotheses including hotspot, \"bremsstrahlung\", and collision-induced radiation. Some researchers have even speculated that temperatures in sonoluminescing systems could reach millions of kelvins, potentially causing thermonuclear fusion; this idea, however, has been met with skepticism by other researchers. The phenomenon has also been observed in nature, with the pistol shrimp being the first known instance of an animal producing light through sonoluminescence.\nHistory.\nThe sonoluminescence effect was first discovered at the University of Cologne in 1934 as a result of work on sonar. Hermann Frenzel and H. Schultes put an ultrasound transducer in a tank of photographic developer fluid. They hoped to speed up the development process. Instead, they noticed tiny dots on the film after developing and realized that the bubbles in the fluid were emitting light with the ultrasound turned on. It was too difficult to analyze the effect in early experiments because of the complex environment of a large number of short-lived bubbles. This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL).\nIn 1960, Peter Jarman from Imperial College of London proposed the most reliable theory of sonoluminescence phenomenon. He concluded that sonoluminescence is basically thermal in origin and that it might possibly arise from microshocks with the collapsing cavities.\nIn 1990, an experimental advance was reported by Gaitan and Crum, who produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL). In SBSL, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the standing wave. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt steel, as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about . Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner temperature of such a bubble well above was postulated. This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments indicate temperatures around .\nProperties.\nSonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a preexisting bubble or may be generated through a process known as cavitation. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure antinode of the standing wave. The frequencies of resonance depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.\nSome facts about sonoluminescence:\nSpectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from , the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas. Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.\nA study describes a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of plasmas. Using argon bubbles in sulfuric acid, the data shows the presence of ionized molecular oxygen O2+, sulfur monoxide, and atomic argon populating high-energy excited states, which confirms a hypothesis that the bubbles have a hot plasma core. The ionization and excitation energy of dioxygenyl cations, which they observed, is . From this observation, they conclude the core temperatures reach at least \u2014hotter than the surface of the Sun.\nRayleigh\u2013Plesset equation.\nThe dynamics of the motion of the bubble is characterized to a first approximation by the Rayleigh\u2013Plesset equation (named after Lord Rayleigh and Milton Plesset):\nformula_1\nThis is an approximate equation that is derived from the Navier\u2013Stokes equations (written in spherical coordinate system) and describes the motion of the radius of the bubble \"R\" as a function of time \"t\". Here, \"\u03bc\" is the viscosity, \"formula_2\" is the external pressure infinitely far from the bubble, \"formula_3\" is the internal pressure of the bubble, formula_4 is the liquid density, and \"\u03b3\" is the surface tension. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the acoustically driven field except during the final stages of collapse. Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble. Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh\u2013Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce. In the static case, the Rayleigh-Plesset equation simplifies, yielding the Young\u2013Laplace equation.\nMechanism of phenomena.\nThe mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown. Hypotheses include: hotspot, bremsstrahlung radiation, collision-induced radiation and corona discharges, nonclassical light, proton tunneling, electrodynamic jets and fractoluminescent jets (now largely discredited due to contrary experimental evidence).\nIn 2002, M. Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism. An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20\u201340% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of water vapor. Chemical reactions cause nitrogen and oxygen to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light. The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the argon flash devices.\nDuring bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on wavelength, contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to recombine with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large ionization energy relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).\nComputations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.\nAny discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.\nOther proposals.\nQuantum explanations.\nAn unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist Julian Schwinger and more thoroughly considered in a paper by Claudia Eberlein of the University of Sussex. Eberlein's paper suggests that the light in sonoluminescence is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to Hawking radiation, the radiation generated at the event horizon of black holes. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains virtual particles, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This is related to the Unruh effect or the Casimir effect. The argument has been made that sonoluminescence releases too large an amount of energy and releases the energy on too short a time scale to be consistent with the vacuum energy explanation, although other credible sources argue the vacuum energy explanation might yet prove to be correct.\nNuclear reactions.\nSome have argued that the Rayleigh\u2013Plesset equation described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 kelvins. Some research claims to have measured temperatures as high as 100,000 kelvins and speculates temperatures could reach into the millions of kelvins. Temperatures this high could cause thermonuclear fusion. This possibility is sometimes referred to as bubble fusion and is likened to the implosion design used in the fusion component of thermonuclear weapons.\nExperiments in 2002 and 2005 by R. P. Taleyarkhan using deuterated acetone showed measurements of tritium and neutron output consistent with fusion. However, the papers were considered low quality and there were doubts cast by a report about the author's scientific misconduct. This made the report lose credibility among the scientific community.\nOn January 27, 2006, researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute claimed to have produced fusion in sonoluminescence experiments.\nBiological sonoluminescence.\nPistol shrimp (also called \"snapping shrimp\") produce a type of cavitation luminescence from a collapsing bubble caused by quickly snapping its claw. The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4\u00a0cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour (97\u00a0km/h) and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. The light produced is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. The light and heat produced by the bubble may have no direct significance, as it is the shockwave produced by the rapidly collapsing bubble which these shrimp use to stun or kill prey. However, it is the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect and was whimsically dubbed \"shrimpoluminescence\" upon its discovery in 2001. It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the mantis shrimp, contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.\nA mechanical device with 3D printed snapper claw at five times the actual size was also reported to emit light in a similar fashion, this bioinspired design was based on the snapping shrimp snapper claw molt shed from an \"Alpheus formosus\", the striped snapping shrimp.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was established in 1388. It closed in 1798 before being re-established in 1919. It is now one of the largest universities in Germany with around 45,187 students. The University of Cologne is a member of the German U15 association of major research-intensive universities and was a university of excellence as part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative from 2012 to 2019. It is consistently ranked among the top 20 German universities in the world rankings. \nThe University of Cologne has 5 Clusters of Excellence: CECAD Cluster of Excellence for Aging Research, Cluster of Excellence ECONtribute: Markets &amp; Public Policy, CEPLAS Cluster of Excellence for Plant Sciences, ML4Q Cluster of Excellence Matter and Light for Quantum Information and DYNAVERSE Cluster of Excellence. As of 2025, among its notable alumni, faculty and researchers are 5 Nobel Laureates, 11 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, 8 Humboldt Professorship winners, and 2 Humboldt Research Awards winners. \nHistory.\n1388\u20131798.\nThe University of Cologne was established in 1388 as the fourth university in the Holy Roman Empire, after the Charles University of Prague (1348), the University of Vienna (1365) and the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg (1386). The charter was signed by Pope Urban VI. The university began teaching on 6 January 1389, and operated for several hundred years.\nIn 1798, the university was abolished by the French First Republic, which had invaded Cologne in 1794, as many universities across France were abolished under the new French constitution. The last rector Ferdinand Franz Wallraf was able to preserve the university's Great Seal, which is now in use again.\n1919\u2013today.\nIn 1919, the Prussian government endorsed a decision by the Cologne City Council to re-establish the university. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which contemporaneously reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. On 29 May 1919, the Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer signed the charter of the new university.\nAt that point, the new university was located in Neustadt-S\u00fcd, but relocated to its current campus in Lindenthal on 2 November 1934. The old premises are now being used by the TH K\u00f6ln \u2013 University of Applied Sciences.\nInitially, the university was composed of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences (successor to the Institutes of Commerce and of Communal and Social Administration) and the Faculty of Medicine (successor to the Academy of Medicine). In 1920, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts were added, from which the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was separated in 1955 to form an independent Faculty. In 1980, the two Cologne departments of the Rhineland School of Education were attached to the university as the Faculties of Education and of Special Education. In 1988, the university became a founding member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), today's Global Alliance in Management Education.\nThe university is regularly ranked at the top of national and international law and business rankings (see Rankings).\nOrganization.\nThe University of Cologne is a statutory corporation (K\u00f6rperschaft des \u00f6ffentlichen Rechts), operated by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nFaculties.\nThe university is divided into six Faculties, which together offer 137 degree programmes. The Faculties are those of Management, Economics and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine (with the affiliated University Hospital Cologne), Arts and Humanities, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and Human Sciences.\nRectors.\nOn 10 May 2023, Joybrato Mukherjee was elected as Rector of the .\nProfile.\nThe University of Cologne is a member of the association German U15 e.V., an association of fifteen major research-intensive and leading medical universities in Germany with a full disciplinary spectrum.\nEspecially the Faculties of law and economics are renowned and leading in Germany. Leading researchers are affiliated to Cologne, including Angelika Nu\u00dfberger, Thomas von Danwitz, Claus Kre\u00df, Martin Henssler, Ulrich Preis, Heinz-Peter Mansel.\nApart from these, affiliated persons with the university have won various awards, including the Max Planck Research Award, the Cologne Innovation Prize (City of Cologne), the Postbank Finance Award (Deutsche Postbank), the Ernst Jung Prize in Medicine (Jung Foundation), the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, the Wilhelm Vaillant Prize (Wilhlem Vaillant Foundation), the Heinz Maier Leibnitz Prize (DFG), the Alfried Krupp Prize for the Advancement of Young Professors, the Innovation Prize of the State of NRW, and the Karl Arnold Prize (North Rhine-Westphalia Academy of Sciences and Arts).\nName.\nThe university did not have a name for a long time, except for the medieval name \"universitas studii s[an]c[ta]e civitatis coloniensis\" (see university\u2019s seal) or the new name \"Cologne University\". Both names emphasize that the university was an institution of the \"city of Cologne\". Josef Kroll, Rector of the university from 1945 to 1949, introduced the official name \"University of Cologne\". Kroll had already taken the initiative in his first term of office in the early 1930s.\nOrganization and faculties.\nThe Rectorate is responsible for the governance and management of the university. It consists of the Rector as Chairperson (Joybrato Mukherjee), six Vice-Rectors and the Chancellor (Karsten Gerlof). The Rectorate is elected by the University Election Assembly, in which the Senate and the University Council exercise equal voting power; the first term of office is at least six years and subsequent terms of office at least four years. The Rector is Chairperson of the Rectorate and the Senate of the University.\nThe university is divided into the following six Faculties:\n\"WS 2023/24, according to the university publication 'Zahlen Daten Fakten 2023\"' \"(as of March 2025), main and part-time students, excluding doctoral students, incl. short-term students\"\nOn 20 July 2005, the University Senate approved a concept for the reorganization of the Faculties. The concept led to the dissolution of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Curative Education and the founding of a new \u2018sixth\u2019 Faculty, the \"Faculty of Human Sciences\". The representatives of the didactic subjects, who had previously worked mainly at the Faculty of Education, were assigned to the Faculties corresponding to their subject as a separate subject group for didactics (for example \"Biology and its didactics\", \"Chemistry and its didactics\" as a new didactic subject group at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences), while the new \"Faculty of Human Sciences\" mainly retained the pedagogical, curative education and psychology subjects or transferred them from the Faculty of Arts and Humanities and the Faculty of Education. The reorganization of the Faculties was officially implemented on 1 January 2007 with the establishment of the corresponding committees. In 2010, the Center for Teacher Education was founded, which was given extensive responsibilities in the organization and coordination of teacher training degree programmes as part of the restructuring of teacher training in North Rhine-Westphalia.\nSpecial funding for research.\nClusters of Excellence / Excellence Strategy of the German federal and state governments.\nOn 5 June 2025, the University of Cologne and the non-profit Alfred Landecker Foundation, founded by the Reimann family, signed a cooperation agreement to establish the Adenauer School of Government (ASG). The aim of the ASG is to establish itself as a leading, non-partisan center for public policy, governance and administrative sciences that helps to shape relevant developments in economics and other research fields. The school will be funded for an unlimited term, with an initial budget of ten million euros per year.\nCooperation with major research institutions.\nSome University of Cologne professors are also members of major research institutions:\nUniversity Award for outstanding achievements.\nEach year, the University of Cologne recognizes outstanding achievements in the categories research, teaching and learning as well as administration.\nSchmittmann Wahlen Scholarship.\nThis scholarship is awarded to doctoral candidates. The scholarship is awarded in honour of professor Benedikt Schmittmann (1872\u20131939), a professor at the University of Cologne.\nGerhard Michel Scholarship.\nIn 2003, a former employee in the International Office, who was responsible for studies abroad, set up a university scholarship fund; thanks to donations from former international scholarship holders and friends of internationalization, scholarships can be awarded annually for study visits at partner universities that offer a fee waiver.\nCologne University Foundation.\nThe Cologne University Foundation was established in 2019 to promote early-career researchers, research and academic projects. The foundation manages private donations to the university, which promote the transfer of knowledge to society.\nThird-party funding.\nThe volume of third-party funding was 239.2 million euros in 2023, of which 103.9 million euros was allocated to the Faculty of Medicine. The German Research Foundation was by far the largest provider of third-party funding with around 101.5 million euros. Other third-party funders in 2023 were the EU (16.9 million euros), the federal government (42.8 million euros), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (21.7 million euros), foundations (17.2 million euros), industry (29.9 million euros) and other third-party funders (9.2 million euros).\nEndowed professorships.\nThe university has acquired a number of endowed professorships, some of which have been established on a long-term basis or only for a few years and are then funded by the state.\nTeaching.\nThe University of Cologne is a research-orientated comprehensive university. With 137 degree programmes, the university offers a wide range of study and research opportunities. The teaching degree programmes make up a total of around 45%. The largest degree programmes are Law, Human Medicine and Business Administration.\nIn January 2022, the University of Cologne published its mission statement teaching and learning, which describes the university\u2019s ambitions and serves as a basis for the further development of teaching and learning offers. Based on the mission statement for teaching and learning, the University of Cologne has developed a quality management system that involves and is shaped by all status groups. The Accreditation Council awarded a \u2018System Accreditation\u2019 quality seal to the University of Cologne for its QM system that serves to regularly evaluate and further develop the university's degree programmes. The Vice-Rectorate for Teaching and Studies is headed by Beatrix Busse.\nStudent representation.\nThe students of the university are represented by student members in the various university committees, such as the Senate. These members are directly elected in annual elections or appointed by directly elected members from higher-level bodies. Due to the legal requirements of Section 11 subsection 2 of the Higher Education Act NRW, students do not form a majority in most committees and can be outvoted by professorial members and other status groups.\nIn contrast, the constituted student body is a statutory body under public law of the university and represents student interests. The central bodies are the student parliament with its 51 elected members and the student union (AStA) appointed by it as the executive body. The most important tasks of the student body are to represent the student interests in the university and society, to participate in the political discourse of the university and to promote culture, sport and political education. In order to fulfil these tasks, the student body levies a fee from the students, which is collected together with the fee for the K\u00f6lner Studierendenwerk as a course and tuition fee. In the winter semester 2024/25, this amounted to \u20ac304.25, of which about 36% was allocated to the Studierendenwerk and 58% to the semester ticket; the AStA is responsible for negotiating the price of the semester ticket with the K\u00f6lner Verkehrs-Betriebe (KVB). The remaining 6% was distributed by the student body to its own projects and salaries as well as to University Sport Cologne. The AStA offers a wide range of services, including counselling and complaints offices, a bicycle repair shop, a tool rental service, the campus garden and countless cultural and informative events such as lectures, museum tours, the long study nights and the \u2018festival contre le racisme\u2019.\nIn addition to the general representation of student interests, the student body also has several autonomous departments such as the autonomous parents\u2019 department or the autonomous internationals' department; these departments represent special status groups within the student body.\nAt Faculty level, the student associations look after the interests of their respective students. Depending on the Faculty, there is either joint student association for all students in the Faculty or a two-tier system consisting of a departmental and a Faculty representation. In addition to providing subject-specific advice and representing students\u2019 interests to lecturers, providing support to first-semester students is one of the main tasks of the student associations.\nInternationalization.\nThe International Office is responsible for the university\u2019s international relations (offering support for international students and visiting scholars and scientists, study and research opportunities abroad, university partnerships, international marketing) at university level and the Centres for International Relations at Faculty level (centralized-decentralized organizational concept). \nThe university has been operating an office in Beijing since the beginning of 2007 (official inauguration in May 2007). The office is located at the DAAD German Centre and represents the China-NRW University Alliance. The University of Cologne has taken on the task of coordinating academic contacts with China from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The office will make it easier for members of the consortium to expand their work in China and provide local support. The University of Cologne heads this consortium. The university has further regional offices in New York City and in New Delhi and coordination offices in Cairo and Accra.\nNumber and proportion of international students (including educational residents).\nThe number of international students in the winter semester 2023/24 was 5,074 (excluding doctoral students). This corresponds to around 11% of the total number of students.\nUniversity partnerships and networks.\nThe university maintains over 40 official partnerships. In addition to the official university partnerships, there are almost 300 cooperations and exchange relationships with renowned universities all over the world at the level of the individual Faculties and departments.\nExtensive funding opportunities are available through the Erasmus programme of the EU, the DAAD or fee waivers agreements with partner universities (complete list of partner universities on the university website). In 2005, the University of Cologne took over the central mediation and coordination of relations between the higher education institutions of North Rhine-Westphalia and China.\nAward for the support of international students.\nIn 2004, the University was awarded the Federal Foreign Office\u2019s prize for special services to the support of international students for its centralized and decentralized organizational concept, based on the Centre for International Relations at the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences.\nHumboldt Rankings.\nDuring the years 2018 through 2022, 142 international scholars and scientists sponsored by the Humboldt Foundation chose to spend their research years at the University of Cologne.\nBudget and finances.\nThe total budget of the University of Cologne (including the Faculty of Medicine) amounted to 920 million euros in 2023 (of which 263.7 million euros is allocated to the Faculty of Medicine). The budget was made up of 426.8 million euros in state funds, 239.2 million euros in third-party funding, 120.5 million euros in special funds such as QVM or HSP and 53.5 million euros in other income.\nGender equality.\nThe University of Cologne was awarded the title \u2018Total E-Quality\u2019 in 2004, 2007, 2014, 2018 and 2022 for its equal opportunities and diversity strategy. The title honours companies as well as higher education institutions and research institutions that successfully implement strategies promoting equal opportunities through HR and institutional measures.

{"id": "42758", "revid": "50955785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42758", "title": "Murasaki Shikibu", "text": "Japanese novelist and poet (c. 973 \u2013 c. 1014)\n, or , was a Japanese novelist, poet and lady-in-waiting at the Imperial court in the Heian period. She was best known as the author of \"The Tale of Genji\", widely considered to be one of the world's first novels, written in Japanese between about 1000 and 1012. Murasaki Shikibu is a descriptive name; her personal name is unknown, but she may have been , who was mentioned in a 1007 court diary as an imperial lady-in-waiting.\nHeian women were traditionally excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics and managed to acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to-late twenties and gave birth to a daughter, Daini no Sanmi. Her husband died after two years of marriage. It is uncertain when she began to write \"The Tale of Genji\", but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, she was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Sh\u014dshi at the Imperial court by Fujiwara no Michinaga, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Sh\u014dshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1025.\nMurasaki wrote \"The Diary of Lady Murasaki\"; a volume of poetry; as well as \"The Tale of Genji\". Within a decade of its completion, \"Genji\" was distributed throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Between 1925 and 1933, \"The Tale of Genji\" was published in English. Scholars continue to recognize the importance of her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.\nEarly life.\nMurasaki Shikibu was born c.\u2009973 in Heian-ky\u014d, Japan, into the northern Fujiwara clan descending from Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, the first 9th century Fujiwara regent. The Fujiwara clan dominated court politics until the end of the 11th century through strategically marrying their daughters into the imperial family and the use of regencies. In the late 10th century and early 11th century, Fujiwara no Michinaga, the so-called Mido Kampaku, arranged his four daughters into marriages with emperors, giving him unprecedented power. Murasaki's great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had been in the top tier of the aristocracy, but her branch of the family gradually lost power and by the time of Murasaki's birth was at the middle to lower ranks of the Heian aristocracy\u2014the level of provincial governors. The lower ranks of the nobility were typically posted away from court to undesirable positions in the provinces, exiled from the centralized power and court in Kyoto.\nDespite the loss of status, the family had a reputation among the literati through Murasaki's paternal great-grandfather and grandfather, both of whom were well-known poets. Her great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had 56 poems included in 13 of the Twenty-one Imperial Anthologies, the \"Collections of Thirty-six Poets\" and the (\"Tales of Yamato\"). Her great-grandfather and grandfather were both friendly with Ki no Tsurayuki, who became notable for popularizing Japanese-language verse. Her father, Fujiwara no Tametoki, attended the State Academy (Daigaku-ry\u014d) and became a well-respected scholar of Chinese classics and poetry; his own verse was anthologized. He entered public service around 968 as a minor official and was given a governorship in 996, staying in service until about 1018. Murasaki's mother was descended from the same branch of northern Fujiwara as Tametoki. The couple had three children, a son and two daughters.\nIn the Heian era the use of names, insofar as they were recorded, did not follow a modern pattern. A court lady, as well as being known by the title of her own position, if any, took a name referring to the rank or title of a male relative. Thus \"Shikibu\" is not a modern surname, but refers to , the Ministry of Ceremonials where Murasaki's father was a functionary. \"Murasaki\", an additional name possibly derived from the color violet associated with wisteria, the meaning of the word (an element of her clan name), may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to the name she herself had given to the main female character in \"Genji\". Michinaga mentions the names of several ladies-in-waiting in a 1007 diary entry; one, Fujiwara no Kaoruko (Ky\u014dshi), may be Murasaki's personal name.\nIn Heian-era Japan, husbands and wives kept separate households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when they were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she was very close to one sister who died in her twenties.\nMurasaki was born at a period when Japan was becoming more isolated, after missions to China had ended and a stronger national culture was emerging. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a written language through the development of , a syllabary based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki's lifetime, men continued to write formally in Chinese, but became the written language of intimacy and of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of Japanese literature.\nChinese was taught to Murasaki's brother as preparation for a career in government, and during her childhood, living in her father's household, she learned and became proficient in classical Chinese. In her diary she wrote, \"When my brother\u00a0... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man!'\" With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in \"The History of Japan\" that \"Women\u00a0... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese.\" Murasaki was aware that others saw her as \"pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful\". Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had \"a forceful personality that seldom won her friends.\"\nMarriage.\nAristocratic Heian women lived restricted and secluded lives, allowed to speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, however, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.\nIn 996 when her father was posted to a four-year governorship in Echizen Province (modern Fukui prefecture), Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance that could take as long as five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka, a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties at the time of their marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well-known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Interpretations of their marital relationship differ among scholars: Richard Bowring suggests a harmonious marriage, while Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane finds evidence of resentment towards her husband in Murasaki\u2019s poems.\nThe couple's daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), was born in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had servants to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances () such as \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" and \"The Tales of Ise.\" Scholars believe she may have started writing \"The Tale of Genji\" before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: \"I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion\u00a0... doing little more than registering the passage of time\u00a0... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable\".\nAccording to legend, Murasaki retreated to Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, where she was inspired to write \"The Tale of Genji\" on an August night while looking at the Moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis of the story of her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the Moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of \"Genji\" to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.\nIn her early to mid-thirties, she became a lady-in-waiting () at court, most likely because of her reputation as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in \"Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook\" that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Sh\u014dshi.\nCourt life.\nHeian culture and court life reached a peak early in the 11th century. The population of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations\u2014according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen\u2014who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth\u2014included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized as some of the earliest and among the best literature written in Japanese canon.\nRival courts and women poets.\nWhen in 995 Michinaga's two brothers Fujiwara no Michitaka and Fujiwara no Michikane died, leaving the regency vacant, Michinaga quickly won a power struggle against his nephew Fujiwara no Korechika (brother to Teishi, Emperor Ichij\u014d's wife), and, aided by his sister Senshi, he assumed power. Teishi had supported her brother Korechika, who was discredited and banished from court in 996 following a scandal involving his shooting at the retired Emperor Kazan, causing her to lose power. Four years later Michinaga sent Sh\u014dshi, his eldest daughter, to Emperor Ichij\u014d's harem when she was about 12. A year after placing Sh\u014dshi in the imperial harem, in an effort to undermine Teishi's influence and increase Sh\u014dshi's standing, Michinaga had her named Empress although Teishi already held the title. As historian Donald Shively explains, \"Michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for the unprecedented appointment of Teishi (or Sadako) and Sh\u014dshi as concurrent empresses of the same emperor, Teishi holding the usual title of \"Lustrous Heir-bearer\" and Sh\u014dshi that of \"Inner Palatine\" (), a toponymically derived equivalent coined for the occasion\". About five years later, Michinaga brought Murasaki to Sh\u014dshi's court, in a position that Bowring describes as a companion-tutor.\nWomen of high status lived in seclusion at court and, through strategic marriages, were used to gain political power for their families. In the case of Sh\u014dshi and other such marriages to members of the imperial clan, it enabled the woman's clan to exercise influence over the emperor\u2014this was how Michinaga, and other Fujiwara Regents, achieved their power. Despite their seclusion, some women wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive salons, dependent on the quality of those attending. Ichij\u014d's mother and Michinaga's sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted Sh\u014dshi to surround herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon.\nSh\u014dshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki joined her court, either in 1005 or 1006. According to Arthur Waley, Sh\u014dshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living arrangements were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women writers such as Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon\u2014the author of an early vernacular history, \"The Tale of Flowering Fortunes\". The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: \"Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; but there is something not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not seem to me that in herself she is really a poet at all.\"\nSei Sh\u014dnagon, author of \"The Pillow Book\", had been in service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Sh\u014dshi came to court; it is possible that Murasaki was invited to Sh\u014dshi's court as a rival to Sh\u014dnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Sh\u014dshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Sh\u014dnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her. Sh\u014dnagon's \"The Pillow Book\" may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Sh\u014dshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Sh\u014dshi's court in a similar manner.\nThe two writers had different temperaments: Sh\u014dnagon was witty, clever, and outspoken; Murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive. Entries in Murasaki's diary show that the two may not have been on good terms. Murasaki wrote, \"Sei Sh\u014dnagon\u00a0... was dreadfully conceited. She thought herself so clever, littered her writing with Chinese characters, [which] left a great deal to be desired.\" Keene thinks that Murasaki's impression of Sh\u014dnagon could have been influenced by Sh\u014dshi and the women at her court, as Sh\u014dnagon served Sh\u014dshi's rival empress. Furthermore, he believes Murasaki was brought to court to write \"Genji\" in response to Sh\u014dnagon's popular \"Pillow Book\". Murasaki contrasted herself to Sh\u014dnagon in a variety of ways. She denigrated the pillow book genre and, unlike Sh\u014dnagon, who flaunted her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki pretended to not know the language, regarding it as pretentious and affected.\n\"The Lady of the Chronicles\".\nAlthough the popularity of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Sh\u014dshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Sh\u014dshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, was one of the few women available to teach Sh\u014dshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was \"almost subversive\" that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Sh\u014dshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, \"Since last summer\u00a0... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I have been reading with Her Majesty\u00a0... There has of course been no question of formal lessons\u00a0... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody.\"\nMurasaki probably earned an ambiguous nickname, \"The Lady of the Chronicles\" (), for teaching Sh\u014dshi Chinese literature. A lady-in-waiting who disliked Murasaki accused her of flaunting her knowledge of Chinese and began calling her \"The Lady of the Chronicles\"\u2014an allusion to the classic \"Chronicles of Japan\"\u2014after an incident in which chapters from \"Genji\" were read aloud to the Emperor and his courtiers, one of whom remarked that the author showed a high level of education. Murasaki wrote in her diary, \"How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, ever think of doing so at court?\" Although the nickname was apparently meant to be disparaging, Mulhern believes Murasaki was flattered by it.\nThe attitude toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, the Chinese language had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Sh\u014dshi's salon there was a great deal of hostility towards the language\u2014perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese\u2014even though Sh\u014dshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Sh\u014dnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.\nMurasaki seems to have been unhappy with court life and was withdrawn and somber. No surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions; she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service. In general, unlike Sh\u014dnagon, Murasaki gives the impression in her diary that she disliked court life, the other ladies-in-waiting, and the drunken revelry. She did, however, become close friends with a lady-in-waiting named Lady Saish\u014d, and she wrote of the winters that she enjoyed, \"I love to see the snow here\".\nAccording to Waley, Murasaki may not have been unhappy with court life in general but bored in Sh\u014dshi's court. He speculates she would have preferred to serve with the Lady Senshi, whose household seems to have been less strict and more light-hearted. In her diary, Murasaki wrote about Sh\u014dshi's court, \"[she] has gathered round her a number of very worthy young ladies\u00a0... Her Majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life, and no longer judges others by the same rigid standards as before; but meanwhile her Court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness\".\nMurasaki disliked the men at court, whom she thought were drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was involved romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote to him in a poem, \"You have neither read my book, nor won my love.\" In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga\u2014one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of \"Genji.\" However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described her daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the \"complexities of the marriage system\", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Sh\u014dshi's two sons.\nIt is likely that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude. She believed she did not fit well with the general atmosphere of the court, writing of herself: \"I am wrapped up in the study of ancient stories\u00a0... living all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people\u00a0... But when they get to know me, they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle\". Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki's court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi's poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved.\nRank was important in Heian court society and Murasaki would not have felt herself to have much, if anything, in common with the higher ranked and more powerful Fujiwaras. In her diary, she wrote of her life at court: \"I realized that my branch of the family was a very humble one; but the thought seldom troubled me, and I was in those days far indeed from the painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at Court a continual torment to me.\" A court position would have increased her social standing, but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about. Court life, as she experienced it, is well reflected in the chapters of \"Genji\" written after she joined Sh\u014dshi. The name Murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary: in 1008 the well-known court poet Fujiwara no Kint\u014d inquired after the \"Young Murasaki\"\u2014an allusion to the character named Murasaki in \"Genji\"\u2014which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author.\nLater life and death.\nWhen Emperor Ichij\u014d died in 1011, Sh\u014dshi retired from the Imperial Palace to live in a Fujiwara mansion in Biwa, most likely accompanied by Murasaki, who is recorded as being there with Sh\u014dshi in 1013. George Aston explains that when Murasaki retired from court she was again associated with Ishiyama-dera: \"To this beautiful spot, it is said, Murasaki no Shikibu \"[sic]\" retired from court life to devote the remainder of her days to literature and religion. There are sceptics, however, Motoori being one, who refuse to believe this story, pointing out\u00a0... that it is irreconcilable with known facts. On the other hand, the very chamber in the temple where the \"Genji\" was written is shown\u2014with the ink-slab which the author used, and a Buddhist Sutra in her handwriting, which, if they do not satisfy the critic, still are sufficient to carry conviction to the minds of ordinary visitors to the temple.\"\nMurasaki may have died in 1014. Her father made a hasty return to Kyoto from his post at Echigo Province (modern Niigata) that year, possibly because of her death. Writing in \"A Bridge of Dreams: A Poetics of \"The Tale of Genji\"\", Shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as the date of Murasaki Shikibu's death and 973 as the date of her birth, making her 41 when she died. Bowring considers 1014 to be speculative, and believes she may have lived with Sh\u014dshi until as late as 1025. Waley agrees given that Murasaki may have attended ceremonies with Sh\u014dshi held for Sh\u014dshi's son, Emperor Go-Ichij\u014d around 1025.\nMurasaki's brother Nobunori died in around 1011, which, combined with the death of his daughter, may have prompted her father to resign his post and take vows at Miidera temple where he died in 1029. Murasaki's daughter entered court service in 1025 as a wet nurse to the future Emperor Go-Reizei (1025\u20131068). She went on to become a well-known poet as Daini no Sanmi.\nWorks.\nThree works are attributed to Murasaki: \"The Tale of Genji\", \"The Diary of Lady Murasaki\" and \"Poetic Memoirs\", a collection of 128 poems. Her work is considered important for its reflection of the creation and development of Japanese writing, during a period when Japanese shifted from an unwritten vernacular to a written language. Until the 9th century, Japanese language texts were written in Chinese characters using the writing system. A revolutionary achievement was the development of , a true Japanese script, in the mid-to late 9th century. Japanese authors began to write prose in their own language, which led to genres such as tales () and poetic journals (). Historian Edwin Reischauer writes that genres such as the monogatari were distinctly Japanese and that \"Genji\", written in , \"was the outstanding work of the period\".\nDiary and poetry.\nMurasaki began her diary after she entered service at Sh\u014dshi's court. Much of what is known about her and her experiences at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Sh\u014dshi's sons\u2014at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace\u2014and the process of writing \"Genji\", including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Sh\u014dshi's son Emperor Go-Ichij\u014d, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and \"de facto\" regent to an emperor.\n\"Poetic Memoirs\" is a collection of 128 poems Mulhern describes as \"arranged in a biographical sequence\". The original set has been lost. According to custom, the verses would have been passed from person to person and often copied. Some appear written for a lover\u2014possibly her husband before he died\u2014but she may have merely followed tradition and written simple love poems. They contain biographical details: she mentions a sister who died, the visit to Echizen province with her father and that she wrote poetry for Sh\u014dshi. Murasaki's poems were published in 1206 by Fujiwara no Teika, in what Mulhern believes to be the collection that is closest to the original form; at around the same time Teika included a selection of Murasaki's works in an imperial anthology, \"New Collections of Ancient and Modern Times\".\n\"The Tale of Genji\".\nMurasaki is best known for her \"The Tale of Genji\", a three-part novel spanning 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Sh\u014dshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.\nIn his \"The Pleasures of Japanese Literature\", Keene claims Murasaki wrote the \"supreme work of Japanese fiction\" by drawing on traditions of court diaries, and earlier \u2014written in a mixture of Chinese script and Japanese script\u2014such as \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" or \"The Tales of Ise\". She drew on and blended styles from Chinese histories, narrative poetry and contemporary Japanese prose. Adolphson writes that the juxtaposition of formal Chinese style with mundane subjects resulted in a sense of parody or satire, giving her a distinctive voice. \"Genji\" follows the traditional format of \u2014telling a tale\u2014particularly evident in its use of a narrator, but Keene claims Murasaki developed the genre far beyond its bounds, and by doing so created a form that is utterly modern. The story of the \"shining prince\" Genji is set in the late 9th to early 10th centuries, and Murasaki eliminated from it the elements of fairy tales and fantasy frequently found in earlier .\nThe themes in \"Genji\" are common to the period, and are defined by Shively as encapsulating \"the tyranny of time and the inescapable sorrow of romantic love\". The main theme is that of the fragility of life, \"the sorrow of human existence\" (), a term used over a thousand times in \"Genji\". Keene speculates that in her tale of the \"shining prince\", Murasaki may have created for herself an idealistic escape from court life, which she found less than savory. In Prince Genji she formed a gifted, comely, refined, yet human and sympathetic protagonist. Keene writes that \"Genji\" gives a view into the Heian period; for example love affairs flourished, although women typically remained unseen behind screens, curtains or .\nHelen McCullough describes Murasaki's writing as of universal appeal and believes \"The Tale of Genji\" \"transcends both its genre and age. Its basic subject matter and setting\u2014love at the Heian court\u2014are those of the romance, and its cultural assumptions are those of the mid-Heian period, but Murasaki Shikibu's unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love\u00a0... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others.\" Prince Genji recognizes in each of his lovers the inner beauty of the woman and the fragility of life, which according to Keene, makes him heroic. The story was popular: Emperor Ichij\u014d had it read to him, even though it was written in Japanese. By 1021 all the chapters were known to be complete and the work was sought after in the provinces where it was scarce.\nLegacy.\nMurasaki's reputation and influence have not diminished since her lifetime when she, with other Heian women writers, was instrumental in developing Japanese into a written language. Her writing was required reading for court poets as early as the 12th century as her work began to be studied by scholars who generated authoritative versions and criticism. Within a century of her death she was highly regarded as a classical writer. In the 17th century, Murasaki's work became emblematic of Confucian philosophy and women were encouraged to read her books. In 1673, Kumazawa Banzan argued that her writing was valuable for its sensitivity and depiction of emotions. He wrote in his \"Discursive Commentary on Genji\" that when \"human feelings are not understood the harmony of the Five Human Relationships is lost.\"\n\"The Tale of Genji\" was copied and illustrated in various forms as early as a century after Murasaki's death. \"The Genji Monogatari Emaki\", is a late Heian era 12th century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. The illustrations, definitively dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. The scroll is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.\nFemale virtue was tied to literary knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or \"Genji\" inspired artifacts, known as . Dowry sets decorated with scenes from \"Genji\" or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century they had come to symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk screens, painted by Kan\u014d Tan'y\u016b as a wedding gift in 1649.\nMurasaki became a popular subject of paintings and illustrations highlighting her as a virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishiyama Temple, staring at the Moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. \"The Tale of Genji\" became a favorite subject of Japanese artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, by the middle of the Edo period the mass-produced prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.\nIn \"Envisioning the \"Tale of Genji\" Shirane observes that \"The Tale of Genji\" has become many things to many different audiences through many different media over a thousand years\u00a0... unmatched by any other Japanese text or artifact.\" The work and its author were popularized through its illustrations in various media: (illustrated handscrolls); (screen paintings), (woodblock prints); films, comics, and in the modern period, manga. In her fictionalized account of Murasaki's life, \"The Tale of Murasaki: A Novel\", Liza Dalby has Murasaki involved in a romance during her travels with her father to Echizen Province.\n\"The Tale of the Genji\" is recognized as an enduring classic. McCullough writes that Murasaki \"is both the quintessential representative of a unique society and a writer who speaks to universal human concerns with a timeless voice. Japan has not seen another such genius.\" Keene writes that \"The Tale of Genji\" continues to captivate, because, in the story, her characters and their concerns are universal. When Waley's translation (\"The Tale of Genji: A Novel in Six Parts\") was published in 1933, reviewers compared \"Genji\" to Austen, Proust, and Shakespeare. Mulhern says of Murasaki that she is similar to Shakespeare, who represented his Elizabethan England, in that she captured the essence of the Heian court and as a novelist \"succeeded perhaps even beyond her own expectations.\" Like Shakespeare, her work has been the subject of reams of criticism and many books.\nKyoto held a year-long celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of \"Genji\" in 2008, with poetry competitions, visits to the Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size rendition of Murasaki at her desk was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layer Heian court and ankle-length wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and \"The Tale of Genji\". A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.\nA \"Genji Album\", only in the 1970s dated to 1510, is housed at Harvard University. The album is considered the earliest of its kind and consists of 54 paintings by Tosa Mitsunobu and 54 sheets of calligraphy on paper in five colors, written by master calligraphers. The leaves are housed in a case dated to the Edo period, with a silk frontispiece painted by Tosa Mitsuoki, dated to around 1690. The album contains Mitsuoki's authentication slips for his ancestor's 16th century paintings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

JTA was a specification developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 907. JTA provides for:\nX/Open XA architecture.\nIn the X/Open XA architecture, a transaction manager or transaction processing monitor (TP monitor) coordinates the transactions across multiple resources such as databases and message queues. Each resource has its own resource manager. The resource manager typically has its own API for manipulating the resource, for example the JDBC API to work with relational databases. In addition, the resource manager allows a TP monitor to coordinate a distributed transaction between its own and other resource managers. Finally, there is the application which communicates with the TP monitor to begin, commit or roll back the transactions. The application also communicates with the individual resources using their own API to modify the resource.\nJTA implementation of the X/Open XA architecture.\nThe JTA API consists of classes in two Java packages:\nThe JTA is modelled on the X/Open XA architecture, but it defines two different APIs for demarcating transaction boundaries. It distinguishes between an application server such as an EJB server and an application component. It provides an interface, , that is used by the application server itself to begin, commit and roll back the transactions. It provides a different interface, the , that is used by general client code such as a servlet or an EJB to manage the transactions.\nThe JTA architecture requires that each resource manager must implement the interface in order to be managed by the TP monitor. As stated previously, each resource will have its own specific API, for instance:\nAPI.\nThe Jakarta Transactions API consists of three elements: a high-level application transaction demarcation interface, a high-level transaction manager interface intended for an application server, and a standard Java mapping of the X/Open XA protocol intended for a transactional resource manager.\nUserTransaction interface.\nThe interface provides the application the\nability to control transaction boundaries programmatically. This interface may be used\nby Java client programs or EJB beans.\nThe method starts a global transaction and associates the\ntransaction with the calling thread. The transaction-to-thread association is managed\ntransparently by the Transaction Manager.\nSupport for nested transactions is not required. The UserTransaction.begin method\nthrows the NotSupportedException when the calling thread is already associated\nwith a transaction and the transaction manager implementation does not support nested\ntransactions.\nTransaction context propagation between application programs is provided by the\nunderlying transaction manager implementations on the client and server machines.\nThe transaction context format used for propagation is protocol dependent and must be\nnegotiated between the client and server hosts. For example, if the transaction manager\nis an implementation of the JTS specification, it will use the transaction context\npropagation format as specified in the CORBA OTS 1.1 specification. Transaction\npropagation is transparent to application programs.\n@Transactional annotation.\nThe annotation provides the application the\nability to control transaction boundaries declaratively. This annotation can be applied to any class that the Jakarta EE specification\ndefines as a managed bean (which includes CDI managed beans).\nThe code sample below illustrates the usage of \n in a request scoped CDI managed bean:\n@RequestScoped\npublic class ExampleBean {\n @Transactional\n public void foo() { // A transaction is active here\n // Do work\n } // After the method returns transaction is committed or rolled back\nTransactional behavior can be configured via an attribute on the annotation. The available options closely mirror those of the EJB specification.\n@TransactionScoped annotation.\nThe annotation provides the application the\nability to declare that the scope during which a bean lives is tied to the time a given transaction is active.\nThe code sample below illustrates the usage of \n in a request scoped CDI managed bean:\n@TransactionScoped\npublic class TxScopedBean {\n public int number;\n@RequestScoped\npublic class ExampleBean {\n @Inject\n private TxScopedBean txScopedBean;\n @Transactional\n public void foo() {\n txScopedBean.setNumber(1);\n @Transactional\n public void bar() {\n System.out.print(tXscopedBean.getNumber());\nIf method \"foo()\" is first called on a managed instance of ExampleBean and then subsequently method \"bar()\" is called, the number printed will be 0 and not 1. This is because each method had its own transaction and therefore its own instance of TxScopedBean. The number 1 that was set during the call to \"foo()\" will therefore not be seen during the call to \"bar()\".\nUserTransaction support in EJB server.\nEJB servers are required to support the \n interface for use by EJB\nbeans with the BEAN value in the annotation (this is called bean-managed transactions or BMT). The \ninterface is exposed to EJB components through either the \n interface using the\n method, or directly via injection using the general codice_1 annotation. Thus, an EJB application does not interface with the\nTransaction Manager directly for transaction demarcation; instead, the EJB bean relies\non the EJB server to provide support for all of its transaction work as defined in the\nJakarta Enterprise Beans Specification. (The underlying interaction between the EJB\nServer and the TM is transparent to the application; the burden of implementing transaction management is on the EJB container and server provider.)\nThe code sample below illustrates the usage of \n via bean-managed transactions in an EJB session bean:\n@Stateless\n@TransactionManagement(BEAN)\npublic class ExampleBean {\n @Resource\n private UserTransaction utx;\n public void foo() {\n // start a transaction\n utx.begin();\n // Do work\n // Commit it\n utx.commit();\nAlternatively, the \n can be obtained from the \n@Stateless\n@TransactionManagement(BEAN)\npublic class ExampleBean {\n @Resource\n private SessionContext ctx;\n public void foo() {\n UserTransaction utx = ctx.getUserTransaction();\n // start a transaction\n utx.begin();\n // Do work\n // Commit it\n utx.commit();\nNote though that in the example above if the codice_2 annotation is omitted, a JTA transaction is automatically started whenever codice_3 is called and is automatically committed or rolled back when codice_3 is exited. Making use of a \n is thus not necessary in EJB programming, but might be needed for very specialized code.\nUserTransaction support in JNDI.\nThe UserTransaction should be available under codice_5 (if a JTA implementation is installed in the environment).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, these lands were absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later was merged into the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16th century.\nFollowing the Partitions of Poland in the 18th century, Belarusian territories became part of the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, different states arose competing for legitimacy amid the Russian Civil War, ultimately ending with the consolidation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union when it was founded in 1922.\nThe republic was devastated as a result of the German occupation during World War II, and its territory was expanded after Western Belorussia was annexed by the Soviet Union as a result of the war. Belarus became an independent state in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nPrehistoric era.\nArchaeological discoveries show what is now Belarus had human inhabitants during the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages.\nEarly history.\nThe history of Belarus begins with the migration and expansion of the Slavic peoples through Eastern Europe between the 6th and 8th centuries. East Slavs settled on the territory of present-day Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, assimilating local Baltic (Yotvingians, Dnieper Balts), Finns (in Russia) and steppe nomads (in Ukraine) already living there, their early ethnic integrations contributed to the gradual differentiation of the East Slavs. These East Slavs, pagan, animistic, agrarian people, had an economy which included trade in agricultural produce, game, furs, honey, beeswax and amber.\nThe modern Belarusian ethnos was probably formed on the basis of the three Slavic tribes\u2014Kryvians, Drehovians, and Radzimians\u2014as well as several Baltic tribes.\nThe common cultural bond of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and written Church Slavonic (a literary and liturgical Slavic language developed by 8th-century missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius) fostered the emergence of a new geopolitical entity, Kievan Rus' \u2014 a loose-knit multi-ethnic network of principalities, established along pre-existing trade routes, with major centers in Novgorod (now in Russia), Polotsk (now in Belarus) and Kiev (now in Ukraine).\nKievan Rus'.\nBetween the 9th and 12th centuries, the Principality of Polotsk (now in northern Belarus) emerged as the dominant center of power in the territory of Belarus, while the Principality of Turov south of it was a lesser power.\nThe Principality of Polotsk repeatedly asserted its sovereignty in relation to the other centers of Rus', becoming a political capital, the episcopal see of a bishopric and the controller of vassal territories among Balts in the west. The city's Cathedral of the Holy Wisdom (1044\u201366), though completely rebuilt over the years, remains a symbol of this independent-mindedness, rivaling churches of the same name in Novgorod and Kiev, referring to the original Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (and hence to claims of imperial prestige, authority and sovereignty). Cultural achievements of the Polotsk period include the work of the nun Euphrosyne of Polotsk (1120\u20131173), who built monasteries, transcribed books, promoted literacy and sponsored art (including local artisan Lazar Bohsha's famous \"Cross of Euphrosyne\", a national symbol and treasure stolen during World War II), and the prolific, original Church Slavonic sermons and writings of Bishop Kirill of Turov (1130\u20131182).\nGrand Duchy of Lithuania.\nIn the 13th century, the fragile unity of Kievan Rus' disintegrated due to nomadic incursions from Asia, which climaxed with the Mongol sacking of Kiev in 1240, leaving a geopolitical vacuum in the region. The East Slavs had splintered into a number of independent and competing principalities. Due to military conquest and dynastic marriages, the western principalities of Rus' in modern Belarus were acquired by the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania, beginning with the rule of Lithuanian King Mindaugas (1240\u20131263). From the 13th to 15th century, the principalities were either conquered or willingly joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\nThe Lithuanians' smaller numbers in this medieval state gave the Ruthenians (later Belarusians and Ukrainians) an important role in the everyday cultural life of the state. Owing to the prevalence of East Slavs and the Eastern Orthodox faith among the population in eastern and southern regions of the state, the Ruthenian language was a widely used colloquial language.\nThe East Slavic variety of the language (\"rus'ka mova\", \"Old Belarusian\" or \"West Russian Chancellery language\"), gradually influenced by Polish, was the language of administration in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from at least Vytautas' reign until the late 17th century when it was replaced by Polish.\nThis period of political breakdown and reorganization also saw the rise of written local vernaculars in place of the literary and liturgical Church Slavonic language, a further stage in the evolving differentiation between the Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian languages.\nSeveral Lithuanian monarchs \u2014 the last being \u0160vitrigaila in 1432\u201336 \u2014 relied on the Eastern Orthodox Ruthenian majority, while most monarchs and magnates increasingly came to reflect the opinions of the Roman Catholics.\nConstruction of Orthodox churches in some parts of present-day Belarus had been initially prohibited, as was the case in Vitebsk in 1480. On the other hand, further unification of the mostly Orthodox Grand Duchy with mostly Catholic Poland led to liberalization and a partial solving of the religious problem. In 1511, King and Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old granted the Orthodox clergy an autonomy previously enjoyed only by Catholic clergy. The privilege was enhanced in 1531, when the Orthodox church was no longer responsible to the Catholic bishop and instead the metropolitan was responsible only to the \"sobor\" of eight Orthodox bishops, the Grand Duke and the Patriarch of Constantinople. The privilege also extended the jurisdiction of the Orthodox hierarchy over all Orthodox people.\nIn such circumstances, a vibrant Ruthenian culture flourished, mostly in the major cities of present-day Belarus.\nDespite the legal usage of the Ruthenian language, which was used as a chancellery language in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, literature was mostly non-existent, apart from several chronicles.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nThe Union of Lublin in 1569 led to the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth to become an influential player in European politics and the largest multinational state in Europe. While present-day Ukraine and Podlaskie became subjects of the Polish Crown, present-day Belarusian territories were still regarded as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The new polity was dominated by densely populated Poland, which had 134 representatives in the Sejm as compared to 46 representatives from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania retained significant autonomy, and was governed by a separate code of laws called the Lithuanian Statutes, which codified both civil and property rights. Of the territory of present-day Belarus, Mogilev was the largest urban centre, followed by Vitebsk, Polotsk, Pinsk, Slutsk, and Brest, whose population exceeded 10,000. In addition, Vilna (Vilnius), the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, also had a significant Ruthenian population.\nWith time, the ethnic pattern did not evolve much. Throughout their existence as a separate culture, Ruthenians formed in most cases the rural population, with power held by the local \"szlachta\" and boyars, often of Lithuanian, Polish or Russian descent. By this time, a significant Jewish presence had also formed in this region of German Jews fleeing persecution from the Northern and Baltic Crusaders. Since the Union of Horodlo of 1413, the local nobility was assimilated into the traditional clan system by means of the formal procedure of adoption by the \"szlachta\" (Polish gentry). Eventually, it formed a significant part of the \"szlachta\". Initially mostly Ruthenian and Orthodox, with time most of them became polonized. This was especially true for major magnate families (Sapieha and Radziwi\u0142\u0142 clans being the most notable), whose personal fortunes and properties often surpassed those of the royal families and were huge enough to be called a state within a state.\nAlso, with time religious conflicts started to arise. The gentry with time started to adopt Catholicism while the common people by large remained faithful to Eastern Orthodoxy. Initially the Warsaw Compact of 1573 codified the preexisting freedom of worship. However, the rule of an ultra-Catholic King Sigismund III Vasa was marked by numerous attempts to spread Catholicism, mostly through his support for counterreformation and the Jesuits. Possibly to avoid such conflicts, in 1595 the Orthodox hierarchs of Kiev signed the Union of Brest, breaking their links with the Patriarch of Constantinople and placing themselves under the Pope. Although the union was generally supported by most local Orthodox bishops and the king himself, it was opposed by some prominent nobles and, more importantly, by the nascent Cossack movement. This led to a series of conflicts and rebellions against the local authorities. The first of such happened in 1595, when the Cossack insurgents under Severyn Nalyvaiko took the towns of Slutsk and Mogilev and executed Polish magistrates there. Other such clashes took place in Mogilev (1606\u201310), Vitebsk (1623), and Polotsk (1623, 1633). This left the population of the Grand Duchy divided between Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox parts. At the same time, after the schism in the Orthodox Church (Raskol), some Old Believers migrated west, seeking refuge in the Rzeczpospolita, which allowed them to freely practice their faith.\nFrom 1569, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth suffered a series of Tatar raids, the goal of which was to loot, pillage and capture slaves into jasyr. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people, predominantly Ukrainians but also Russians, Belarusians and Poles, were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.\nDespite these conflicts, the literary tradition of Belarus evolved. Until the 17th century, the Ruthenian language, the predecessor of modern Belarusian, was used in the Grand Duchy as a chancery language, that is, the language used for official documents. Afterwards, it was replaced with the Polish language, commonly spoken by the upper classes. Both Polish and Ruthenian cultures gained a major cultural centre with the foundation of the Academy of Vilna. At the same time, the Belarusian lands entered a path of economic growth, with the formation of numerous towns that served as centres of trade on the east\u2013west routes.\nEventually, by 1795, Poland was partitioned by its neighbors. Thus, a new period in Belarusian history began, with all its lands annexed by the Russian Empire.\nRussian Empire.\nUnder Russian administration, the territory of Belarus was divided into the governorates (\"guberniyas\") of Minsk, Vitebsk, Mogilev, and Grodno. Belarusians were active in the guerrilla movement against Napoleon's occupation. With Napoleon's defeat, Belarus again became a part of Imperial Russia and its \"guberniyas\" constituted part of the Northwestern Krai. The independence seeking 1830 and 1863 uprisings of the gentry were subdued by the government forces.\nAlthough under Nicholas I and Alexander III the national cultures were repressed due to the policies of de-Polonization and Russification, which included the return to Orthodoxy, the 19th century signifies the rise of the modern Belarusian nation and self-confidence. A number of authors started publishing in the Belarusian language, including Jan Czeczot, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Syrokomla and Konstanty Kalinowski. In 1862-1863 Kalinowski published first newspaper in modern Belarusian language, \"Mu\u017cyckaja prauda\" (\"Peasants' Truth\"), in a Latin script.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Belarusian economy, like that of the entire Europe, was experiencing significant growth due to the spread of the Industrial Revolution to Eastern Europe, particularly after the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and the construction of railways in the late 19th century (with Minsk, Vitebsk, Grodno, Pinsk and Gomel becoming significant industrial centres.\n20th century.\nBNR and LBSSR.\nOn 21 February 1918, Minsk was captured by German troops. World War I was the short period when Belarusian culture started to flourish. German administration allowed schools with Belarusian language, previously banned in Russia; a number of Belarusian schools were created until 1919 when they were banned again by the Polish military administration. At the end of World War I, when Belarus was still occupied by Germans, according to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the short-lived People's Republic of Belarus was pronounced on 25 March 1918, as part of the German Mitteleuropa plan.\nIn December 1918, Mitteleuropa was obsolete as the German Empire withdrew from the Ober-Ost territory, and for the next few years in the newly created power vacuum the territories of Belarus would witness the struggle of various national and foreign factions. On 3 December 1918 the Germans withdrew from Minsk. On 10 December 1918 Soviet troops occupied Minsk. The Rada (Council) of the People's Republic of Belarus went into exile, first to Kaunas, then to Berlin and finally to Prague. On 2 January 1919, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia was declared. On 17 February 1919 it was disbanded. Part of it was included into Russian SFSR, and part was joined to the Lithuanian SSR to form the LBSSR, Lithuanian\u2013Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, informally known as \"Litbel\", whose capital was Vilnius. While Belarus National Republic faced off with Litbel, foreign powers were preparing to reclaim what they saw as their territories: Polish forces were moving from the West, and Russians from the East. When Vilnius was captured by Polish forces on 17 April 1919, the capital of the Soviet puppet state Litbel was moved to Minsk. On 17 July 1919 Lenin dissolved Litbel because of the pressure of Polish forces advancing from the West. Polish troops captured Minsk on 8 August 1919.\nRepublic of Central Lithuania.\nThe Republic of Central Lithuania was a short-lived political entity within a territory now split between modern Lithuania and Belarus. It was the last attempt to restore Lithuania in the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower). The republic was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st Lithuanian\u2013Belarusian Division of the Polish Army under Lucjan \u017beligowski. Centered on the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vilna (, ), for 18 months the entity served as a buffer state between Poland, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area. After a variety of delays, a disputed election took place on 8 January 1922, and the territory was annexed to Poland. \u017beligowski later in his memoir which was published in London in 1943 condemned the annexation of Republic by Poland, as well as the policy of closing Belarusian schools and general disregard of Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's confederation plans by Polish ally.\nBelarusian Soviet Republic and West Belarus.\nSome time in 1918 or 1919, Sergiusz Piasecki returned to Belarus, joining Belarusian anti-Soviet units, the \"Green Oak\" (in Polish, \"Zielony D\u0105b\"), led by Ataman Wiaczes\u0142aw Adamowicz (pseudonym: J. Dziergacz). When on 8 August 1919, the Polish Army captured Minsk, Adamowicz decided to work with them. Thus Belarusian units were created, and Piasecki was transferred to a Warsaw school of infantry cadets. In the summer of 1920, during the Polish\u2013Soviet War, Piasecki fought in the Battle of Radzymin.\nThe frontiers between Poland, which had established an independent government after World War I, and the former Russian Empire were not recognized by the League of Nations. Poland's J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, who envisioned the formation of an Intermarium federation as a Central and East European bloc that would be a bulwark against Germany to the west and Russia to the east, carried out a Kiev offensive into Ukraine in 1920. This met with a Red Army counter-offensive that drove into Polish territory almost to Warsaw, Minsk itself was re-captured by the Soviet Red Army on 11 July 1920 and a new Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was declared on 31 July 1920. Pi\u0142sudski, however, halted the Soviet advance at the Battle of Warsaw and resumed his eastward offensive. Finally the Treaty of Riga, ending the Polish\u2013Soviet War, divided Belarus between Poland and Soviet Russia. Over the next two years, the People's Republic of Belarus prepared a national uprising, ceasing the preparations only when the League of Nations recognized the Soviet Union's western borders on 15 March 1923. The Soviets terrorised Western Belarus, the most radical case being Soviet raid on Sto\u0142pce. Poland created Border Protection Corps in 1924.\nThe Polish part of Belarus was subject to Polonization policies (especially in the 1930s), while the Soviet Belarus was one of the original republics which formed the USSR. For several years, the national culture and language enjoyed a significant boost of revival in the Soviet Belarus. A Polish Autonomous District was also formed. This was however soon ended during the Great Purge, when almost all prominent Belarusian national intelligentsia were executed, many of them buried in Kurapaty. Thousands were deported to Asia. As the result of Polish operation of the NKVD tens of thousands people of many nationalities were killed. Belarusian orthography was Russified in 1933 and use of Belarusian language was discouraged as exhibiting anti-soviet attitude.\nIn West Belarus, up to 30,000 families of Polish veterans (\"osadniks\") were settled in the lands formerly belonging to the Russian tsar family and Russian aristocracy. Belarusian representation in Polish parliament was reduced as a result of the 1930 elections. Since the early 1930s, the Polish government introduced a set of policies designed to Polonize all minorities (Belarusians, Ukrainians, Jews, etc.). The usage of Belarusian language was discouraged and the Belarusian schools were facing severe financial problems. In spring of 1939, there already was neither single Belarusian official organisation in Poland nor a single exclusively Belarusian school (with only 44 schools teaching Belarusian language left).\nBelarus in World War II.\nWhen the Soviet Union invaded Poland on September 17, 1939, following the terms of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol, Western Byelorussia, which was part of Poland, is included in the BSSR. Similarly to the times of German occupation during World War I, Belarusian language and Soviet culture enjoyed relative prosperity in this short period. Already in October 1940, over 75% of schools used the Belarusian language, also in the regions where no Belarus people lived, e.g. around \u0141om\u017ca, what was Ruthenization. Western Belarus was sovietised, tens of thousands were imprisoned in Gulag camps, exiled and many were executed as \"enemies of the people\". The victims were mostly Polish and Jewish.\nAfter twenty months of Soviet rule, Nazi Germany and its Axis allies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Soviet authorities immediately evacuated about 20% of the population of Belarus, killed thousands of prisoners and destroyed all the food supplies. The country suffered particularly heavily during the fighting and the German occupation. Minsk was captured by the Germans on 28 June 1941. Following bloody encirclement battles, all of the present-day Belarus territory was occupied by the Germans by the end of August 1941.\nDuring World War II, the Nazis attempted to establish a puppet Belarusian government, Belarusian Central Rada, with the symbolics similar to BNR. In reality, however, the Germans imposed a brutal racist regime, burning down some 9,000 Belarusian villages, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians more. Local police took part in many of those crimes. Almost the whole, previously very numerous, Jewish populations of Belarus that did not evacuate were killed. One of the first uprisings of a Jewish ghetto against the Nazis occurred in 1942 in Belarus, in the small town of Lakhva.\nSince the early days of the occupation, a powerful and increasingly well-coordinated Belarusian resistance movement emerged. Hiding in the woods and swamps, the partisans inflicted heavy damage to German supply lines and communications, disrupting railway tracks, bridges, telegraph wires, attacking supply depots, fuel dumps and transports and ambushing German soldiers. Not all anti-German partisans were pro-Soviet. In the largest partisan sabotage action of the entire Second World War, the so-called Asipovichy diversion of 30 July 1943 four German trains with supplies and Tiger tanks were destroyed. To fight partisan activity, the Germans had to withdraw considerable forces behind their front line. On 22 June 1944 the huge Soviet offensive Operation Bagration was launched, Minsk was re-captured on 3 July 1944, and all of Belarus was regained by the end of August. Hundred thousand of Poles were expelled after 1944. As part of the Nazis' effort to combat the enormous Belarusian resistance during World War II, special units of local collaborationists were trained by the SS's Otto Skorzeny to infiltrate the Soviet rear. In 1944 thirty Belarusians (known as \u010corny Kot (\"Black Cat\") and personally led by Micha\u0142 Vitu\u0161ka) were airdropped by the Luftwaffe behind the lines of the Red Army, which had already liberated Belarus during Operation Bagration. They experienced some initial success due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army, and some other German-trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest in 1945. The NKVD, however, had already infiltrated these units. Vitu\u0161ka himself was hunted down, captured and executed, although he continued to live on in Belarusian nationalist hagiography.\nIn total, Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population in World War II including practically all its intellectual elite. About 9,200 villages and 1.2 million houses were destroyed. The major towns of Minsk and Vitsebsk lost over 80% of their buildings and city infrastructure. For the defence against the Germans, and the tenacity during the German occupation, the capital Minsk was awarded the title \"Hero City\" after the war. The fortress of Brest was awarded the title \"Hero-Fortress\".\nPost-war BSSR.\nAfter the end of War in 1945, Belarus became one of the founding members of the United Nations Organisation. Joining Belarus was the Soviet Union itself and another republic Ukraine. In exchange for Belarus and Ukraine joining the UN, the United States had the right to seek two more votes, a right that has never been exercised.\nMore than 200,000 ethnic Poles left or were expelled to Poland in late 1940s and late 1950s, some killed by the NKVD or deported to Siberia. Armia Krajowa and post-AK resistance was the strongest in the Grodno, Vawkavysk, Lida and Shchuchyn regions.\nThe Belarusian economy was completely devastated by the events of the war. Most of the industry, including whole production plants were removed either to Russia or Germany. Industrial production of Belarus in 1945 amounted for less than 20% of its pre-war size. Most of the factories evacuated to Russia, with several spectacular exceptions, were not returned to Belarus after 1945. During the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union first rebuilt and then expanded the BSSR's economy, with control always exerted exclusively from Moscow. During this time, Belarus became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR. Huge industrial objects like the BelAZ, MAZ, and the Minsk Tractor Plant were built in the country. The increase in jobs resulted in a huge immigrant population of Russians in Belarus. Russian became the official language of administration and the peasant class, which traditionally was the base for Belarusian nation, ceased to exist.\nPerestroika and Glasnost.\nOn 26 April 1986, the Chernobyl disaster occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine situated close to the border with Belarus. It is regarded as the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power. It produced a plume of radioactive debris that drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia. Large areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia were contaminated, resulting in the evacuation and resettlement of roughly 200,000 people. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus. The effects of the Chernobyl accident in Belarus were dramatic: about 50,000\u00a0km2 (or about a quarter of the territory of Belarus) formerly populated by 2.2 million people (or a fifth of the Belarusian population) now require permanent radioactive monitoring (after receiving doses over 37 kBq/m2 of caesium-137). 135,000 persons were permanently resettled and many more were resettled temporarily. After 10 years since the accident, the occurrences of thyroid cancer among children increased fifteenfold (the sharp rise started in about four years after the accident).\nOn 27 July 1990, Belarus declared its national sovereignty, a key step toward independence from the Soviet Union. Around that time, Stanislav Shushkevich became the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, the top leadership position in Belarus.\nOn 25 August 1991, after the failure of the August Coup in Moscow, Belarus declared full independence from the USSR by granting the declaration of state sovereignty a constitutional status that it did not have before.\nRepublic of Belarus.\nIndependent country and the Commonwealth.\nOn 8 December 1991, Shushkevich met with Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, in Belavezhskaya Pushcha, to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nPost-Soviet countries have signed a series of treaties and agreements to settle the legacy of the former Soviet Union multilaterally and bilaterally.\nLukashenko era.\nA new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Alexander Lukashenko was elected president of Belarus. Having assumed the rights and responsibilities of the Soviet Union on the territory of Byelarus, in December 1994 Lukashenko signed the Budapest Memorandum along with Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States acting as guarantors and thereby denuclearized the nation.\nThe 1996 referendum resulted in amendments to the constitution that removed key powers from the parliament.\nIn 1999 opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar disappeared and were presumably killed. In 2001, Lukashenko was re-elected as president in elections described as undemocratic by Western observers. At the same time, the west began criticizing him as authoritarian. In 2006, Lukashenko was once again re-elected in presidential elections again criticized as flawed by most European Union countries.\nIn 2010, Lukashenko was re-elected once again in presidential elections which were again described as falsified by most EU countries and organizations such as the OSCE. A peaceful protest against the electoral flaws turned into a riot when demonstrators tried to storm a government building. The police used batons to quell the riot. Seven presidential candidates and hundreds of rioters were arrested by KGB.\nLukashenko's disputed victory in the country's 2020 presidential election led to widespread allegations of vote rigging, which strongly amplified anti-government protests, the largest during his rule. Protesters have faced violent persecution by the authorities. A statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office on 1 September cited more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, as well as reports of sexual abuse and rape. Several protesters were killed. Following the contested election, Lukashenko is not recognized by the United Kingdom, the European Union, or the United States as the legitimate president of Belarus.\nOn 23 May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 was diverted by the Belarusian government to Minsk National Airport, where two of its passengers, opposition activist and former editor-in-chief of the Telegram channel Nexta Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, were arrested by authorities. In summer of the same year, Belarusian authorities organized the 2021\u20132022 Belarus\u2013European Union border crisis consisting of an influx of tens of thousands of immigrants, primarily from Iraqi Kurdistan, to Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland via those countries' borders with Belarus.\nBelarus allowed its territory to be used by the Russian army in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to stage and launch forces from the north into Ukraine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Additionally, it specifies a service provider interface (SPI) that allows directory service implementations to be plugged into the framework. The information looked up via JNDI may be supplied by a server, a flat file, or a database; the choice is up to the implementation used.\nTypical uses of JNDI include:\nBackground.\nThe Java RMI and Java EE APIs use the JNDI API to look up objects in a network.\nThe API provides:\nThe SPI portion allows support for practically any kind of naming or directory service, including:\nSun Microsystems first released the JNDI specification on March 10, 1997. As of 2006[ [update]], the current version is JNDI 1.2.\nBasic lookup.\nJNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) organizes its names into a hierarchy. A name can be any string such as \"com.example.ejb.MyBean\". A name can also be an object that implements the codice_1 interface; however, a string is the most common way to name an object. A name is bound to an object in the directory by storing either the object or a reference to the object in the directory service identified by the name.\nThe JNDI API defines a context that specifies where to look for an object. The initial context is typically used as a starting point.\nIn the simplest case, an initial context must be created using the specific implementation and extra parameters required by the implementation. The initial context will be used to look up a name. The initial context is analogous to the root or top of a directory tree for a file system. Below is an example of creating an initial context:\nHashtable contextArgs = new Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt;();\n// First you must specify the context factory.\n// This is how you choose between jboss implementation\n// vs. an implementation from Sun or other vendors.\ncontextArgs.put( Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, \"com.jndiprovider.TheirContextFactory\" );\n// The next argument is the URL specifying where the data store is:\ncontextArgs.put( Context.PROVIDER_URL, \"jndiprovider-database\" );\n// (You may also have to provide security credentials)\n// Next you create the initial context\nContext myCurrentContext = new InitialContext(contextArgs);\nA context is then used to look up previously bound names in that context. For example:\nMyBean myBean = (MyBean) myCurrentContext.lookup(\"com.mydomain.MyBean\");\nAlternative to above code is as below:\nThe Context object can also be configured by adding jndi.properties file in classpath containing initial context factory class name and provider URL. The above code will be reduced as shown below:\n//just need to create initial context object, it will try to read jndi.properties file from the classpath.\nContext myCurrentContext = new InitialContext();\nA context is then used to look up previously bound names in that context. For example:\nMyBean myBean = (MyBean) myCurrentContext.lookup(\"com.mydomain.MyBean\");\nSearching.\nAttributes may be attached to special entries called directories. Directories enable searching for objects by their associated attributes. Directories are a type of context; they restrict the name space much like a directory structure on a file system does."}

It was formerly a church (360\u20131453) and a museum (1935\u20132020). The last of three church buildings to be successively erected on the site by the Eastern Roman Empire, it was completed in AD 537, becoming the world's largest interior space and among the first to employ a fully pendentive dome. It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have \"changed the history of architecture\". From its dedication in 360 until 1453 Hagia\u202fSophia served as the cathedral of Constantinople in the Byzantine liturgical tradition, except for the period 1204\u20131261 when the Latin Crusaders installed their own hierarchy. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, it served as a mosque, having its minarets added soon after. The site became a museum in 1935, and was redesignated as a mosque in 2020.\nThe current structure was built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I as the Christian cathedral of Constantinople between 532\u2013537 and was designed by the Greek geometers Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. It was formally called the Temple of God's Holy Wisdom, () the third church of the same name to occupy the site, as the prior one had been destroyed in the Nika riots. As the episcopal see of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, it remained the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years, until the Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520.\nHagia Sophia became the quintessential model for Eastern Orthodox church architecture, and its architectural style was emulated by Ottoman mosques a thousand years later. The Hagia Sophia served as an architectural inspiration for many other religious buildings including the Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, Panagia Ekatontapiliani, the \u015eehzade Mosque, the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque, the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque and the K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali Pasha Complex.\nAs the religious and spiritual centre of the Eastern Orthodox Church for nearly one thousand years, the church was dedicated to Holy Wisdom. The church has been described as \"holding a unique position in the Christian world\", and as \"an architectural and cultural icon of Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox civilization\". It was where the excommunication of Patriarch Michael I Cerularius was officially delivered by Humbert of Silva Candida, the envoy of Pope Leo IX in 1054, an act considered the start of the East\u2013West Schism. In 1204, it was converted during the Fourth Crusade into a Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire, before being restored to the Eastern Orthodox Church upon the restoration of the Byzantine Empire in 1261. Enrico Dandolo, the doge of Venice who led the Fourth Crusade and the 1204 Sack of Constantinople, was buried in the church.\nAfter the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, it was converted to a mosque by Mehmed the Conqueror and became the principal mosque of Istanbul until the 1616 construction of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.livescience.com/27574-hagia-sophia.html2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The patriarchate moved to the Church of the Holy Apostles, which became the city's cathedral. The complex remained a mosque until 1931, when it was closed to the public for four years. It was re-opened in 1935 as a museum under the secular Republic of Turkey, and the building was Turkey's most visited tourist attraction as of 2019[ [update]]. In 2020, the Council of State annulled the 1934 decision to establish the museum, and the Hagia Sophia was reclassified as a mosque. The decision was highly controversial, sparking divided opinions and drawing condemnation from the Turkish opposition, UNESCO, the World Council of Churches and the International Association of Byzantine Studies, as well as numerous international leaders, while several Muslim leaders in Turkey and other countries welcomed its conversion.\nHistory.\nChurch of Constantius II.\nThe first church on the site was known as the () because of its size compared to the sizes of the contemporary churches in the city. According to the \"Chronicon Paschale\", the church was consecrated on 15 February 360, during the reign of the emperor Constantius II (r.\u2009337\u00a0\u2013\u00a0361) by the Arian bishop Eudoxius of Antioch. It was built next to the area where the Great Palace was being developed.\nAccording to the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian Socrates of Constantinople, the emperor Constantius had c.\u2009346 \"constructed the Great Church alongside that called Irene which because it was too small, the emperor's father [Constantine] had enlarged and beautified\". A tradition which is not older than the 7th or 8th century reports that the edifice was built by Constantius' father, Constantine the Great (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0337). \nHesychius of Miletus wrote that Constantine built Hagia Sophia with a wooden roof and removed 427 (mostly pagan) statues from the site. The 12th-century chronicler Joannes Zonaras reconciles the two opinions, writing that Constantius had repaired the edifice consecrated by Eusebius of Nicomedia, after it had collapsed. Since Eusebius was the bishop of Constantinople from 339 to 341, and Constantine died in 337, it seems that the first church was erected by Constantius.\nThe nearby Hagia Irene (\"Holy Peace\") church was completed earlier and served as cathedral until the Great Church was completed. Besides Hagia Irene, there is no record of major churches in the city-centre before the late 4th century. Rowland Mainstone argued the 4th-century church was not yet known as Hagia Sophia.\nThe church is known to have had a timber roof, curtains, columns, and an entrance that faced west. It likely had a narthex and is described as being shaped like a Roman circus. This may mean that it had a U-shaped plan like the basilicas of San Marcellino e Pietro and Sant'Agnese fuori le mura in Rome. However, it may also have been a more conventional three-, four-, or five-aisled basilica, perhaps resembling the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The building was likely preceded by an atrium, as in the later churches on the site.\nAccording to Ken Dark and Jan Kostenec, a further remnant of the 4th century basilica may exist in a wall of alternating brick and stone banded masonry immediately to the west of the Justinianic church. The top part of the wall is constructed with bricks stamped with brick-stamps dating from the 5th century, but the lower part is of constructed with bricks typical of the 4th century. This wall was probably part of the propylaeum at the west front of both the Constantinian and Theodosian Great Churches.\nThe building was accompanied by a baptistery and a \"skeuophylakion\". A hypogeum, perhaps with an martyrium above it, was discovered before 1946, and the remnants of a brick wall with traces of marble revetment were identified in 2004. The hypogeum was a tomb which may have been part of the 4th-century church or may have been from the pre-Constantinian city of Byzantium. The \"skeuophylakion\" is said by Palladius to have had a circular floor plan, and since some U-shaped basilicas in Rome were funerary churches with attached circular mausolea (the Mausoleum of Constantina and the Mausoleum of Helena), it is possible it originally had a funerary function, though by 405 its use had changed. A later account credited a woman called Anna with donating the land on which the church was built in return for the right to be buried there.\nExcavations on the western side of the site of the first church under the propylaeum wall reveal that the first church was built atop a road about wide. According to early accounts, the first Hagia Sophia was built on the site of an ancient pagan temple, although there are no artefacts to confirm this.\nThe Patriarch of Constantinople John Chrysostom came into a conflict with Empress Aelia Eudoxia, wife of the emperor Arcadius (r.\u2009383\u00a0\u2013\u00a0408), and was sent into exile on 20 June 404. During the subsequent riots, this first church was largely burnt down. Palladius noted that the 4th-century \"skeuophylakion\" survived the fire. According to Dark and Kostenec, the fire may only have affected the main basilica, leaving the ancillary buildings intact.\nChurch of Theodosius II.\nA second church on the site was ordered by Theodosius II (r.\u2009402\u00a0\u2013\u00a0450), who inaugurated it on 10 October 415. The \"Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae,\" a fifth-century list of monuments, names Hagia Sophia as , while the former cathedral Hagia Irene is referred to as . At the time of Socrates of Constantinople around 440, \"both churches [were] enclosed by a single wall and served by the same clergy\". Thus, the complex would have encompassed a large area including the future site of the Hospital of Samson. If the fire of 404 destroyed only the 4th-century main basilica church, then the 5th century Theodosian basilica could have been built surrounded by a complex constructed primarily during the fourth century.\nDuring the reign of Theodosius II, the emperor's elder sister, the \"Augusta\" Pulcheria (r.\u2009414\u00a0\u2013\u00a0453) was challenged by the patriarch Nestorius (r.\u200910 April 428\u00a0\u2013\u00a022 June 431). The patriarch denied the \"Augusta\" access to the sanctuary of the \"Great Church\", likely on 15 April 428. According to the anonymous \"Letter to Cosmas\", the virgin empress, a promoter of the cult of the Virgin Mary who habitually partook in the Eucharist at the sanctuary of Nestorius's predecessors, claimed right of entry because of her equivalent position to the \"Theotokos\" \u2013 the Virgin Mary \u2013 \"having given birth to God\". Pulcheria along with Pope Celestine\u00a0I and Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria had Nestorius overthrown, condemned at the ecumenical council, and exiled.\nThe area of the western entrance to the Justinianic Hagia Sophia revealed the western remains of its Theodosian predecessor, as well as some fragments of the Constantinian church. German archaeologist Alfons Maria Schneider began conducting archaeological excavations during the mid-1930s, publishing his final report in 1941. Excavations in the area that had once been the 6th-century atrium of the Justinianic church revealed the monumental western entrance and atrium, along with columns and sculptural fragments from both 4th- and 5th-century churches. Further digging was abandoned for fear of harming the structural integrity of the Justinianic building, but parts of the excavation trenches remain uncovered, laying bare the foundations of the Theodosian building.\nThe basilica was built by architect Rufinus. The church's main entrance, which may have had gilded doors, faced west, and there was an additional entrance to the east. There was a central pulpit and likely an upper gallery, possibly employed as a matroneum (women's section). The exterior was decorated with elaborate carvings of rich Theodosian-era designs, fragments of which have survived, while the floor just inside the portico was embellished with polychrome mosaics. The surviving carved gable end from the centre of the western fa\u00e7ade is decorated with a cross-roundel. Fragments of a frieze of reliefs with 12 lambs representing the 12 apostles also remain; unlike Justinian's 6th-century church, the Theodosian Hagia Sophia had both colourful floor mosaics and external decorative sculpture.\nAt the western end, surviving stone fragments of the structure show there was vaulting, at least at the western end. The Theodosian building had a monumental propylaeum hall with a portico that may account for this vaulting, which was thought by the original excavators in the 1930s to be part of the western entrance of the church itself. The propylaeum opened onto an atrium which lay in front of the basilica church itself. Preceding the propylaeum was a steep monumental staircase following the contours of the ground as it sloped away westwards in the direction of the Strategion, the Basilica, and the harbours of the Golden Horn. This arrangement would have resembled the steps outside the atrium of the Constantinian Old St Peter's Basilica in Rome. Near the staircase, there was a cistern, perhaps to supply a fountain in the atrium or for worshippers to wash with before entering.\nThe 4th-century \"skeuophylakion\" was replaced in the 5th century by the present-day structure, a rotunda constructed of banded masonry in the lower two levels and of plain brick masonry in the third. Originally this rotunda, probably employed as a treasury for liturgical objects, had a second-floor internal gallery accessed by an external spiral staircase and two levels of niches for storage. A further row of windows with marble window frames on the third level remain bricked up. The gallery was supported on monumental consoles with carved acanthus designs, similar to those used on the late 5th-century Column of Leo. A large lintel of the \"skeuophylakion\"'s western entrance \u2013 bricked up during the Ottoman era \u2013 was discovered inside the rotunda when it was archaeologically cleared to its foundations in 1979, during which time the brickwork was also repointed. The \"skeuophylakion\" was again restored in 2014 by the Vak\u0131flar.\nA fire started during the tumult of the Nika Revolt, which had begun nearby in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, and the second Hagia Sophia was burnt to the ground on 13\u201314 January 532. The court historian Procopius wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And by way of shewing that it was not against the Emperor alone that they [the rioters] had taken up arms, but no less against God himself, unholy wretches that they were, they had the hardihood to fire the Church of the Christians, which the people of Byzantium call \"Sophia\", an epithet which they have most appropriately invented for God, by which they call His temple; and God permitted them to accomplish this impiety, foreseeing into what an object of beauty this shrine was destined to be transformed. So the whole church at that time lay a charred mass of ruins.\u2014\u200a\nChurch of Justinian I (current structure).\nOn 23 February 532, only a few weeks after the destruction of the second basilica, Emperor Justinian I inaugurated the construction of a third and entirely different basilica, larger and more majestic than its predecessors. Justinian appointed two architects, mathematician Anthemius of Tralles and geometer and engineer Isidore of Miletus, to design the building.\nConstruction of the church began in 532 during the short tenure of Phocas as praetorian prefect. According to John the Lydian, Phocas was responsible for funding the initial construction of the building with 4,000 Roman pounds of gold, but he was dismissed from office in October 532. John the Lydian wrote that Phocas had acquired the funds by moral means, but Evagrius Scholasticus later wrote that the money had been obtained unjustly.\nAccording to Anthony Kaldellis, both of Hagia Sophia's architects named by Procopius were associated with the school of the pagan philosopher Ammonius of Alexandria. It is possible that both they and John the Lydian considered Hagia Sophia a great temple for the supreme Neoplatonist deity who manifestated through light and the sun. John the Lydian describes the church as the \"\"temenos\" of the Great God\" ().\nOriginally the exterior of the church was covered with marble veneer, as indicated by remaining pieces of marble and surviving attachments for lost panels on the building's western face. The white marble cladding of much of the church, together with gilding of some parts, would have given Hagia Sophia a shimmering appearance quite different from the brick- and plaster-work of the modern period, and would have significantly increased its visibility from the sea. The cathedral's interior surfaces were sheathed with polychrome marbles, green and white with purple porphyry, and gold mosaics. The exterior was clad in stucco that was tinted yellow and red during the 19th-century restorations by the Fossati architects.\nThe construction is described by Procopius in \"On Buildings\" (, ). Columns and other marble elements were imported from throughout the Mediterranean, although the columns were once thought to be spoils from cities such as Rome and Ephesus. Even though they were made specifically for Hagia Sophia, they vary in size. \nMore than ten thousand people were employed during the construction process. This new church was contemporaneously recognized as a major work of architecture. Outside the church was an elaborate array of monuments around the bronze-plated Column of Justinian, topped by an equestrian statue of the emperor which dominated the Augustaeum, the open square outside the church which connected it with the Great Palace complex through the Chalke Gate. \nAt the edge of the Augustaeum was the Milion and the Regia, the first stretch of Constantinople's main thoroughfare, the \"Mese\". Also facing the Augustaeum were the enormous Constantinian \"thermae\", the Baths of Zeuxippus, and the Justinianic civic basilica under which was the vast cistern known as the Basilica Cistern. On the opposite side of Hagia Sophia was the former cathedral, Hagia Irene.\nProcopius lauded the Justinianic building, writing in \"De aedificiis\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... the Emperor Justinian built not long afterwards a church so finely shaped, that if anyone had enquired of the Christians before the burning if it would be their wish that the church should be destroyed and one like this should take its place, shewing them some sort of model of the building we now see, it seems to me that they would have prayed that they might see their church destroyed forthwith, in order that the building might be converted into its present form.\u2014\u200a\nUpon seeing the finished building, the Emperor reportedly said: \"Solomon, I have surpassed thee\".\nJustinian and Patriarch Menas inaugurated the new basilica on 27 December 537, 5 years and 10 months after construction started, with much pomp. Hagia Sophia was the seat of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and a principal setting for Byzantine imperial ceremonies, such as coronations. The basilica offered sanctuary from persecution to criminals, although there was disagreement about whether Justinian had intended for murderers to be eligible for asylum.\nEarthquakes in 553 and on 557 caused cracks in the main dome and eastern semi-dome. According to the \"Chronicle\" of John Malalas, during a subsequent earthquake in 558, the eastern semi-dome collapsed, destroying the ambon, altar, and ciborium. The collapse was due mainly to the excessive bearing load and to the enormous shear load of the dome, which was too flat. These caused the deformation of the piers which sustained the dome. Justinian ordered an immediate restoration. He entrusted it to Isidorus the Younger, who used lighter materials. The entire vault had to be taken down and rebuilt 20 Byzantine feet () higher than before, giving the building its current interior height of . Moreover, Isidorus changed the dome type, erecting a ribbed dome with pendentives whose diameter was between 32.7 and 33.5\u00a0m. Under Justinian's orders, eight Corinthian columns were disassembled from Baalbek, Lebanon and shipped to Constantinople around 560. This reconstruction, which gave the church its present 6th-century form, was completed in 562. The poet Paul the Silentiary composed an \"ekphrasis\", or long visual poem, for the re-dedication of the basilica presided over by Patriarch Eutychius on 24 December 562.\nAccording to the history of the patriarch Nicephorus\u00a0I and the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, various liturgical vessels of the cathedral were melted down on the order of the emperor Heraclius (r.\u2009610\u00a0\u2013\u00a0641) during the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628. Theophanes states that these were made into gold and silver coins, and a tribute was paid to the Avars. The Avars attacked the extramural areas of Constantinople in 623, causing the Byzantines to move the \"garment\" relic () of Mary, mother of Jesus to Hagia Sophia from its usual shrine of the Church of the \"Theotokos\" at Blachernae just outside the Theodosian walls. On 14 May 626, the \"Scholae Palatinae\", an elite body of soldiers, protested in Hagia Sophia against a planned increase in bread prices. The Persians under Shahrbaraz and the Avars together laid the siege of Constantinople in 626; according to the \"Chronicon Paschale\", on 2 August 626, Theodore Syncellus, a deacon and presbyter of Hagia Sophia, was among those who negotiated unsuccessfully with the \"khagan\" of the Avars. A homily, attributed by existing manuscripts to Theodore Syncellus and possibly delivered on the anniversary of the event, describes the translation of the Virgin's garment and its ceremonial re-translation to Blachernae by the patriarch Sergius\u00a0I after the threat had passed.\nIn 726, the emperor Leo the Isaurian issued a series of edicts against the veneration of images, ordering the army to destroy all icons \u2013 ushering in the period of Byzantine iconoclasm. At that time, all religious pictures and statues were removed from the Hagia Sophia. Following a brief hiatus during the reign of Empress Irene (797\u2013802), the iconoclasts returned. Emperor Theophilus (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842) had two-winged bronze doors with his monograms installed at the southern entrance of the church.\nThe basilica suffered damage, first in a great fire in 859, and again in an earthquake in 869 that caused the collapse of one of the half-domes. Emperor Basil\u00a0I ordered repair of the tympanas, arches, and vaults.\nIn his book \"De Ceremoniis\" (\"Book of Ceremonies\"), the emperor Constantine VII (r.\u2009913\u00a0\u2013\u00a0959) wrote a detailed account of the ceremonies held in the Hagia Sophia by the emperor and the patriarch.\nEarly in the 10th century, the pagan ruler of the Kievan Rus' sent emissaries to his neighbors to learn about Judaism, Islam, and Roman and Orthodox Christianity. After visiting Hagia Sophia his emissaries reported back: \"We were led into a place where they serve their God, and we did not know where we were, in heaven or on earth.\"\nIn the 940s or 950s, probably around 954 or 955, after the Rus'\u2013Byzantine War of 941 and the death of the Grand Prince of Kiev, Igor\u00a0I (r.\u2009912\u00a0\u2013\u00a0945), his widow Olga of Kiev \u2013 regent for her infant son Sviatoslav\u00a0I (r.\u2009945\u00a0\u2013\u00a0972) \u2013 visited the emperor Constantine VII and was received as queen of the Rus' in Constantinople. She was probably baptized in Hagia Sophia's baptistery, taking the name of the reigning \"augusta\", Helena Lecapena, and receiving the titles \"z\u014dst\u0113 patrik\u00eda\" and the styles of \"archontissa\" and hegemon of the Rus'. Her baptism was an important step towards the Christianization of the Kievan Rus', though the emperor's treatment of her visit in \"De caerimoniis\" does not mention baptism. According to an early 14th-century source, the second church in Kiev, Saint Sophia's, was founded in \"anno mundi\" 6460 in the Byzantine calendar, or c.\u2009952. The name of this future cathedral of Kiev probably commemorates Olga's baptism.\nAfter an earthquake in 989 collapsed the western dome arch, Emperor Basil II asked for the Armenian architect Trdat, creator of the Cathedral of Ani, to direct the repairs. He erected again and reinforced the fallen dome arch, and rebuilt the west side of the dome with 15 dome ribs. The extent of the damage required six years of repair and reconstruction; the church was re-opened on 13 May 994. At the end of the reconstruction, the church's decorations were renovated, including the addition of four immense paintings of cherubs; a new depiction of Christ on the dome; a burial cloth of Christ shown on Fridays, and on the apse a new depiction of the Virgin Mary holding Jesus, between the apostles Peter and Paul. On the great side arches were painted the prophets and the teachers of the church.\nIn 1181, the daughter of the emperor Manuel\u00a0I, Maria Comnena, and her husband, the \"caesar\" Renier of Montferrat, fled to Hagia Sophia at the culmination of their dispute with the empress Maria of Antioch, regent for her son, the emperor Alexius II Comnenus. Maria Comnena and Renier occupied the cathedral with the support of the patriarch, refusing the imperial administration's demands for a peaceful departure. According to Niketas Choniates, they \"transformed the sacred courtyard into a military camp\", garrisoned the entrances to the complex with locals and mercenaries, and despite the strong opposition of the patriarch, made the \"house of prayer into a den of thieves or a well-fortified and precipitous stronghold\", while \"all the dwellings adjacent to Hagia Sophia and adjoining the Augusteion were demolished by [Maria's] men\". A battle ensued in the Augustaion and around the Milion, during which the defenders fought from the \"gallery of the Catechumeneia (also called the Makron)\" facing the Augusteion, from which they eventually retreated and took up positions in the exonarthex of Hagia Sophia itself. At this point, \"the patriarch was anxious lest the enemy troops enter the temple, with unholy feet trample the holy floor, and with hands defiled and dripping with blood still warm plunder the all-holy dedicatory offerings\". After a successful sally by Renier and his knights, Maria requested a truce, the imperial assault ceased, and an amnesty was negotiated. Greek historian Niketas Choniates compared the preservation of the cathedral to the efforts made by the 1st-century emperor Titus to avoid the destruction of the Second Temple during the siege of Jerusalem in the First Jewish\u2013Roman War. Choniates reports that in 1182, a white hawk wearing jesses was seen to fly from the east to Hagia Sophia, flying three times from the \"building of the \"Th\u014dmait\u0113s\"\" (a basilica erected on the southeastern side of the Augustaion) to the Palace of the Kathisma in the Great Palace, where new emperors were acclaimed. This was supposed to presage the end of the reign of Andronicus\u00a0I Comnenus (r.\u20091183\u00a0\u2013\u00a01185).\nChoniates writes that in 1203, during the Fourth Crusade, the emperors Isaac\u00a0II Angelus and Alexius IV Angelus stripped Hagia Sophia of all gold ornaments and silver oil-lamps to pay off the Crusaders who had ousted Alexius III Angelus and helped Isaac return to the throne. In the Sack of Constantinople in 1204, the church was further ransacked and desecrated by the Crusaders, as described by Choniates, though he did not witness the events in person. According to his account, Hagia Sophia was stripped of its remaining metal ornaments, its altar was smashed into pieces, and a \"woman laden with sins\" sang and danced on the synthronon. He adds that mules and donkeys were brought into the cathedral's sanctuary to carry away the spoils, and that one of them slipped on the marble floor and was accidentally disembowelled, further contaminating the place. According to Ali ibn al-Athir, whose treatment of the Sack of Constantinople was probably dependent on a Christian source, the Crusaders massacred some clerics who had surrendered. Much of the interior was damaged and would not be repaired until its return to Orthodox control in 1261. The sack of Hagia Sophia, and Constantinople in general, remained a sore point in Catholic\u2013Eastern Orthodox relations.\nDuring the Latin occupation of Constantinople (1204\u20131261), the church became a Latin Catholic cathedral. Baldwin\u00a0I of Constantinople (r.\u20091204\u00a0\u2013\u00a01205) was crowned emperor on 16 May 1204 in Hagia Sophia in a ceremony which closely followed Byzantine practices. Enrico Dandolo, the Doge of Venice who commanded the sack and invasion of the city in 1204, is buried inside the church, probably in the upper eastern gallery. In the 19th century, an Italian restoration team placed a cenotaph marker, frequently mistaken as being a medieval artifact, near the probable location and is still visible. The original tomb was destroyed by the Ottomans during the conversion of the church into a mosque.\nUpon the capture of Constantinople in 1261 by the Empire of Nicaea and the emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus, (r.\u20091261\u00a0\u2013\u00a01282), the church was in a dilapidated state. In 1317, emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus (r.\u20091282\u00a0\u2013\u00a01328) ordered four new buttresses () to be built in the eastern and northern parts of the church, financing them with the inheritance of his late wife, Irene of Montferrat (d.1314). New cracks developed in the dome after the earthquake of October 1344, and several parts of the building collapsed on 19 May 1346. Repairs by architects Astras and Peralta began in 1354.\nOn 12 December 1452, Isidore of Kiev proclaimed in Hagia Sophia the long-anticipated ecclesiastical union between the western Catholic and eastern Orthodox Churches as decided at the Council of Florence and decreed by the papal bull \"Laetentur Caeli\", though it would be short-lived. The union was unpopular among the Byzantines, who had already expelled the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory III, for his pro-union stance. A new patriarch was not installed until after the Ottoman conquest. According to the Greek historian Doukas, the Hagia Sophia was tainted by these Catholic associations, and the anti-union Orthodox faithful avoided the cathedral, considering it to be a haunt of demons and a \"Hellenic\" temple of Roman paganism. Doukas also notes that after the \"Laetentur Caeli\" was proclaimed, the Byzantines dispersed discontentedly to nearby venues where they drank toasts to the Hodegetria icon, which had, according to late Byzantine tradition, interceded to save them in the former sieges of Constantinople by the Avar Khaganate and the Umayyad Caliphate.\nAccording to \"Nestor Iskander's Tale on the Taking of Tsargrad\", the Hagia Sophia was the focus of an alarming omen interpreted as the Holy Spirit abandoning Constantinople on 21 May 1453, in the final days of the Siege of Constantinople. The sky lit up, illuminating the city, and many people gathered and saw on the Church of the Wisdom, at the top of the window, a large flame of fire issuing forth. It encircled the entire neck of the church for a long time. The flame gathered into one; its flame altered, and there was an indescribable light. At once it took to the sky. ... The light itself has gone up to heaven; the gates of heaven were opened; the light was received; and again they were closed. The eventual fall of Constantinople had long been predicted in apocalyptic literature. Hagia Sophia is mentioned in a hagiography of uncertain date detailing the life of the Eastern Orthodox saint Andrew the Fool. The text is self-attributed to Nicephorus, a priest of Hagia Sophia, and contains a description of the end time in the form of a dialogue, in which the interlocutor, upon being told by the saint that Constantinople will be sunk in a flood and that \"the waters as they gush forth will irresistibly deluge her and cover her and surrender her to the terrifying and immense sea of the abyss\", says \"some people say that the Great Church of God will not be submerged with the city but will be suspended in the air by an invisible power\". The reply is given that \"When the whole city sinks into the sea, how can the Great Church remain? Who will need her? Do you think God dwells in temples made with hands?\" The Column of Constantine, however, is prophesied to endure.\nAccording to Laonicus Chalcocondyles, Hagia Sophia was a refuge for the population during the city's capture. Despite the ill-repute and empty state of Hagia Sophia after December 1452, Doukas writes that after the Theodosian walls were breached, the Byzantines took refuge there as the Turks advanced through the city. He attributes their change of heart to a prophecy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What was the reason that compelled all to flee to the Great Church? They had been listening, for many years, to some pseudo-soothsayers, who had declared that the city was destined to be handed over to the Turks, who would enter in large numbers and would massacre the Romans as far as the Column of Constantine the Great. After this an angel would descend, holding his sword. He would hand over the kingdom, together with the sword, to some insignificant, poor, and humble man who would happen to be standing by the Column. He would say to him: \"Take this sword and avenge the Lord's people.\" Then the Turks would be turned back, would be massacred by the pursuing Romans, and would be ejected from the city and from all places in the west and the east and would be driven as far as the borders of Persia, to a place called the Lone Tree ... That was the cause for the flight into the Great Church. In one hour that famous and enormous church was filled with men and women. An innumerable crowd was everywhere: upstairs, downstairs, in the courtyards, and in every conceivable place. They closed the gates and stood there, hoping for salvation.\u2014\u200a\nIn accordance with the traditional custom of the time, Sultan Mehmed\u00a0II allowed three full days of unbridled pillage in the city shortly after it was captured. This period saw the destruction of many Orthodox churches; Hagia Sophia itself was looted as the invaders believed it to contain the greatest treasures of the city. Shortly after the defence of the Walls of Constantinople collapsed and the victorious Ottoman troops entered the city, the pillagers and looters made their way to the Hagia Sophia and battered down its doors before storming inside. Once the three days passed, Mehmed was to claim the city's remaining contents for himself. However, by the end of the first day, he proclaimed that the looting should cease as he felt profound sadness when he toured the city.\nThroughout the siege of Constantinople, the trapped people of the city participated in the Divine Liturgy and the Prayer of the Hours at the Hagia Sophia, and the church was a refuge for many of those who were unable to contribute to the city's defence, including women, children, elderly, the sick and the wounded. As they were trapped in the church, the many congregants and other refugees became spoils-of-war to be divided amongst the triumphant invaders. The building was desecrated and looted, and those who sought shelter within the church were enslaved. While most of the elderly and the infirm, injured, and sick were killed, the remainder (mainly teenage males and young boys) were chained and sold into slavery in the Ottoman Empire.\nMosque (1453\u20131935).\nConstantinople fell to the attacking Ottoman forces on 29 May 1453. Sultan Mehmed\u00a0II entered the city and performed the Friday prayer and \"khutbah\" (sermon) in Hagia Sophia. The church's priests and religious personnel continued to perform Christian rites, prayers, and ceremonies until they were compelled to stop. When Mehmed and his entourage entered the church, he ordered that it be converted into a mosque immediately. One of the \"\u02bfulam\u0101\u02be\" (Islamic scholars) present climbed onto the church's ambo and recited the \"shahada\" (\"There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger\"), thus marking the conversion of the church into a mosque. Mehmed is reported to have taken a sword to a soldier who tried to pry up one of the paving slabs of the Proconnesian marble floor.\nAs described by Western visitors before 1453, such as the C\u00f3rdoban nobleman Pero Tafur and the Florentine geographer Cristoforo Buondelmonti, the church was in a dilapidated state, with several of its doors fallen from their hinges. Mehmed\u00a0II ordered a renovation of the building. Mehmed attended the first Friday prayer in the mosque on 1 June 1453. Aya Sofya became the first imperial mosque of Istanbul. Most of the existing houses in the city and the area of the future Topkap\u0131 Palace were endowed to the corresponding waqf. From 1478, 2,360 shops, 1,300 houses, 4 caravanserais, 30 \"boza\" shops, and 23 shops of sheep heads and trotters gave their income to the foundation. Through the imperial charters of 1520 and 1547, shops and parts of the Grand Bazaar and other markets were added to the foundation.\nBefore 1481, a small minaret was erected on the southwest corner of the building, above the stair tower. Mehmed's successor Bayezid\u00a0II (r.\u20091481\u00a0\u2013\u00a01512) later built another minaret at the northeast corner. One of the minarets collapsed after the earthquake of 1509, and around the middle of the 16th century they were both replaced by two diagonally opposite minarets built at the east and west corners of the edifice. In 1498, Bernardo Bonsignori was the last Western visitor to Hagia Sophia to report seeing the ancient Justinianic floor; shortly afterwards the floor was covered over with carpet and not seen again until the 19th century.\nIn the 16th century, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r.\u20091520\u00a0\u2013\u00a01566) brought two colossal candlesticks from his of the Kingdom of Hungary and placed them on either side of the \"mihrab\". During Suleiman's reign, the mosaics above the narthex and imperial gates depicting Jesus, Mary, and various Byzantine emperors were covered by whitewash and plaster, which were removed in 1930 under the Turkish Republic.\nDuring the reign of Selim\u00a0II (r.\u20091566\u00a0\u2013\u00a01574), the building started showing signs of fatigue and was extensively strengthened with the addition of structural supports to its exterior by Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, who was also an earthquake engineer. In addition to strengthening the historic Byzantine structure, Sinan built two additional large minarets at the western end of the building, the original sultan's lodge and the t\u00fcrbe (mausoleum) of Selim\u00a0II to the southeast of the building in 1576\u20131577. In order to do that, parts of the Patriarchate at the south corner of the building were pulled down the previous year. Moreover, the golden crescent was mounted on the top of the dome, and a respect zone 35 \"ar\u015f\u0131n\" (about 24\u00a0m) wide was imposed around the building, leading to the demolition of all houses within the perimeter. The t\u00fcrbe became the location of the tombs of 43 Ottoman princes. Murad III (r.\u20091574\u00a0\u2013\u00a01595) imported two large alabaster Hellenistic urns from Pergamon (Bergama) and placed them on two sides of the nave.\nIn 1594 \"Mimar\" (court architect) Davud A\u011fa built the t\u00fcrbe of Murad III, where the Sultan and his \"valide\", Safiye Sultan were buried. The octagonal mausoleum of their son Mehmed III (r.\u20091595\u00a0\u2013\u00a01603) and his \"valide\" was built next to it in 1608 by royal architect Dalgi\u00e7 Mehmet A\u011da. His son Mustafa\u00a0I (r.\u20091617\u00a0\u2013\u00a01618,\u00a01622\u00a0\u2013\u00a01623) converted the baptistery into his t\u00fcrbe.\nIn 1717, under the reign of Sultan Ahmed III (r.\u20091703\u00a0\u2013\u00a01730), the crumbling plaster of the interior was renovated, contributing indirectly to the preservation of many mosaics, which otherwise would have been destroyed by mosque workers. It was usual for the mosaic's tesserae\u2014believed to be talismans\u2014to be sold to visitors. Sultan Mahmud\u00a0I ordered the restoration of the building in 1739 and added a \"medrese\" (a Koranic school, subsequently the library of the museum), an \"imaret\" (soup kitchen for distribution to the poor) and a library, and in 1740 he added a \"\u015eadirvan\" (fountain for ritual ablutions), thus transforming it into a \"k\u00fclliye\", or social complex. A new sultan's lodge and a new mihrab were built inside.\nRenovation of 1847\u20131849.\nThe 19th-century restoration of the Hagia Sophia was ordered by Sultan Abdulmejid\u00a0I (r.\u20091823\u00a0\u2013\u00a01861) and completed between 1847 and 1849 by eight hundred workers under the supervision of the Swiss-Italian architect brothers Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati. The brothers consolidated the dome with a restraining iron chain and strengthened the vaults, straightened the columns, and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building. The mosaics in the upper gallery were exposed and cleaned, although many were recovered \"for protection against further damage\".\nEight new gigantic circular-framed discs or medallions were hung from the cornice, on each of the four piers and at either side of the apse and the west doors. These were designed by the calligrapher Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi and painted with the names of Allah, Muhammad, the Rashidun (the first four caliphs), and the two grandsons of Muhammad. In 1850, the architects Fossati built a new maqsura or caliphal loge in Neo-Byzantine columns and an Ottoman\u2013Rococo style marble grille connecting to the royal pavilion behind the mosque. The new maqsura was built at the extreme east end of the northern aisle, next to the north-eastern pier. The existing maqsura in the apse, near the mihrab, was demolished. A new entrance was constructed for the sultan: the . The Fossati brothers also renovated the minbar and mihrab.\nOutside the main building, the minarets were repaired and altered so that they were of equal height. A clock building, the , was built by the Fossatis for use by the muwaqqit (the mosque timekeeper), and a new madrasa (Islamic school) was constructed. The was also built under their direction. When the restoration was finished, the mosque was re-opened with a ceremony on 13 July 1849. An edition of lithographs from drawings made during the Fossatis' work on Hagia Sophia was published in London in 1852, entitled: \"Aya Sophia of Constantinople as Recently Restored by Order of H.M. The Sultan Abdulmejid\".\nOccupation of Istanbul (1918\u20131923).\nIn the aftermath of the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War\u00a0I, Constantinople was occupied by British, French, Italian, and Greek forces. On none }}, the Greek Orthodox Christian military priest Eleftherios Noufrakis performed a Divine Liturgy in the Hagia Sophia, the only such instance since the 1453 fall of Constantinople. The anti-occupation Sultanahmet demonstrations were held next to Hagia Sophia from March to May 1919. In Greece, the 500 drachma banknotes issued in 1923 featured Hagia Sophia.\nMuseum (1935\u20132020).\nIn 1935, the first Turkish President and founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, transformed the building into a museum. During the Second World War, the minarets of the museum housed MG 08 machine guns. The carpet and the layer of mortar underneath were removed and marble floor decorations such as the \"omphalion\" appeared for the first time since the Fossatis' restoration, when the white plaster covering many of the mosaics had been removed. Due to neglect, the condition of the structure continued to deteriorate, prompting the World Monuments Fund (WMF) to include the Hagia Sophia in their 1996 and 1998 Watch Lists. The building's copper roof had cracked, causing water to leak down over the fragile frescoes and mosaics. Moisture entered from below as well. Rising ground water increased the level of humidity within the monument, creating an unstable environment for stone and paint. The WMF secured a series of grants from 1997 to 2002 for the restoration of the dome. The first stage of work involved the structural stabilization and repair of the cracked roof, which was undertaken with the participation of the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The second phase, the preservation of the dome's interior, afforded the opportunity to employ and train young Turkish conservators in the care of mosaics. By 2006, the WMF project was complete, though many areas of Hagia Sophia continue to require significant stability improvement, restoration, and conservation.\nIn 2014, Hagia Sophia was the second most visited museum in Turkey, attracting almost 3.3 million visitors annually.\nWhile use of the complex as a place of worship (mosque or church) was strictly prohibited, in 1991 the Turkish government allowed the allocation of a pavilion in the museum complex (\"Ayasofya M\u00fczesi H\u00fcnkar Kasr\u0131\") for use as a prayer room, and, since 2013, two of the museum's minarets had been used for voicing the call to prayer (the ezan) regularly.\nFrom the early 2010s, several campaigns and government high officials, notably Turkey's deputy prime minister B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7 in November 2013, demanded the Hagia Sophia be converted back into a mosque. In 2015, Pope Francis publicly acknowledged the Armenian genocide, which is officially denied in Turkey. In response, the mufti of Ankara, Mefail H\u0131zl\u0131, said he believed the Pope's remarks would accelerate the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque.\nOn 1 July 2016, Muslim prayers were held again in the Hagia Sophia for the first time in 85\u00a0years. That November, a Turkish NGO, the \"Association for the Protection of Historic Monuments and the Environment\", filed a lawsuit for converting the museum into a mosque. The court decided it should stay as a 'monument museum'. In October 2016, Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs (\"Diyanet\") appointed, for the first time in 81 years, a designated imam, \u00d6nder Soy, to the Hagia Sophia mosque. Since then, the adhan has been regularly called out from the Hagia Sophia's minarets five times a day.\nOn 13 May 2017, a large group of people, organized by the Anatolia Youth Association, gathered in front of Hagia Sophia and prayed the morning prayer with a call for the re-conversion of the museum into a mosque. On 21 June 2017 the \"\" organized a special programme, broadcast live by state-run television TRT, which included the recitation of the Quran and prayers in Hagia Sophia, to mark the Laylat al-Qadr.\nReversion to mosque (2020\u2013present).\nSince 2018, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan had talked of reverting the status of the Hagia Sophia back to a mosque, as a populist gesture. On 31 March 2018 Erdo\u011fan recited the first verse of the Quran in the Hagia Sophia, dedicating the prayer to the \"souls of all who left us this work as inheritance, especially Istanbul's conqueror,\" strengthening the political movement to make the Hagia Sophia a mosque once again. \nIn March 2019, Erdo\u011fan said that he would change the status of Hagia Sophia from a museum to a mosque, adding that it had been a \"very big mistake\" to turn it into a museum. As a UNESCO World Heritage site, this change would require approval from UNESCO's World Heritage Committee. In late 2019 Erdo\u011fan's office took over the administration and upkeep of the nearby Topkap\u0131 Palace Museum, transferring responsibility for the site from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism by presidential decree.\nIn 2020, Turkey's government celebrated the 567th anniversary of the Conquest of Constantinople with an Islamic prayer in Hagia Sophia. In May, during the anniversary events, passages from the Quran were read in the Hagia Sophia. Greece condemned this action, while Turkey in response accused Greece of making \"futile and ineffective statements\". In June, the head of Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs said that \"we would be very happy to open Hagia Sophia for worship\" and that if it happened \"we will provide our religious services as we do in all our mosques\". On 25 June, John Haldon, president of the International Association of Byzantine Studies, wrote an open letter to Erdo\u011fan asking that he \"consider the value of keeping the Aya Sofya as a museum\".\nOn 10 July 2020, the decision of the Council of Ministers from 1935 to transform the Hagia Sophia into a museum was annulled by the Council of State, decreeing that Hagia Sophia cannot be used \"for any other purpose\" than being a mosque and that the Hagia Sophia was property of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han Foundation. The council reasoned Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II, who conquered Istanbul, deemed the property to be used by the public as a mosque without any fees and was not within the jurisdiction of the Parliament or a ministry council. \nDespite secular and global criticism, Erdo\u011fan signed a decree annulling the Hagia Sophia's museum status, reverting it to a mosque. The call to prayer was broadcast from the minarets shortly after the announcement of the change and rebroadcast by major Turkish news networks. A presidential spokesperson said it would become a working mosque, open to anyone similar to the Parisian churches Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur and Notre-Dame. The spokesperson also said that the change would not affect the status of the Hagia Sophia as a UNESCO World Heritage site, and that \"Christian icons\" within it would continue to be protected.\nA presidential spokesperson claimed that all political parties in Turkey supported Erdo\u011fan's decision, but the Peoples' Democratic Party had previously released a statement denouncing the decision, saying \"decisions on human heritage cannot be made on the basis of political games played by the government\". The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, said that he supports the conversion \"as long as it benefits Turkey\", adding that he felt that Hagia Sophia has been a mosque since 1453. \nAli Babacan attacked the policy of his former ally Erdo\u011fan, saying the Hagia Sophia issue \"has come to the agenda now only to cover up other problems\". Orhan Pamuk, Turkish novelist and Nobel laureate, publicly denounced the move, saying \"Kemal Atat\u00fcrk changed... Hagia Sophia from a mosque to a museum, honouring all previous Greek Orthodox and Latin Catholic history, making it as a sign of Turkish modern secularism\".\nOn 17 July, Erdo\u011fan announced that the first prayers in the Hagia Sophia would be open to between 1,000 and 1,500 worshippers, stating that Turkey had sovereign power over Hagia Sophia and was not obligated to bend to international opinion.\nWhile the Hagia Sophia has now been rehallowed as a mosque, certain areas remains open for visitors outside of prayer times. Most of the ground floor remains restricted to worshipers, however the upper galleries were reopened to visitors in 2024. Women visitors are required to wear headscarfs to enter. Entrance was initially free, but starting from 15 January 2024, foreign nationals have to pay an entrance fee. \nOn 22 July, a turquoise-coloured carpet was laid to prepare the mosque for worshippers. The mosque opened for Friday prayers on 24 July, the 97th anniversary of the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the borders of the modern Turkish Republic. The mosaics of the Virgin and Child in the apse were covered by white drapes. Ali Erba\u015f, President of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, proclaimed during his sermon, \"Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror dedicated this magnificent construction to believers to remain a mosque until the Day of Resurrection\". Erdo\u011fan and some government ministers attended the midday prayers as many worshippers prayed outside; at one point the security cordon was breached and dozens of people broke through police lines. Turkey invited foreign leaders and officials, including Pope Francis, for the prayers. It is the fourth Byzantine church converted from museum to a mosque during Erdo\u011fan's rule.\nDays before the final decision on the conversion was made, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew\u00a0I of Constantinople stated in a sermon that \"the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque would disappoint millions of Christians around the world\". The proposed conversion was decried by other Orthodox Christian leaders, the Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch Kirill of Moscow stating that \"a threat to Hagia Sophia [wa]s a threat to all of Christian civilization\".\nFollowing the Turkish government's decision, UNESCO announced it \"deeply regret[ted]\" the conversion \"made without prior discussion\", and asked Turkey to \"open a dialogue without delay\", stating that the lack of negotiation was \"regrettable\". UNESCO further announced that the \"state of conservation\" of Hagia Sophia would be \"examined\" at the next session of the World Heritage Committee, urging Turkey \"to initiate dialogue without delay, in order to prevent any detrimental effect on the universal value of this exceptional heritage\". Ernesto Ottone, UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for Culture said \"It is important to avoid any implementing measure, without prior discussion with UNESCO, that would affect physical access to the site, the structure of the buildings, the site's moveable property, or the site's management\".\nThe World Council of Churches condemned the decision to convert the building into a mosque, saying that would \"inevitably create uncertainties, suspicions and mistrust\". At the recitation of the Sunday Angelus prayer at St Peter's Square on 12 July Pope Francis said, \"My thoughts go to Istanbul. I think of Santa Sophia and I am very pained\" ().\nJosep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Vice-President of the European Commission, released a statement calling the decisions by the Council of State and Erdo\u011fan \"regrettable\" and pointing out that \"as a founding member of the Alliance of Civilisations, Turkey has committed to the promotion of inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue and to fostering of tolerance and co-existence.\" According to Borrell, the European Union member states' twenty-seven foreign ministers \"condemned the Turkish decision to convert such an emblematic monument as the Hagia Sophia\" at meeting on 13 July, saying it \"will inevitably fuel the mistrust, promote renewed division between religious communities and undermine our efforts at dialog and cooperation\" and that \"there was a broad support to call on the Turkish authorities to urgently reconsider and reverse this decision\".\nGreece denounced the conversion and considered it a breach of the UNESCO World Heritage titling. Greek culture minister Lina Mendoni called it an \"open provocation to the civilised world\" which \"absolutely confirms that there is no independent justice\" in Erdo\u011fan's Turkey, and that his Turkish nationalism \"takes his country back six centuries\". Greece and Cyprus called for EU sanctions on Turkey. Morgan Ortagus, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State, noted: \"We are disappointed by the decision by the government of Turkey to change the status of the Hagia Sophia.\" Jean-Yves Le Drian, foreign minister of France, said his country \"deplores\" the move, saying \"these decisions cast doubt on one of the most symbolic acts of modern and secular Turkey\".\nVladimir Dzhabarov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian Federation Council, said that it \"will not do anything for the Muslim world. It does not bring nations together, but on the contrary brings them into collision\" and calling the move a \"mistake\". The former deputy prime minister of Italy, Matteo Salvini, held a demonstration in protest outside the Turkish consulate in Milan, calling for all plans for accession of Turkey to the European Union to be terminated \"once and for all\". In East Jerusalem, a protest was held outside the Turkish consulate on 13 July, with the burning of a Turkish flag and the display of the Greek flag and flag of the Greek Orthodox Church.\nErsin Tatar, prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey, welcomed the decision, calling it \"sound\" and \"pleasing\". Through a spokesman the Foreign Ministry of Iran welcomed the change, saying the decision was an \"issue that should be considered as part of Turkey's national sovereignty\" and \"Turkey's internal affair\". Sergei Vershinin, deputy foreign minister of Russia, said that the matter was of one of \"internal affairs, in which, of course, neither we nor others should interfere.\" The Arab Maghreb Union was supportive.\nEkrema Sabri, imam of the al-Aqsa Mosque, and Ahmed bin Hamad al-Khalili, grand mufti of Oman, both congratulated Turkey on the move. The Muslim Brotherhood was also in favour of the news. A spokesman for the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas called the verdict \"a proud moment for all Muslims\". Pakistani politician Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi of the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) welcomed the ruling, claiming it was \"not only in accordance with the wishes of the people of Turkey but the entire Muslim world\". The Muslim Judicial Council group in South Africa praised the move, calling it \"a historic turning point\". In Nouakchott, capital of Mauritania, there were prayers and celebrations topped by the sacrifice of a camel. On the other hand, Shawki Allam, grand mufti of Egypt, ruled that conversion of the Hagia Sophia to a mosque is \"impermissible\".\nWhen Erdo\u011fan announced that the first Muslim prayers would be held inside the building on 24 July, he added that \"like all our mosques, the doors of Hagia Sophia will be wide open to locals and foreigners, Muslims and non-Muslims.\" Presidential spokesman \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n said that the icons and mosaics of the building would be preserved, and that \"in regards to the arguments of secularism, religious tolerance and coexistence, there are more than four hundred churches and synagogues open in Turkey today.\" The Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, told TRT Haber on 13 July that the government was surprised at the reaction of UNESCO, saying that \"We have to protect our ancestors' heritage. The function can be this way or that way \u2013 it does not matter\".\nOn 14 July the prime minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said his government was \"considering its response at all levels\" to what he called Turkey's \"unnecessary, petty initiative\", and that \"with this backward action, Turkey is opting to sever links with western world and its values\". In relation to both Hagia Sophia and the Cyprus\u2013Turkey maritime zones dispute, Mitsotakis called for European sanctions against Turkey, referring to it as \"a regional troublemaker, and which is evolving into a threat to the stability of the whole south-east Mediterranean region\". Dora Bakoyannis, Greek former foreign minister, said Turkey's actions had \"crossed the Rubicon\", distancing itself from the West.\nArmenia's Foreign Ministry expressed \"deep concern\" about the move, adding that it brought to a close Hagia Sophia's symbolism of \"cooperation and unity of humankind instead of clash of civilizations.\" Catholicos Karekin II, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, said the move \"violat[ed] the rights of national religious minorities in Turkey.\" Sahak II Mashalian, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, perceived as loyal to the Turkish government, endorsed the decision to convert the museum into a mosque. He said, \"I believe that believers' praying suits better the spirit of the temple instead of curious tourists running around to take pictures.\"\nIn July 2021, UNESCO asked for an updated report on the state of conservation and expressed \"grave concern\". There were also some concerns about the future of its World Heritage status. Turkey responded that the changes had \"no negative impact\" on UNESCO standards and the criticism is \"biased and political\".\nArchitecture.\nHagia Sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture. Its interior is decorated with mosaics, marble pillars, and coverings of great artistic value. Justinian had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time, and it was to remain the largest cathedral for 1,000 years until the completion of the cathedral in Seville in Spain.\nThe Hagia Sophia uses masonry construction. The structure has brick and mortar joints that are 1.5 times the width of the bricks. The mortar joints are composed of a combination of sand and minute ceramic pieces distributed evenly throughout the mortar joints. This combination of sand and potsherds was often used in Roman concrete, a predecessor to modern concrete. A considerable amount of iron was used as well, in the form of cramps and ties.\nJustinian's basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of late antiquity and the first masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the Eastern Christianity, Western Christianity, and Islam alike.\nThe vast interior has a complex structure. The nave is covered by a central dome which at its maximum is from floor level and rests on an arcade of 40 arched windows. Repairs to its structure have left the dome somewhat elliptical, with the diameter varying between .\nAt the western entrance and eastern liturgical side, there are arched openings extended by half domes of identical diameter to the central dome, carried on smaller semi-domed exedrae, a hierarchy of dome-headed elements built up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the central dome, with a clear span of .The theories of Hero of Alexandria, a Hellenistic mathematician of the 1st century AD, may have been utilized to address the challenges presented by building such an expansive dome over so large a space. Svenshon and Stiffel proposed that the architects used Hero's proposed values for constructing vaults. The square measurements were calculated using the side-and-diagonal number progression, which results in squares defined by the numbers 12 and 17, wherein 12 defines the side of the square and 17 its diagonal, which have been used as standard values as early as in cuneiform Babylonian texts.\nEach of the four sides of the great square Hagia Sophia is approximately 31\u00a0m long, and it was previously thought that this was the equivalent of 100 Byzantine feet. Svenshon suggested that the size of the side of the central square of Hagia Sophia is not 100 Byzantine feet but instead 99 feet. This measurement is not only rational, but it is also embedded in the system of the side-and-diagonal number progression (70/99) and therefore a usable value by the applied mathematics of antiquity. It gives a diagonal of 140 which is manageable for constructing a huge dome.\nFloor.\nThe stone floor of Hagia Sophia dates from the 6th century. After the first collapse of the vault, the broken dome was left \"in situ\" on the original Justinianic floor and a new floor was laid above the rubble when the dome was rebuilt in 558. From the installation of this second Justinianic floor, the floor became part of the liturgy, with significant locations and spaces demarcated in various ways using different-coloured stones and marbles.\nThe floor is predominantly made up of Proconnesian marble, quarried on Proconnesus (Marmara Island) in the Propontis (Sea of Marmara). This was the main white marble used in the monuments of Constantinople. Other parts of the floor, like the Thessalian verd antique \"marble\", were quarried in Thessaly in Roman Greece. The Thessalian verd antique bands across the nave floor were often likened to rivers.\nThe floor was praised by numerous authors and repeatedly compared to a sea. The Justinianic poet Paul the Silentiary likened the ambo and the solea connecting it to the sanctuary with an island in a sea, with the sanctuary itself a harbour. The 9th-century \"Narratio\" writes of it as \"like the sea or the flowing waters of a river\". Michael the Deacon in the 12th century also described the floor as a sea in which the ambo and other liturgical furniture stood as islands. \nDuring the 15th-century conquest of Constantinople, the Ottoman caliph Mehmed is said to have ascended to the dome and the galleries in order to admire the floor, which according to Tursun Beg resembled \"a sea in a storm\" or a \"petrified sea\". Other Ottoman-era authors also praised the floor; T\u00e2c\u00eez\u00e2de Cafer \u00c7elebi compared it to waves of marble. The floor was hidden beneath a carpet on 22 July 2020.\nNarthex and portals.\nThe Imperial Gate, or Imperial Door, was the main entrance between the exo- and esonarthex, and it was originally exclusively used by the emperor. A long ramp from the northern part of the outer narthex leads up to the upper gallery.\nUpper gallery.\nThe upper gallery, or matroneum, is horseshoe-shaped; it encloses the nave on three sides and is interrupted by the apse. Several mosaics are preserved in the upper gallery, an area traditionally reserved for the Empress and her court. The best-preserved mosaics are located in the southern part of the gallery.\nThe northern first floor gallery contains runic graffiti believed to have been left by members of the Varangian Guard. Structural damage caused by natural disasters is visible on the Hagia Sophia's exterior surface. To ensure that the Hagia Sophia did not sustain any damage on the interior of the building, studies have been conducted using ground penetrating radar within the gallery of the Hagia Sophia. With the use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), teams discovered weak zones within the Hagia Sophia's gallery and also concluded that the curvature of the vault dome has been shifted out of proportion, compared to its original angular orientation.\nDome.\nThe dome of Hagia Sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians, architects, and engineers because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned it. The dome is carried on four spherical triangular pendentives, making the Hagia Sophia one of the first large-scale uses of this element. The pendentives are the corners of the square base of the dome, and they curve upwards into the dome to support it, thus restraining the lateral forces of the dome and allowing its weight to flow downwards. The main dome of the Hagia Sophia was the largest pendentive dome in the world until the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and it has a much lower height than any other dome of such a large diameter.\nThe great dome at the Hagia Sophia is in diameter and is only thick. The main building materials for the original Hagia Sophia were brick and mortar. Brick aggregate was used to make roofs easier to construct. Due to the material's plasticity, it was chosen over cut stone due to the fact that aggregate can be used over a longer distance. According to Rowland Mainstone, \"it is unlikely that the vaulting-shell is anywhere more than one normal brick in thickness\".\nThe weight of the dome remained a problem for most of the building's existence. The original cupola collapsed entirely after the earthquake of 558; in 563 a new dome was built by Isidore the Younger. Unlike the original, this included 40 ribs and was raised 6.1 meters (20 feet), in order to lower the lateral forces on the church walls. A larger section of the second dome collapsed as well, over two episodes, so that as of 2021, only two sections of the present dome, the north and south sides, are from the 562 reconstructions. Of the whole dome's 40 ribs, the surviving north section contains eight ribs, while the south section includes six ribs.\nAlthough this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The bricklayers used more mortar than brick, which is more effective if the mortar was allowed to settle, as the building would have been more flexible; however, the builders did not allow the mortar to cure before they began the next layer. When the dome was erected, its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath.\nWhen Isidore the Younger rebuilt the fallen cupola, he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again. The architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls. He shaped the new cupola like a scalloped shell or the inside of an umbrella, with ribs that extend from the top down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.\nHagia Sophia is famous for the light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the nave, giving the dome the appearance of hovering. This effect was achieved by inserting forty windows around the base of the original structure, which also reduced its weight.\nButtresses.\nNumerous buttresses have been added throughout the centuries. The flying buttresses to the west of the building, although thought to have been constructed by the Crusaders upon their visit to Constantinople, were actually built during the Byzantine era. This shows that the Romans had prior knowledge of flying buttresses, which can also be seen at in Greece, at the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, at the monastery of Hosios Loukas in Boeotia, and in Italy at the octagonal basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. Other buttresses were constructed during the Ottoman times under the guidance of the architect Sinan. A total of 24 buttresses were added.\nMinarets.\nThe minarets were an Ottoman addition and not part of the original church's Byzantine design. Mehmed had built a wooden minaret over one of the half domes soon after Hagia Sophia's conversion from a cathedral to a mosque. This minaret does not exist today. One of the minarets (at southeast) was built from red brick and can be dated back from the reign of Mehmed or his successor Beyaz\u0131d II. The other three were built from white limestone and sandstone, of which the slender northeast column was erected by Bayezid II and the two identical, larger minarets to the west were erected by Selim\u00a0II and designed by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. Both are in height, and their thick and massive patterns complete Hagia Sophia's main structure. Many ornaments and details were added to these minarets on repairs during the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries, which reflect each period's characteristics and ideals.\nNotable elements and decorations.\nOriginally, under Justinian's reign, the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs on marble slabs on the walls and floors as well as mosaics on the curving vaults. Of these mosaics, the two archangels Gabriel and Michael are still visible in the spandrels (corners) of the bema. There were already a few figurative decorations, as attested by the late 6th-century \"ekphrasis\" of Paul the Silentiary, the \"Description of Hagia Sophia\". The spandrels of the gallery are faced in inlaid thin slabs (\"opus sectile\"), showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble. In later stages, figurative mosaics were added, which were destroyed during the iconoclastic controversy (726\u2013843). Present mosaics are from the post-iconoclastic period.\nApart from the mosaics, many figurative decorations were added during the second half of the 9th century: an image of Christ in the central dome; Eastern Orthodox saints, prophets and Church Fathers in the tympana below; historical figures connected with this church, such as Patriarch Ignatius; and some scenes from the Gospels in the galleries. Basil\u00a0II let artists paint a giant six-winged seraph on each of the four pendentives. The Ottomans covered their faces with golden stars, but in 2009, one of them was restored to its original state.\nLoggia of the Empress.\nThe loggia of the empress is located in the centre of the gallery of the Hagia Sophia, above the Imperial Gate and directly opposite the apse. From this matroneum (women's gallery), the empress and the court-ladies would watch the proceedings down below. A green stone disc of verd antique marks the spot where the throne of the empress stood.\nLustration urns.\nTwo huge marble lustration (ritual purification) urns were brought from Pergamon during the reign of Sultan Murad III. They are from the Hellenistic period and carved from single blocks of marble.\nMarble Door.\nThe Marble Door inside the Hagia Sophia is located in the southern upper enclosure or gallery. It was used by the participants in synods, who entered and left the meeting chamber through this door. It is said that each side is symbolic and that one side represents heaven while the other represents hell. Its panels are covered in fruits and fish motifs. The door opens into a space that was used as a venue for solemn meetings and important resolutions of patriarchate officials.\nNice Door.\nThe Nice Door is the oldest architectural element found in the Hagia Sophia dating back to the 2nd century BC. The decorations are of reliefs of geometric shapes as well as plants that are believed to have come from a pagan temple in Tarsus in Cilicia, part of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme in modern-day Mersin Province in south-eastern Turkey. It was incorporated into the building by Emperor Theophilos in 838 where it is placed in the south exit in the inner narthex.\nImperial Gate.\nThe Imperial Gate is the door that was used solely by the Emperor and his personal bodyguard and retinue. At it is the largest door in the Hagia Sophia and has been dated to the 6th century. Byzantine sources say it was made with wood from Noah's Ark.\nIn April 2022, the door was vandalised by unknown assailant(s).\nWishing column.\nAt the northwest of the building, there is a column with a hole in the middle covered by bronze plates. This column goes by different names; the \"perspiring\" or \"sweating column\", the \"crying column\", or the \"wishing column\". Legend states that it has been moist since the appearance of Gregory Thaumaturgus near the column in 1200. It is believed that touching the moisture cures many illnesses.\nViking inscription.\nIn the southern section of Hagia Sophia, a 9th-century Viking inscription has been discovered, which reads, \"Halvdan was here.\" It is theorized that the inscription was created by a Viking soldier serving as a mercenary in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nMosaics.\nThe first mosaics which adorned the church were completed during the reign of Justin II. Many of the non-figurative mosaics in the church come from this period. Most of the mosaics, however, were created in the 10th and 12th centuries, following the periods of Byzantine Iconoclasm.\nDuring the Sack of Constantinople in 1204, the Latin Crusaders vandalized valuable items in every important Byzantine structure of the city, including the golden mosaics of the Hagia Sophia. Many of these items were shipped to Venice, whose Doge Enrico Dandolo had organized the invasion and sack of Constantinople after an agreement with Prince Alexios Angelos, the son of a deposed Byzantine emperor.\n19th-century restoration.\nFollowing the building's conversion into a mosque in 1453, many of its mosaics were covered with plaster, due to Islam's ban on representational imagery. This process was not completed at once, and reports exist from the 17th century in which travellers note that they could still see Christian images in the former church. In 1847\u20131849, the building was restored by Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati, and Sultan Abdulmejid\u00a0I allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process, which were later archived in Swiss libraries. \nThis work did not include repairing the mosaics, and after recording the details about an image, the Fossatis painted it over again. The Fossatis restored the mosaics of the two \"hexapteryga\" (six-winged angels; it is uncertain whether they are seraphim or cherubim) located on the two east pendentives, and covered their faces again before the end of the restoration. The other two mosaics, placed on the west pendentives, are copies in paint created by the Fossatis since they could find no surviving remains of them. \nAs in this case, the architects reproduced in paint damaged decorative mosaic patterns, sometimes redesigning them in the process. The Fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in the 1894 Istanbul earthquake. These include a mosaic over a now-unidentified \"Door of the Poor\", a large image of a jewel-encrusted cross, and many images of angels, saints, patriarchs, and church fathers. Most of the missing images were located in the building's two tympana.\nOne mosaic they documented is Christ Pantocrator in a circle, which would indicate it to be a ceiling mosaic, possibly even of the main dome, which was later covered and painted over with Islamic calligraphy that expounds God as the light of the universe. The Fossatis' drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are today kept in the Archive of the Canton of Ticino.\n20th-century restoration.\nMany mosaics were uncovered in the 1930s by a team from the Byzantine Institute of America led by Thomas Whittemore. The team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster but uncovered all major mosaics found.\nBecause of its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. Christian iconographic mosaics can be uncovered, but often at the expense of important and historic Islamic art. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the Islamic calligraphy on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, to permit the underlying Pantocrator mosaic of Christ as Master of the World to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).\nThe Hagia Sophia has been a victim of natural disasters that have caused deterioration to the buildings structure and walls. The deterioration of the Hagia Sophia's walls can be directly attributed to salt crystallization. The crystallization of salt is due to an intrusion of rainwater that causes the Hagia Sophia's deteriorating inner and outer walls. Diverting excess rainwater is the main solution to the deteriorating walls at the Hagia Sophia.\nBuilt between 532 and 537, a subsurface structure under the Hagia Sophia has been under investigation, using LaCoste-Romberg gravimeters to determine the depth of the subsurface structure and to discover other hidden cavities beneath the Hagia Sophia. The hidden cavities have also acted as a support system against earthquakes. With these findings using the LaCoste-Romberg gravimeters, it was also discovered that the Hagia Sophia's foundation is built on a slope of natural rock.\nImperial Gate mosaic.\nThe Imperial Gate mosaic is located in the tympanum above that gate, which was used only by the emperors when entering the church. Based on style analysis, it has been dated to the late 9th or early 10th century. The emperor with a nimbus or halo could possibly represent emperor Leo VI the Wise or his son Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus bowing down before Christ Pantocrator, seated on a jewelled throne, giving his blessing and holding in his left hand an open book.\nSouthwestern entrance mosaic.\nThe southwestern entrance mosaic, situated in the tympanum of the southwestern entrance, dates from the reign of Basil II. It was rediscovered during the restorations of 1849 by the Fossatis. The Virgin sits on a throne without a back, her feet resting on a pedestal, embellished with precious stones. The Christ Child sits on her lap, giving his blessing and holding a scroll in his left hand. On her left side stands emperor Constantine in ceremonial attire, presenting a model of the city to Mary. On her right side stands emperor Justinian\u00a0I, offering a model of the Hagia Sophia. The composition of the figure of the Virgin enthroned was probably copied from the mosaic inside the semi-dome of the apse inside the liturgical space.\nApse mosaics.\nThe mosaic in the semi-dome above the apse at the east end shows Mary, mother of Jesus holding the Christ Child and seated on a jewelled \"thokos\" backless throne. Since its rediscovery after a period of concealment in the Ottoman era, it \"has become one of the foremost monuments of Byzantium\". The infant Jesus's garment is depicted with golden \"tesserae\".\nGuillaume-Joseph Grelot, who had travelled to Constantinople, in 1672 engraved and in 1680 published in Paris an image of the interior of Hagia Sophia which shows the apse mosaic indistinctly. Together with a picture by Cornelius Loos drawn in 1710, these images are early attestations of the mosaic before it was covered towards the end of the 18th century. The mosaic of the Virgin and Child was rediscovered during the restorations of the Fossati brothers in 1847\u20131848 and revealed by the restoration of Thomas Whittemore in 1935\u20131939. It was studied again in 1964 with the aid of scaffolding.\nIt is not known when this mosaic was installed. According to Cyril Mango, the mosaic is \"a curious reflection on how little we know about Byzantine art\". The work is generally believed to date from after the end of Byzantine Iconoclasm and usually dated to the patriarchate of Photius\u00a0I (r.\u2009858\u00a0\u2013\u00a0867,\u00a0877\u00a0\u2013\u00a0886) and the time of the emperors Michael III (r.\u2009842\u00a0\u2013\u00a0867) and Basil\u00a0I (r.\u2009867\u00a0\u2013\u00a0886). Most specifically, the mosaic has been connected with a surviving homily known to have been written and delivered by Photius in the cathedral on 29 March 867.\nOther scholars have favoured earlier or later dates for the present mosaic or its composition. Nikolaos Oikonomides pointed out that Photius's homily refers to a standing portrait of the \"Theotokos\" \u2013 a \"Hodegetria\" \u2013 while the present mosaic shows her seated. Likewise, a biography of the patriarch Isidore\u00a0I (r.\u20091347\u00a0\u2013\u00a01350) by his successor Philotheus\u00a0I (r.\u20091353\u00a0\u2013\u00a01354,\u00a01364\u00a0\u2013\u00a01376) composed before 1363 describes Isidore seeing a standing image of the Virgin at Epiphany in 1347. \nSerious damage was done to the building by earthquakes in the 14th century, and it is possible that a standing image of the Virgin that existed in Photius's time was lost in the earthquake of 1346, in which the eastern end of Hagia Sophia was partly destroyed. This interpretation supposes that the present mosaic of the Virgin and Child enthroned is of the late 14th century, a time in which, beginning with Nilus of Constantinople (r.\u20091380\u00a0\u2013\u00a01388), the patriarchs of Constantinople began to have official seals depicting the \"Theotokos\" enthroned on a \"thokos\".\nStill other scholars have proposed an earlier date than the later 9th century. According to George Galavaris, the mosaic seen by Photius was a \"Hodegetria\" portrait which after the earthquake of 989 was replaced by the present image not later than the early 11th century. According to Oikonomides however, the image in fact dates to before the Triumph of Orthodoxy, having been completed c.\u2009787\u2013797, during the iconodule interlude between the First Iconoclast (726\u2013787) and the Second Iconoclast (814\u2013842) periods. Having been plastered over in the Second Iconoclasm, Oikonomides argues a new, standing image of the Virgin \"Hodegetria\" was created above the older mosaic in 867, which then fell off in the earthquakes of the 1340s and revealed again the late 8th-century image of the Virgin enthroned.\nMore recently, analysis of a hexaptych menologion icon panel from Saint Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai has determined that the panel, showing numerous scenes from the life of the Virgin and other theologically significant iconic representations, contains an image at the centre very similar to that in Hagia Sophia. The image is labelled in Greek merely , but in the Georgian language the inscription reveals the image is labelled \"of the semi-dome of Hagia Sophia\". This image is therefore the oldest depiction of the apse mosaic known and demonstrates that the apse mosaic's appearance was similar to the present day mosaic in the late 11th or early 12th centuries, when the hexaptych was inscribed in Georgian by a Georgian monk, which rules out a 14th-century date for the mosaic.\nThe portraits of the archangels Gabriel and Michael (largely destroyed) in the bema of the arch also date from the 9th century. The mosaics are set against the original golden background of the 6th century. These mosaics were believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the 6th century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era by the Byzantines of that time, as represented in the inaugural sermon by the patriarch Photios. However, no record of figurative decoration of Hagia Sophia exists before this time.\nEmperor Alexander mosaic.\nThe Emperor Alexander mosaic is not easy to find for the first-time visitor, located on the second floor in a dark corner of the ceiling. It depicts the emperor Alexander in full regalia, holding a scroll in his right hand and a globus cruciger in his left. A drawing by the Fossatis showed that the mosaic survived until 1849 and that Thomas Whittemore, founder of the Byzantine Institute of America who was granted permission to preserve the mosaics, assumed that it had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1894. Eight years after his death, the mosaic was discovered in 1958 largely through the researches of Robert Van Nice. Unlike most of the other mosaics in Hagia Sophia, which had been covered over by ordinary plaster, the Alexander mosaic was simply painted over and reflected the surrounding mosaic patterns and thus was well hidden. It was duly cleaned by the Byzantine Institute's successor to Whittemore, Paul A. Underwood.\nEmpress Zoe mosaic.\nThe Empress Zoe mosaic on the eastern wall of the southern gallery dates from the 11th century. Christ Pantocrator, clad in the dark blue robe (as is the custom in Byzantine art), is seated in the middle against a golden background, giving his blessing with the right hand and holding the Bible in his left hand. On either side of his head are the \"nomina sacra\" \"IC\" and \"XC\", meaning \"I\u0113sous Christos\". He is flanked by Constantine IX Monomachus and Empress Zoe, both in ceremonial costumes. He is offering a purse, as a symbol of donation, he made to the church, while she is holding a scroll, symbol of the donations she made. The previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones. Perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband Romanus III Argyrus or her second husband Michael IV. Another theory is that this mosaic was made for an earlier emperor and empress, with their heads changed into the present ones.\nComnenus mosaic.\nThe Comnenus mosaic, also located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery, dates from 1122. The Virgin Mary is standing in the middle, depicted, as usual in Byzantine art, in a dark blue gown. She holds the Christ Child on her lap. He gives his blessing with his right hand while holding a scroll in his left hand. On her right side stands emperor John II Comnenus, represented in a garb embellished with precious stones. He holds a purse, symbol of an imperial donation to the church.\nHis wife, the empress Irene of Hungary stands on the left side of the Virgin, wearing ceremonial garments and holding an eiletarion scroll. Their eldest son Alexius Comnenus is represented on an adjacent pilaster. He is shown as a beardless youth, probably representing his appearance at his coronation aged seventeen.\nIn this panel, one can already see a difference with the Empress Zoe mosaic that is one century older. There is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation. The Empress Irene, daughter of Ladislaus\u00a0I of Hungary, is shown with plaited blond hair, rosy cheeks, and grey eyes, revealing her Hungarian descent. The emperor is depicted in a dignified manner.\nDe\u00ebsis mosaic.\nThe De\u00ebsis mosaic (, \"Entreaty\") probably dates from 1261. It was commissioned to mark the end of 57 years of Latin Catholic use and the return to the Eastern Orthodox faith. It is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries. It is widely considered the finest in Hagia Sophia, because of the softness of the features, the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic. The style is close to that of the Italian painters of the late 13th or early 14th century, such as Duccio. In this panel the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist are imploring the intercession of Christ Pantocrator for humanity on Judgment Day. The bottom part of this mosaic is badly deteriorated. This mosaic is considered as the beginning of a renaissance in Byzantine pictorial art.\nNorthern tympanum mosaics.\nThe northern tympanum mosaics feature various saints. They have been able to survive due to their high and inaccessible location. They depict Patriarchs of Constantinople John Chrysostom and Ignatios of Constantinople standing, clothed in white robes with crosses, and holding richly jewelled Bibles. The figures of each patriarch, revered as saints, are identifiable by labels in Greek. The other mosaics in the other tympana have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes, as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the Ottoman conquerors.\nDome mosaic.\nThe dome was decorated with four non-identical figures of the six-winged angels which protect the Throne of God; it is uncertain whether they are seraphim or cherubim. The mosaics survive in the eastern part of the dome, but since the ones on the western side were damaged during the Byzantine period, they have been renewed as frescoes. During the Ottoman period each face was covered with metallic lids in the shape of stars, but these were removed to reveal the faces during renovations in 2009.\nWorks influenced by the Hagia Sophia.\nMany buildings have been modeled on the Hagia Sophia's core structure of a large central dome resting on pendentives and buttressed by two semi-domes.\nByzantine churches influenced by the Hagia Sophia include the Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, and the Hagia Irene. The Hagia Irene was remodeled to have a dome similar to the Hagia Sophia's during the reign of Justinian. Neo-Byzantine churches modeled on the Hagia Sophia include the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral, Holy Trinity Cathedral, Sibiu and Poti Cathedral. Each closely replicates the internal geometry of the Hagia Sophia. The layout of the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral is nearly identical to the Hagia Sophia in size and geometry. Its marble revetment mimics the style of the Hagia Sophia. \nThe Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa in S\u00e3o Paulo and the \u00c9glise du Saint-Esprit (Paris) both replace the two large tympanums beneath the main dome with two shallow semi-domes. Several churches combine elements of the Hagia Sophia with a Latin cross plan. For instance, the transept of the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis) is formed by two semi-domes surrounding the main dome. The church's column capitals and mosaics emulate the style of the Hagia Sophia.\nOther examples include the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia, St Sophia's Cathedral, London, Saint Clement Catholic Church, Chicago, and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Several mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty have plans based on the Hagia Sophia, including the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque and the Bayezid II Mosque.\nSynagogues based on the Hagia Sophia include the Congregation Emanu-El (San Francisco), Great Synagogue of Florence, and Hurva Synagogue.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"See also the thematically organised full bibliography in Stroth (2021), pp.\u00a0137\u2013183.\"\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Articles \n Mosaics "}

His parents are entertainers Sonny Bono and Cher, and he became widely known in appearances as a child on their television show, \"The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour\".\nChaz Bono is a trans man. In 1995, while then presenting as a woman, and several years after being outed as lesbian by the tabloid press, Chaz publicly self-identified as a lesbian in a cover story in a leading American gay monthly magazine, \"The Advocate\". Bono eventually went on to discuss the process of coming out to oneself and others in two books: \"Family Outing: A Guide to the Coming Out Process for Gays, Lesbians, and Their Families\" (1998) includes his coming-out account. The memoir \"The End of Innocence\" (2003) discusses his outing, music career, and partner Joan's death from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Bono sought out a gender transition. In a June 2009 two-part CBS TV \"Entertainment Tonight\" feature, Chaz explained that his medical transition had started a year prior. In May 2010, he legally changed his ID to match his gender and name. A documentary on Bono's experience, \"Becoming Chaz\", was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and later made its television debut on the Oprah Winfrey Network.\nEarly life.\nBono was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Cher and Sonny Bono of the pop duo Sonny &amp; Cher, stars of a TV variety show on which the young child often appeared. Bono was named after the film \"Chastity\", which was produced by Sonny and in which Cher (in her first solo role in a feature film) played a bisexual woman. Through his mother, Bono is of Armenian, Irish, English, and German ancestry. He is of Italian descent through his father.\nBono was enrolled at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts in New York City. Bono came out to both parents as a lesbian at age 18. In \"Family Outing\", Bono wrote that, \"as a child, I always felt there was something different about me. I'd look at other girls my age and feel perplexed by their obvious interest in the latest fashion, which boy in class was the cutest, and who looked the most like cover girl Christie Brinkley. When I was 13, I finally found a name for exactly how I was different. I realized I was gay.\"\nCeremony.\nBono began a short music career in 1988 with the band Ceremony, which released one album, \"Hang Out Your Poetry\", in 1993. The band featured Bono on vocals, acoustic guitar, and percussion. Other members were Steve March Torm\u00e9 (backup vocals), Heidi Shink a.k.a. Chance, Pete McRae, Steve Bauman, Louis Ruiz, and Bryn Mathieu. All but one of the band's songs were written or co-written by Bono, Shink, and Mark Hudson. They used no synthesizers or digital effects on the album; Shink noted, \"We turned our back on technology. [ ... ] It's reminiscent of the 60s, but more a tip of the hat than emulating it. We took the music we love and rejuvenated it, made it 90s.\" Critical reception of the album was lukewarm, with Roch Parisien of AllMusic describing \"Hang Out Your Poetry\" as a mildly psychedelic take on early 1990s pop, \"pleasant, accessible, well-produced ear-candy that's ultimately toothless\".\nThe songs \"Could've Been Love\" and \"Ready for Love\" were released as singles from the album. Sonny and Cher also recorded backing vocals for the track \"Livin' It Up\" on the album.\nLGBTQ activism.\nIn April 1995, Bono came out as a lesbian in an interview with \"The Advocate\", a national gay and lesbian magazine. The 1998 book \"Family Outing\" detailed how Bono's coming out \"catapulted me into a political role that has transformed my life, providing me with affirmation as a lesbian, as a woman, and as an individual.\" In the same book, Bono reported that Cher, who was both a gay icon and an ally of LGBTQ communities, was quite uncomfortable with the news at first and \"went ballistic\" before coming to terms with it: \"By August 1996, one year after I came out publicly, my mother had progressed so far that she agreed to 'come out' herself on the cover of \"The Advocate\" as the proud mother of a lesbian daughter.\" Cher has since become an outspoken LGBTQ rights activist.\nBono's paternal relationship became strained from November 1994, when his father was elected as a Republican Congressman from California. Their differing political views separated them, and they had not spoken for more than a year at the time of Sonny's fatal skiing accident in January 1998.\nBono worked as a writer at large for \"The Advocate\". As a social activist, Bono became a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, promoted National Coming Out Day, campaigned for the reelection of Bill Clinton for US president, campaigned against the Defense of Marriage Act, and served as Entertainment Media Director for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Bono was a team captain for \"Celebrity Fit Club 3\" (2006) and was supported by girlfriend Jennifer Elia, who orchestrated exercise and training sessions.\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Bono and others told the stories of the people killed there.\nTransition.\nIn mid-2008, Bono began undergoing a physical and social transition from female to male. This was confirmed in June 2009 by his publicist, who identified Bono's name as \"Chaz Bono\" and said, \"It is Chaz's hope that his choice to transition will open the hearts and minds of the public regarding this issue, just as his coming out did.\" GLAAD and the Empowering Spirits Foundation were quick to offer praise and support for the announcement. Bono's legal transition was completed on May 6, 2010, when a California court granted his request for a gender and name change. Bono made \"Becoming Chaz\", a documentary film about his transition that premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. The Oprah Winfrey Network acquired the rights to the documentary and debuted it on May 10, 2011.\nIn September 2011, he became a competitor on the 13th season of the U.S. version of \"Dancing with the Stars\", paired with professional ballroom dancer Lacey Schwimmer. The duo was eliminated on October 25, 2011. This was the first time an openly transgender man starred on a major network television show for something unrelated to being transgender.\nHis book, \"Transition: Becoming Who I Was Always Meant to Be\" was published in 2012, making him the first person of Armenian descent to publish a memoir about being an openly transgender man.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42766", "revid": "105353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42766", "title": "Climbing wall", "text": "Artificial rock climbing wall\nA climbing wall is an artificially constructed wall with manufactured grips (or \"holds\") for the hands and feet. Most walls are located indoors, and climbing on such walls is often termed indoor climbing. Some walls are brick or wooden constructions but on modern walls, the material most often used is a thick multiplex board with holes drilled into it. Recently, manufactured steel and aluminum have also been used. The wall may have places to attach belay ropes, but may also be used to practice lead climbing or bouldering.\nEach hole contains a specially formed t-nut to allow modular climbing holds to be screwed onto the wall. With manufactured steel or aluminum walls, an engineered industrial fastener is used to secure climbing holds. The face of the multiplex board climbing surface is covered with textured products including concrete and paint or polyurethane loaded with sand. In addition to the textured surface and hand holds the wall may contain surface structures such as indentions (in cuts) and protrusions (bulges), or take the form of an overhang, underhang or crack. Some grips or handholds are formed to mimic the conditions of outdoor rock, including some that are oversized and can have other grips bolted onto them.\nHistory.\nThe earliest artificial climbing walls were typically small concrete faces with protrusions made of medium-sized rocks for hand holds. Schurman Rock in Seattle, WA is believed by some to be the first artificial climbing structure in the United States, constructed in 1939.\nThe first artificial climbing wall in the world seems to be the wall commissioned by the King of Belgium Leopold III in 1937 near his palace. This was documented by Mark Sebille in his book Bel'Wall.\nThe modern artificial climbing wall began in the UK. The first wall was created in 1964 by Don Robinson, a lecturer in Physical Education at the University of Leeds, by inserting pieces of rock into a corridor wall. The first commercial wall in the UK, The Foundry Climbing Centre, was built in Sheffield in 1991, traditionally England's centre for climbing due to its proximity to the Peak District. The first indoor climbing gym in the United States was established by Vertical World in Seattle in 1987. Terre Neuve in the heart of Brussels (Belgium) was opened in 1987 as well. It is not clear which gym was opened first.\nTypes.\nThe simplest type of wall is of plywood construction, known colloquially in the climbing community as a 'woody', with a combination of either bolt-on holds or screw-on holds. Bolt-on holds are fixed to a wall with bolts that are inserted through the hold, which will have specific bolt points, and then fixed into pre-allocated screw-threaded holes in the wall. Screw-on holds are, by contrast, usually much smaller, owing to the nature of their fixing. These holds are connected to the wall by screws, which may be fastened anywhere on the wall's surface.\nSome other types of walls include slabs of granite, concrete sprayed onto a wire mesh, pre-made fiberglass panels, large trees, manufactured steel and aluminum panels, textured fiberglass walls, and inflatables. A newer innovation is the rotating climbing wall: a mechanical, mobile wall that rotates like a treadmill to match your climbing rate of ascent.\nThe most common construction method involves bolting resin hand and foot holds onto wooden boards. The boards can be of varying height &amp; steepness (from completely horizontal 'roofs' to near-vertical 'slabs') with a mixture of holds attached. These can vary from very small 'crimps', and 'pinches', and slanted-surfaced 'slopers', to 'jugs', which are often large and easy to hold. This variety, coupled with the ability for the climbs to be changed by moving the holds to new positions on the wall, has resulted in indoor climbing becoming a very popular sport.\nEquipment.\nProper climbing equipment must be used during indoor climbing.\nMost climbing gyms lend harnesses, ropes and belay devices. Some also lend climbing shoes and chalk bags. Some climbing gyms require use of chalk balls (as opposed to loose chalk) to reduce chalk dust in the air and chalk spills when a chalk bag is tipped over or stepped on. Reducing chalk in the air helps to avoid clogging ventilation systems and reduces the dust that accumulates on less-than-vertical surfaces.\nIndoor climbing.\nIndoor climbing is an increasingly popular form of rock climbing performed on artificial structures that attempt to mimic the experience of outdoor rock. The first indoor climbing gym in North America, Vertical World in Seattle, was established in 1987. The first indoor climbing hall in the world was inaugurated in Brussels, Belgium on May 16, 1987, by Isabelle Dorsimond and Marc Bott.\nTerres Neuves integrated the concept of pre-drilled plywood walls fitted with T-nuts, as developed in 1986 by the Brussels-based firm Alpi'In. Pierre d'Haenens is the inventor of this system, which is now used worldwide by all climbing wall manufacturers. Terres Neuves still exists today in an almost unchanged form.\nThe first indoor walls tended to be made primarily of brick, which limited the steepness of the wall and variety of the hand holds. More recently, indoor climbing terrain is constructed of plywood over a metal frame, with bolted-on plastic hand and footholds, and sometimes spray-coated with texture to simulate a rock face.\nMost climbing competitions are held in climbing gyms, making them a part of indoor climbing.\nCompared to outdoor climbing.\nIndoor and outdoor climbing can differ in techniques, style, and equipment. Climbing artificial walls, especially indoors, is much safer because anchor points and holds are able to be more firmly fixed, and environmental conditions can be controlled. During indoor climbing, holds are easily visible in contrast with natural walls where finding a good hold or foothold may be a challenge. Climbers on artificial walls are somewhat restricted to the holds prepared by the route setter, whereas on natural walls they can use every slope or crack in the surface of the wall. Some typical rock formations can be difficult to emulate on climbing walls.\nRoutes and grading.\nHolds come in different colours, those of the same colour often being used to denote a route, allowing routes of different difficulty levels to be overlaid on one another. Coloured tape placed under climbing holds is another way that is often used to mark different climbing routes. In attempting a given route, a climber is only allowed to use grips of the designated colour as handholds, but is usually allowed to use both handholds and footholds of the designated colour and surface structures and textures of the \"rockface\" as footholds.\nThe grade (difficulty) of the route is usually a consensus decision between the setter of the route and the first few people who climb the route. Many indoor climbing walls have people who are assigned to set these different climbing routes. These people are called route setters or course setters. As indoor climbing walls are often used to check the development of climbers' abilities, climbs are color-coded.\nRoute-setting is the design of routes by placing climbing holds in a strategic, technical, and fun way that sets how the route will flow. There are many different techniques involved with setting, and up to 5 levels of certifications are awarded to those qualified. Route setting can be defined as the backbone of indoor climbing; without a great set of routes, a gym cannot easily hope to keep a good hoard of climbers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42768", "revid": "50593771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42768", "title": "Old Church Slavonic", "text": "Medieval Slavic literary language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nOld Church Slavonic (OCS) or Old Slavonic ( ) is the first Slavic literary language and the oldest extant written Slavonic language attested in literary sources. It belongs to the South Slavic subgroup of the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family and remains the liturgical language of many Christian Orthodox churches. \nHistorians credit the 9th-century Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius with standardizing the language and undertaking the task of translating the Gospels and necessary liturgical books into it as part of the Christianization of the Slavs. It is thought to have been based primarily on the dialect of the 9th-century Byzantine Slavs living in the Province of Thessalonica (in present-day Greece).\nOld Church Slavonic played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions. Some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use these Church Slavonic recensions as a liturgical language to this day.\nAs the oldest attested Slavic language, Old Church Slavonic provides important evidence for the features of Proto-Slavic, the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages.\nNomenclature.\nThe name of the language in Old Church Slavonic texts was simply \"Slavic\" (, ), derived from the word for \"Slavs\" (, ), the self-designation of the compilers of the texts. This name is preserved in the modern native names of the Slovak and Slovene languages. The terms \"Slavic\" and \"Slavonic\" are interchangeable in English. The language is sometimes called \"Old Slavic\", which may be confused with the distinct Proto-Slavic language. Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Serbian, Slovene and Slovak linguists have claimed Old Church Slavonic; thus OCS has also been variously called \"Old Bulgarian\", \"Old Macedonian\", \"Old Slovenian\", \"Old Croatian\", or \"Old Serbian,\" or even \"Old Slovak\". The commonly accepted terms in modern English-language Slavic studies are \"Old Church Slavonic\" and \"Old Church Slavic\".\nThe term \"Old Bulgarian\" (, ) is the designation used by most Bulgarian-language writers. It was used in numerous 19th-century sources, e.g. by August Schleicher, Martin Hattala, Leopold Geitler and August Leskien, who noted similarities between the first literary Slavic works and the modern Bulgarian language. For similar reasons, Russian linguist Aleksandr Vostokov used the term \"Slav-Bulgarian\". The term is still used by some writers but nowadays normally avoided in favor of \"Old Church Slavonic\".\nThe term \"Old Macedonian\" is occasionally used by Western scholars in a regional context. According to Slavist Henrik Birnbaum, the term was introduced mostly by Macedonian scholars and it is anachronistic because there was no separate Macedonian language, distinguished from early Bulgarian, in the 9th century.\nThe obsolete term \"Old Slovenian\" was used by early 19th-century scholars who conjectured that the language was based on the dialect of Pannonia.\nHistory.\nIt is generally held that the language was standardized by two Byzantine missionaries, Cyril and his brother Methodius, for a mission to Great Moravia (the territory of today's eastern Czech Republic and western Slovakia; for details, see Glagolitic alphabet). The mission took place in response to a request by Great Moravia's ruler, Duke Rastislav for the development of Slavonic liturgy.\nAs part of preparations for the mission, in 862/863, the missionaries developed the Glagolitic alphabet and translated the most important prayers and liturgical books, including the \"Aprakos Evangeliar\", the Psalter, and the Acts of the Apostles, allegedly basing the language on the Slavic dialect spoken in the hinterland of their hometown, Thessaloniki, in present-day Greece.\nBased on a number of archaicisms preserved until the early 20th century (the articulation of yat as in Boboshtic\u00eb, Drenov\u00eb, around Thessaloniki, Razlog, the Rhodopes and Thrace and of yery as around Castoria and the Rhodopes, the presence of decomposed nasalisms around Castoria and Thessaloniki, etc.), the dialect is posited to have been part of a macrodialect extending from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, and covering southern Albania, northern Greece and the southernmost parts of Bulgaria.\nBecause of the very short time between Rastislav's request and the actual mission, it has been widely suggested that both the Glagolitic alphabet and the translations had been \"in the works\" for some time, probably for a planned mission to Bulgaria.\nThe language and the Glagolitic alphabet, as taught at the Great Moravian Academy (), were used for government and religious documents and books in Great Moravia between 863 and 885. The texts written during this phase contain characteristics of the West Slavic vernaculars in Great Moravia.\nIn 885, Pope Stephen V prohibited the use of Old Church Slavonic in Great Moravia in favour of Latin. King Svatopluk I of Great Moravia expelled the Byzantine missionary contingent in 886.\nExiled students of the two apostles then brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the Bulgarian Empire, being at least some of them Bulgarians themselves. Boris I of Bulgaria (r.\u2009852\u00a0\u2013\u00a0889) received and officially accepted them; he established the Preslav Literary School and the Ohrid Literary School.\nBoth schools originally used the Glagolitic alphabet, though the Cyrillic script developed early on at the Preslav Literary School, where it superseded Glagolitic as official in Bulgaria in 893.\nThe texts written during this era exhibit certain linguistic features of the vernaculars of the First Bulgarian Empire. Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably Croatia, Serbia, Bohemia, Lesser Poland, and principalities of the Kievan Rus' \u2013 while retaining characteristically Eastern South Slavic linguistic features.Later texts written in each of those territories began to take on characteristics of the local Slavic vernaculars, and by the mid-11th century Old Church Slavonic had diversified into a number of regional varieties (known as \"recensions\"). These local varieties are collectively known as the Church Slavonic language.\nApart from use in the Slavic countries, Old Church Slavonic served as a liturgical language in the Romanian Orthodox Church, and also as a literary and official language of the princedoms of Wallachia and Moldavia (see Old Church Slavonic in Romania), before gradually being replaced by Romanian during the 16th to 17th centuries.\nChurch Slavonic maintained a prestigious status, particularly in Russia, for many centuries\u00a0\u2013 among Slavs in the East it had a status analogous to that of Latin in Western Europe, but had the advantage of being substantially less divergent from the vernacular tongues of average parishioners.\nSome Orthodox churches, such as the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church and Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric, as well as several Eastern Catholic Churches, still use Church Slavonic in their services and chants.\nScripts.\nInitially Old Church Slavonic was written with the Glagolitic alphabet, but later Glagolitic was replaced by Cyrillic, which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire by a decree of Boris I of Bulgaria in the 9th century. Of the Old Church Slavonic canon, about two-thirds is written in Glagolitic.\nThe local Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was preserved in Serbia, Bosnia and parts of Croatia, while a variant of the angular Glagolitic alphabet was preserved in Croatia. See Early Cyrillic alphabet for a detailed description of the script and information about the sounds it originally expressed.\nPhonology.\nFor Old Church Slavonic, the following segments are reconstructible. A few sounds are given in Slavic transliterated form rather than in IPA, as the exact realisation is uncertain and often differs depending on the area that a text originated from.\nConsonants.\nFor English equivalents and narrow transcriptions of sounds, see .\nVowels.\nFor English equivalents and narrow transcriptions of sounds, see Old Church Slavonic Pronunciation on Wiktionary.\nPhonotactics.\nSeveral notable constraints on the distribution of the phonemes can be identified, mostly resulting from the tendencies occurring within the Common Slavic period, such as \"intrasyllabic synharmony\" and the \"law of open syllables\". For consonant and vowel clusters and sequences of a consonant and a vowel, the following constraints can be ascertained:\nMorphophonemic alternations.\nAs a result of the first and the second Slavic palatalizations, velars alternate with dentals and palatals. In addition, as a result of a process usually termed \"iotation\" (or \"iodization\"), velars and dentals alternate with palatals in various inflected forms and in word formation.\nIn some forms the alternations of /c/ with /\u010d/ and of /dz/ with /\u017e/ occur, in which the corresponding velar is missing. The dental alternants of velars occur regularly before /\u011b/ and /i/ in the declension and in the imperative, and somewhat less regularly in various forms after /i/, /\u0119/, /\u044c/ and /r\u044c/. The palatal alternants of velars occur before front vowels in all other environments, where dental alternants do not occur, as well as in various places in inflection and word formation described below.\nAs a result of earlier alternations between short and long vowels in roots in Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Balto-Slavic and Proto-Slavic times, and of the fronting of vowels after palatalized consonants, the following vowel alternations are attested in OCS: /\u044c/ : /i/;\u00a0 /\u044a/ : /y/ : /u/;\u00a0/e/ : /\u011b/ : /i/;\u00a0/o/ : /a/;\u00a0/o/ : /e/;\u00a0/\u011b/ : /a/;\u00a0/\u044a/ : /\u044c/;\u00a0/y/ : /i/;\u00a0/\u011b/ : /i/;\u00a0/y/ : /\u0119/.\nVowel:\u2205 alternations sometimes occurred as a result of sporadic loss of weak yer, which later occurred in almost all Slavic dialects. The phonetic value of the corresponding vocalized strong jer is dialect-specific.\nGrammar.\nAs an ancient Indo-European language, OCS has a highly inflective morphology. Inflected forms are divided in two groups, nominals and verbs. Nominals are further divided into nouns, adjectives and pronouns. Numerals inflect either as nouns or pronouns, with 1\u20134 showing gender agreement as well.\nNominals can be declined in three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, plural, dual) and seven cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, genitive, and locative. There are five basic inflectional classes for nouns: \"o/jo\"-stems, \"a/ja\"-stems, \"i\"-stems, \"u\"-stems, and consonant stems. Forms throughout the inflectional paradigm usually exhibit morphophonemic alternations.\nFronting of vowels after palatals and \"j\" yielded dual inflectional class \"o\" : \"jo\" and \"a\" : \"ja\", whereas palatalizations affected stem as a synchronic process (N sg. \"vl\u044ck\u044a\", V sg. \"vl\u044c\u010de\"; L sg. \"vl\u044cc\u011b\"). Productive classes are \"o/jo-\", \"a/ja-\", and \"i\"-stems. Sample paradigms are given in the table below:\nAdjectives are inflected as \"o/jo\"-stems (masculine and neuter) and \"a/ja\"-stems (feminine), in three genders. They could have short (indefinite) or long (definite) variants, the latter being formed by suffixing to the indefinite form the anaphoric third-person pronoun \"j\u044c\".\nSynthetic verbal conjugation is expressed in present, aorist and imperfect tenses while perfect, pluperfect, future and conditional tenses/moods are made by combining auxiliary verbs with participles or synthetic tense forms. Sample conjugation for the verb \"vesti\" \"to lead\" (underlyingly \"ved-ti\") is given in the table below.\nBasis.\nWritten evidence of Old Church Slavonic survives in a relatively small body of manuscripts, most of them written in the First Bulgarian Empire during the late 10th and the early 11th centuries. The language has an Eastern South Slavic basis in the Bulgarian-Macedonian dialectal area, with an admixture of Western Slavic (Moravian) features inherited during the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius to Great Moravia (863\u2013885).\nThe only well-preserved manuscript of the Moravian recension, the Kiev Missal, or the Kiev Folia, is characterised by the replacement of some South Slavic phonetic and lexical features with Western Slavic ones. Manuscripts written in the First Bulgarian Empire have, on the other hand, few Western Slavic features.\nThough South Slavic in phonology and morphology, Old Church Slavonic was influenced by Byzantine Greek in syntax and style, and is characterized by complex subordinate sentence structures and participial constructions.\nA large body of complex, polymorphemic words was coined, first by Saint Cyril himself and then by his students at the academies in Great Moravia and the First Bulgarian Empire, to denote complex abstract and religious terms, e.g., \ua641\u044a\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0463\ua657\u043d\u044c\u0465 (\"z\u044alod\u011bjan\u044cje\") from \ua641\u044a\u043b\u043e ('evil') + \u0434\u0463\u0442\u0438 ('do') + \u043d\u044c\u0465 (noun suffix), i.e., 'evil deed'. A significant part of them w\u0435r\u0435 calqued directly from Greek.\nOld Church Slavonic is valuable to historical linguists since it preserves archaic features believed to have once been common to all Slavic languages such as:\nOld Church Slavonic is also likely to have preserved an extremely archaic type of accentuation (probably close to the Chakavian dialect of modern Serbo-Croatian), but unfortunately, no accent marks appear in the written manuscripts.\nThe South Slavic and Eastern South Slavic nature of the language is evident from the following variations:\nOld Church Slavonic also shares the following phonetic features only with Bulgarian:\nLocal influences (recensions).\nOver time, the language adopted more and more features from local Slavic vernaculars, producing different variants referred to as Recensions or \"Redactions\". Modern convention differentiates between the earliest, classical form of the language, referred to as Old Church Slavonic, and later, vernacular-coloured forms, collectively designated as Church Slavonic. More specifically, Old Church Slavonic is exemplified by extant manuscripts written between the 9th and 11th century in Great Moravia and the First Bulgarian Empire.\nGreat Moravia.\nThe language was standardized for the first time by the mission of the two apostles to Great Moravia from 863. The manuscripts of the Moravian recension are therefore the earliest dated of the OCS recensions. The recension takes its name from the Slavic state of Great Moravia which existed in Central Europe during the 9th century on the territory of today's Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, northern Austria and southeastern Poland.\nMoravian recension.\nThis recension is exemplified by the Kiev Missal. Its linguistic characteristics include:\nFirst Bulgarian Empire.\nAlthough the missionary work of Constantine and Methodius took place in Great Moravia, it was in the First Bulgarian Empire that early Slavic written culture and liturgical literature really flourished. The Old Church Slavonic language was adopted as state and liturgical language in 893, and was taught and refined further in two bespoke academies created in Preslav (Bulgarian capital between 893 and 972), and Ohrid (Bulgarian capital between 991/997 and 1015).\nThe language did not represent one regional dialect but a generalized form of early eastern South Slavic, which cannot be localized. The existence of two major literary centres in the Empire led in the period from the 9th to the 11th centuries to the emergence of two recensions (otherwise called \"redactions\"), termed \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" respectively.\nSome researchers do not differentiate between manuscripts of the two recensions, preferring to group them together in a \"Macedo-Bulgarian\" or simply \"Bulgarian\" recension. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighboring cultures, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity.\nCommon features of both recensions:\nMoreover, consistent scribal errors indicate the following trends in the development of the recension(s) between the 9th and the 11th centuries:\nThere are also certain differences between the Preslav and Ohrid recensions. According to Huntley, the primary ones are the diverging development of the strong yers (Western: \u044a &gt; o (*) and \u044c &gt; \u0454 (*), Eastern \u044a and \u044c &gt; *), and the palatalization of dentals and labials before front vowels in East but not West. These continue to be among the primary differences between Eastern Bulgarian and Western Bulgarian/Macedonian to this day. Moreover, two different styles (or redactions) can be distinguished at Preslav; Preslav Double-Yer (\u044a \u2260 \u044c) and Preslav Single-Yer (\u044a = \u044c, usually &gt; \u044c). \nThe Preslav and Ohrid recensions are described in greater detail below:\nPreslav recension.\nThe manuscripts of the Preslav recension or \"Eastern\" variant are among the oldest of the Old Church Slavonic language, only predated by the Moravian recension. This recension was centred around the Preslav Literary School. Since the earliest datable Cyrillic inscriptions were found in the area of Preslav, it is this school which is credited with the development of the Cyrillic alphabet which gradually replaced the Glagolitic one. A number of prominent Bulgarian writers and scholars worked at the Preslav Literary School, including Naum of Preslav (until 893), Constantine of Preslav, John Exarch, Chernorizets Hrabar, etc.. The main linguistic features of this recension are the following:\nOhrid recension.\nThe manuscripts of the Ohrid recension or \"Western\" variant are among the oldest of the Old Church Slavonic language, only predated by the Moravian recension. The recension is sometimes named Macedonian because its literary centre, Ohrid, lies in the historical region of Macedonia. At that period, Ohrid administratively formed part of the province of Kutmichevitsa in the First Bulgarian Empire until the Byzantine conquest. The main literary centre of this dialect was the Ohrid Literary School, whose most prominent member and most likely founder, was Saint Clement of Ohrid who was commissioned by Boris I of Bulgaria to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state in the Slavonic language. This recension is represented by the Codex Zographensis and Marianus, among others. The main linguistic features of this recension include:\nLater recensions.\nOld Church Slavonic may have reached Slovenia as early as Cyril and Methodius's Panonian mission in 868 and is exemplified by the late 10th century Freising fragments, written in the Latin script. Later, in the 10th century, Glagolitic liturgy was carried from Bohemia to Croatia, where it established a rich literary tradition. Old Church Slavonic in the Cyrillic script was in turn transmitted from Bulgaria to Serbia in the 10th century and to Kievan Rus' in connection with its adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 988.\nThe later use of Old Church Slavonic in these medieval Slavic polities resulted in a gradual adjustment of the language to the local vernacular, while still retaining a number of Eastern South Slavic, Moravian or Bulgarian features. In all cases, yuses denasalised so that only Old Church Slavonic, modern Polish and some isolated Bulgarian dialects retained the old Slavonic nasal vowels.\nFive major recensions with such vernacular \"accommodations\" can be identified: the Czech-Moravian or Bohemian recension, which originated in the original mission in Great Moravia but became moribund as early as the late 1000s; (Middle) Bulgarian, which continued the literary tradition of the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools; Croatian, associated with the continued use of the Glagolitic alphabet; Serbian, known for at least four separate recensions; and Russian, which came to dominance in the 1800s.\nCertain authors also talk about separate Bosnian and Ruthenian recensions, whereas the use of the Bulgarian Euthymian recension in Wallachia and Moldova from the late 1300s until the early 1700s is sometimes referred to as \"Daco-Slavonic\" or \"Dacian\" recension. All of these later versions of Old Church Slavonic are collectively referred to as Church Slavonic. \nBohemian (Czech-Moravian) recension.\nThe Bohemian (Czech) recension is derived from the Moravian recension and was used in the Czech lands until 1097. It was written in Glagolitic, which is posited to have been carried over to Bohemia even before the death of Methodius. It is preserved in religious texts (e.g. Prague Fragments), legends and glosses and shows substantial influence of the Western Slavic vernacular in Bohemia at the time. Its main features are:\nBosnian recension.\nThe Bosnian recension used both the Glagolitic alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet. A home-grown version of the Cyrillic alphabet, commonly known as Bosan\u010dica, or Bosnian Cyrillic, coined as neologism in 19th century, emerged very early on (probably the 1000s). Primary features:\nThe recension has been subsumed under the Serbian recension, especially by Serbian linguistics, and (along with Bosan\u010dica) is the subject of a dispute between Serbs, Croatians and Bosniaks.\nMiddle Bulgarian.\nThe common term \"Middle Bulgarian\" is usually contrasted to \"Old Bulgarian\" (an alternative name for Old Church Slavonic) and is loosely used for manuscripts whose language demonstrates a broad spectrum of regional and temporal dialect features after the 11th century. An alternative term, Bulgarian recension of Church Slavonic, is used by some authors. \nUnlike the Old Bulgarian period, centres other than the capital of Tarnovo are only loosely defined, and designating individual recensions is difficult. Until St. Euthymius' reform, orthographies were not standardised, varying not only based on place and time\u2015reflecting a language in phonetic and grammatical flux\u2015but also by manuscript type and education and experience of the copyist. Lay works and manuscripts of less polished copyists, e.g., The Popular Vita of St. John of Rila of the late 1100s, the early 1200s Dobreyshovo Gospels or the early 1300s Troy Story exhibit far more and advanced analytical features than established canonical texts.\nMiddle Bulgarian is generally defined as a transition from the synthetic Old Bulgarian to the highly analytic New Bulgarian and Macedonian, where incipient 10th-century analytisms gradually spread from the north-east to all Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian dialects. Primary features:\nPhonological:\nMorphological:\nPre-Euthymian Tarnovo recension:\nMost norms reflect the developments in the Moesian dialectal basis of the Tarnovo region at the time.\nEuthymian recension.\nIn the early 1370s, Bulgarian Patriarch Euthymius of Tarnovo implemented a reform to standardize Bulgarian orthography. Instead of bringining the language closer to that of commoners, the \"Euthymian\", or Tarnovo, recension, rather sought to re-establish older Old Church Slavonic models, further archaizing it. The fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule in 1396 precipitated an exodus of Bulgarian men-of-letters, e.g., Cyprian, Gregory Tsamblak, Constantine of Kostenets, etc. to Wallachia, Moldova and the Grand Duchies of Lithuania and Moscow, where they enforced the Euthymian recension as liturgical and chancery language, and to the Serbian Despotate, where it influenced the Resava School.\nCroatian recension.\nThe Croatian recension of Old Church Slavonic used only the Glagolitic alphabet of angular type. It shows the development of the following characteristics:\nRussian recension.\nThe Russian recension emerged in the 1000s based on the earlier Eastern Bulgarian recension, from which it differed slightly. The earliest manuscript to contain Russian elements is the Ostromir Gospel of 1056\u20131057, which exemplifies the beginning of a Russianized Church Slavonic that gradually spread to liturgical and chancery documents. The Russianization process was cut short in the late 1300s, when a series of Bulgarian prelates, starting with Cyprian, consciously \"re-Bulgarized\" church texts to achieve maximum conformity with the Euthymian recension. The Russianization process resumed in the late 1400s but was sluggish due to the clergy's hostility towards vernacular use, which they regarded as \"contamination of the holy language\", and towards using Cyrillics to write any idiom other than Church Slavonic\u2015which was similarly deemed \"sacrilegious\". Nevertheless, Russian Church Slavonic eventually stabilised and even started projecting influence outwards, until it became entrenched as the de facto standard for all Orthodox Slavs, incl. Serbs and Bulgarians, by the early 1800s.

Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (\"prosve\u0161\u010denie\") vs. Ukrainian \u043e\u0441\u0432i\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f (\"osvi\u010dennja\") ('illumination')\n- Use of \u27e8\u0436\u0434\u27e9 (*\u0292d) instead of East Slavic \u27e8\u0436\u27e9 (*\u0292) for Pra-Slavic *dj: cf. Russian \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430 (\"ode\u017eda\") vs. Ukrainian \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0430 (\"ode\u017ea\") ('clothing')\n- Non-pleophonic \"-ra/-la\" instead of East Slavic pleophonic \"-oro/-olo\" forms: cf. Russian \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 (\"nagrada\") vs. Ukrainian \u043d\u0430\u0433o\u0440o\u0434\u0430 (\"nahoroda\") ('reward')\n- Prefixes so-/voz-/iz- instead of s-/vz- (z-)/vy-: cf.

The Euthymian recension that was pursued throughout the 1400s was gradually replaced in the 1500s by Ruthenian, an administrative language based on the Belarusian dialect of Vilno.\nSerbian recension.\nThe Serbian recension initially employed both the Glagolitic alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet, but Cyrillic eventually prevailed and was the only script used from the 1200s onwards (apart from limited use of Latin script in coastal areas).\nA home-grown side version of the Cyrillic alphabet, commonly known as Serbian Cyrillic, emerged very early on (probably the 10th century).\nThe penetration of Serbian vernacular phonemes into liturgical texts led to the stabilization of a Serbian pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic and the development of graphic and orthographic solutions. Over time, this evolution produced the Zeta-Hum, Ra\u0161ka, and Resava orthographic schools, named after their respective locations.\nThe one of oldest preserved manuscript written in the Serbian recension is the Miroslav Gospel, dated to 1180, commissioned by brother of the Great Prince of Serbia Stefan Nemanja. Today is a Serbia UNESCO's Memory of the World international register.\nPrimary features:\nResava variant.\nDue to the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria in 1396, Serbia saw an influx of educated scribes and clergy, who re-introduced a more classical form that resembled more closely the Bulgarian recension. The Resava recension developed around the Resava Literary School, founded by the order of Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 in the early 1400s and led by Bulgarian scholar Constantine of Kostenets. The recension was closely modelled on the Euthymian one, with etymological use of *\u011b (yat), *y (yery), etc., use of Bulgarian \u27e8\u0449\u27e9 (*\u0283t) and \u27e8\u0436\u0434\u27e9 (*\u0292d) for Pra-Slavic *tj/*gt/*kt and *dj, but replacing yuses with Serbian reflexes *\u0119 &gt; e &amp; *\u01eb &gt; u. In the late 1400s and early 1500s, the Resava orthography spread to Bulgaria and North Macedonia and exerted substantial influence on Wallachia. It was eventually superseded by Russian Church Slavonic in the late 1700s and early 1800s.\nRole in modern Slavic languages.\nOld Church Slavonic was initially widely intelligible across the Slavic world. However, with the gradual differentiation of individual languages, Orthodox Slavs and, to some extent, Croatians ended up in a situation of diglossia, where they used one Slavic language for religious and another one for everyday affairs. The resolution of this situation, and the choice made for the exact balance between Old Church Slavonic and vernacular elements and forms is key to understanding the relationship between (Old) Church Slavonic and modern Slavic literary languages, as well as the distance between individual languages.\nIt was first Russian polymath and grammarian Mikhail Lomonosov that defined in 1755 \"three styles\" to the balance of Church Slavonic and Russian elements in the Russian literary language: a high style\u2014with substantial Old Church Slavonic influence\u2014for formal occasions and heroic poems; a low style\u2014with substantial influence of the vernacular\u2014for comedy, prose and ordinary affairs; and a middle style, balancing between the two, for informal verse epistles, satire, etc.\nThe middle, \"Slaveno-Russian\", style eventually prevailed. Thus, while standard Russian was codified on the basis of the Central Russian dialect and the Moscow chancery language, it retains an entire stylistic layer of Church Slavonisms with typically Eastern South Slavic phonetic features. Where native and Church Slavonic terms exist side by side, the Church Slavonic one is in the higher stylistic register and is usually more abstract, e.g., the neutral \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 (\"gorod\") vs. the poetic \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 (\"gr\u0430d\") ('town').\nBulgarian faced a similar dilemma a century later, with three camps championing Church Slavonic, Slaveno-Bulgarian, and New Bulgarian as a basis for the codification of modern Bulgarian. Here the proponents of the analytic vernacular eventually won. However, the language re-imported a vast number of Church Slavonic forms, regarded as a legacy of Old Bulgarian, either directly from Russian Church Slavonic or through the mediation of Russian.\nBy contrast, Serbian made a clean break with (Old) Church Slavonic in the first half of the 1800s, as part of Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's linguistic reform, opting instead to build the modern Serbian language from the ground up, based on the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect. Ukrainian and Belarusian as well as Macedonian took a similar path in the mid and late 1800s and the late 1940s, respectively, the former two because of the association of Old Church Slavonic with stifling Russian imperial control and the latter in an attempt to distance the newly-codified language as further away from Bulgarian as possible.\nCanon.\nThe core corpus of Old Church Slavonic manuscripts is usually referred to as \"canon\". Manuscripts must satisfy certain linguistic, chronological and cultural criteria to be incorporated into the canon: they must not significantly depart from the language and tradition of Saints Cyril and Methodius, usually known as the \"Cyrillo-Methodian tradition\".\nFor example, the Freising Fragments, dating from the 10th century, show some linguistic and cultural traits of Old Church Slavonic, but they are usually not included in the canon, as some of the phonological features of the writings appear to belong to certain Pannonian Slavic dialect of the period. Similarly, the Ostromir Gospels exhibits dialectal features that classify it as East Slavic, rather than South Slavic so it is not included in the canon either. On the other hand, the Kiev Missal is included in the canon even though it manifests some West Slavic features and contains Western liturgy because of the Bulgarian linguistic layer and connection to the Moravian mission.\nManuscripts are usually classified in two groups, depending on the alphabet used, Cyrillic or Glagolitic. With the exception of the Kiev Missal and Glagolita Clozianus, which exhibit West Slavic and Croatian features respectively, all Glagolitic texts are assumed to be of the Macedonian recension:\nAll Cyrillic manuscripts are of the Preslav recension (Preslav Literary School) and date from the 11th century except for the Zographos, which is of the Ohrid recension (Ohrid Literary School):\nSample text.\nHere is the Lord's Prayer in Old Church Slavonic:\nAuthors.\nThe history of Old Church Slavonic writing includes a northern tradition begun by the mission to Great Moravia, including a short mission in the Lower Pannonia, and a Bulgarian tradition begun by some of the missionaries who relocated to Bulgaria after the expulsion from Great Moravia.\nThe first texts written in Old Church Slavonic are translations of the Gospels and Byzantine liturgical texts begun by the Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius, mostly during their mission to Great Moravia.\nThe most important authors in Old Church Slavonic after the death of Methodius and the dissolution of the Great Moravian academy were Clement of Ohrid (active also in Great Moravia), Constantine of Preslav, Chernorizetz Hrabar and John Exarch, all of whom worked in medieval Bulgaria at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century. The full text of the Second Book of Enoch is only preserved in Old Church Slavonic, although the original most certainly had been in Greek or even Hebrew or Aramaic.\nSoftware.\nPISMO: a cross-platform (Windows, Macintosh, Linux) open source software package is now available for digitizing Slavic texts.\nhttps://richmondmathewson.owlstown.net/pages/8572-pismo\nModern Slavic nomenclature.\nHere are some of the names used by speakers of modern Slavic languages:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden as well as from the autonomous areas of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and \u00c5land. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme. The council's official languages are Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish, though it uses only the mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages\u2014Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish\u2014as its working languages. These three comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the remaining 20%.\nIn 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental forum, was established to complement the council. The Council and the Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas in Northern Europe, including the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the Benelux countries and the Baltic states.\nHistory.\nDuring World War II, Denmark and Norway were occupied by Germany; Finland was under assault by the Soviet Union; while Sweden, though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the Nordic countries pursued the idea of a Scandinavian defence union to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen policy of neutrality and FCMA treaty with the USSR, could not participate.\nIt was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with NATO, which some were planning at the time. The United States, keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO as founding members. Finland and Sweden joined NATO in 2023 and 2024, respectively, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nFurther Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led Danish Prime Minister Hans Hedtoft to propose, on 13 August 1951, a consultative interparliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden during a meeting in Copenhagen on 15\u201316 March 1952. The council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of Joseph Stalin, Finland joined the council in 1955, following a voting in the Parliament of Finland on 28 October that year, effective from 23 December the same year.\nOn 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the Nordic Passport Union was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a single market but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the European Free Trade Area (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the European Economic Community (EEC).\nThis move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Helsinki Treaty outlined the workings of the council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in Reykjav\u00edk were created. Danish Prime Minister Hilmar Baunsgaard proposed full economic cooperation (\"Nordek\") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway). Nordek was then abandoned.\nAs a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation. In 1970 representatives of the Faroe Islands and \u00c5land were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations. Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics. Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in circumpolar affairs.\nIn the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the Nordic Industrial Fund, Nordtest and the Nordic Investment Bank. The council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983 and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the Baltic states and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the European Union (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership. However, Norway and Iceland did join the European Economic Area (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's Schengen Area in 1996.\nThe Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the Arctic, Baltic, Europe, and Canada. The \u00d8resund Bridge linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers. However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began EU membership talks, but decided to annul these in 2015. Unlike the Benelux, there is no explicit provision in the Treaty on European Union that takes into account Nordic co-operation. However, the Treaties provide that international agreements concluded by the Member States before they become members of the Union remain valid, even if they are contrary to the provisions of Union law. However, each Member State must take all necessary measures to eliminate any discrepancies as quickly as possible. Nordic co-operation can therefore in practice only be designed to the extent that it complies with Union law.\nOrganisation.\nCouncil.\nThe Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called \"theme session\" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories\u00a0\u2013 Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and \u00c5land\u00a0\u2013 also have Nordic secretariats.\nThe Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With all countries being members of NATO, the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.\nCouncil of Ministers.\nThe original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. The \"Nordic Council of Ministers\", founded in 1971, is responsible for intergovernmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which coordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states. The Nordic Council of Ministers has offices in the Baltic countries.\nLanguages.\nThe Nordic Council uses the three Continental Scandinavian languages (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish) as its official working languages, while interpretation and translation service is arranged for Finnish and Icelandic (but never between the Scandinavian languages). The council also publishes material in English for information purposes. The Council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community. Since 1987, under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police, and social security offices. The languages included are Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish.\nOn 31 October 2018, the council established it has five official languages, giving Finnish and Icelandic equal status with Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish from 1 January 2020 onward. While the working languages of the council's secretariat remain the three Scandinavian languages, the Council emphasised that the secretariat must include personnel with comprehensive understanding of Finnish and Icelandic as well. The then-President of the Council Michael Tetzschner thought the compromise good but also expressed concern over the change's expenses and hoped they would not increase so much that there would be pressure to switch over to using English.\nWork.\nLanguage understanding.\nThe Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the Nordic language community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.\nLocation.\nThe Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in Copenhagen and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at Ved Stranden No. 18, close to Slotsholmen.\nMembers.\nList of members.\nThe Nordic Council has five full members (which are sovereign states) and three associate members (which are self-governing regions of full member states).\nList of representatives.\nAs of \u00a02021[ [update]]\nParty groups.\nThe Nordic Council comprises the following party groups:\nObserver, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions.\nIn accordance with \u00a7 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the S\u00e1mi Parliamentary Council is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with \u00a7 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of \"guest\" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium \"may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights\" as guests. According to the council, \"within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session.\"\nThe Nordic Council of Ministers has established four \"Offices outside the Nordic Region\": In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.\nThe Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers also define Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia as \"Adjacent Areas\" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework.\nThe Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the Soviet Union, accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs. In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.\nWhile the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a Danish minority population. As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the South Schleswig Voter Federation and a member of the Social Democrats with ties to the Danish minority were elected.\nThe S\u00e1mi political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the S\u00e1mi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the S\u00e1mi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the Faroe Islands have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.\nThree of the members of the Nordic Council (Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, all EU member states), the Baltic Assembly, and the Benelux sought intensifying cooperation in the Digital Single Market, as well as discussing social matters, the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, the European migrant crisis and defense cooperation. Foreign relations in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea and the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum were also on the agenda.\nFollowing the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the Finnish member of Parliament Mikko K\u00e4rn\u00e4 announced he would launch an initiative at the Nordic council to grant Scotland observer status. Scotland's relationship with the Nordics has also been explored by Scottish journalist Anthony Heron, who would go on to interview Bertel Haarder on the topic.\nNordic unification.\nSome desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico, or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42787", "revid": "39150892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42787", "title": "History of Estonia", "text": "The history of Estonia forms a part of the history of Europe. Human settlement in what is now Estonia became possible 13,000\u201311,000 years ago, after the ice from the last glacial era had melted, and signs of the first permanent population in the region date from around 9000 BC.\nThe medieval indigenous population of Estonia was one of the last pagan civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Northern Crusades in the 13th century. After the crusaders had conquered the area by 1227, Estonia was first ruled by the King of Denmark in the north (until 1345), and then until 1559 by the Teutonic Order, and by the ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire, which from 1418 to 1562 covered the whole of Estonia, forming a part of the Livonian Confederation. After 1559, Estonia became part of the Kingdom of Sweden until 1710, when the Tsardom of Russia (Muscovy) conquered the entire area during the Great Northern War of 1700\u20131721. Throughout this period the local German-speaking nobility enjoyed significant autonomy, and High German (earlier also Low German and Latin) served as the main language of administration and education.\nThe Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750\u20131840) led to the Estonian national awakening in the middle of the 19th century. In the aftermath of World War I (1914\u20131918) and the revolutions of 1917 that brought the end to the Russian Empire, Estonia was declared an independent democratic republic in February 1918. In the Estonian War of Independence (1918\u20131920) the newly proclaimed state successfully fought against the Soviet Russian Bolshevist invasion, and in the February 1920 Russian-Estonian Peace Treaty the Soviet Russia recognised Estonian independence in perpetuity.\nDuring World War II (1939\u20131945) the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia in June 1940 and illegally annexed the country. In the course of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany occupied Estonia in 1941; the Soviet Army reoccupied Estonia in 1944. Estonia regained its independence in August 1991 and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.\nAncient Estonia: pre-history.\nMesolithic Period.\nThe region has been populated since the end of the Late Pleistocene glaciation, about 9,000 BC. The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with the Kunda culture, a culture whose origins involved a mix of Western Hunter-Gatherer and Eastern Hunter-Gatherer ancestry, with more of the former than the latter. The early Mesolithic Pulli settlement is located by the P\u00e4rnu River. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda culture received its name from the \"Lammasm\u00e4e\" settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500 BC. Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern Lithuania and southern Finland. Among minerals, flint and quartz were used the most for making cutting tools.\nNeolithic Period.\nThe beginning of the Neolithic Period is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, and appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva-type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.\nAround the beginning of 4th millennium BC Comb Ceramic culture arrived in Estonia. Until the early 1980s the arrival of Balto-Finnic peoples, the ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, and Livonians, on the shores of the Baltic Sea was associated with the Comb Ceramic Culture. However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with linguistic ones cannot be proven, and it has been suggested that the increase of settlement finds in the period is more likely to have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate. Some researchers have even argued that a Uralic language may have been spoken in Estonia and Finland since the end of the last glaciation.\nThe burial customs of the comb pottery people included additions of figures of animals, birds, snakes and men carved from bone and amber. Antiquities from comb pottery culture are found from northern Finland to eastern Prussia.\nThe beginning of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 BC is characterized by the appearance of the Corded Ware culture, pottery with corded decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes). Evidence of agriculture is provided by charred grains of wheat on the wall of a corded-ware vessel found in Iru settlement. Osteological analysis show an attempt was made to domesticate the wild boar.\nSpecific burial customs were characterized by the dead being laid on their sides with their knees pressed against their breast, one hand under the head. Objects placed into the graves were made of the bones of domesticated animals.\nBronze Age.\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 BC. The development of the borders between the Finnic peoples and the Balts was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of Saaremaa and Iru in northern Estonia, began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, and stone cist graves and cremation burials became increasingly common, alongside a small number of boat-shaped stone graves.\nAbout the 7th century BC, a large meteorite hit Saaremaa island and created the Kaali craters.\nAbout 325 BC, the Greek explorer Pytheas possibly visited Estonia. The Thule island he described has been identified as Saaremaa by Lennart Meri, though this identification is not widely considered probable, as Saaremaa lies far south of the Arctic Circle.\nIron Age.\nThe Pre-Roman Iron Age began in Estonia about 500 BC and lasted until the middle of the 1st century AD. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square Celtic fields surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds, began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.\nThe Roman Iron Age in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the Roman Empire. In material culture this is reflected by a few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas, while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas\u2014northern Estonia, southern Estonia, and western Estonia including the islands\u2014had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nThe name \"Estonia\" occurs first in a form of Aestii in the 1st century AD by Tacitus; however, it might have indicated Baltic tribes living in the area. In the Scandinavian sagas (9th century) the term started to be used to indicate the Estonians.\nPtolemy in his \"Geography III\" in the middle of the 2nd century AD mentions the Osilians among other dwellers on the Baltic shore.\nAccording to the 5th-century Roman historian Cassiodorus, the people known to Tacitus as \"Aestii\" were the Estonians. The extent of their territory in early medieval times is disputed, but the nature of their religion is not. They were known to the Scandinavians as experts in wind-magic, as were the Sami people (known at the time as Finns) in the North. Cassiodorus mentions Estonia in his book V. Letters 1\u20132 dating from the 6th century.\nThe Chud people, mentioned in early Rus' chronicles, starting with the \"Primary Chronicle\", are thought to be the Ests or Esthonians by some historians.\nIn the 1st centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (\"kihelkond\") and the county (\"maakond\"). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), R\u00e4vala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), J\u00e4rvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).\nVarbola Stronghold was one of the largest circular rampart fortresses and trading centers built in Estonia, Harju County () at the time.\nIn the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the Vikings from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.\nWith the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually led to the Baltic crusades.\nThe east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: first the Livs, Letts and Estonians, then the Prussians and the Finns underwent defeat, baptism, military occupation and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.\nEstonian Crusade: The Middle Ages.\nEstonia was one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be Christianized. In 1193 Pope Celestine III called for a crusade against pagans in Northern Europe. The Northern Crusades from northern Germany established the stronghold of Riga (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of Livs and Letts, the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the Sword Brethren and their recently converted allies won a major battle in which the Estonian commander Lembitu was killed.\nDanish Estonia (1219\u20131346).\nNorthern Estonia was conquered by Danish crusaders led by king Waldemar II, who arrived in 1219 on the site of the Estonian town of Lindanisse (now Tallinn) at (Latin) \"Revelia\" (Estonian) \"Revala\" or \"R\u00e4vala\", the adjacent ancient Estonian county. The Danish Army defeated the Estonians at the Battle of Lindanise.\nThe Estonians of Harria started a rebellion in 1343 (St. George's Night Uprising). The province was occupied by the Livonian Order as a result. In 1346, the Danish dominions in Estonia (Harria and Vironia) were sold for 10\u00a0000 marks to the Livonian Order.\nSwedish coastal settlements.\nThe first written mention of the Estonian Swedes comes from 1294, in the laws of the town of Haapsalu. Estonian Swedes are one of the earliest known minorities in Estonia. They have also been called \"Coastal Swedes\" (\"Rannarootslased\" in Estonian), or according to their settlement area Ruhnu Swedes, Hiiu Swedes etc. They themselves used the expression \"aibofolke\" (\"island people\"), and called their homeland \"Aiboland\".\nThe ancient areas of Swedish settlement in Estonia were Ruhnu Island, Hiiumaa Island, the west coast and smaller islands (Vormsi, Noarootsi, Sutlepa, Riguldi, Osmussaar), the northwest coast of the Harju District (N\u00f5va, Vihterpalu, Kurkse, the Pakri Peninsula and the Pakri Islands), and Naissaar Island near Tallinn. The towns with a significant percentage of Swedish population have been Haapsalu and Tallinn.\nIn earlier times Swedes also lived on the coasts of Saaremaa, the southern part of L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa, the eastern part of Harjumaa and the western part of Virumaa.\nTerra Mariana.\nIn 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold on the Estonian island of Saaremaa. After the conquest, all the remaining local pagans of Estonia were ostensibly Christianized. An ecclesiastical state Terra Mariana was established. The conquerors exercised control through a network of strategically located castles.\nThe territory was then divided between the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, the Bishopric of Dorpat (in Estonian: \"Tartu piiskopkond\") and the Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek (in Estonian: \"Saare-L\u00e4\u00e4ne piiskopkond\"). The northern part of Estonia \u2013 more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) \u2013 was a nominal possession of Denmark until 1346. Tallinn (Reval) was granted L\u00fcbeck town rights by the king of Denmark in 1248. It became a member city of the Hanseatic League at the end of the 13th century. In 1343, the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion (St. George's Night Uprising) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and four elected Estonian \"kings\" were killed in Paide during peace negotiations in 1343. Vesse, the rebel King of Saaremaa, was hanged in 1344. Despite the rebellions, and Muscovite invasions in 1481 and 1558, the Middle Low German-speaking minority established themselves as the dominating force in the society of Estonia, both as traders and the urban middle-class in the cities, and as landowners in the countryside, through a network of manorial estates.\nThe Reformation.\nProtestant Reformation, initiated in 1517 by Martin Luther, spread rapidly to Estonia in the 1520s, with the name of Martin Luther officially mentioned for the first time at the Prelates' Conference at Ronneburg on July 28, 1521. Early Estonian Lutheranism was most popular in larger towns with significant merchant classes, and soon contributed to the spread of literacy among the commoners. Many peasants were traditionalists and comfortable with Catholic traditions, delaying the adoption of the new church; despite this, after 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less of a burden, and altars often featured depictions of the Last Supper, but images and statues of the saints had disappeared. Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of Latin, and the first books were printed in Estonian.\nDivision of Estonia in the Livonian War.\nDuring the Livonian War in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control, while southern Estonia briefly came under the control of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 1580s. In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of Estonia in the north and Livonia in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early 20th century.\nFerdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor asked for help of Gustav I of Sweden, and the Kingdom of Poland also began direct negotiations with Gustavus, but nothing resulted because on 29 September 1560, Gustavus I Vasa died. The chances for success of Magnus von Lyffland and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 and 1570. In the former case he had been recognised as their sovereign by the Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek and the Bishopric of Courland, and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of the Bishopric of Dorpat; the Bishopric of Reval with the Harrien-Wierland gentry were on his side; and the Livonian Order conditionally recognised his right of ownership of the principality of Estonia.\nThen, along with Archbishop Wilhelm von Brandenburg of the Archbishopric of Riga and his coadjutor Christoph von Mecklenburg, Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of the Kingdom of Livonia which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land. Once Eric XIV of Sweden became king, he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with Muscovy and spoke to the burghers of Reval city. He offered them goods to submit to him, as well as threatening them. By 6 June 1561, they submitted to him, contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish princess Catherine Jagiellon. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to Finland, Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent. Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly and lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of Riga. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his inheritance of Holstein.\nAfter Sweden occupied Reval, Frederick II of Denmark made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement, and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on 7 August 1562, in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and the Northern Seven Years' War between the Free City of L\u00fcbeck, Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568, Erik XIV became insane, and his brother Johan III took his place. Johan III ascended to the throne of Sweden, and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark.\nAfter all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King Sigismund II Augustus of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, know that he was ready for peace. On 13 December 1570, the Treaty of Stettin was concluded. It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to the Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the Livonian War a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called \"Peace Party\". Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with Ivan the Terrible, proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.\nThe Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces \u2013 scattered bands of household troops (\"Hofleute\") under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 (Battle of P\u00e4rnu and Siege of Reval (1565)), in 1570\u20131571 (Siege of Reval (1570\u20131571); 30 weeks), and in 1574\u20131576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of Wiek to the Danish Crown and the loss of the territory to the Muscovites). In 1575 after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition, as did the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with Rzeczpospolita. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita, and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.\nHaving rejected peace proposals from its enemies, Ivan the Terrible found himself in a difficult position by 1578, when the Crimean Khanate devastated southern Muscovian territories and burnt down suburb(posad) of Moscow (see Russo-Crimean Wars), the drought and epidemics had fatally affected the economy, the policy of oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government, while the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had united with the Kingdom of Poland and acquired an energetic leader, Stefan Batory, supported by the Ottoman Empire (1576). Batory replied with a series of three offensives against Muscovy, trying to cut the Kingdom of Livonia from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men he retook Polotsk. During the second, in 1580, with a 29,000-strong army he took Velikie Luki, and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the Siege of Pskov. Frederick II had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike Sweden and Poland. He came to an agreement with John III of Sweden in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of Ducatus Ultradunensis only in 1582. After Magnus von Lyffland died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the Duchy of Courland and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of \u0152sel, Denmark was out of the Baltic by 1585. In 1598 Polish Livonia was divided into:\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nDuring 1582\u201383 southern Estonia (Livonia) became part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nEstonia in the Swedish Empire (1561\u20131710).\nThe Duchy of Estonia placed itself under Swedish rule in 1561 to receive protection against Russia and Poland as the Livonian Order lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present-day Estonia.\nLivonia was conquered from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1629 in the Polish\u2013Swedish War. By the Treaty of Oliva between the Commonwealth and Sweden in 1660 following the Northern Wars the Polish\u2013Lithuanian king renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day Latvia (Vidzeme region).\nIn 1631, Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden forced the nobility to grant the rural commoners greater autonomy. During his rule, in 1632, the first printing press, and the university was established in the city of Tartu.\nEstonia in the Russian Empire (1710\u20131917).\nSweden's defeat by Russia in the Great Northern War resulted in the capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, Lutheran church, local and town governments, secondary and higher education continued mostly in German language until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.\nUnder the imperial Russian rule, from the 1720s to the First World War, in Estonia the local Baltic German minority continued to own most of the land and businesses, and dominated in all cities. The local German-speakers were Lutherans, and so were the vast majority of the Estonian population. Moravian Protestant missionaries made an impact in the eighteenth century, and translated the complete Bible into Estonian. Some Germans complained, the imperial government banned the Moravians from 1743 to 1764. A theological faculty opened at the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu), with German professors. The local German gentry controlled the local churches and rarely hired Estonian graduates, but they made their mark as intellectuals and Estonian nationalists. In the 1840s, there was a movement of Lutheran farmers into the Russian Orthodox Church. The czar discouraged them when he realized they were challenging the local authorities. The German character of the Lutheran churches alienated many nationalists, who emphasized the secular in their subcultures. For example, choral societies offered a secular alternative to church music.\nBy 1819, the Baltic governorates were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, enabling an increasing number of farmers to rent or purchase land, as well as triggering a wave of internal migration of landless rural Estonians into the growing cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the Estonian national identity, as the country was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-19th century. The general population, as well as the students and faculty of the multicultural Imperial University of Dorpat, were largely uninterested in the Russification programmes introduced by the imperial Russian central government in the 1890s.\nThe Estophile enlightenment period (1750\u20131840).\nEducated German immigrants and local Baltic Germans in Estonia, educated at German universities, introduced Enlightenment ideas of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality. The French Revolution provided a powerful motive for the \"enlightened\" local upper class to create literature for the commoners. The abolition of serfdom on in 1816 in southern Estonia (then Governorate of Livonia), and 1819 in northern Estonia (then Governorate of Estonia) by Emperor Alexander I of Russia gave rise to a debate as to the future fate of the Estonian-speaking population. Although many Baltic Germans regarded the future of the Estonians as being a fusion with the Germans, many other educated and Estophile Germans admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century. The Estophile Enlightenment Period formed the transition from religious Estonian literature to newspapers printed in Estonian for the general public.\nNational awakening.\nA cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of Estonian as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. \"Kalevipoeg\", Estonia's national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.\n1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of Russification. The impact of this was that many of the Baltic German legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian \u2013 a good example of this is the University of Tartu.\nAs the Russian Revolution of 1905 swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for freedom of the press and assembly, for universal franchise, and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.\nRoad to the republic (1917\u20131920).\nEstonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian February Revolution of 1917. With the collapse of the Russian Empire in World War I, Russia's Provisional Government granted national autonomy to a unified Estonia in April. The Governorate of Estonia in the north (corresponding to the historic Danish Estonia) was united with the northern part of the Governorate of Livonia. Elections for a provisional parliament, \"Maap\u00e4ev\", was organized, with the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party obtaining a part of the vote. On 5 November 1917, two days before the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, Estonian Bolshevik leader Jaan Anvelt violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maap\u00e4ev in a coup d'\u00e9tat, forcing the Maap\u00e4ev underground.\nIn February, after the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the German Empire, mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans. Bolshevik forces retreated to Russia. Between the Russian Red Army's retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the Salvation Committee of the Estonian National Council Maap\u00e4ev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence in P\u00e4rnu on 23 February 1918.\nWar of Independence.\nAfter the collapse of the short-lived puppet government of the United Baltic Duchy and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an Estonian Provisional Government retook office. A military invasion by the Red Army followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence (1918\u20131920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of the Red Army by February 1919. On 5\u20137 April 1919 the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected.\nBy the summer of 1919, Estonia had reached its largest territorial extent ever, having pushed the Red Army far beyond Estonia's borders on the Southern and Eastern fronts, with the assistance of the Northwestern army under the Estonian command in the east.\nVictory.\nOn 2 February 1920, the Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and the Russian SFSR. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia.\nThe first Constitution of Estonia was adopted on 15 June 1920. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the League of Nations in 1921.\nInterwar period (1920\u20131939).\nThe first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a sovereign state. Economically and socially, land reform in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the Baltic nobility were redistributed among farmers and especially among volunteers in the Estonian War of Independence. Estonia's principal markets became Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and western Europe, with some exports to the United States and to the Soviet Union.\nThe first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a parliamentary form of government. The parliament (\"Riigikogu\") consisted of 100 members elected for three-year terms. Between 1920 and 1934, Estonia had 21 governments.\nA mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary Vaps Movement emerged in the 1930s. In October 1933, a referendum on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent. The league spearheaded replacement of the parliamentary system with a presidential form of government and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive self-coup on 12 March 1934, by then Head of State Konstantin P\u00e4ts, who established his own authoritarian rule until a new constitution came to force in 1938. The parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938, and the country was ruled by decree by P\u00e4ts. The Vaps Movement was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an amnesty and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.\nThe interwar period was one of great cultural advancement. Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to minority groups comprising at least 3,000 persons, including Jews (see history of the Jews in Estonia). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly \"700-year German rule\" as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.\nEstonia had pursued a policy of neutrality, but it was of no consequence after the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939. In the agreement, the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland), with Estonia falling in the Soviet \"sphere of influence\". After the invasion of Poland, the \"Orze\u0142\" incident took place when Polish submarine ORP \"Orze\u0142\" looked for shelter in Tallinn but escaped after the Soviet Union attacked Poland on 17 September. Estonia's lack of will and/or inability to disarm and intern the crew caused the Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of \"helping them escape\" and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On 24 September 1939, the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country\u2014an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.\nWorld War II (1939\u20131944).\nFollowing the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet invasion of Poland, warships of the Red Navy appeared off Estonian ports on 24 September 1939, and Soviet bombers began a threatening patrol over Tallinn and the nearby countryside. Moscow demanded Estonia assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement on 28 September 1939.\nIncorporation in the Soviet Union (1940).\nThe Republic of Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940.\nOn 12 June 1940, the order for a total military blockade of Estonia by the Soviet Baltic Fleet was given.\nOn 14 June 1940, while the world's attention was focused on the fall of Paris to Nazi Germany a day earlier, the Soviet military blockade of Estonia went into effect, and two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane \"Kaleva\" flying from Tallinn to Helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki. US Foreign Service employee Henry W. Antheil Jr. was killed in the crash.\nOn 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union invaded Estonia. Molotov accused the Baltic states of conspiracy against the Soviet Union and delivered an ultimatum to Estonia for the establishment of a government approved of by the Soviets.\nThe Estonian government decided, given the overwhelming Soviet force both on the borders and inside the country, not to resist, to avoid bloodshed and open war. Estonia accepted the ultimatum, and the statehood of Estonia de facto ceased to exist as the Red Army exited from their military bases in Estonia on 17 June. The following day, some 90,000 additional troops entered the country. The military occupation of the Republic of Estonia was rendered official by a communist coup d'\u00e9tat supported by the Soviet troops, followed by parliamentary elections where all but pro-Communist candidates were outlawed. The newly elected parliament proclaimed Estonia a Socialist Republic on 21 July 1940 and unanimously requested Estonia to be accepted into the Soviet Union. Those who had fallen short of the \"political duty\" of voting Estonia into the USSR, who had failed to have their passports stamped for so voting, were allowed to be shot in the back of the head by Soviet tribunals. Estonia was formally annexed into the Soviet Union on 6 August and renamed the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1979, the European Parliament would condemn \"the fact that the occupation of these formerly independent and neutral States by the Soviet Union occurred in 1940 following the Molotov/Ribbentrop pact, and continues,\" and sought to help restore Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian independence through political means.\nThe Soviet authorities, having gained control over Estonia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940\u20131941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country's leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most of the others were moved to Gulag prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return alive. On 14 June 1941, when mass deportations took place simultaneously in all three Baltic countries, about 10,000 Estonian civilians were deported to Siberia and other remote areas of the Soviet Union, where nearly half of them later perished. Of the 32,100 Estonian men who were forcibly relocated to Russia under the pretext of mobilisation into the Soviet army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, nearly 40 percent died within the next year in the so-called \"labour battalions\" of hunger, cold and overworking. During the first Soviet occupation of 1940\u201341 about 500 Jews were deported to Siberia.\nEstonian graveyards and monuments were destroyed. Among others, the Tallinn Military Cemetery had the majority of gravestones from 1918 to 1944 destroyed by the Soviet authorities, and this graveyard became reused by the Red Army. Other cemeteries destroyed by the authorities during the Soviet era in Estonia include Baltic German cemeteries established in 1774 (Kopli cemetery, M\u00f5igu cemetery) and the oldest cemetery in Tallinn, from the 16th century, Kalamaja cemetery.\nMany countries including the United States did not recognize the seizure of Estonia by the USSR. Such countries recognized Estonian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in many countries in the name of their former governments. These aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence.\nErnst Jaakson, the longest-serving foreign diplomatic representative to the United States, served as vice-consul from 1934, and as consul general in charge of the Estonian legation in the United States from 1965 until reestablishment of Estonia's independence. On 25 November 1991, he presented credentials as Estonian ambassador to the United States.\nOccupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany (1941\u20131944).\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, and the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941, most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped to restore independence. But it soon became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied \"Ostland\". A \"Sicherheitspolizei\" was established for internal security under the leadership of Ain-Ervin Mere. The initial enthusiasm that accompanied the liberation from Soviet occupation quickly waned as a result, and the Germans had limited success in recruiting volunteers. The draft was introduced in 1942, resulting in some 3,400 men fleeing to Finland to fight in the Finnish Army rather than join the Germans. Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 (Estonian: \"soomepoisid\") was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation.\nBy January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. Narva was evacuated. J\u00fcri Uluots, the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service. (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38,000 volunteers jammed registration centers. Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia's independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence.\nThe initial formation of the volunteer SS Estonian legion created in 1942 was eventually expanded to become a full-sized conscript division of the Waffen-SS in 1944, the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. The Estonian units saw action defending the Narva line throughout 1944.\nAs the Germans started to retreat on 18 September 1944, J\u00fcri Uluots, the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the Allies. On 22 September 1944, as the last German units pulled out of Tallinn, the city was re-occupied by the Soviet Red Army. The new Estonian government fled to Stockholm, Sweden, and operated in exile from 1944 until 1992, when Heinrich Mark, the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president Lennart Meri.\nThe Holocaust in Estonia.\nThe process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, when in 1865 Russian Tsar Alexander II granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the Republic of Estonia, and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of its existence as a state, Estonia showed tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting its territories. On 12 February 1925, the Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3,000. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to the global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the Government of the Republic of Estonia with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement.\nThere were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 2,000 Estonian Jews. Many Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 500 Jews suffered this fate. With the invasion of the Baltics, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltic countries as their main area of mass genocide. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated. Out of the approximately 4,300 Jews in Estonia prior to the war, between 1,500 and 2,000 were entrapped by the Nazis, and an estimated 10,000 Jews were killed in Estonia after having been deported to camps there from Eastern Europe.\nThere have been seven ethnic Estonians \u2013 Ralf Gerrets, Ain-Ervin Mere, Jaan Viik, Juhan J\u00fcriste, Karl Linnas, Aleksander Laak and Ervin Viks \u2013 who have faced trials for crimes against humanity since the reestablishment of Estonian independence and the formation of the Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity. Markers were put in place for the 60th anniversary of the mass executions that were carried out at the Lagedi, Vaivara and Klooga (Kalevi-Liiva) camps in September 1944.\nFate of other minorities during and after World War II.\nThe Baltic Germans had voluntarily evacuated to Germany (in accordance with Hitler's order) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939.\nAlmost all the remaining Estonian Swedes fled Aiboland in August 1944, often in their small boats to the Swedish island of Gotland.\nThe Russian minority grew significantly in numbers during the postwar era.\nSoviet Estonia (1944\u20131991).\nStalinism.\nIn World War II Estonia had suffered huge losses. Ports had been destroyed, and 45% of industry and 40% of the railways had become damaged. Estonia's population had decreased by one-fifth, about 200,000 people. Some 10% of the population (over 80,000 people) had fled to the West between 1940 and 1944, first to countries such as Sweden and Finland and then to other western countries, often by refugee ships such as the . More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. In 1944 Russian air raids had destroyed Narva and one-third of the residential area in Tallinn. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces had ushered in a second phase of Soviet rule on the heels of the German troops withdrawing from Estonia, and followed it up by a new wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.\nAn anti-Soviet guerrilla movement known as the \"Metsavennad\" (\"Forest Brothers\") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946\u201348. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the \"Metsavennad\"; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000\u201335,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.\nIn March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.\nAfter the war the Communist Party of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.\nKhrushchev era.\nAfter Stalin's death, Communist Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of perestroika the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 7% of the country's population.\nOne positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the regranting of permission in the late 1950s for citizens to make contact with foreign countries. In the 1960s, Estonians were thus able to start watching Finnish television. This electronic \"window to the West\" afforded Estonians more information on current world affairs and more access to contemporary Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. \nBrezhnev era.\nIn the late 1970s, Estonian society grew increasingly concerned about the threat of cultural Russification to the Estonian language and national identity. By 1981, Russian was taught in the first grade of Estonian-language schools and was also introduced into Estonian pre-school teaching.\nMoscow Olympic Games of 1980.\nTallinn was selected to host the sailing events at the 1980 Summer Olympics, which led to controversy since many governments had not \"de jure\" recognized ESSR as part of the USSR. During the preparations to the Olympics, sports buildings were built in Tallinn, along with other general infrastructure and broadcasting facilities. This wave of investment included Tallinn Airport, Hotell Ol\u00fcmpia, Tallinn TV Tower, Pirita Yachting Centre and Linnahall.\nAndropov and Chernenko era.\nOn 10 November 1982, Leonid Brezhnev died and was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, the former head of the KGB. Andropov introduced limited economic reforms and established an anti-corruption program. On 9 February 1984, Andropov died and was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko who in turn died on 10 March 1985.\nGorbachev era.\nBy the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the Estonian Popular Front, established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership and broad constituency. The Greens and the dissident-led Estonian National Independence Party soon followed.\nRestoration of \"de facto\" independence.\nThe Estonian Sovereignty Declaration was issued on 16 November 1988. By 1989 the political spectrum had widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily. The republic's Supreme Soviet transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (16 November 1988); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that November; a language law making Estonian the official language (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).\nDespite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front's proposal to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called \"third republic\" whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment, found less and less support over time.\nA grassroots Estonian Citizens' Committees Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a Congress of Estonia. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of the Estonian Republic which still existed \"de jure\", recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens' committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nationwide structure, and by the beginning of 1990 over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia.\nThe spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On 24 February 1990, the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn 11\u201312 March 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee (Eesti Komitee) was elected with Tunne Kelam as its chairman.\nIn March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than \"re\"-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against.\nAlthough the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of Russian speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.\nIn the 18 March 1990, elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet, all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of left and centrist parties and led by former Central Planning Committee official Edgar Savisaar, gained a parliamentary majority.\nOn 8 May 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (renamed the previous day) changed the name to the Republic of Estonia. Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which Latvia and Lithuania incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the attempted August coup in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its telecommunications facilities, thereby offering the West a clear view into the latest developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia's own \"confirmation\" of independence on 20 August 1991. 20 August remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this. Russia as a republic of the U.S.S.R. formally recognized Estonia's independence on 25 August 1991 and called on the U.S.S.R. union government to follow suit. The United States intentionally delayed recognition to 2 September, and the State Council of the Soviet Union issued its recognition on 6 September.\nSince the debates about whether the future independent Estonia would be established as a new republic or a continuation of the first republic were not yet complete by the time of the August coup, while the members of the Supreme Soviet generally agreed that independence should be declared rapidly, a compromise was hatched between the two main sides: instead of \"declaring\" independence, which would imply a new start, or explicitly asserting continuity, the declaration would \"confirm\" Estonia as a state independent of the Soviet Union, and willing to reestablish diplomatic relations of its own accord. The text of the statement was in Estonian and only a few paragraphs in length.\nAfter more than three years of negotiations, on 31 August 1994, the armed forces of Russia withdrew from Estonia. Since fully regaining independence Estonia has had sixteen governments with ten prime ministers: Mart Laar, Andres Tarand, Tiit V\u00e4hi, Mart Siimann, Siim Kallas, Juhan Parts, Andrus Ansip, Taavi R\u00f5ivas, J\u00fcri Ratas and Kaja Kallas. The PMs of the interim government (1990\u20131992) were Edgar Savisaar and Tiit V\u00e4hi.\nSince the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. Estonia opened accession negotiations with the European Union in 1998 and joined in 2004, shortly after becoming a member of NATO.\nContemporary Estonian government (1992\u2013present).\nOn 28 June 1992, Estonian voters approved the constitutional assembly's draft constitution and implementation act, which established a parliamentary government with a president as chief of state and with a government headed by a prime minister. The Riigikogu, a unicameral legislative body, is the highest organ of state authority. It initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. The prime minister has full responsibility and control over his cabinet.\nMeri presidency and Laar premiership (1992\u20132001).\nParliamentary and presidential elections were held on 20 September 1992. Approximately 68% of the country's 637,000 registered voters cast ballots. Lennart Meri, an outstanding writer and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, won this election and became president. He chose 32-year-old historian and Christian Democratic Party founder Mart Laar as prime minister.\nIn February 1992, and with amendments in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an ambitious programme of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures (shock therapy). Fast privatization was pursued and the role of the state in the economy as well as in the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came with a social price: the average life expectancy in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova. Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' demonstration took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs Marju Lauristin.\nOn 28 September 1994, the MS Estonia sank as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. The disaster claimed the lives of 852 people (501 of them were Swedes), being one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century.\nThe opposition won the 1995 election, but to a large extent continued with the previous governments' policies.\nIn 1996, Estonia ratified a border agreement with Latvia and completed work with Russia on a technical border agreement. President Meri was re-elected in free and fair indirect elections in August and September in 1996. During parliamentary elections in 1999, the seats in the Riigikogu were divided as follows: the Estonian Centre Party received 28, the Pro Patria Union 18, the Estonian Reform Party 18, the People's Party Moderates (election cartel between Moderates and People's Party) 17, Coalition Party 7, Country People's Party (now People's Union of Estonia) 7, and the United People's Party's electoral cartel 6 seats. Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, and the Moderates formed a government with Mart Laar as prime minister, whereas the Centre Party with the Coalition Party, People's Union, United People's Party, and members of parliament who were not members of factions formed the opposition in the Riigikogu.\nThe 1999 Parliamentary election, with a 5% threshold and no electoral cartel allowed, resulted in a disaster for the Coalition Party, which achieved only seven seats together with two of its smaller allies. Estonian Ruralfolk Party, which participated the election on its own list, obtained seven seats as well.\nThe programme of Mart Laar's government was signed by Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, the Moderates, and the People's Party. The latter two merged soon after, so Mart Laar's second government is widely known as \"Kolmikliit\", or the Tripartite coalition. Notwithstanding the different political orientation of the ruling parties, the coalition stayed united until Laar resigned in December 2001, after the Reform Party had broken up the same coalition in Tallinn municipality, making opposition leader Edgar Savisaar the new mayor of Tallinn. After the resignation of Laar, the Reform Party and Estonian Centre Party formed a coalition that lasted until the next parliamentary election, in 2003.\nThe Moderates joined with the People's Party on 27 November 1999, forming the People's Party Moderates.\nR\u00fc\u00fctel presidency and Siim Kallas government (2001\u20132002).\nIn fall 2001 Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel became the President of the Republic of Estonia, and in January 2002 Prime Minister Laar stepped down. On 28 January 2002, the new government was formed from a coalition of the centre-right Estonian Reform Party and the more left wing Centre Party, with Siim Kallas from the Reform Party of Estonia as Prime Minister.\nJuhan Parts government (2003-2005).\nFollowing parliamentary elections in 2003, the seats were allocated as follows (the United People's Party failed to meet the 5% threshold):\nVoter turnout was higher than expected at 58%. The results saw the Centre Party win the most votes, but they were only 0.8% ahead of the new Res Publica party. As a result, both parties won 28 seats, which was a disappointment for the Centre Party who had expected to win the most seats. Altogether the right of centre parties won 60 seats, compared to only 41 for the left wing, and so were expected to form the next government. Both the Centre and Res Publica parties said that they should get the chance to try and form the next government, while ruling out any deal between themselves. President R\u00fc\u00fctel had to decide who he should nominate as Prime Minister and therefore be given the first chance at forming a government. On 2 April he invited the leader of the Res Publica party, Juhan Parts, to form a government, and after negotiations a coalition government composed of Res Publica, the Reform Party and the People's Union of Estonia was formed on 10 April.\nOn 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the European Union. With 64% of the electorate turning out, the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.\nIn February 2004 the People's Party Moderates renamed themselves the Social Democratic Party of Estonia.\nEstonia joined NATO on 29 March 2004.\nOn 8 May 2004, a defection of several Centre Party members to form a new party, the Social Liberal Party, over a row concerning the Centrists' \"no\" stance to joining the European Union changed the allocation of the seats in the Riigikogu. Social-liberals had eight seats, but a hope to form a new party disappeared by 10 May 2005, because most members in the social-liberal group joined other parties.\nOn 24 March Prime Minister Juhan Parts announced his resignation following a vote of no confidence in the Riigikogu against Minister of Justice Ken-Marti Vaher, which was held on 21 March. The result was 54 pro (Social Democrats, Social Liberals, People's Union, Pro Patria Union and Reform Party) with no against or neutral MPs. 32 MPs (Res Publica and Centre Party) did not take part.\nAndrus Ansip government (2005-2014).\nOn 4 April 2005, President R\u00fc\u00fctel nominated Reform party leader Andrus Ansip as Prime Minister designate and asked him to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new cabinet, on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.\nOn 18 May 2005, Estonia signed a border treaty with the Russian Federation in Moscow. The treaty was ratified by the Riigikogu on 20 June 2005. However, in the end of June the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaty and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaty because the Riigikogu had attached a preambule to the ratification act that referenced earlier documents that mentioned the Soviet occupation and the uninterrupted legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia during the Soviet period. The issue remains unsolved and is the focus of European-level discussions.\nOn 4 April 2006, Fatherland Union and Res Publica decided to form a united right-conservative party. The two parties joining was approved on 4 June by both parties in P\u00e4rnu. The joined party name is Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit (Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica).\nIn September 2006, Toomas Hendrik Ilves was elected as the new president of Estonia. He defeated in the Electoral Assembly incumbent one-term president Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel.\n2007 election.\nThe 2007 parliamentary elections have shown an improvement in the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica lost 16. Socialdemocrats gained 4 seats, while the Greens entered the Parliaments with 7 seats, at the expense of the agrarian People's Union which lost 6. The new configuration of the Estonian Parliament shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn Edgar Savisaar, has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with Putin's United Russia party, real estate scandals in Tallinn, and the Bronze Soldier controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority. The lack of a concrete possibility for government alternance in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.\nAccession of Estonia to the European Union.\nOn 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the European Union. With 64% of the electorate turning out the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place the following year, on 1 May 2004. Estonia became Schengen area member on 21 December 2007\nIn its first European Parliament elections in 2004, Estonia elected three MEPs for the Social Democratic Party (PES), while the governing Res Publica Party and People's Union polled poorly, not being able to gain any of the other three MEP posts. The voter turnout in Estonia was one of the lowest of all member countries, at only 26.8%. A similar trend was visible in most of the new member states that joined the EU in 2004.\nThe European Parliament election of 2009 in Estonia scored a 43.9% turnout \u2013 about 17.1% higher than during the previous election, and slightly above the European average of 42.94%. Six seats were up for taking in this election: two of them were won by the Estonian Centre Party. Estonian Reform Party, Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica, Social Democratic Party and an independent candidate Indrek Tarand (who gathered the support of 102,460 voters, only 1,046 votes less than the winner of the election) all won one seat each. The success of independent candidates has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and the use of closed lists which rendered voters incapable of casting a vote for specific candidates in party lists.\nOn 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro. The enlargement of the Eurozone was hailed as a good sign during the 2008 financial crisis. However, the government cut down public service salaries; the only opposition, in the absence of organised unions, came from Estonian teachers, whose salary cuts were therefore limited.\nEstonian euro coins entered circulation on 1 January 2011. Estonia was the fifth of ten states that joined the EU in 2004, and the first ex-Soviet republic to join the eurozone. Of the ten new member states, Estonia was the first to unveil its design. It originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007; however, it did not formally apply when Slovenia did, and officially changed its target date to 1 January 2008, and later, to 1 January 2011. On 12 May 2010 the European Commission announced that Estonia had met all criteria to join the eurozone. On 8 June 2010, the EU finance ministers agreed that Estonia would be able to join the euro on 1 January 2011. On 13 July 2010, Estonia received the final approval from the ECOFIN to adopt the euro as from 1 January 2011. On the same date the exchange rate at which the kroon would be exchanged for the euro (\u20ac1 = 15.6466 krooni) was also announced. On 20 July 2010, mass production of Estonian euro coins began in the Mint of Finland.\nBeing a member of the eurozone, NATO and the European Union, Estonia is the most integrated in Western European organizations of all Nordic states.\nEstonia\u2013Russia relations in the late 2000s.\nEstonia\u2013Russia relations remain tense. According to the Estonian Internal Security Service, Russian influence operations in Estonia form a complex system of financial, political, economic and espionage activities in the Republic of Estonia for the purposes of influencing Estonia's political and economic decisions in ways considered favourable to the Russian Federation and conducted under the sphere-of-influence doctrine known as \"near abroad\". According to the Centre for Geopolitical Studies, the Russian information campaign, which the centre characterises as a \"real mud-throwing\" exercise, had provoked a split in Estonian society amongst Russian speakers, inciting some to riot over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a cenotaph commemorating the soldiers killed in World War II. Estonia regarded the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia as an information operation intended to influence the decisions and actions of the Estonian government. While Russia denied any direct involvement in the attacks, hostile rhetoric in the media from the political elite influenced people to attack. Following the 2007 cyber-attacks, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) was established in Tallinn.\nFrom 2011 to present.\nIn August 2011, President Toomas Hendrik Ilves was re-elected in a vote in parliament for the second five-year term. Center-right Reform Party was the biggest party in 2011 and 2015 parliamentary elections. Estonian prime minister Andrus Ansip resigned in March 2014, after nine years in office since 2005. He wanted his successor to lead the Reform Party into 2015 elections. In April 2014, Taavi R\u00f5ivas of the Reform party became new prime minister. In October 2016, Estonia's parliament elected Kersti Kaljulaid as the new president of Estonia. The role of president is a largely ceremonial. In November 2016, chairman of the Centre Party J\u00fcri Ratas became the new prime minister of Estonia, after Prime Minister Taavi R\u00f5ivas had lost a parliamentary vote on confidence.\nIn March 2019, Estonian parliamentary election the center-right opposition party Reform won the elections and ruling Centre was the second. Far-right Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) came third. After the election prime minister Ratas formed a new three-party coalition government with far-right EKRE and rightwing Isamaa\nIn January 2021, prime minister J\u00fcri Ratas resigned over a corruption scandal in his Centre Party. The leader of Reform party Kaja Kallas formed a new two-party coalition government between the Reform and Center parties. She was the first female prime minister of Estonia. Her father Siim Kallas was the founder of the Reform party and he was prime minister of Estonia in 2002\u20132003.\nFemale leadership 2021.\nAfter the formation of the new government in 2021, Estonia was the only country in the world that was led by elected women as the head of state and as the head of government: both the president, Kersti Kaljulaid, and prime minister, Kaja Kallas, were female.\nIn the cabinet of Kaja Kallas there were also several women in other key positions, both foreign minister and finance minister were female. Mr. Alar Karis was sworn in as Estonia's sixth President on 11 October 2021.\nSince 2022.\nIn July 2022, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas formed a new three-party coalition by her liberal Reform Party, the Social Democrats and the conservative Isamaa party. Her previous government had lost its parliamentary majority after the center-left Center Party left the coalition.\nIn March 2023, the Reform party, led by Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, won the parliamentary election, taking 31,4% of the vote. Far-right Conservative People's Party came second with 16,1 % and the third was the Centre Party with 15% of the vote. In April 2023, Kallas formed her third government, which included in addition to Reform Party, also the liberal Estonia 200 and the Social Democratic (SDE) parties.\nIn July 2024, Kristen Michal became Estonia's new prime minister to succeed Kaja Kallas, who resigned as prime minister on July 15 to become the European Union's new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42794", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42794", "title": "History of Burundi", "text": "Burundi originated in the 16th century as a small kingdom in the African Great Lakes region. After European contact, it was united with the Kingdom of Rwanda, becoming the colony of Ruanda-Urundi - first colonised by Germany and then by Belgium. The colony gained independence in 1962, and split once again into Rwanda and Burundi. It is one of the few countries in Africa (along with Rwanda, Botswana, Lesotho, and Eswatini) to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state.\nKingdom of Burundi (1680\u20131966).\nThe origins of Burundi are known from a mix of oral history and archaeology. There are two main founding legends for Burundi. Both suggest that the nation was founded by a man named Cambarantama. The other version, more common in pre-colonial Burundi says that Cambarantama came from the southern state of Buha.\nThe first evidence of the Burundian state is from 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours and competing with Rwanda. Its greatest growth occurred under Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba, who ruled the country from about 1796 to 1850 and saw the kingdom double in size.\nThe Kingdom of Burundi was characterized by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange. The king, known as the \"mwami\" headed a princely aristocracy (\"ganwa\") which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers and herders. In the mid-18th century, this Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the \"ubugabire\"\u2014a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure.\nEuropean contact (1856).\nEuropean explorers and missionaries made brief visits to the area as early as 1856, and they compared the organization of the kingdom of Burundi with that of the old Greek empire. It was not until 1899 that Burundi became a part of German East Africa. Unlike the Rwandan monarchy, which decided to accept the German advances, the Burundian king Mwezi IV Gisabo opposed all European influence, refusing to wear European clothing and resisting the advance of European missionaries or administrators.\nGerman East Africa (1899\u20131916).\nThe Germans used armed force and succeeded in doing great damage, but did not destroy the king's power. Eventually they backed one of the king's sons-in-law Maconco in a revolt against Gisabo. Gisabo was eventually forced to concede and agreed to German suzerainty. The Germans then helped him suppress Maconco's revolt. The smaller kingdoms along the western shore of Lake Victoria were also attached to Burundi.\nEven after this the foreign presence was minimal and the kings continued to rule much as before. The Europeans did, however, bring devastating diseases affecting both people and animals. Affecting the entire region, Burundi was especially hard hit. A great famine hit in 1905, with others striking the entire Great Lakes region in 1914, 1923 and 1944. Between 1905 and 1914 half the population of the western plains region died.\nBelgian and United Nations governance (1916\u20131962).\nIn 1916 Belgian troops conquered the area during the First World War. In 1923, the League of Nations mandated to Belgium the territory of Ruanda-Urundi, encompassing modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, the western kingdoms being assigned to Tanganyika. The Belgians administered the territory through indirect rule, building on the Tutsi-dominated aristocratic hierarchy.\nFollowing the Second World War, Ruanda-Urundi became a United Nations Trust Territory under Belgian administrative authority. The trust territory guidelines required that the trust territories be prepared for independence and majority rule but it wasn't until 10 November 1959 that Belgium committed itself to political reform and legalised the emergence of competing political parties.\nOn 20 January 1959, Burundi's ruler Mwami Mwambutsa IV requested Burundi's independence from Belgium and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union. In the following months, Burundian political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and Burundi. The first and largest of these political parties was the Union for National Progress (UPRONA). UPRONA was a multi-ethnic party led by Tutsi Prince Louis Rwagasore while the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) was supported by Belgium, which was being ruled by the Christian Social Party, whose party leader, August de Schryver, was Minister of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi from 1959 until 1960.\nBurundi's first elections took place on 8 September 1961 and UPRONA won just over 80% of the electorate's votes. In the wake of the elections, on 13 October, the 29-year-old Prince Rwagasore was assassinated, robbing Burundi of its most popular and well-known nationalist. Historians have speculated over Belgium's role in Rwagasore's death and the two highest ranking Belgian colonial officials in Burundi (Jean-Paul Harroy and Roberto R\u00e9gnier) were accused of involvement by Rwagasore's convicted murderer (Jean Kageorgis). The day after Kageorgis' execution Burundi was granted independence.\nIndependence (1962).\nFull independence was achieved on July 1, 1962. In the context of weak democratic institutions at independence, Tutsi King Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng established a constitutional monarchy comprising equal numbers of Hutus and Tutsis. The 15 January 1965 assassination of the Hutu prime minister Pierre Ngendandumwe set in motion a series of destabilizing Hutu revolts and subsequent governmental repression.\nThese were in part in reaction to Rwanda's \"Social Revolution\" of 1959\u20131961, where Rwandan Tutsi were subject to mass murder by the new government of Hutu Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda. In Burundi the Tutsi became committed to ensuring they would not meet the same fate and much of the country's military and police forces became controlled by Tutsis. Unlike Rwanda, which allied itself with the United States in the Cold War, Burundi after independence became affiliated with China.\nThe monarchy refused to recognize gains by Hutu candidates in the first legislative elections held by Burundi as an independent country on 10 May 1965. In response, a group of Hutu carried out a failed coup attempt against the monarchy on 18 October 1965, which in turn prompted the killing of scores of Hutu politicians and intellectuals. On 8 July 1966, King Mwambutsa IV was deposed by his son, Prince Ntare V, who himself was deposed by his prime minister Capt. Michel Micombero on 28 November 1966. Micombero abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. A de facto military regime emerged and civil unrest continued throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. Micombero headed a clique of ruling Hima, the Tutsi subgroup located in southern Burundi. Similar to 1965, rumors of an impending Hutu coup in 1969 prompted the arrest and execution of scores of prominent political and military figures.\nIn June 1971, a group of Banyaruguru, the socially \"higher up\" subgroup of Tutsi located in the north of the country, were accused of conspiracy by the ruling Hima clique. On 14 January 1972, a military tribunal sentenced four Banyaruguru officers and five civilians to death, and seven to life imprisonment. To the Hima concerns about a Hutu uprising or Banyaruguru-led coup was added the return of Ntare V from exile, a potential rallying point for the Hutu majority.\n1972 genocide.\nOn April 29, there was an outbreak of violence in the south of the country, also the base of the Hima, where bands of roving Hutu committed atrocities against Tutsi civilians. All civilian and military authorities in the city of Bururi were killed and the insurgents then seized the armories in the towns of Rumonge and Nyanza-Lac. They then attempted to kill every Tutsi they could, as well as some Hutu who refused to participate in the rebellion, before retreating to Vyanda, near Bururi, and proclaiming a \"Republic of Martyazo.\" Somewhere from 800 to 1200 people were killed.\nA week after the insurgent proclamation of a republic, government troops moved in. Meanwhile, President Micombero declared martial law on May 30 and asked Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko for assistance. Congolese paratroopers were deployed to secure the airport while the Burundi army moved into the countryside. Africanist Ren\u00e9 Lemarchand notes, \"What followed was not so much a repression as a hideous slaughter of Hutu civilians. The carnage went on unabated through the month of August. By then virtually every educated Hutu element, down to secondary school students, was either dead or in flight.\"\nBecause the perpetrators, composed of government troops and the Jeunesses R\u00e9volutionnaires Rwagasore (JRR), the youth wing of the Union for National Progress ruling party, targeted primarily civil servants, educated males and university students, solely because of their \"Hutuness\" and irrespective of whether they posed a threat, Lemarchand terms the eradication a \"partial genocide.\" One of the first to be killed was deposed monarch Ntare V, in Gitega.\nAs president, Micombero became an advocate of African socialism and received support from the People's Republic of China. He imposed a staunch regime of law and order, sharply repressing Hutu militarism.\nFrom late April to September 1972, an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Hutu were killed. About 300,000 people became refugees, with most fleeing to Tanzania. In an effort to attract sympathy from the United States, the Tutsi-dominated government accused the Hutu rebels of having Communist leanings, although there is no credible evidence that this was actually the case. Lemarchand notes that, while crushing the rebellion was the first priority, the genocide was successful in a number of other objectives: ensuring the long-term stability of the Tutsi state by eliminating Hutu elites and potential elites; turning the army, police and gendarmerie into a Tutsi monopoly; denying the potential return of monarchy through the murder of Ntare V; and creating a new legitimacy for the Hima-dominated state as protector of the country, especially for the previously fractious Tutsi-Banyaruguru.\nPost-1972 genocide developments.\nIn 1976, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza took power in a bloodless coup. Although Bagaza led a Tutsi-dominated military regime, he encouraged land reform, electoral reform, and national reconciliation. In 1981, a new constitution was promulgated. In 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state, as the sole candidate. After his election, Bagaza's human rights record deteriorated as he suppressed religious activities and detained political opposition members.\nIn 1987, Major Pierre Buyoya overthrew Col. Bagaza in a military coup d'\u00e9tat. He dissolved opposition parties, suspended the 1981 constitution, and instituted his ruling Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN). During 1988, increasing tensions between the ruling Tutsis and the majority Hutus resulted in violent confrontations between the army, the Hutu opposition, and Tutsi hardliners. During this period, an estimated 150,000 people were killed, with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. Buyoya formed a commission to investigate the causes of the 1988 unrest and to develop a charter for democratic reform.\nIn 1991, Buyoya approved a constitution that provided for a president, non-ethnic government, and a parliament. Burundi's first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, of the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) Party, was elected in 1993.\n1993 genocide and civil war (1993\u20132005).\nNdadaye was assassinated three months later, in October 1993, by Tutsi army extremists. The country's situation rapidly declined as Hutu peasants began to rise up and massacre Tutsi. In acts of brutal retribution, the Tutsi army proceeded to round up thousands of Hutu and kill them. The Rwandan genocide in 1994, sparked by the killing of Ndadaye's successor Cyprien Ntaryamira, further aggravated the conflict in Burundi by sparking additional massacres of Tutsis.\nA decade of civil war followed, as the Hutu formed militias in the refugee camps of northern Tanzania. An estimated 300,000 people were killed in clashes and reprisals against the local population, with 550,000 citizens (nine percent of the population) being displaced. After the assassination of Ntaryamira, the Hutu presidency and Tutsi military operated under a power-sharing political system until July 1996, when Tutsi Pierre Buyoya seized power in a military coup. Under international pressure, the warring factions negotiated a peace agreement in Arusha in 2000, which called for ethnically balanced military and government and democratic elections.\nThe country has been hit hard by HIV/AIDS during this period. Sample testing by SOS Children had shown that those who were HIV positive were 20 percent of the urban population and 6% of the rural population. The death toll due to the syndrome has been devastating: the UN estimated 12,000 deaths in 2001 and Oxfam estimated 40,000 deaths in 2001.\nTwo powerful Hutu rebel groups (the CNDD-FDD and the FNL) refused to sign the peace agreement and fighting continued in the countryside. Finally, the CNDD-FDD agreed to sign a peace deal in November 2003 and joined the transitional government. The last remaining rebel group, the FNL, continued to reject the peace process and committed sporadic acts of violence in 2003 and 2004, finally signing a cease fire agreement in 2006.\nPost-war (2005\u2013present).\nPost-war elections.\nIn 2005, Burundi began the transition towards peace with its first elections since 1993. The CNDD-FDD won both the local and legislative elections, held in June and July respectively. An indirect presidential election took place in August 2005, and the members of the legislature and senate elected Pierre Nkurunziza, a former teacher and CNDD rebel, who had been president of the CNDD-FDD party since August 2000. He won with 151 of the 161 votes.\nNkurunziza era (2005\u20132020).\nPeacetime ushered in an era in which the ruling CNDD-FDD party dominated the political space in Burundi. President Pierre Nkurunziza, and a small clique of military generals from the party, tightly controlled the country.\nIn 2005, Pierre Nkurunziza, became the first post-transitional president. He was elected by the National Assembly and Senate through the means of indirect presidential elections.\nFormer President Domitien Ndayizeye and his political supporters were arrested in 2006 and accused of plotting a coup, but later he was acquitted by the Supreme Court. International human rights groups claimed that the current government was framing Domitien Ndayizeye by torturing him into false confessions of a coup plot. In December 2006 the International Crisis Group labeled Burundi's human rights status as \"deteriorating\". The organization reported that the government had arrested critics, muzzled the press, committed human rights abuses, and tightened its control over the economy, and that \"unless it [reversed] this authoritarian course, it risk[ed] triggering violent unrest and losing the gains of peace process.\"\nIn February 2007, the United Nations officially shut down its peacekeeping operations in Burundi and turned its attention to rebuilding the nation's economy, which relies heavily on tea and coffee, but which had suffered severely during 12 years of civil war. The UN had deployed 5,600 peacekeepers since 2004, and several hundred troops remained to work with the African Union in monitoring the ceasefire. The UN Post Conflict Fund (PBF) pledged $35 million to Burundi to work on infrastructure, to promote democratic practices, to rebuild the military, and to defend human rights.\n2010 elections.\nNkurunziza was re-elected in 2010 with more than 91% of the votes amidst an opposition boycott and sworn in for his second term on 26 August 2010.\n2015 unrest.\nIn April 2015, Nkurunziza announced that he would seek a third term in office. The opposition said that Nkurunziza's bid to extend his term was in defiance of the constitution, as it bars the president from running for a third term. However, Nkurunziza's allies said his first term did not count as he was appointed by parliament and not directly by the people. On April 26 police clashed with demonstrators protesting Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term in office. At least six people were killed in the first two days of ongoing protests. The government shut down multiple radio stations and arrested a prominent civil society leader, Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, in a statement, that he had despatched his special envoy for the region, Said Djinnit, to Burundi for talks with Nkurunziza. African Union commission head Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said she welcomed a decision by Burundi's Senate to ask the Constitutional Court to rule whether Nkurunziza could stand for re-election. More than 24,000 people fled Burundi in April, as tensions mounted ahead of presidential elections in June, the UN refugee agency said.\nOn May 13, 2015, Burundi army General Godefroid Niyombareh, former head of Burundian intelligence, declared a coup via radio while Nkurunziza was abroad attending a summit in Tanzania with other African leaders. Niyombareh had been fired by the President in February. Despite reports that gunshots had been heard and people were celebrating in the streets of the capital, government officials dismissed the threat and claimed to remain in control.\nOpposition groups announced on 26 June that they would boycott the election.\nSpeaking to a Kenyan television station on 6 July, one of the coup leaders, General Leonard Ngendakumana, called for armed rebellion against Nkurunziza. He said that his group was responsible for the grenade attacks and said that \"our intent is to intensify\". Fighting was reported in northern Burundi on 10\u201311 July. The military said on 13 July that 31 rebels had been killed and 170 had been captured in those battles; it said that six of its own soldiers had also been wounded. The Burundian government stated that the rebels had crossed into northern Burundi through the Nyungwe Forest from Rwanda but the Rwandan government denied this. Ngendakumana said that the rebels were from his group.\nShortly after the election was held on 21 July, without the participation of the opposition, main opposition leader Agathon Rwasa proposed the formation of a national unity government, while warning of the potential for more violence and armed rebellion against Nkurunziza. As conditions for participating in such a government, Rwasa said that Nkurunziza's third term would need to be greatly truncated to no more than a year and new elections would have to be held, although he admitted that he doubted Nkurunziza would accept those conditions. He also urged those hoping to oust Nkurunziza through violence to instead focus on dialogue. The government welcomed the idea of forming a national unity government, but rejected the notion of truncating Nkurunziza's new term.\nThe presidential election results were announced on 24 July 2015. Nkurunziza won the election with 69.41% of the vote. Agathon Rwasa was placed second and credited with 18.99% despite calling for a boycott. This change of power led to an opening of social science research in the country, and later a reconsideration of the value and purpose of that research within the context of the larger political and societal violence.\nOn 30 September 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi through resolution 33/24. Its mandate is to \"conduct a thorough investigation into human rights violations and abuses committed in Burundi since April 2015, to identify alleged perpetrators and to formulate recommendations.\" The Human Rights Council extended the mandate of the commission for another year in September 2017. On 29 September 2017 the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi called on Burundian government to put an end to serious human rights violations. It further stressed that, \"The Burundian government has so far refused to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry, despite the Commission's repeated requests and initiatives.\" The Commission conducted interviews with more than 500 Burundian refugees abroad and others who remained in their country and reached the conclusion that \"serious human rights violations and abuses have been committed in Burundi since April 2015. The violations the Commission documented include arbitrary arrests and detentions, acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, rape and other forms of sexual violence.\"\nPost-2015.\nIn a constitutional referendum in May 2018, Burundians voted by 79.08% to approve an amended constitution that ensured that Nkurunziza could remain in power until 2034. However, much to the surprise of most observers, Nkurunziza later announced that he did not intend to serve another term, paving the way for a new president to be elected in the 2020 General Election.\nOn 24 December 2018, the government moved Burundi's political capital from Bujumbura back to Gitega, where it had been until 1966.\nThe threat of the COVID-19 pandemic was played down officially by the regime. The Presidency issued a statement which warned its population against \"hasty, extreme, unilateral measures\" against the virus. Human Rights Watch reported that some nurses had been told \"not to talk about suspected cases, symptom patterns, or insufficient resources\".\nPost-Nkurunziza (2020\u2013present).\nOn 20 May 2020, \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye, a candidate who was hand-picked as Nkurunziza's successor by the CNDD-FDD, won the election with 71.45% of the vote. Shortly after, on 9 June 2020, Nkurunziza died of a cardiac arrest, at the age of 55. There was some speculation that his death was COVID-19 related, though this is unconfirmed. As per the constitution, Pascal Nyabenda, the president of the national assembly, led the government until Ndayishimiye's inauguration on 18 June 2020.\nInitially, Ndayishimiye adopted a stronger response to the COVID-19 pandemic than his predecessor - calling the virus the nation's \"worst enemy\" shortly after taking office. In January 2021, he closed national borders, having previously issued a statement which said that anyone bringing Covid into Burundi would be treated as \"people bringing weapons to kill Burundians\". In February 2021, however, Burundi joined Tanzania in being the only African nations to reject vaccines from the COVAX scheme: the health minister Thaddee Ndikumana stated that \u201csince more than 95% of patients are recovering, we estimate that the vaccines are not yet necessary.\u201d As of June 2021, Burundi has still not made any effort to procure vaccines - one of three countries to fail to take this step.\nIn June 2025, Burundi urged the United Nations to officially recognize the 1972-1973 massacres of Hutus as genocide.\nSee also.\nGeneral:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While the term outside of the scientific literature is often used interchangeably with anorexia nervosa, many possible causes exist for a loss of appetite, some of which may be harmless, while others indicate a serious clinical condition or pose a significant risk.\nAnorexia in this usage is a symptom, not a diagnosis.\nThe symptom also occurs in non-human animals, such as cats, dogs, cattle, goats, and sheep. In these species, anorexia may be referred to as inappetence. As in humans, loss of appetite can be due to a range of diseases and conditions, as well as environmental and psychological factors.\nEtymology.\nThe term is from (, 'without' + , spelled , meaning 'appetite').\nCommon manifestations.\nAnorexia simply manifests as a decreased or loss of appetite. This can present as not feeling hungry or lacking the desire to eat. Sometimes people do not even notice they lack an appetite until they begin to lose weight from eating less. In other cases, it can be more noticeable, such as when a person becomes nauseated from just the thought of eating. Any form of decreased appetite that leads to changes in the body (such as weight loss or muscle loss) and is not done intentionally as part of dieting is clinically significant.\nPhysiology of anorexia.\nAppetite stimulation and suppression is a complex process involving many different parts of the brain and body by the use of various hormones and signals. Appetite is thought to be stimulated by interplay between peripheral signals to the brain (taste, smell, sight, gut hormones) as well as the balance of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the hypothalamus. Examples of these signals or hormones include neuropeptide Y, leptin, ghrelin, insulin, serotonin, and orexins (also called hypocretins). Anything that causes an imbalance of these signals or hormones can lead to the symptom of anorexia. While it is known that these signals and hormones help control appetite, the complicated mechanisms regarding a pathological increase or decrease in appetite are still being explored.\nComplications.\nComplications of anorexia may result due to poor food intake. Poor food intake can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, anemia and nutritional deficiencies. These imbalances will worsen the longer that food is avoided.\nSudden cardiac death.\nAnorexia is a relatively common condition that can lead patients to have dangerous electrolyte imbalances, leading to acquired long QT syndrome which can result in sudden cardiac death. This can develop over a prolonged period of time, and the risk is further heightened when feeding resumes after a period of abstaining from consumption.\nRefeeding syndrome.\nCare must be taken when a patient begins to eat after prolonged starvation to avoid the potentially fatal complications of refeeding syndrome. The initial signs of refeeding syndrome are minimal, but can rapidly progress to death. Thus, the reinitiation of food or oral intake is usually started slowly and requires close observation under supervision by trained healthcare professionals. This is usually done in a hospital or nutritional rehabilitation center.\nManagement.\nAnorexia can be treated with the help of orexigenic drugs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a teenager, she achieved popularity with her debut films \"La Boum\" (1980) and \"La Boum 2\" (1982), receiving a C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress. She became a film star in Europe with a string of successful films, including \"L'\u00c9tudiante\" (1988), \"Pacific Palisades\" (1990), \"Fanfan\" (1993) and \"Revenge of the Musketeers\" (1994). She became an international film star with her performances in \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"Firelight\" (1997), \"Anna Karenina\" (1997) and as Elektra King in the 19th James Bond film \"The World Is Not Enough\" (1999). Some of her later films tackle critical social issues such as \"Arr\u00eatez-moi\" (2013), \"Jailbirds\" (2015) and \"Everything Went Fine\" (2021).\nMarceau has appeared on more than 300 magazine covers worldwide and been the face of numerous luxury brands. She was made Officer (\"Officier\") in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Minister of Culture of France in 2003, and in 2015 it was revealed that she had refused the Legion of Honour (\"Ordre national de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur\").\nEarly life.\nShe was born 17 November 1966 in Paris, the second child of Simone (n\u00e9e Morisset), who was a shop assistant, and Beno\u00eet Maupu, a truck driver. Her parents divorced when she was nine years old.\nFilm career.\nIn February 1980, Marceau and her mother came across a model agency looking for teenagers. Marceau had photos taken at the agency, but did not think anything would come of it. At the same time, Fran\u00e7oise Menidrey, the casting director for Claude Pinoteau's \"La Boum\" (1980), asked modeling agencies to recommend a new teenager for the project. After viewing the rushes, Alain Poir\u00e9, the director of the Gaumont, signed Marceau to a long-term contract. \"La Boum\" was a hit film, with 4,378,500 tickets sold in France. In 1981, Marceau made her singing debut with French singer Fran\u00e7ois Val\u00e9ry on record \"Dream in Blue\", written by Pierre Delano\u00eb. She rejected the main role in a soon-to-be controversial film, \"Beau-p\u00e8re\", in which she would have played as a teenage girl who seduces her step-father for a sexual relationship. The role was eventually played by Ariel Besse. In 1982, at age 16, Marceau bought back her contract with Gaumont for one million French francs. She borrowed most of the money.\nAfter starring in the sequel film \"La Boum 2\" (1982), Marceau focused on more dramatic roles, including the historical drama \"Fort Saganne\" in 1984 with G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve, \"Joyeuses P\u00e2ques\" (\"Happy Easter\") in 1984, \"L'amour braque\" and \"Police\" in 1985, and \"Descente aux enfers\" (\"Descent into Hell\") in 1986. In 1988, she starred in \"L'\u00c9tudiante\" (\"The Student\") and the historical adventure film \"Chouans!\". That year, Marceau was named Best Romantic Actress at the International Festival of Romantic Movies for her role in \"Chouans!\"\nIn 1989, Marceau starred in \"My Nights Are More Beautiful Than Your Days\", which was directed by her long-time partner Andrzej Zulawski. In 1990, she starred in \"Pacific Palisades\" and \"La note bleue\", her third film directed by her companion. In 1991, she ventured into the theater in \"Eurydice\", which earned Marceau the Moliere Award for Best Female Newcomer. Throughout the 1990s, Marceau began making less-dramatic films, such as the comedy \"Fanfan\" in 1993 and \"Revenge of the Musketeers\" (\"La fille de d'Artagnan\") in 1994\u2014both popular in Europe and abroad. That year, she returned to the theatre as Eliza Doolittle in \"Pygmalion\".\nMarceau achieved international recognition in 1995 playing the role of Princess Isabelle in Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\". That year, she was part of an ensemble of international actors in the French film \"Beyond the Clouds\", directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and Wim Wenders. In 1997, she continued her string of successful films with William Nicholson's \"Firelight\", filmed in England, V\u00e9ra Belmont's \"Marquise\", filmed in France, and Bernard Rose's \"Anna Karenina\", filmed in Russia. In 1999, she played Hippolyta in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and the villainous Bond girl Elektra King in \"The World Is Not Enough\". In 2000, Marceau teamed up again with her then-partner Andrzej Zulawski to film \"Fidelity\", playing the role of a talented photographer who takes a job at a scandal-mongering tabloid and becomes romantically involved with an eccentric children's book publisher.\nSince the early 2000s, Marceau has continued to appear in a wide variety of roles, mainly in French films, playing a widowed nurse in \"Nelly\" (\"\u00c0 ce soir\") in 2004, an undercover police agent in \"Anthony Zimmer\" in 2005, and the troubled daughter of a murdered film star in \"Trivial\" in 2007. In 2008, Marceau played a member of the French Resistance movement in \"Female Agents\", and a struggling single mother in \"LOL (Laughing Out Loud)\". In 2009, she teamed up with Monica Bellucci in \"Don't Look Back\" about the mysterious connection between two women who have never met. In 2010, Marceau played a successful business executive forced to confront her unhappy childhood in \"With Love... from the Age of Reason\" (\"L'\u00e2ge de raison\").\nIn 2012, Marceau played a 40-something career woman who falls in love with a young jazz musician in \"Happiness Never Comes Alone\". In 2013, she appeared in \"Arr\u00eatez-moi\" (\"Arrest Me\") as a woman who shows up at a police station and confesses to the murder of her abusive husband several years earlier.\nShe was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\nAuthor and director.\nIn 1996, Marceau published the semi-autobiographical novel, \"Menteuse\" (the English translation, \"Telling Lies\", was published in 2001). Marceau's work was described as \"an exploration of female identity\".\nIn 2002, Marceau made her directorial debut in the feature film \"Speak to Me of Love\", for which she was named Best Director at the Montreal World Film Festival. The film starred Judith Godr\u00e8che. It was her second directorial effort, following her nine-minute short film \"L'aube \u00e0 l'envers\" in 1995, which also starred Godr\u00e8che. In 2007, she directed \"Trivial\", her second feature film and in 2018 \"Mrs Mills\".\nAdvertising.\nIn the early stages of her career, she shot around a dozen television commercials and numerous national magazine covers in Japan and South Korea where she is famous since \"La Boum\". Since 2008, Marceau is an international ambassador for high-end jeweller Chaumet based in Paris. Since 2014, she has been the ambassador of the DS 4, DS 5 and DS 6 cars (2010\u20132016) of the PSA Group with billboards and television commercials throughout Asia and especially in China.\nPersonal life.\nFrom 1985 to 2001, Marceau was in a relationship with Polish director Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski. They have a son, Vincent, born in July 1995. In 2001, Marceau separated from \u017bu\u0142awski and began a six-year relationship with American producer Jim Lemley. They have a daughter, Juliette, born in June 2002.\nMarceau also had a relationship with actor Christopher Lambert beginning in 2007, with whom she appeared in the films \"Trivial\" and \"Cartagena\". They separated in July 2014. In 2016, for about 10 months, Marceau was in a relationship with the chef and restaurant owner Cyril Lignac.\nMarceau is a classically trained cellist, as seen in the 1999 film \"Lost and Found\". She is bilingual (French and English). She considers herself sapiosexual.\nDecorations.\n\"Female conqueror and ambitious actress. For millions of spectators, you embody freedom and revolt. Your career is part of the tradition of the greatest French actors, in the wake of Catherine Deneuve, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret or Jean-Paul Belmondo. You are a role model in our country and, abroad, you embody the image of the perfect French woman and for that you deserve the gratitude of the Republic\".\nPublic image.\nMarceau is one of the most well-known Western actors in Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea and most importantly China, owing to her films, her countless local advertising campaigns and her role as a cultural ambassador of France in these countries since the 1980s. Marceau was invited to sing \"La Vie en rose\" in China in a duet with Liu Huan for the 2014 CCTV's New Year gala which was watched by over 700 million people ushering in the nation's week-long holiday. As of 2020 and since the 1990s, the circumlocution \"the French people's favourite actress\" (French: \"actrice pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e des Fran\u00e7ais\") became a synonym for Marceau in media and the press as she has regularly topped most annual surveys and opinion polls determining it during that period.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech. The reverse process is speech recognition.\nSynthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database. Systems differ in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores phones or diphones provides the largest output range, but may lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the vocal tract and other human voice characteristics to create a completely \"synthetic\" voice output.\nThe quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its similarity to the human voice and by its ability to be understood clearly. An intelligible text-to-speech program allows people with visual impairments or reading disabilities to listen to written words on a home computer. The earliest computer operating system to have included a speech synthesizer was Unix in 1974, through the Unix speak utility. In 2000, Microsoft Sam was the default text-to-speech voice synthesizer used by the narrator accessibility feature, which shipped with all Windows 2000 operating systems, and subsequent Windows XP systems.\nA text-to-speech system (or \"engine\") is composed of two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end has two major tasks. First, it converts raw text containing symbols like numbers and abbreviations into the equivalent of written-out words. This process is often called \"text normalization\", \"pre-processing\", or \"tokenization\". The front-end then assigns phonetic transcriptions to each word, and divides and marks the text into prosodic units, like phrases, clauses, and sentences. The process of assigning phonetic transcriptions to words is called \"text-to-phoneme\" or \"grapheme-to-phoneme\" conversion. Phonetic transcriptions and prosody information together make up the symbolic linguistic representation that is output by the front-end. The back-end\u2014often referred to as the \"synthesizer\"\u2014then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into sound. In certain systems, this part includes the computation of the \"target prosody\" (pitch contour, phoneme durations), which is then imposed on the output speech.\nHistory.\nLong before the invention of electronic signal processing, some people tried to build machines to emulate human speech. There were also legends of the existence of \"Brazen Heads\", such as those involving Pope Silvester II (d. 1003 AD), Albertus Magnus (1198\u20131280), and Roger Bacon (1214\u20131294).\nIn 1779, the German-Danish scientist Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein won the first prize in a competition announced by the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences and Arts for models he built of the human vocal tract that could produce the five long vowel sounds (in International Phonetic Alphabet notation: , , , and ). There followed the bellows-operated \"acoustic-mechanical speech machine\" of Wolfgang von Kempelen of Pressburg, Hungary, described in a 1791 paper. This machine added models of the tongue and lips, enabling it to produce consonants as well as vowels. In 1837, Charles Wheatstone produced a \"speaking machine\" based on von Kempelen's design, and in 1846, Joseph Faber exhibited the \"Euphonia\". In 1923, Paget resurrected Wheatstone's design.\nIn the 1930s, Bell Labs developed the vocoder, which automatically analyzed speech into its fundamental tones and resonances. From his work on the vocoder, Homer Dudley developed a keyboard-operated voice-synthesizer called The Voder (Voice Demonstrator), which he exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\nDr. Franklin S. Cooper and his colleagues at Haskins Laboratories built the Pattern playback in the late 1940s and completed it in 1950. There were several different versions of this hardware device; only one currently survives. The machine converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech in the form of a spectrogram back into sound. Using this device, Alvin Liberman and colleagues discovered acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels).\nElectronic devices.\nThe first computer-based speech-synthesis systems originated in the late 1950s. Noriko Umeda \"et al.\" developed the first general English text-to-speech system in 1968, at the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Japan. In 1961, physicist John Larry Kelly, Jr and his colleague Louis Gerstman used an IBM 704 computer to synthesize speech, an event among the most prominent in the history of Bell Labs. Kelly's voice recorder synthesizer (vocoder) recreated the song \"Daisy Bell\", with musical accompaniment from Max Mathews. Coincidentally, Arthur C. Clarke was visiting his friend and colleague John Pierce at the Bell Labs Murray Hill facility. Clarke was so impressed by the demonstration that he used it in the climactic scene of his screenplay for his novel \"\", where the HAL 9000 computer sings the same song as astronaut Dave Bowman puts it to sleep. Despite the success of purely electronic speech synthesis, research into mechanical speech-synthesizers continues.\nLinear predictive coding (LPC), a form of speech coding, began development with the work of Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1966. Further developments in LPC technology were made by Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs during the 1970s. LPC was later the basis for early speech synthesizer chips, such as the Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips used in the Speak &amp; Spell toys from 1978.\nIn 1975, Fumitada Itakura developed the line spectral pairs (LSP) method for high-compression speech coding, while at NTT. From 1975 to 1981, Itakura studied problems in speech analysis and synthesis based on the LSP method. In 1980, his team developed an LSP-based speech synthesizer chip. LSP is an important technology for speech synthesis and coding, and in the 1990s was adopted by almost all international speech coding standards as an essential component, contributing to the enhancement of digital speech communication over mobile channels and the internet.\nIn 1975, MUSA was released, and was one of the first Speech Synthesis systems. It consisted of a stand-alone computer hardware and a specialized software that enabled it to read Italian. A second version, released in 1978, was also able to sing Italian in an \"a cappella\" style.\nDominant systems in the 1980s and 1990s were the DECtalk system, based largely on the work of Dennis Klatt at MIT, and the Bell Labs system; the latter was one of the first multilingual language-independent systems, making extensive use of natural language processing methods.\nHandheld electronics featuring speech synthesis began emerging in the 1970s. One of the first was the Telesensory Systems Inc. (TSI) \"Speech+\" portable calculator for the blind in 1976. Other devices had primarily educational purposes, such as the Speak &amp; Spell toy produced by Texas Instruments in 1978. Fidelity released a speaking version of its electronic chess computer in 1979. The first video game to feature speech synthesis was the 1980 shoot 'em up arcade game, \"Stratovox\" (known in Japan as \"Speak &amp; Rescue\"), from Sun Electronics. The first personal computer game with speech synthesis was \"Manbiki Shoujo\" (\"Shoplifting Girl\"), released in 1980 for the PET 2001, for which the game's developer, Hiroshi Suzuki, developed a \"zero cross\" programming technique to produce a synthesized speech waveform. Another early example, the arcade version of \"Berzerk\", also dates from 1980. The Milton Bradley Company produced the first multi-player electronic game using voice synthesis, \"Milton\", in the same year.\nIn 1976, Computalker Consultants released their CT-1 Speech Synthesizer. Designed by D. Lloyd Rice and Jim Cooper, it was an analog synthesizer built to work with microcomputers using the S-100 bus standard.\nSynthesized voices typically sounded male until 1990, when Ann Syrdal, at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, created a female voice.\nKurzweil predicted in 2005 that as the cost-performance ratio caused speech synthesizers to become cheaper and more accessible, more people would benefit from the use of text-to-speech programs.\nArtificial intelligence.\nIn September 2016, DeepMind released WaveNet, which demonstrated that deep learning models are capable of modeling raw waveforms and generating speech from acoustic features like spectrograms or mel-spectrograms, starting the field of deep learning speech synthesis. Although WaveNet was initially considered to be computationally expensive and slow to be used in consumer products at the time, a year after its release, DeepMind unveiled a modified version of WaveNet known as \"Parallel WaveNet,\" a production model 1,000 times faster than the original. This was followed by Google AI's Tacotron 2 in 2018, which demonstrated that neural networks could produce highly natural speech synthesis but required substantial training data\u2014typically tens of hours of audio\u2014to achieve acceptable quality. Tacotron 2 employed an autoencoder architecture with attention mechanisms to convert input text into mel-spectrograms, which were then converted to waveforms using a separate neural vocoder. When trained on smaller datasets, such as 2 hours of speech, the output quality degraded while still being able to maintain intelligible speech, and with just 24 minutes of training data, Tacotron 2 failed to produce intelligible speech.\nIn 2019, Microsoft Research introduced FastSpeech, which addressed speed limitations in autoregressive models like Tacotron 2. The same year saw the release of HiFi-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoder that improved the efficiency of waveform generation while producing high-fidelity speech. In 2020, the release of Glow-TTS introduced a flow-based approach that allowed for both fast inference and voice style transfer capabilities.\nIn March 2020, the free text-to-speech website 15.ai was launched. 15.ai gained widespread international attention in early 2021 for its ability to synthesize emotionally expressive speech of fictional characters from popular media with minimal amount of data. The creator of 15.ai stated that 15 seconds of training data is sufficient to perfectly clone a person's voice (hence its name, \"15.ai\"), a significant reduction from the previously known data requirement of tens of hours. 15.ai is credited as the first platform to popularize AI voice cloning in memes and content creation. In January 2022, the first instance of speech synthesis NFT fraud occurred when a cryptocurrency company called Voiceverse generated voice lines using 15.ai, pitched them up to sound unrecognizable, promoted them as the byproduct of their own technology, and sold them as NFTs without permission.\nIn January 2023, ElevenLabs launched its browser-based text-to-speech platform, which employs advanced algorithms to analyze contextual aspects of text and detect emotions such as anger, sadness, happiness, or alarm. The platform is able to adjust intonation and pacing based on linguistic context to produce lifelike speech with human-like inflection, and offers features including multilingual speech generation and long-form content creation.\nIn March 2024, OpenAI corroborated the 15 second benchmark to clone a human's voice. However, they deemed their Voice Engine tool \"too risky\" for general release, stating that they would only release a preview and not release the technology for public use.\nSynthesizer technologies.\nThe most important qualities of a speech synthesis system are \"naturalness\" and \"intelligibility\". Naturalness describes how closely the output sounds like human speech, while intelligibility is the ease with which the output is understood. The ideal speech synthesizer is both natural and intelligible. Speech synthesis systems usually try to maximize both characteristics.\nThe two primary technologies generating synthetic speech waveforms are \"concatenative synthesis\" and \"formant synthesis\". Each technology has strengths and weaknesses, and the intended uses of a synthesis system will typically determine which approach is used.\nConcatenation synthesis.\nConcatenative synthesis is based on the concatenation (stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally, concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output. There are three main sub-types of concatenative synthesis.\nUnit selection synthesis.\nUnit selection synthesis uses large databases of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual phones, diphones, half-phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified speech recognizer set to a \"forced alignment\" mode with some manual correction afterward, using visual representations such as the waveform and spectrogram. An index of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the fundamental frequency (pitch), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At run time, the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted decision tree.\nUnit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of digital signal processing (DSP) to the recorded speech. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural, although some systems use a small amount of signal processing at the point of concatenation to smooth the waveform. The output from the best unit-selection systems is often indistinguishable from real human voices, especially in contexts for which the TTS system has been tuned. However, maximum naturalness typically require unit-selection speech databases to be very large, in some systems ranging into the gigabytes of recorded data, representing dozens of hours of speech. Also, unit selection algorithms have been known to select segments from a place that results in less than ideal synthesis (e.g. minor words become unclear) even when a better choice exists in the database. Recently, researchers have proposed various automated methods to detect unnatural segments in unit-selection speech synthesis systems.\nDiphone synthesis.\nDiphone synthesis uses a minimal speech database containing all the diphones (sound-to-sound transitions) occurring in a language. The number of diphones depends on the phonotactics of the language: for example, Spanish has about 800 diphones, and German about 2500. In diphone synthesis, only one example of each diphone is contained in the speech database. At runtime, the target prosody of a sentence is superimposed on these minimal units by means of digital signal processing techniques such as linear predictive coding, PSOLA or MBROLA. or more recent techniques such as pitch modification in the source domain using discrete cosine transform. Diphone synthesis suffers from the sonic glitches of concatenative synthesis and the robotic-sounding nature of formant synthesis, and has few of the advantages of either approach other than small size. As such, its use in commercial applications is declining, although it continues to be used in research because there are a number of freely available software implementations. An early example of Diphone synthesis is a teaching robot, Leachim, that was invented by Michael J. Freeman. Leachim contained information regarding class curricular and certain biographical information about the students whom it was programmed to teach. It was tested in a fourth grade classroom in the Bronx, New York.\nDomain-specific synthesis.\nDomain-specific synthesis concatenates prerecorded words and phrases to create complete utterances. It is used in applications where the variety of texts the system will output is limited to a particular domain, like transit schedule announcements or weather reports. The technology is very simple to implement, and has been in commercial use for a long time, in devices like talking clocks and calculators. The level of naturalness of these systems can be very high because the variety of sentence types is limited, and they closely match the prosody and intonation of the original recordings.\nBecause these systems are limited by the words and phrases in their databases, they are not general-purpose and can only synthesize the combinations of words and phrases with which they have been preprogrammed. The blending of words within naturally spoken language however can still cause problems unless the many variations are taken into account. For example, in non-rhotic dialects of English the \"r\" in words like \"clear\" is usually only pronounced when the following word has a vowel as its first letter (e.g. \"clear out\" is realized as ). Likewise in French, many final consonants become no longer silent if followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an effect called liaison. This alternation cannot be reproduced by a simple word-concatenation system, which would require additional complexity to be context-sensitive.\nFormant synthesis.\nFormant synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime. Instead, the synthesized speech output is created using additive synthesis and an acoustic model (physical modelling synthesis). Parameters such as fundamental frequency, voicing, and noise levels are varied over time to create a waveform of artificial speech. This method is sometimes called \"rules-based synthesis\"; however, many concatenative systems also have rules-based components.\nMany systems based on formant synthesis technology generate artificial, robotic-sounding speech that would never be mistaken for human speech. However, maximum naturalness is not always the goal of a speech synthesis system, and formant synthesis systems have advantages over concatenative systems. Formant-synthesized speech can be reliably intelligible, even at very high speeds, avoiding the acoustic glitches that commonly plague concatenative systems. High-speed synthesized speech is used by the visually impaired to quickly navigate computers using a screen reader. Formant synthesizers are usually smaller programs than concatenative systems because they do not have a database of speech samples. They can therefore be used in embedded systems, where memory and microprocessor power are especially limited. Because formant-based systems have complete control of all aspects of the output speech, a wide variety of prosodies and intonations can be output, conveying not just questions and statements, but a variety of emotions and tones of voice.\nExamples of non-real-time but highly accurate intonation control in formant synthesis include the work done in the late 1970s for the Texas Instruments toy Speak &amp; Spell, and in the early 1980s Sega arcade machines and in many Atari, Inc. arcade games using the TMS5220 LPC Chips. Creating proper intonation for these projects was painstaking, and the results have yet to be matched by real-time text-to-speech interfaces.\nFor tonal languages, such as Chinese or Taiwanese language, there are different levels of tone sandhi required and sometimes the output of speech synthesizer may result in the mistakes of tone sandhi.\nArticulatory synthesis.\nArticulatory synthesis consists of computational techniques for synthesizing speech based on models of the human vocal tract and the articulation processes occurring there. The first articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at Haskins Laboratories in the mid-1970s by Philip Rubin, Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was based on vocal tract models developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues.\nUntil recently, articulatory synthesis models have not been incorporated into commercial speech synthesis systems. A notable exception is the NeXT-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the University of Calgary, where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by Steve Jobs in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under the GNU General Public License, with work continuing as gnuspeech. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Carr\u00e9's \"distinctive region model\".\nMore recent synthesizers, developed by Jorge C. Lucero and colleagues, incorporate models of vocal fold biomechanics, glottal aerodynamics and acoustic wave propagation in the bronchi, trachea, nasal and oral cavities, and thus constitute full systems of physics-based speech simulation.\nHMM-based synthesis.\nHMM-based synthesis is a synthesis method based on hidden Markov models, also called Statistical Parametric Synthesis. In this system, the frequency spectrum (vocal tract), fundamental frequency (voice source), and duration (prosody) of speech are modeled simultaneously by HMMs. Speech waveforms are generated from HMMs themselves based on the maximum likelihood criterion.\nSinewave synthesis.\nSinewave synthesis is a technique for synthesizing speech by replacing the formants (main bands of energy) with pure tone whistles.\nDeep learning-based synthesis.\nDeep learning speech synthesis uses deep neural networks (DNN) to produce artificial speech from text (text-to-speech) or spectrum (vocoder).\nThe deep neural networks are trained using a large amount of recorded speech and, in the case of a text-to-speech system, the associated labels and/or input text.\nAudio deepfakes.\nIn 2023, VICE reporter Joseph Cox published findings that he had recorded five minutes of himself talking and then used a tool developed by ElevenLabs to create voice deepfakes that defeated a bank's voice-authentication system.\nChallenges.\nText normalization challenges.\nThe process of normalizing text is rarely straightforward. Texts are full of heteronyms, numbers, and abbreviations that all require expansion into a phonetic representation. There are many spellings in English which are pronounced differently based on context. For example, \"My latest project is to learn how to better project my voice\" contains two pronunciations of \"project\".\nMost text-to-speech (TTS) systems do not generate semantic representations of their input texts, as processes for doing so are unreliable, poorly understood, and computationally ineffective. As a result, various heuristic techniques are used to guess the proper way to disambiguate homographs, like examining neighboring words and using statistics about frequency of occurrence.\nRecently TTS systems have begun to use HMMs (discussed above) to generate \"parts of speech\" to aid in disambiguating homographs. This technique is quite successful for many cases such as whether \"read\" should be pronounced as \"red\" implying past tense, or as \"reed\" implying present tense. Typical error rates when using HMMs in this fashion are usually below five percent. These techniques also work well for most European languages, although access to required training corpora is frequently difficult in these languages.\nDeciding how to convert numbers is another problem that TTS systems have to address. It is a simple programming challenge to convert a number into words (at least in English), like \"1325\" becoming \"one thousand three hundred twenty-five\". However, numbers occur in many different contexts; \"1325\" may also be read as \"one three two five\", \"thirteen twenty-five\" or \"thirteen hundred and twenty five\". A TTS system can often infer how to expand a number based on surrounding words, numbers, and punctuation, and sometimes the system provides a way to specify the context if it is ambiguous. Roman numerals can also be read differently depending on context. For example, \"Henry VIII\" reads as \"Henry the Eighth\", while \"Chapter VIII\" reads as \"Chapter Eight\".\nSimilarly, abbreviations can be ambiguous. For example, the abbreviation \"in\" for \"inches\" must be differentiated from the word \"in\", and the address \"12 St John St.\" uses the same abbreviation for both \"Saint\" and \"Street\". TTS systems with intelligent front ends can make educated guesses about ambiguous abbreviations, while others provide the same result in all cases, resulting in nonsensical (and sometimes comical) outputs, such as \"Ulysses S. Grant\" being rendered as \"Ulysses South Grant\".\nText-to-phoneme challenges.\nSpeech synthesis systems use two basic approaches to determine the pronunciation of a word based on its spelling, a process which is often called text-to-phoneme or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (phoneme is the term used by linguists to describe distinctive sounds in a language). The simplest approach to text-to-phoneme conversion is the dictionary-based approach, where a large dictionary containing all the words of a language and their correct pronunciations is stored by the program. Determining the correct pronunciation of each word is a matter of looking up each word in the dictionary and replacing the spelling with the pronunciation specified in the dictionary. The other approach is rule-based, in which pronunciation rules are applied to words to determine their pronunciations based on their spellings. This is similar to the \"sounding out\", or synthetic phonics, approach to learning reading.\nEach approach has advantages and drawbacks. The dictionary-based approach is quick and accurate, but completely fails if it is given a word which is not in its dictionary. As dictionary size grows, so too does the memory space requirements of the synthesis system. On the other hand, the rule-based approach works on any input, but the complexity of the rules grows substantially as the system takes into account irregular spellings or pronunciations. (Consider that the word \"of\" is very common in English, yet is the only word in which the letter \"f\" is pronounced .) As a result, nearly all speech synthesis systems use a combination of these approaches.\nLanguages with a phonemic orthography have a very regular writing system, and the prediction of the pronunciation of words based on their spellings is quite successful. Speech synthesis systems for such languages often use the rule-based method extensively, resorting to dictionaries only for those few words, like foreign names and loanwords, whose pronunciations are not obvious from their spellings. On the other hand, speech synthesis systems for languages like English, which have extremely irregular spelling systems, are more likely to rely on dictionaries, and to use rule-based methods only for unusual words, or words that are not in their dictionaries.\nEvaluation challenges.\nThe consistent evaluation of speech synthesis systems may be difficult because of a lack of universally agreed objective evaluation criteria. Different organizations often use different speech data. The quality of speech synthesis systems also depends on the quality of the production technique (which may involve analogue or digital recording) and on the facilities used to replay the speech. Evaluating speech synthesis systems has therefore often been compromised by differences between production techniques and replay facilities.\nSince 2005, however, some researchers have started to evaluate speech synthesis systems using a common speech dataset.\nProsodics and emotional content.\nA study in the journal \"Speech Communication\" by Amy Drahota and colleagues at the University of Portsmouth, UK, reported that listeners to voice recordings could determine, at better than chance levels, whether or not the speaker was smiling. It was suggested that identification of the vocal features that signal emotional content may be used to help make synthesized speech sound more natural. One of the related issues is modification of the pitch contour of the sentence, depending upon whether it is an affirmative, interrogative or exclamatory sentence. One of the techniques for pitch modification uses discrete cosine transform in the source domain (linear prediction residual). Such pitch synchronous pitch modification techniques need a priori pitch marking of the synthesis speech database using techniques such as epoch extraction using dynamic plosion index applied on the integrated linear prediction residual of the voiced regions of speech. In general, prosody remains a challenge for speech synthesizers, and is an active research topic.\nHardware and software systems.\nPopular systems offering speech synthesis as a built-in capability.\nTexas Instruments.\nIn the early 1980s, TI was known as a pioneer in speech synthesis, and a highly popular plug-in speech synthesizer module was available for the TI-99/4 and 4A. Speech synthesizers were offered free with the purchase of a number of cartridges and were used by many TI-written video games (games offered with speech during this promotion included \"Alpiner\" and \"Parsec\"). The synthesizer uses a variant of linear predictive coding and has a small in-built vocabulary. The original intent was to release small cartridges that plugged directly into the synthesizer unit, which would increase the device's built-in vocabulary. However, the success of software text-to-speech in the Terminal Emulator II cartridge canceled that plan.\nMattel.\nThe Mattel Intellivision game console offered the Intellivoice Voice Synthesis module in 1982. It included the SP0256 Narrator speech synthesizer chip on a removable cartridge. The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and this was utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed could be stored inside the cartridge itself. The data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify the behavior of the chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples.\nSAM.\nAlso released in 1982, Software Automatic Mouth was the first commercial all-software voice synthesis program. It was later used as the basis for Macintalk. The program was available for non-Macintosh Apple computers (including the Apple II, and the Lisa), various Atari models and the Commodore 64. The Apple version preferred additional hardware that contained DACs, although it could instead use the computer's one-bit audio output (with the addition of much distortion) if the card was not present. The Atari made use of the embedded POKEY audio chip. Speech playback on the Atari normally disabled interrupt requests and shut down the ANTIC chip during vocal output. The audible output is extremely distorted speech when the screen is on. The Commodore 64 made use of the 64's embedded SID audio chip.\nAtari.\nArguably, the first speech system integrated into an operating system was the circa 1983 unreleased Atari 1400XL/1450XL computers. These used the Votrax SC01 chip and a finite-state machine to enable World English Spelling text-to-speech synthesis.\nThe Atari ST computers were sold with \"stspeech.tos\" on floppy disk.\nApple.\nThe first speech system integrated into an operating system that shipped in quantity was Apple Computer's MacInTalk. The software was licensed from third-party developers Joseph Katz and Mark Barton (later, SoftVoice, Inc.) and was featured during the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh computer. This January demo required 512 kilobytes of RAM memory. As a result, it could not run in the 128 kilobytes of RAM the first Mac actually shipped with. So, the demo was accomplished with a prototype 512k Mac, although those in attendance were not told of this and the synthesis demo created considerable excitement for the Macintosh. In the early 1990s Apple expanded its capabilities offering system wide text-to-speech support. With the introduction of faster PowerPC-based computers they included higher quality voice sampling. Apple also introduced speech recognition into its systems which provided a fluid command set. More recently, Apple has added sample-based voices. Starting as a curiosity, the speech system of Apple Macintosh has evolved into a fully supported program, PlainTalk, for people with vision problems. VoiceOver was for the first time featured in 2005 in Mac OS X Tiger (10.4). During 10.4 (Tiger) and first releases of 10.5 (Leopard) there was only one standard voice shipping with Mac OS X. Starting with 10.6 (Snow Leopard), the user can choose out of a wide range list of multiple voices. VoiceOver voices feature the taking of realistic-sounding breaths between sentences, as well as improved clarity at high read rates over PlainTalk. Mac OS X also includes say, a command-line based application that converts text to audible speech. The AppleScript Standard Additions includes a say verb that allows a script to use any of the installed voices and to control the pitch, speaking rate and modulation of the spoken text.\nAmazon.\nUsed in Alexa and as Software as a Service in AWS (from 2017).\nAmigaOS.\nThe second operating system to feature advanced speech synthesis capabilities was AmigaOS, introduced in 1985. The voice synthesis was licensed by Commodore International from SoftVoice, Inc., who also developed the original MacinTalk text-to-speech system. It featured a complete system of voice emulation for American English, with both male and female voices and \"stress\" indicator markers, made possible through the Amiga's audio chipset. The synthesis system was divided into a translator library which converted unrestricted English text into a standard set of phonetic codes and a narrator device which implemented a formant model of speech generation.. AmigaOS also featured a high-level \"Speak Handler\", which allowed command-line users to redirect text output to speech. Speech synthesis was occasionally used in third-party programs, particularly word processors and educational software. The synthesis software remained largely unchanged from the first AmigaOS release and Commodore eventually removed speech synthesis support from AmigaOS 2.1 onward.\nDespite the American English phoneme limitation, an unofficial version with multilingual speech synthesis was developed. This made use of an enhanced version of the translator library which could translate a number of languages, given a set of rules for each language.\nMicrosoft Windows.\nModern Windows desktop systems can use SAPI 4 and SAPI 5 components to support speech synthesis and speech recognition. SAPI 4.0 was available as an optional add-on for Windows 95 and Windows 98. Windows 2000 added Narrator, a text-to-speech utility for people who have visual impairment. Third-party programs such as JAWS for Windows, Window-Eyes, Non-visual Desktop Access, Supernova and System Access can perform various text-to-speech tasks such as reading text aloud from a specified website, email account, text document, the Windows clipboard, the user's keyboard typing, etc. Not all programs can use speech synthesis directly. Some programs can use plug-ins, extensions or add-ons to read text aloud. Third-party programs are available that can read text from the system clipboard.\nMicrosoft Speech Server is a server-based package for voice synthesis and recognition. It is designed for network use with web applications and call centers.\nVotrax.\nFrom 1971 to 1996, Votrax produced a number of commercial speech synthesizer components. A Votrax synthesizer was included in the first generation Kurzweil Reading Machine for the Blind.\nText-to-speech systems.\nText-to-speech (TTS) refers to the ability of computers to read text aloud. A TTS engine converts written text to a phonemic representation, then converts the phonemic representation to waveforms that can be output as sound. TTS engines with different languages, dialects and specialized vocabularies are available through third-party publishers.\nAndroid.\nVersion 1.6 of Android added support for speech synthesis (TTS).\nInternet.\nCurrently, there are a number of applications, plugins and gadgets that can read messages directly from an e-mail client and web pages from a web browser or Google Toolbar. Some specialized software can narrate RSS-feeds. On one hand, online RSS-narrators simplify information delivery by allowing users to listen to their favourite news sources and to convert them to podcasts. On the other hand, on-line RSS-readers are available on almost any personal computer connected to the Internet. Users can download generated audio files to portable devices, e.g. with a help of podcast receiver, and listen to them while walking, jogging or commuting to work.\nA growing field in Internet based TTS is web-based assistive technology, e.g. 'Browsealoud' from a UK company and Readspeaker. It can deliver TTS functionality to anyone (for reasons of accessibility, convenience, entertainment or information) with access to a web browser. The non-profit project was created in 2006 to provide a similar web-based TTS interface to the Wikipedia.\nOther work is being done in the context of the W3C through the W3C Audio Incubator Group with the involvement of The BBC and Google Inc.\nOpen source.\nSome open-source software systems are available, such as:\nDigital sound-alikes.\nAt the 2018 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) researchers from Google presented the work 'Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis', which transfers learning from speaker verification to achieve text-to-speech synthesis, that can be made to sound almost like anybody from a speech sample of only 5 seconds.\nAlso researchers from Baidu Research presented a voice cloning system with similar aims at the 2018 NeurIPS conference, though the result is rather unconvincing.\nBy 2019 the digital sound-alikes found their way to the hands of criminals as Symantec researchers know of 3 cases where digital sound-alikes technology has been used for crime.\nThis increases the stress on the disinformation situation coupled with the facts that \nSpeech synthesis markup languages.\nA number of markup languages have been established for the rendition of text as speech in an XML-compliant format. The most recent is Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), which became a W3C recommendation in 2004. Older speech synthesis markup languages include Java Speech Markup Language (JSML) and SABLE. Although each of these was proposed as a standard, none of them have been widely adopted.\nSpeech synthesis markup languages are distinguished from dialogue markup languages. VoiceXML, for example, includes tags related to speech recognition, dialogue management and touchtone dialing, in addition to text-to-speech markup.\nApplications.\nSpeech synthesis has long been a vital assistive technology tool and its application in this area is significant and widespread. It allows environmental barriers to be removed for people with a wide range of disabilities. The longest application has been in the use of screen readers for people with visual impairment, but text-to-speech systems are now commonly used by people with dyslexia and other reading disabilities as well as by pre-literate children. They are also frequently employed to aid those with severe speech impairment usually through a dedicated voice output communication aid. Work to personalize a synthetic voice to better match a person's personality or historical voice is becoming available. A noted application, of speech synthesis, was the Kurzweil Reading Machine for the Blind which incorporated text-to-phonetics software based on work from Haskins Laboratories and a black-box synthesizer built by Votrax.\nSpeech synthesis techniques are also used in entertainment productions such as games and animations. In 2007, Animo Limited announced the development of a software application package based on its speech synthesis software FineSpeech, explicitly geared towards customers in the entertainment industries, able to generate narration and lines of dialogue according to user specifications. The application reached maturity in 2008, when NEC Biglobe announced a web service that allows users to create phrases from the voices of characters from the Japanese anime series \"\". 15.ai has been frequently used for content creation in various fandoms, including the , the \"Team Fortress 2\" fandom, the \"Portal\" fandom, and the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" fandom.\nText-to-speech for disability and impaired communication aids have become widely available. Text-to-speech is also finding new applications; for example, speech synthesis combined with speech recognition allows for interaction with mobile devices via natural language processing interfaces. Some users have also created AI virtual assistants using 15.ai and external voice control software.\nText-to-speech is also used in second language acquisition. Voki, for instance, is an educational tool created by Oddcast that allows users to create their own talking avatar, using different accents. They can be emailed, embedded on websites or shared on social media.\nContent creators have used voice cloning tools to recreate their voices for podcasts, narration, and comedy shows. Publishers and authors have also used such software to narrate audiobooks and newsletters. Another area of application is AI video creation with talking heads. Webapps and video editors like Elai.io or Synthesia allow users to create video content involving AI avatars, who are made to speak using text-to-speech technology.\nSpeech synthesis is a valuable computational aid for the analysis and assessment of speech disorders. A voice quality synthesizer, developed by Jorge C. Lucero et al. at the University of Bras\u00edlia, simulates the physics of phonation and includes models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, airflow noise and laryngeal asymmetries. The synthesizer has been used to mimic the timbre of dysphonic speakers with controlled levels of roughness, breathiness and strain.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nutella is manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero and was introduced in 1964, although its first iteration dates to 1963.\nHistory.\nPietro Ferrero owned a bakery in Alba, an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the initial batch of \"Pasta Gianduja\", derived from \"gianduja\". Originally sold as a solid block, Ferrero started to sell a creamy, spreadable version in 1951 as \"Supercrema gianduja\".\nIn 1963, Ferrero's son Michele Ferrero, alongside Francesco Rivella, revamped \"Supercrema gianduja\" with the intention of marketing it throughout Europe. Its composition was modified, and it was renamed \"Nutella\". The first jar of Nutella left the factory in Alba on April 20, 1964. The product was an instant success. The global proliferation of Nutella occurred in the context of the Italian economic miracle. Popular both among children and adults, leftists held it in esteem as the Italian response to the American peanut butter. In 1983, Nutella was released in America for the first time.\nIn 2012, French senator Yves Daudigny proposed a tax increase on palm oil from \u20ac100 to \u20ac400 per tonne. At 20 percent, palm oil is one of Nutella's main ingredients, and the tax was dubbed \"the Nutella tax\" in the media. That year, Ferrero settled a class action lawsuit in the US that alleged their advertisements misrepresented Nutella's healthiness by paying $3 million and removing advertising featuring the health claims.\nOn 14 May 2014, Poste Italiane issued a 50th anniversary Nutella commemorative stamp. The 70 Euro cent stamp was designed by Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato and features a jar of Nutella on a golden background. Ferrero held a Nutella Day on 17 and 18 May to celebrate the anniversary.\nIngredients.\nThe main ingredients of Nutella are sugar and palm oil (greater than 50%). It also contains 13% hazelnuts, cocoa solids, and skimmed milk. In the United States and the United Kingdom, Nutella contains soy products. Nutella is marketed as \"hazelnut cream\" in many countries. Under Italian law, it cannot be labelled as a \"chocolate cream\", as it does not meet minimum cocoa solids concentration criteria. Each 220g jar of Nutella uses approximately 50 hazelnuts. Ferrero uses 25 percent of the global supply of hazelnuts, though not all of this is used exclusively in Nutella.\nIn November 2017, the company modified the recipe slightly, increasing the sugar and skimmed milk powder content. Since the colour of the product is lighter in tone, the Hamburg Consumer Protection Center estimated that the cocoa content was also reduced. \nThe traditional Piedmont recipe, \"gianduja\", is a mixture containing approximately 71.5% hazelnut paste and 19.5% chocolate. Nutella was developed in Piedmont, Italy, due to a lack of cocoa beans after post-war rationing reduced the availability of the raw material.\nProcessing.\nNutella is described as a chocolate and hazelnut spread, although it is mostly made of sugar and palm oil. The manufacturing process for this food item is very similar to a generic production of chocolate spread. Nutella is made from sugar, modified palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa powder, skimmed milk powder, whey powder, soy lecithin, and vanillin.\nThe process of making this spread begins with the extraction of cocoa powder from the cocoa bean. These cocoa beans are harvested from cocoa trees and are left to dry for about ten days before being shipped for processing. Typically, cocoa beans contain approximately 50 percent of cocoa butter; therefore, they must be roasted to reduce the cocoa bean into a liquid form. This step is not sufficient for turning cocoa bean into a chocolate paste because it solidifies at room temperature and would not be spreadable. After the initial roast, the liquid paste is sent to presses, which are used to squeeze the butter out of the cocoa bean. The final products are round discs of chocolate made of pure compressed cocoa. The cocoa butter is transferred elsewhere so it can be used in other products.\nThe second process involves the hazelnuts. Once the hazelnuts have arrived at the processing plant, a quality control is issued to inspect the nuts so they are suitable for processing. A guillotine is used to chop the nuts to inspect the interior. After this process, the hazelnuts are cleaned and roasted. A second quality control is issued by a computer-controlled blast of air, which removes the bad nuts from the batch. This ensures that each jar of Nutella is uniform in its look and taste. Approximately 50 hazelnuts can be found in each jar of Nutella, as claimed by the company.\nThe cocoa powder is then mixed with the hazelnuts along with sugar, vanillin and skim milk in a large tank, until it becomes a paste-like spread. Modified palm oil is then added to help retain the solid phase of the Nutella at room temperature, which substitutes for the butter found in the cocoa bean. Whey powder is then added to the mix to act as a binder for the paste. Whey powder is an additive commonly used in spreads to prevent the coagulation of the product, because it stabilizes the fat emulsions. Similarly, lecithin, a form of a fatty substance found in animal and plant tissues, is added to help emulsify the paste, as it promotes homogenized mixing of the different ingredients, allowing the paste to become spreadable. It also aids the lipophilic properties of the cocoa powder, which, again, keeps the product from separating. Vanillin is added to enhance the sweetness of the chocolate.\nNutrition.\nNutella contains 10.4 percent of saturated fat and 58% of processed sugar by weight. A two-tablespoon (37-gram) serving of Nutella contains 200 calories, including 99 calories from 11 grams of fat (3.5\u00a0g of which are saturated) and 80 calories from 21 grams of sugar. The spread also contains 15\u00a0mg of sodium and 2\u00a0g of protein per serving (for reference a Canadian serving size is 1 tablespoon or 19 grams).\nProduction.\nNutella is produced in various facilities. In the North American market, it is produced at a plant in Brantford, Ontario, Canada and more recently in San Jos\u00e9 Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico.\nFor Australia and New Zealand, Nutella has been manufactured in Lithgow, New South Wales, since the late 1970s.\nTwo of the four Ferrero plants in Italy produce Nutella, in Alba, Piedmont, and in Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi in Campania. In France, a production facility is located in Villers-\u00c9calles. For Eastern Europe (including Southeast Europe, Poland, Turkey, Czech Republic and Slovakia) and South Africa, it is produced in Warsaw and Manisa. For Germany and northern Europe, Nutella is produced at the Ferrero plant in Stadtallendorf, which has been in existence since 1956. Nutella entered the Russian market and also has a production plant in Vladimir.\nFerrero also has a plant in Po\u00e7os de Caldas, Brazil, which supplies the Brazilian market, with part of the production being exported overseas. It is also manufactured in Turkey and exported to countries such as India.\nGlobal production in 2013 was about 350,000 tonnes. As of 2015, it was sold in 75 countries.\nUse.\nIn Italy, one of the most common ways to consume it is by spreading it on slices of \"filone\" (a typical Italian loaf bread) or between two or more slices of sandwich bread (\"pancarr\u00e8 e Nutella\"). These two uses are very typical among Italian children as an afternoon snack or during school recess. It is also traditionally used as a filling in \"cornetti\", \"bomboloni\", and crepes, or in recipes such as \"sbriciolona alla Nutella\" and \"nutellotti\", soft cookies with a warm Nutella center.\nWithin Europe, Nutella is a popular topping for pancakes among children in Ireland, often fills the peach-shaped \"breskvice\" cookies in Croatia, replacing the traditional jam and is spread atop baguettes in France, creating open sandwiches eaten with coffee for breakfast. Outside of Europe, Nutella is used to fill sandwiches in Senegal, which are then eaten as an afternoon snack.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hawkins", "text": "American singer\nSophie Ballantine Hawkins (born November 1, 1964) is an American singer-songwriter. Born in New York City, she attended the Manhattan School of Music for a year as a percussionist before leaving to pursue a music career. In the 1990s, she achieved critical and commercial success with her first two albums, producing a string of single hits including \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\", \"Right Beside You\", and \"As I Lay Me Down\". A dispute with her record label Sony Music over her third album, \"Timbre\", led her to establish her own independent label, Trumpet Swan Productions, which has published her subsequent recordings.\nHawkins is a long-time supporter of animal rights and environmental causes. She is also a social and political activist, supporting events promoting women in music and LGBTQ rights.\nCareer.\nHawkins's debut album, \"Tongues and Tails,\" was released in 1992. It achieved both worldwide commercial success and critical acclaim, earning her a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist in 1993. The single \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" went to number 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart in the US and was also a Top 20 hit in the UK, peaking at number 14. Hawkins was asked to perform Bob Dylan's \"I Want You\", which she had covered on \"Tongues and Tails,\" for the 1992 Madison Square Garden concert honoring Dylan's 30th anniversary as a musician; this was later released as \"The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration\", but her performance was omitted.\n\"Whaler,\" her second album, was released in 1994. Produced by Stephen Lipson, it also contained a US top 10 hit, \"As I Lay Me Down\", and was certified gold. Three singles from the album made the UK Top 40, including \"Right Beside You\", which peaked at number 13. The same year, Hawkins posed nude for \"Interview\". As she explained to Ed Rampell in an interview for \"Q\" magazine, she met the photographer, Bruce Weber, and was asked if she would do a photoshoot with him. While she had provided her own clothes, Weber deliberately had her wear an unflattering dress as part of his plan to convince Hawkins to disrobe during the shoot.\nA 1998 documentary by Gigi Gaston, \"The Cream Will Rise,\" followed Hawkins during one of her tours and captured her struggle to deal with past troubles with her family, including her mother and brother. Music by Hawkins was included throughout the film.\nAlso in 1998, Hawkins's record company, Sony Music, delayed the release of her third album. Its executives were unhappy with the finished product and wanted Hawkins to rework some of the material. In particular, they insisted that Hawkins remove a banjo track from one of the songs. Unwilling to compromise her artistic integrity, Hawkins refused to accommodate them. After a lengthy battle between Hawkins and the company, the album, \"Timbre,\" was eventually released in 1999, though Sony declined to promote it. Hawkins subsequently left the label and founded her own label, Trumpet Swan Productions. In 2001, \"Timbre\" was re-released on Hawkins's label, now as a two-disc set that contained new songs, demos, remixes, and videos. Her first independently recorded and released album, \"Wilderness,\" was released in 2004.\nIn 2012, Hawkins starred as Janis Joplin in the play, \"Room 105,\" which was written and directed by her longtime girlfriend and manager, Gigi Gaston. After another long hiatus, she released her fifth album of all-new material in 2012, titled \"The Crossing\".\nOn April 4, 2013, Hawkins appeared as herself on the TV series \"Community\" in the episode \"Herstory of Dance\", performing \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" and \"As I Lay Me Down\" during the community college's \"Sophie B. Hawkins Dance,\" so named because the character \u201cBritta\u201d confused her with Susan B. Anthony in an attempt to compete with a Sadie Hawkins Dance.\nIn 2019, Hawkins completed a sold-out tour around the U.S.; the same year she also appeared on the German TV show \"Night Grooves\", singing several songs, discussing her past, and showing off her drumming talent.\nPersonal life.\nHawkins has two children, Dashiell (b. 2008) and Esther Ballantine (b. 2015). Esther had been conceived 20 years earlier and frozen as an embryo.\nIn an interview with Howard Stern, Hawkins said that she identified as omnisexual. Although there were rumors she had dated Martina Navratilova and Jodie Foster, she denied those, saying, \"I've never met any of the women I'm supposed to have had affairs with.\"\nIn 2012, Hawkins and Gigi Gaston shared a house in Venice, California.\nPolitics.\nIn August 2007, Hawkins headlined the first Los Angeles Women's Music Festival in support of its dual agenda of supporting animal rescue groups and promoting and supporting female musicians. Hawkins is a long-time supporter of animal rights.\nIn February 2008, Hawkins re-recorded her song \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" as \"Damn, We Wish You Were President\" in support of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Hawkins also wrote in her blog, \"Hillary Clinton's achievements come from her heart. She has initiated so much positive change for families, children, victims of crime and the environment in her struggle for the forward movement of America and the working people of this nation.\"\nIn May 2010, Hawkins began supporting Waterkeeper Alliance, an organization of on-the-water advocates who patrol and protect more than 100,000 miles of rivers, streams and coastlines in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. She donated all of the proceeds of her single \"The Land, the Sea, and the Sky\" to the organization.\nIn February 2011, Hawkins performed at the Big Gay Party event staged by GOProud, an organization of gay conservatives, as part of the year's Conservative Political Action Conference festivities. In an after-show interview in the reason.tv documentary \"Liberal in Bed, Conservative in the Head: Sophie B. Hawkins\", Hawkins gave her views on issues such as gun ownership, the free market, limited government and identity politics.\nIn 2017, Hawkins lent her voice in support of LGBTQ youth suicide prevention organization The Trevor Project's 20th Anniversary celebration video campaign.\nAwards and nominations.\n!

The format was widely adopted in all of Asia (except for Japan and South Korea), superseding the VHS and Betamax systems in those regions until DVD-Video became more affordable in the 2000s.\nThe format is a standard digital data format for storing video on a compact disc. VCD discs/disc images are playable in dedicated VCD players and widely playable in most DVD players, personal computers and some video game consoles with an optical disc drive that is programmed to understand VCD discs. \nThe Video CD standard was created in 1993\nby Sony, Philips, Matsushita and JVC; it is referred to as the White Book standard. The MPEG-1 format was also released that same year.\nBrief history.\nLaserDisc was first available on the market, in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1978. This disc could hold an hour of analog audio and video (digital audio was added a few years later) on each side. The LaserDisc provided picture quality nearly double the resolution of VHS tape and analog audio quality far superior to cheap mono VHS recorders (although the difference to the more expensive VHS HiFi stereo recorders was minuscule).\nPhilips later teamed up with Sony to develop a new type of disc, called the compact disc or CD. Introduced in 1982 in Japan (1983 in the U.S. and Europe), the CD is about in diameter, and is single-sided. The format was initially designed to store digitized sound and proved to be a success in the music industry.\nA few years later, Philips decided to give CDs the ability to produce video, utilizing the same technology as its LaserDisc counterpart. This led to the creation of CD Video (CD-V) in 1987. However, the disc's small size significantly impeded the ability to store analog video; thus only 5 minutes of picture information could fit on the disc's surface (despite the fact that the audio was digital). Therefore, CD-V distribution was limited to featuring music videos, and it was soon discontinued by 1991.\nBy the early 1990s engineers were able to digitize and compress video signals, greatly improving storage efficiency. Because this new format could hold 74/80 minutes of audio and video on a 650/700MB disc, releasing movies on compact discs finally became a reality. Extra capacity was obtained by sacrificing the error correction (it was believed that minor errors in the datastream would go unnoticed by the viewer). This format was named Video CD or VCD.\nVCD enjoyed a brief period of success, with a few major feature films being released in the format (usually as a 2 disc set). However the introduction of the CD-R disc and associated recorders stopped the release of feature films in their tracks because the VCD format had no means of preventing unauthorized (and perfect) copies from being made. Despite this, , VCDs were still being produced and released in several countries in Asia with additional copy-protection.\nThe development of more sophisticated, higher capacity optical disc formats yielded the DVD format, released only a few years later with a copy protection mechanism. DVD players use lasers that are of shorter wavelength than those used on CDs, allowing the recorded pits to be smaller, so that more information can be stored. The DVD was so successful that it eventually pushed VHS out of the video market once suitable recorders became widely available. Nevertheless, VCDs made considerable inroads into developing nations, where they are still in use today due to their cheaper manufacturing and retail costs.\nTechnical specifications.\nStructure.\nVideo CDs comply with the CD-i Bridge format, and are authored using tracks in CD-ROM XA mode. The first track of a VCD is in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 1, and stores metadata and menu information inside an ISO 9660 filesystem. This track may also contain other non-essential files, and is shown by operating systems when loading the disc. This track can be absent from a VCD, which would still work but would not allow it to be properly displayed in computers.\nThe rest of the tracks are usually in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 and contain video and audio multiplexed in an MPEG program stream (MPEG-PS) container, but CD audio tracks are also allowed. Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1). This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1. It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed. This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing CD drive technology, specifically the earliest \"1x\" speed CD drives.\nVideo.\nVideo specifications\nAlthough many DVD video players support playback of VCDs, VCD video is only compatible with the DVD-Video standard if encoded at 29.97 frames per second or 25 frames per second. \nThe 352\u00d7240 and 352\u00d7288 (or SIF) resolutions, when compared to the CCIR 601 specifications (defining the appropriate parameters for digital encoding of NTSC and PAL/SECAM TV signals), are reduced by half in all aspects: height, width, frame-rate, and chrominance.\nAudio.\nAudio specifications\nAs with most CD-based formats, VCD audio is incompatible with the DVD-Video standard due to a difference in sampling frequency; DVDs require 48\u00a0kHz, whereas VCDs use 44.1\u00a0kHz.\nAdvantages of compression.\nBy compressing both the video and audio streams, a VCD is able to hold 74 minutes of picture and sound information, the same duration as a standard 74 minute audio CD. The MPEG-1 compression used records mostly the differences between successive video frames, rather than write out each frame individually. Similarly, the audio frequency range is limited to those sounds most clearly heard by the human ear.\nOther features.\nThe VCD standard also features the option of DVD-quality still images/slide shows with audio, at resolutions of 704\u00d7480 (480i, analog NTSC compatible) or 704\u00d7576 (576i, analog PAL/SECAM compatible). Version 2.0 also adds the playback control (PBC), featuring a simple menu like DVD-Video.\nSimilar formats.\nCD-i Digital Video.\nShortly before the advent of White Book VCD, Philips started releasing movies in the Green Book CD-i format, calling the subformat CD-i Digital Video (CD-i DV). While these used a similar format (MPEG-1), due to minor differences between the standards these discs are not compatible with VCD players. Philips' CD-i players with the Full Motion Video MPEG-1 decoder cartridge would play both formats. Approximately 30 CD-i DV titles were released before the company switched to the current VCD format for publishing movies in 1994.\nXVCD.\nXVCD (eXtended Video CD) is the name generally given to any format that stores MPEG-1 video on a compact disc in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2, but does not strictly follow the VCD standard in terms of the encoding of the video or audio.\nA normal VCD is encoded to MPEG-1 at a constant bit rate (CBR), so all scenes are required to use exactly the same data rate, regardless of complexity. However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a variable bit rate (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower data rates. Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.\nTo further reduce the data rate without significantly reducing quality, the size of the GOP can be increased, a different MPEG-1 quantization matrix can be used, the maximum data rate can be exceeded, and the bit rate of the MP2 audio can be reduced or even be swapped out completely for MP3 audio. These changes can be advantageous for those who want to either maximize video quality, or use fewer discs.\nKVCD.\nKVCD (K Video Compression Dynamics) is an XVCD variant that requires the use of a proprietary quantization matrix, created by Karl Wagner and made available for non-commercial use. In addition to standard VCD resolutions, KVCD allows for non-standard resolutions like 528\u00d7480/576, though hardware support for KVCDs authored with these resolutions is limited.\nDVCD.\nDVCD or Double VCD is a method to accommodate longer videos on a CD. A non-standard CD is overburned to include up to 100 minutes of video. However, some CD-ROM drives and players have problems reading these CDs, mostly because the groove spacing is outside specifications and the player's laser servo is unable to track it.\nDVI.\nDVI (Digital Video Interactive) is a compression technique that stored 72 minutes of video on a CD-ROM. In 1998, Intel acquired the technology from RCA's Sarnoff Research Labs. DVI never caught on.\nSVCD.\nSuper Video CD is a format intended to be the successor of VCD, offering better quality of image and sound. The format uses MPEG-2 video at 480x480 or 480x576 and supports multiple bitrate and channel options for encoding audio.\nAdoption.\nIn North America.\nVideo CDs were unable to gain acceptance as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over. The advent of recordable CDs, inexpensive recorders, and compatible DVD players spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly. DVD-Video, with its longer run time and much higher quality, quickly overshadowed VCD in areas that could afford it. In addition many early DVD players could not read recordable (CD-R) media, and this limited the compatibility of home-made VCDs.\nIn Asia.\nThe VCD format was very popular throughout Asia\n(except Japan and South Korea) in the late 1990s through the 2000s, with 8 million VCD players sold in China in 1997 alone,\nand more than half of all Chinese households owning at least one VCD player by 2005. However, popularity has declined over the years, as the number of Hong Kong factories that produced VCDs dropped from 98 in 1999 to 26 in 2012.\nThis popularity was due, in part, to most households not already owning VCRs when VCDs were introduced, the low price of the players, their tolerance of high humidity (a notable problem for VHS tapes), easy storage and maintenance, and the lower-cost media. Western sources have cited unauthorized content as a principal incentive for VCD player ownership.\nVCDs are often produced and sold in Asian countries and regions, such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In many Asian countries, major Hollywood studios (and Asian home video distributors) have licensed companies to officially produce and distribute the VCDs, such as Intercontinental Video Ltd. of Hong Kong, Sunny Video and Speedy Video in Malaysia, Vision Interprima Pictures in Indonesia, CVD International, APS Intermusic Co. Ltd and Pacific Marketing and Entertainment Group in Thailand, Excel Home Entertainment in India, Berjaya-HVN and InnoForm Media in both Malaysia and Singapore, Scorpio East Entertainment in Singapore, as well as Viva Video, Magnavision Home Video, and C-Interactive Digital Entertainment in the Philippines. Legal Video CDs can often be found in established video stores and major book outlets in most Asian countries. They are typically packaged in jewel cases like commercial CDs, though higher-profile films may be released in keep cases, differentiated by the VCD logo.\nIn Asia, the use of VCDs as carriers for karaoke music is very common. One channel would feature a mono track with music and singing, another channel a pure instrumental version for karaoke singing. Prior to this, karaoke music was carried on LaserDiscs.\nWorldwide trends.\nVCD's growth had slowed in areas that could afford DVD-Video, which offered most of the same advantages, as well as better picture quality\n(higher resolution with fewer digital compression artifacts) due to its larger storage capacity. However, VCD had simultaneously seen significant growth in emerging economies such as India, Indonesia and most countries in Africa and South America as a low-cost alternative to DVD. As of 2004, the worldwide popularity of VCD was increasing.\nCompared with VHS.\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to VHS video.\nPoorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be of lower quality than VHS video, for example exhibiting VCD block artifacts (rather than the analog noise seen in VHS sources), but does not deteriorate further with each use. Producing video CDs involves stripping out high- and low-frequency sounds from the video, resulting in lower audio quality than VHS. While both formats need fast-forwarding to find certain scenes, rewinding to the beginning upon reaching the end is not required in VCD. The resolution is just half below that of common VHS resolution.\nVideo CDs did not come with closed captioning (on-screen text to aid viewers with hearing problems). When watching a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1\u00bc hours), the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer had to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs were played on a VCD changer that could hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS tape could hold 3.5 hours of continuous video.\nCompared with DVD.\nWhen playing a DVD, the viewer is taken to a main menu which gives them options (watch the feature film, view \"deleted scenes\", play some special applications, etc.). VCDs are usually straightforward; playing them often goes directly to the video with extras (mostly trailers and commercials) taking place before or after it, like on a VHS cassette.\nSubtitles are found on many Asian VCDs but cannot be removed, unlike on DVDs. The subtitles are embedded on the video during the encoding process (\"hardsubbed\"). It is not uncommon to find a VCD with subtitles for two languages.\nThough the VCD technology can support it, most films carried on VCDs do not contain chapters, requiring the viewer to fast-forward to resume the program after playback has been stopped. This is mostly because VCD technology is able to start playback at a chapter point but there is nothing to signal to the player that the chapter has changed during a program. This can be confusing for the user as the player will indicate that it is still playing chapter 1 when it has played through to chapter 2 or later. Pressing the Next button would cause playback from the beginning of chapter 2. However, preview material is sometimes stored in a separate chapter, followed by a single chapter for the film.\nVCDs are often bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have an option to play only the left or right audio channel. On some films, they feature English on the left audio channel and Cantonese on the right; more commonly Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it is limited to two languages, due to there being only two audio channels (left and right). The audio track effectively becomes monaural.\nVCDs' most noticeable disadvantage compared to DVD is image quality, due both to the more aggressive compression necessary to fit video into such a small capacity as well as to the compression method used. Additionally, VCD movie surround sound capability is limited to Dolby Surround matrixed within the stereo tracks, while DVDs are capable of six channels of discrete surround sound via Dolby Digital AC-3.\nHardware and software support.\nEarly devices supporting Video CD playback include the Philips CD-i systems and the Amiga CD-32 (albeit via an optional decoder card). Disc playback is also available both natively and as an option on some CD- and DVD-based video game consoles, including the original PlayStation (only on the SCPH-5903 model).\nEarly software supporting Video CD playback include XingMPEG. Early PC hardware supporting Video CD playback include proprietary VCD decoder card. Later, because the introduction of Pentium II processor which supports MMX extension, and later graphics cards had included video decoding function, the use of VCD decoder card declined.\nVLC is a free, open-source media player software which supports VCD on Windows, MacOS, Linux and BSD.\nWindows Media Player prior to version 9 does not support playing VCD directly. Windows Vista added native support of VCD along with DVD-Video and can launch the preferred application upon insertion. The disc format is also supported natively by Media Player Classic, VLC Media Player and MPlayer. Discs may include software for playing back VCD on operating systems that do not support it natively, which can be bundled by the authoring software.\nQuickTime Player also does not support playing VCD directly, though it can play the .DAT files (stored under \\MPEGAV for video and audio data) reliably, and plugins were available.\nDirect access playback support is available within Windows XP MCE, Windows Vista and newer (including Windows 10), classic Mac OS, BSD, macOS, and Linux among others, either directly or with updates and compatible software.\nMost DVD players are compatible with VCDs, and VCD-only players are available throughout Asia, and online through many shopping sites. Some older Blu-ray and HD-DVD players also retained support, as do CBHD players as well. However, most Blu-ray players, most vehicle audio with DVD/Blu-ray support, Xbox family, and Sony PlayStation family cannot play VCDs because the player software does not have support for MPEG-1 video and audio; the player software lacks the ability to read MPEG-1 stream in DAT files alongside MPEG-1 stream in standard MPEG, AVI, and Matroska files; or the player lacks the ability to read CD-ROM XA discs. Some Laserdisc players that were released in the late 90s support VCD, as does the Sony PS1 model SCPH-5903 marketed in Southeast Asia.\nAuthoring software for VCD and SVCD includes Nero Video for Windows and VCD Imager for Linux.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42806", "revid": "8747689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42806", "title": "Cyclone", "text": "Large scale rotating air mass\nIn meteorology, a cyclone () is a large air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure, counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as viewed from above (opposite to an anticyclone). Cyclones are characterized by inward-spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure.\nCyclones have also been seen on planets other than the Earth, such as Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune. Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification. \nExtratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.\nWeather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities, and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. Warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.\nTropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), in the Indian and south Pacific oceans it is called a cyclone, and in the northwestern Pacific it is called a typhoon.\nThe growth of instability in the vortices is not universal. For example, the size, intensity, moist-convection, surface evaporation, the value of potential temperature at each potential height can affect the nonlinear evolution of a vortex.\nName.\nThe term \"cyclone\" comes from the Greek word (, meaning \"circle\" or \"ring\" in Ancient Greek), due to the spiraling nature of a cyclone's winds. The word was coined by Henry Piddington, an official in the British East India Company who published 40 papers dealing with tropical storms from Calcutta between 1836 and 1855 in \"The Journal of the Asiatic Society\".\nStructure.\nThere are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones. A cyclone is a low-pressure area. A cyclone's center (often known in a mature tropical cyclone as the eye), is the area of lowest atmospheric pressure in the region. Near the center, the pressure gradient force (from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone) and the force from the Coriolis effect must be in an approximate balance, or the cyclone would collapse on itself as a result of the difference in pressure.\nBecause of the Coriolis effect, the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the fastest winds relative to the surface of the Earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one; the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere. \nFormation.\nCyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere. Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in the development of some sort of cyclone.\nTropical cyclones form as a result of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas\u2014anticyclogenesis.\nA surface low can form in a variety of ways. Topography can create a surface low. Mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm-core. The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest. Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator on the west side of the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and \"catches up\" with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser cold air mass. The cold front over takes the warm front, and reduces the length of the warm front. At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a trowal.\nTropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a tropical cyclone. The mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid-latitude cyclones. Tropical cyclogenesis, the development of a warm-core cyclone, begins with significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment. There are two main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, and low vertical wind shear. \nAn average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least Category\u00a03 intensity on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale).\nSynoptic types.\nThe following types of cyclones are identifiable in synoptic charts.\nSurface-based types.\nThere are three main types of surface-based cyclones: extratropical cyclones, subtropical cyclones and tropical cyclones.\nExtratropical cyclone.\nAn extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale low-pressure weather system that does not have tropical characteristics, as it is connected with fronts and horizontal gradients (rather than vertical) in temperature and dew point otherwise known as \"baroclinic zones\".\n\"Extratropical\" is applied to cyclones outside the tropics, in the middle latitudes. These systems may also be described as \"mid-latitude cyclones\" due to their area of formation, or \"post-tropical cyclones\" when a tropical cyclone has moved (extratropical transition) beyond the tropics. They are often described as \"depressions\" or \"lows\" by weather forecasters and the general public. These are the everyday phenomena that, along with anticyclones, drive weather over much of the Earth.\nAlthough extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, and as a result develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.\nPolar low.\nA polar low is a small-scale, short-lived atmospheric low-pressure system (depression) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller. However, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean.\nDuring winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach move over open waters, deep convection forms, which allows polar low development to become possible. The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than and exist for no more than a couple of days. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least .\nSubtropical.\nA subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center in the United States officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.\nSince they form from extratropical cyclones, which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics, the sea surface temperatures required is around 23\u00a0degrees Celsius (73\u00a0\u00b0F) for their formation, which is three degrees Celsius (5\u00a0\u00b0F) lower than for tropical cyclones. This means that subtropical cyclones are more likely to form outside the traditional bounds of the hurricane season. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm.\nTropical.\nA tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain. A tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist air rises, resulting in condensation of water vapour contained in the moist air. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters, European windstorms, and polar lows, leading to their classification as \"warm core\" storm systems.\nThe term \"tropical\" refers to both the geographic origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively in tropical regions of the globe, and their dependence on Maritime Tropical air masses for their formation. The term \"cyclone\" refers to the storms' cyclonic nature, with counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere. Depending on their location and strength, tropical cyclones are referred to by other names, such as hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply as a cyclone.\nWhile tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, they are also able to produce high waves and a damaging storm surge. Their winds increase the wave size, and in so doing they draw more heat and moisture into their system, thereby increasing their strength. They develop over large bodies of warm water, and hence lose their strength if they move over land. This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland. Storm surges are rises in sea level caused by the reduced pressure of the core that in effect \"sucks\" the water upward and from winds that in effect \"pile\" the water up. Storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastline. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions. They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes, which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism. As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's troposphere.\nMany tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.\nUpper level types.\nPolar cyclone.\nA polar, sub-polar, or Arctic cyclone (also known as a polar vortex) is a vast area of low pressure that strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer. A polar cyclone is a low-pressure weather system, usually spanning to , in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere, and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis acceleration acting on the air masses moving poleward at high altitude, causes a counterclockwise circulation at high altitude. The poleward movement of air originates from the air circulation of the Polar cell. The polar low is not driven by convection as are tropical cyclones, nor the cold and warm air mass interactions as are extratropical cyclones, but is an artifact of the global air movement of the Polar cell. The base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar cyclone has two centers on average. One center lies near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia. In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located near the edge of the Ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude. When the polar vortex is strong, its effect can be felt at the surface as a westerly wind (toward the east). When the polar cyclone is weak, significant cold outbreaks occur.\nTUTT cell.\nUnder specific circumstances, upper level cold lows can break off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT), which is located mid-ocean in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months. These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices, also known as TUTT cells or TUTT lows, usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and their bases generally do not extend below in altitude. A weak inverted surface trough within the trade wind is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core tropical cyclones. Upper cyclones and the upper troughs that trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.\nNon-synoptic types.\nThe following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts.\nMesocyclone.\nA mesocyclone is a vortex of air, to in diameter (the mesoscale of meteorology), within a convective storm. Air rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1,700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.\nDust devil.\nA dust devil is a type of vortex that involves debris such as dust being lifted upward into the air. Most dust devils are between and wide, and between and tall, although the strongest can be several thousand feet tall. Wind speed varies depending on the size of the dust devil; larger ones have winds of at least , reaching up to . Dust devils form from a warm surface during sunny days, often in an area where surface types change, and require the surrounding air to be unstable, dissipating when conditions become more stable; they therefore often from in deserts. They usually dissipate after only a few minutes, but stronger dust devils can last over an hour. Dust devils are smaller than tornadoes and are usually harmless, though stronger ones can destroy small structures. Dust devils have been found on Mars as well as on Earth.\nWaterspout.\nA waterspout is a columnar vortex forming over water that is, in its most common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.\nSteam devil.\nA steam devil is a gentle vortex over calm water or wet land that is made visible by rising water vapour.\nFire whirl.\nA fire whirl \u2013 also colloquially known as a fire devil, fire tornado, firenado, or fire twister \u2013 is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash.\nOther planets.\nCyclones are not unique to Earth. Cyclonic storms are common on giant planets, such as the Small Dark Spot on Neptune. It is about one third the diameter of the Great Dark Spot and received the nickname \"Wizard's Eye\" because it looks like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud in the middle of the Wizard's Eye. Mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms. Jovian storms like the Great Red Spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms. However, this is inaccurate, as the Great Red Spot is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an anticyclone.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42808", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42808", "title": "Lignite", "text": "Soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock\nLignite (derived from Latin \"lignum\" meaning 'wood'), often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat. It has a carbon content around 25\u201335% and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content. When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture, which partially explains its low carbon content. Lignite is mined all around the world and is used almost exclusively as a fuel for steam-electric power generation.\nLignite combustion produces less heat for the amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur released than other ranks of coal. As a result, lignite is the most harmful coal to human health. Depending on the source, various toxic heavy metals, including naturally occurring radioactive materials, may be present in lignite and left over in the coal fly ash produced from its combustion, further increasing health risks.\nCharacteristics.\nLignite is brownish-black in color and has a carbon content of 60\u201370 percent on a dry ash-free basis. However, its inherent moisture content is sometimes as high as 75 percent and its ash content ranges from 6\u201319 percent, compared with 6\u201312 percent for bituminous coal. As a result, its carbon content on the as-received basis (i.e., containing both inherent moisture and mineral matter) is typically just 25-35 percent.\nThe energy content of lignite ranges from on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis. The energy content of lignite consumed in the United States averages , on the as-received basis. The energy content of lignite consumed in Victoria, Australia, averages on a net wet basis.\nLignite has a high content of volatile matter which makes it easier to convert into gas and liquid petroleum products than higher-ranking coals. Its high moisture content and susceptibility to spontaneous combustion can cause problems in transportation and storage. Processes which remove water from brown coal reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion to the same level as black coal, increase the calorific value of brown coal to a black coal equivalent fuel, and significantly reduce the emissions profile of 'densified' brown coal to a level similar to or better than most black coals. However, removing the moisture increases the cost of the final lignite fuel.\nLignite rapidly degrades when exposed to air, in a process called \"slacking\" (or \"slackening\").\nUses.\nMost lignite is used to generate electricity. However, small amounts are used in agriculture, in industry, and even, as \"jet\", in jewelry. Its historical use as fuel for home heating has continuously declined and is now of lower importance than its use to generate electricity.\nAs fuel.\nLignite is often found in thick beds located near the surface, making it inexpensive to mine. However, because of its low energy density, tendency to crumble, and typically high moisture content, brown coal is inefficient to transport and is not traded extensively on the world market compared with higher coal grades. It is often burned in power stations near the mines, such as in Poland's Be\u0142chat\u00f3w plant and Tur\u00f3w plant, Australia's Latrobe Valley and Luminant's Monticello plant and Martin Lake plant in Texas. Primarily because of latent high moisture content and low energy density of brown coal, carbon dioxide emissions from traditional brown-coal-fired plants are generally much higher per megawatt-hour generated than for comparable black-coal plants, with the world's highest-emitting plant being Australia's Hazelwood Power Station until its closure in March 2017. The operation of traditional brown-coal plants, particularly in combination with strip mining, is politically contentious due to environmental concerns.\nThe German Democratic Republic relied extensively on lignite to become energy self-sufficient, and eventually obtained 70% of its energy requirements from lignite. Lignite was also an important chemical industry feedstock via Bergius process or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in lieu of petroleum, which had to be imported for hard currency following a change in policy by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, which had previously delivered petroleum at below market rates. East German scientists even converted lignite into coke suitable for metallurgical uses (high temperature lignite coke) and much of the railway network was dependent on lignite either through steam trains or electrified lines mostly fed with lignite derived power. As per the table below, East Germany was the largest producer of lignite for much of its existence as an independent state.\nIn 2014, about 12 percent of Germany's energy and, specifically, 27 percent of Germany's electricity came from lignite power plants, while in 2014 in Greece, lignite provided about 50 percent of its power needs. Germany has announced plans to phase out lignite by 2038 at the latest. Greece has confirmed that the last coal plant will be shut in 2025 after receiving pressure from the European Union and plans to heavily invest in renewable energy.\nHome heating.\nLignite was and is used as a replacement for or in combination with firewood for home heating. It is usually pressed into briquettes for that use. Due to the smell it gives off when burned, lignite was often seen as a fuel for poor people compared to higher value hard coals. In Germany, briquettes are still readily available to end consumers in home improvement stores and supermarkets.\nIn agriculture.\nAn environmentally beneficial use of lignite is in agriculture. Lignite may have value as an environmentally benign soil amendment, improving cation exchange and phosphorus availability in soils while reducing availability of heavy metals, and may be superior to commercial K humates. Lignite fly ash produced by combustion of lignite in power plants may also be valuable as a soil amendment and fertilizer. However, rigorous studies of the long-term benefits of lignite products in agriculture are lacking.\nLignite may also be used for the cultivation and distribution of biological control microbes that suppress plant pests. The carbon increases the organic matter in the soil while the biological control microbes provide an alternative to chemical pesticides.\n\"Leonardite\" is a soil conditioner rich in humic acids that is formed by natural oxidation when lignite comes in contact with air. The process can be replicated artificially on a large scale. The less matured xyloid (wood-shaped) lignite also contains high amounts of humic acid.\nIn drilling mud.\nReaction with quaternary amine forms a product called amine-treated lignite (ATL), which is used in drilling mud to reduce fluid loss during drilling.\nAs an industrial adsorbent.\nLignite may have potential uses as an industrial adsorbent. Experiments show that its adsorption of methylene blue falls within the range of activated carbons currently used by industry.\nIn jewellery.\nJet is a form of lignite that has been used as a gemstone. The earliest jet artifacts date to 10,000 BCE and jet was used extensively in necklaces and other ornamentation in Britain from the Neolithic until the end of Roman Britain. Jet experienced a brief revival in Victorian Britain.\nGeology.\nLignite begins as partially decayed plant material, or peat. Peat tends to accumulate in areas with high moisture, slow land subsidence, and no disturbance by rivers or oceans \u2013 under these conditions, the area remains saturated with water, which covers dead vegetation and protects it from atmospheric oxygen. Otherwise, peat swamps are found in a variety of climates and geographical settings. Anaerobic bacteria may contribute to the degradation of peat, but this process takes a long time, particularly in acidic water. Burial by other sediments further slows biological degradation, and subsequent transformations are a result of increased temperatures and pressures underground.\nLignite forms from peat that has not been subjected to deep burial and heating. It forms at temperatures below , primarily by biochemical degradation. This includes the process of humification, in which microorganisms extract hydrocarbons from peat and form humic acids, which decrease the rate of bacterial decay. In lignite, humification is partial, coming to completion only when the coal reaches sub-bituminous rank. The most characteristic chemical change in the organic material during formation of lignite is the sharp reduction in the number of C=O and C-O-R functional groups.\nLignite deposits are typically younger than higher-ranked coals, with the majority of them having formed during the Tertiary period.\nExtraction.\nLignite is often found in thick beds located near the surface. These are inexpensive to extract using various forms of surface mining, though this can result in serious environmental damage. Regulations in the United States and other countries require that land that is surface mined must be restored to its original productivity once mining is complete.\nStrip mining of lignite in the United States begins with drilling to establish the extent of the subsurface beds. Topsoil and subsoil must be properly removed and either used to reclaim previously mined-out areas or stored for future reclamation. Excavator and truck overburden removal prepares the area for dragline overburden removal to expose the lignite beds. These are broken up using specially equipped tractors (\"coal ripping\") and then loaded into bottom dump trucks using front loaders.\nOnce the lignite is removed, restoration involves grading the mine spoil to as close an approximation as practical of the original ground surface (Approximate Original Contour or AOC). Subsoil and topsoil are restored and the land reseeded with various grasses. In North Dakota, a performance bond is held against the mining company for at least ten years after the end of mining operations to guarantee that the land has been restored to full productivity. A bond (not necessary in this form) for mine reclamation is required in the US by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.\nResources and reserves.\nAustralia.\nThe Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Australia, contains estimated reserves of some 65 billion tonnes of brown coal. The deposit is equivalent to 25 percent of known world reserves. The coal seams are up to thick, with multiple coal seams often giving virtually continuous brown coal thickness of up to . Seams are covered by very little overburden ().\nA partnership led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and backed by the governments of Japan and Australia has begun extracting hydrogen from brown coal. The liquefied hydrogen will be shipped via the transporter \"Suiso Frontier\" to Japan.\nNorth America.\nThe largest lignite deposits in North America are the Gulf Coast lignites and the Fort Union lignite field. The Gulf Coast lignites are located in a band running from Texas to Alabama roughly parallel to the Gulf Coast. The Fort Union lignite field stretches from North Dakota to Saskatchewan. Both are important commercial sources of lignite.\nTypes.\nLignite can be separated into two types: xyloid lignite or fossil wood, and compact lignite or perfect lignite.\nAlthough xyloid lignite may sometimes have the tenacity and the appearance of ordinary wood, it can be seen that the combustible woody tissue has experienced a great modification. It is reducible to a fine powder by trituration, and if submitted to the action of a weak solution of potash, it yields a considerable quantity of humic acid. Leonardite is an oxidized form of lignite, which also contains high levels of humic acid.\nJet is a hardened, gem-like form of lignite used in various types of jewelry.\nProduction.\nGermany is the largest producer of lignite, followed by China, Russia, and United States. Lignite accounted for 8% of all U.S. coal production in 2019.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42821", "revid": "50529556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42821", "title": "La Paz", "text": "Seat of government of Bolivia\nLa Paz (; lit.\u2009'the peace'), officially Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (Aymara: Chuqi Yapu ), is the seat of government of Bolivia. With 755,732 residents as of 2024, it is the third-most populous city in Bolivia. Its metropolitan area, which includes the neighboring city of El Alto, and other smaller towns, is the second most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 2.2\u00a0million, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra with a population of 2.3\u00a0million. The city is also the capital of the department of the same name.\nLocated in west-central Bolivia southeast of Lake Titicaca, La Paz is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is in a bowl-like depression, part of the Amazon basin, surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly above sea level, La Paz is the highest administrative capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, the city has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.\nLa Paz was founded on 20 October 1548, by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza, at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potos\u00ed and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz\" (meaning \"Our Lady of Peace\") in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist T\u00fapac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On 16 July 1809, the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.\nAs the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is an important political, administrative, economic, and sports center of Bolivia; it generates 24% of the nation's gross domestic product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.\nLa Paz is also an important cultural center of South America, as it hosts several landmarks dating from colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and Ja\u00e9n Street. La Paz is also situated at the confluence of archaeological regions of the Tiwanaku and Inca Empire. The city is renowned for its markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its nightlife. Its topography offers views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is home to the largest urban cable car network in the world.\nName and toponyms.\nThe Spanish conquistadors founded the city in 1548 with the name \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz\" (meaning \"Our Lady of Peace\"). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru.\nIn 1825, after the decisive victory of the republicans at Ayacucho over the Spanish army in the course of the Spanish American wars of independence, the city's full name was changed to \"La Paz de Ayacucho\" (meaning \"The Peace of Ayacucho\").\nThe region in which La Paz is located in was known as Chuquiago Marka (\"marka\" means village; \"Chuqi Yapu\" means 'gold farm', probably due to the exploitation of gold nuggets in the small rivers of the place; spelling differences due to Aymara writing compared to Spanish transliteration) in the Aymara language, leading former President of Bolivia Evo Morales to suggest renaming the city to \"Chuquiago Marka\" in a speech in 2017.\nHistory.\nThis area had been the site of an Inca city on a major trading route.\nAlthough the Spanish conquistadors entered the area in 1535, they did not find La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the Native American settlement, Laja. The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.\nControl over the former Inca lands had been entrusted to Pedro de la Gasca by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) Emperor Charles V. Gasca commanded Alonso de Mendoza to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on 20 October 1548, by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.\nIn 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.\nSpain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of Tupac Katari, they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the Ekeko. In 1809, the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On 16 July 1809, Pedro Domingo Murillo said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de Am\u00e9rica and brought about the Bolivian War of Independence.\nPedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Espa\u00f1oles several months later, on 29 January 1810. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.\nIn 1898, La Paz was made the \"de facto\" seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted silver mines of Potos\u00ed to the exploitation of tin near Oruro, and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national elites.\nThe segregation of Cholitas (women of Andean indigenous background) continued until the 1980s. They were not allowed to enter certain public places and were banned from cinemas and some restaurants, with more emphasis in Bolivian eastern cities like Santa Cruz De La Sierra.\nGeography.\nLa Paz is in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. The metropolitan area is near to the Cordillera Real range, which includes such notable mountains as Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Mururata, Huayna Potosi, Chacaltaya, Kunturiri, Llamp'u, Chachakumani, Chearoco, and Ancohuma. \nLa Paz is built in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.\nThe geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills. The satellite city of El Alto, where the airport is, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano.\nAn earthquake in July 1994 rated at 8.2 struck north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area. In February 2002 the city was subjected to a hail and rainstorm that resulted in flooding causing serious damage and over 50 deaths.\nClimate.\nAt more than above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have a cold subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cwc\"), bordering on a tundra climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"ET\"). At this altitude, night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. Snow flurries can occur in winter, especially at dawn and usually melts before noon. Despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, this part of the city has average temperatures similar to that of cities such as Bergen, Norway or T\u00f3rshavn, Faroe Islands.\nTemperatures in central La Paz, at , and in the \"Zona Sur\" (Southern Zone), at above sea level are warmer and are classified as subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cwb\"). Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. At an altitude of 3,250 meters, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of , and the driest is July with .\nThe whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March. Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive mudslides. The wettest month is January with a monthly average of of precipitation, and the driest months are June and July with around of precipitation.\nIn the highest part of the city, above 4,000 meters, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.\nColonial architecture.\nThe city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years, mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city.\nWhile there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.\nLa Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. Historically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban center of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. \"The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves. The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.\"\nSports.\nLa Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.\nThe city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:\nWith the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Uni\u00f3n Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the Estadio Hernando Siles, which also hosts the national football team and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the Estadio Rafael Mendoza which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.\nEducation.\nThe city hosts some of the most important universities of the country:\nTourism.\nLa Paz is an important cultural center of Bolivia. The city hosts several cathedrals belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Cathedral and the Metropolitan Cathedral, this last one located on Murillo Square, which is also home of the political and administrative power of the country. Hundreds of different museums can be found across the city, the most notable ones on Ja\u00e9n Street, which street design has been preserved from the Spanish days and is home of 10 different museums.\nThe home of the Bolivian government is located on Murillo Square and is known as \"Palacio Quemado\" (\"Burnt Palace\") as it has been on fire several times. The palace has been restored many times since, but the name has remained untouched.\nFood.\nPopular food from La Paz includes:\nTransportation.\nAutomobiles and public transportation are the main means to get into the city. In March 2012, more than 1.5\u00a0million vehicles were registered. Heavy traffic is common in the city center and traffic jams occur on peak hours.\nHighways.\nThe La Paz-El Alto Highway is a toll road that connects the city of La Paz with the neighboring city of El Alto. It is the city's main highway. It allows easy access to El Alto International Airport. The highway runs 11,7\u00a0km and crosses the city of El Alto:\nThe Southern District, one of La Paz's most affluent and commercial neighborhoods, is relatively separated from the rest of the city, including the CBD. The Avenida Costanera and Avenida Kantutani (Costanera and Kantutani Avenues) connect the southern district with the rest of the metropolitan area.\nAir.\nEl Alto International Airport (IATA code: LPB) is La Paz's national and international airport and a principal hub for L\u00ednea A\u00e9rea Amaszonas and Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar. It also serves as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag-carrier and largest airline. The airport is located in the city of El Alto and is () south-west of La Paz's city center. At an elevation of , it is the highest international airport and fifth highest commercial airport in the world. The runway has a length of . It is one of Bolivia's three main international gateways, along with Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport.\nInternational carriers serving El Alto International Airport include Avianca and LATAM Airlines, which offer direct flights from La Paz to cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Lima, and Santiago. However, most international traffic, including flights to Europe, operated out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is at a much lower altitude and is capable of handling larger aircraft.\nAdditionally, the airport supplies travelers with oxygen for those who suffer from altitude sickness.\nBus.\nLa Paz Bus Station, originally a bus and train station, was built by the French architect Gustave Eiffel. It is the main gateway for inter-city buses with several daily departures to all the main Bolivian cities, and routes to Chile and Peru. The city is connected by road with the city of Oruro from where there are routes to Sucre, Potos\u00ed and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. Roads to the west go to Copacabana and Tiwanaku, near Lake Titicaca, and continue to Cuzco, Peru via the border town of Desaguadero. There are also roads north to get to Yungas crossing the Andes Mountains.\nDepartures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa F\u00e1tima (departures to Los Yungas, Beni and Pando), Upper San Pedro (for Apolo) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).\nCable car system.\nA system of urban transit aerial cable cars called Mi Telef\u00e9rico (\"My Cable Car\") was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the Austrian company Doppelmayr. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with El Alto. All stations have both a Spanish name and an Aymara name.\nWater supply.\nThe water supply of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city El Alto. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the Cordillera mountain range. 20\u201328% of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change, initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the Chacaltaya near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of Huayna Potosi and from Condoriri North of El Alto. The 2.9\u00a0km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year. The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with water scarcity. New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.\nInternational relations.\nLa Paz is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities from 12 October 1982.\nLa Paz is also a member of Merco Ciudades, a group of 180 cities within Mercosur, since 1999.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nLa Paz is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An example from Estonian is and ('into the house'), formed from ('house'). An example from Finnish is ('into the house'), formed from ('a house'), another from Lithuanian is ('into the boat') formed from ('boat'), and from Latvian ('into the boat') formed from ('boat').\nIn Finnish.\nThe case is formed by adding \"-hVn\", where 'V' represents the last vowel, and then removing the 'h' if a simple long vowel would result. For example, + \"Vn\" becomes with a simple long 'oo'; cf. + \"hVn\" becomes , without the elision of 'h'. This unusually complex way of adding a suffix can be explained by its reconstructed origin: a voiced palatal fricative. (Modern Finnish has lost palatalization and fricatives other than 'h' or 's'.) In some dialects spoken in Ostrobothnia, notably South Ostrobothnia, the 'h' is not removed; one says . Some dialects of Finland Proper and Kymenlaakso also have a similar feature.

Since the beginning of the 20th century it isn't included in the lists of standard Lithuanian cases in most grammar books and textbooks, and the prepositional construction \u012f+accusative is more frequently used today to denote direction. The illative case was used extensively in older Lithuanian; the first Lithuanian grammar book, by Daniel Klein, mentions both illative and \u012f+accusative but calls the usage of the illative \"more elegant\". Later, it has often appeared in the written texts of the authors who grew up in Dz\u016bkija or Eastern Auk\u0161taitija, such as Vincas Kr\u0117v\u0117-Mickevi\u010dius.\nThe illative case in Lithuanian has its own endings, which are different for each declension paradigm, although quite regular, compared with some other Lithuanian cases.

In addition, it is the logical complement of the adessive case for referring to \"being around the place\". For example, \"koululle\" means \"to the vicinity of the school\". With time, the use is the same: \"ruokatunti\" (lunch break) and \"... l\u00e4hti ruokatunnille\" (\"... left to the lunch break\"). Some actions require the case, e.g. \"k\u00e4vely\" - \"menn\u00e4 k\u00e4velylle\" \"a walk - go for a walk\".

For the modern languages the remains of the allative can be found in certain fixed expressions that have become adverbs, such as Lithuanian \"i\u0161\u0117jo Dievop\" (\"gone to God\", i.e. died), \"velniop!\" (\"to the devil\" i.e. to hell), \"nuteisti myriop\" (\"sentence to death\"), \"rudeniop\" (\"towards autumn\"), \"vakarop\" (\"towards the evening\"), Latvian \"m\u0101jup\" (\"towards home\"), \"kalnup\" (\"uphill\"), \"lejup\" (\"downhill\").\nGreek.\nFor Mycenaean Greek, an ending \"-de\" is used to denote an allative, when it is not being used as an enclitic, e.g. \"te-qa-de\", *\"T\u02b0\u0113g\u02b7asde\", \"to Thebes\" (Linear B: ).

The essive case on a noun can express it as a definite period of time during which something happens or during which a continuous action was completed. It can also denote a form as a temporary location, state of being, or character in which the subject was at a given time. The latter meaning is often described as the equivalent of the English phrase \"as a __\".\nFinnish.\nIn Finnish, it is marked by adding \"/\" (depending on the vowel harmony) to the stem of the noun.\nExamples:\n\"\" \"child\" \u2192 \"lapsena\" \"as a child\", \"when (I) was a child\".\n \"My brother is a composer (at somewhere or a certain kind of).\"\ncf: (Nom) (My brother is a composer) vs. (Ess) (My brother works/acts as a composer (somewhere))\n' \"composer\" \u2192 ' \"state of being a composer (the given time is the present)\"\nExample: \"\"' \"My brother is a composer in an orchestra\".\nExample: \"\"' \"As a composer my brother is unique\".\nIn Finnish, the essive case is technically categorized as an old locative case, a case that, in some way, indicates spatial location. However, in the present language, the case has lost the majority of its spatial meaning. The case instead typically denotes a state that is temporary or inclined to change.\nSome fixed expressions retain the essive in its ancient locative meaning, however: \"at home\" is . \nExample: \"\" \"I read newspapers at home.\"\nIf the inessive were used, , it would distinguish the activity from reading the papers, such as in the garage or in the garden (of the home).\nThe essive case is also used in a temporal sense with certain nouns, notably the names of weekdays, and (year), (morning), (evening), and (night), as well as dates.\n\"\" \"(on) last Monday.\"\n\"\" \"on 6 December\".\n\"\" \"on this day\"\n\"\" \"(during) last year\"\nWhen marking something that cannot literally change states, the essive case can implicate the presence of alternative states, even two individual, differing \"worlds\". That can be seen in the following example:\nExample: \"\" \"I bought the pearl thinking it was genuine [but later found out that it was not].\"\nThe example above illustrates the process by which marking of the essive case can be seen as creating two differing \"worlds\": one real and one illusionary. The \"temporary\" component of the meaning encoded by marking of the essive case on the Finnish word for \"genuine\" () makes a distinction between the perceived state of the subject, as genuine at the time of purchase, and the actual state of subject, as not genuine as it is now perceived or at the time of the moment of speech.\nEstonian.\nIn Estonian, it is marked by adding \"-na\" to the genitive stem. Marking of the case in Estonian denotes the capacity in which the subject acts. The essive case is used for indicating \"states of being\" but not of \"becoming\", which is instead marked by the translative case, the elative case, or the nominative case.\nExamples:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\" \"He works as an engineer.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In English, the preposition \"with\", in the sense of \"in company with\" or \"together with\", plays a substantially similar role. Other uses of \"with\", like in the meaning of \"using\" or \"by means of\" (I cut bread with a knife), correspond to the instrumental case or related cases.\nCore meaning.\nThe comitative case encodes a relationship of \"accompaniment\" between two participants in an event, called the \"accompanier\" and the \"companion\". In addition, there is a \"relator\" (which can be of multiple lexical categories, but is most commonly an affix or adposition). Use of the comitative case gives prominence to the accompanier. This Italian sentence is an example:\n[\"il professore\"]accompanier \"entra nell'aula\" [\"con\"]relator [\"i suoi studenti\"]companion\n'the professor enters the lecture-hall (together) with his students'.\nIn this case, is the accompanier, is the companion, and is the relator. As the accompanier, is the most prominent.\nAnimacy also plays a major role in most languages with a comitative case. One group of languages requires both the accompanier and the companion to be either human or animate. Another group requires both to be in the same category: both human or both animate. A third group requires an animate accompanier and an inanimate companion. Other languages have no restrictions based on animacy.\nComparison to similar cases.\nThe comitative case is often conflated or confused with other similar cases, especially the instrumental case and the associative case.\nThe comitative relates to an accompanier and a companion, and the instrumental relates to an agent, an object, and a patient. Enrique Palancar defines the role of Instrumental case as 'the role played by the object the Agent manipulates to achieve a change of state of the Patient.' Even though the difference is straightforward, because the instrumental and the comitative are expressed the same way in many languages, including English, it is often difficult to separate them.\nRussian is one of many languages that differentiate morphologically between instrumental and comitative:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Russian, the comitative is marked by adding a preposition and by declining the companion in the instrumental case; the design as a whole becomes comitative. In the instrumental case, the object is declined, but no preposition is added.\nThe comitative case is often confused with the associative case. Before the term comitative was applied to the accompanier-companion relationship, the relationship was often called associative case, a term still used by some linguists.\nIt is important to distinguish between the comitative and the associative because the associative also refers to a specific variety of the comitative case that is used in Hungarian.\nExpressions of comitative semantic relation.\nGrammatical case is a category of inflectional morphology. The comitative case is an expression of the comitative semantic relation through inflectional affixation, by prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes. Although all three major types of affixes are used in at least a few languages, suffixes are the most common expression. Languages which use affixation to express the comitative include Hungarian, which uses suffixes; Totonac, which uses prefixes; and Chukchi, which uses circumfixes.\nComitative relations are also commonly expressed by using adpositions: prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions. Examples of languages that use adpositional constructions to express comitative relations are French, which uses prepositions; Way\u00e3pi, which uses postpositions; and Bambara, which uses circumpositions.\nAdverbial constructions can also mark comitative relations, but they act very similarly to adpositions. One language that uses adverbs to mark the comitative case is Latvian.\nThe final way in which comitative relations can be expressed is by serial-verb constructions. In these languages, the comitative marker is usually a verb whose basic meaning is \"to follow\". A language which marks comitative relations with serial-verb constructions is Chinese.\nExamples.\nIndo-European languages.\nLatvian.\nIn Latvian, both instrumental and comitative are expressed with the preposition However, it is used only when the companion is in accusative and singular or when it is in dative and plural. Otherwise the co-ordinating conjunction is used.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the example above, is used because Rudolf, the companion, is in accusative and singular. Below, it is used in the other case that it is allowed, with a dative plural companion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUralic languages.\nEstonian.\nIn Estonian, the comitative () marker is the suffix .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFinnish.\nIn Finnish, the comitative case () consists of the suffix with adjectives and + a mandatory possessive suffix with the main noun. There is no singular-plural distinction; only the plural of the comitative exists and is used in both singular and plural senses, and thus it always appears as . For instance, \"with their big ships\" is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhile \"with his/her big ships\" is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is rarely used and is mainly a feature of formal literary language, appearing very rarely in everyday speech.\nThe much more common, less formal way of expressing \"with\" is with the postposition , e.g., 'with their big ships'. The two forms may contrast, however, since the comitative always comes with the possessive suffix and thus can only be used when the agent has some sort of possession of the thing expressed by the main noun. For instance, , 'The foreign minister, with [assistance from] his colleagues, is continuing the negotiations with the guerrillas', has 'with his colleagues' contrasted with 'with the guerrillas', the former \"possessed\", the latter not.\nColloquial Finnish also has the postposition , derived from and cognate with the Estonian . With pronouns it is written as a suffix, . Compare also Ingrian , e.g., 'with a house'.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSami languages.\nAs there are many Sami languages there are variations between them. In the largest Sami language, Northern Sami, the comitative case means either communion, fellowship, connection - or instrument, tool. It can be used either as an object or as an adverbial.\nIt is expressed through the suffix in the singular and in the plural.\nAn example of the object use in Northern Sami is 'She always argues with her husband'. An example of the adverbial use is 'I write with ink'.\nHungarian.\nIn Hungarian, comitative case is marked by the suffix , as shown in the example below.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, the comitative case marker cannot be used if the companion has a plural marker. So when the comitative marker is added to a noun, it obscures whether that noun is singular or plural.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChukchi.\nChukchi uses a circumfix to express comitative case.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the example, the circumfix \u0433\u0430\u27e9...\u27e8\u043c\u0430 is attached to the root 'gun' to express comitative.\nDrehu.\nIn Drehu, there are two prepositions which can be used to mark comitative. Which of the prepositions is used is determined by the classes of the accompanier and companion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHausa.\nThe comitative marker in Hausa is the preposition . In Hausa, a prepositional phrase marked for comitative can be moved to the front of the sentence for emphasis, as shown in the examples below.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Hausa it is ungrammatical to do the same with coordinating conjunctions. For example, if the companions were \"dog and cat\", it would be ungrammatical to move either \"dog\" or \"cat\" to the front of the sentence for emphasis, while it is grammatical to do so when there is a comitative marker rather than a conjunction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can be used in other constructions, but then it does not sound \"natural\". Examples would be \"postitse\" (\"by post\"), \"puhelimitse\" (\"by telephone\"), \"meritse\" (\"by sea\"), \"netitse\" (\"over the Internet\"). A number of Finnish grammarians classify the prolative form as an adverb because it does not require agreement with adjectives like other Finnish cases. This claim is not true, however, because an adjective will agree with the prolative: \"H\u00e4n hoiti asian pitkitse kirjeitse\" (\"He/she dealt with the matter by way of a long letter\").\nThe prolative exists in a similar state in the Estonian language.\nThe vialis case in Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages has a similar interpretation, used to express movement using a surface or way. For example, in the Greenlandic language 'by ship' or in Central Alaskan Yup'ik 'by river' or 'by sled'.\nBasque grammars frequently list the \"nortzat / nortako\" case (suffix \"-tzat\" or \"-tako\") as \"prolative\" (\"prolatiboa\"). However, the meaning of this case is unrelated to the one just described above for other languages and alternatively has been called \"essive / translative\", as it means \"for [something else], as (being) [something else]\"; e.g., \"hiltzat eman\" \"to give up for dead\", \"lelotzat hartu zuten\" \"they took him for a fool\". The meaning \"by way of\" of the case labelled prolative in the above languages is expressed in Basque by means of the instrumental (suffix \"-[e]z\").\nThis case is also called the prosecutive case in some languages. It is found under this name in Tundra Nenets, in Old Basque and, with spatial nouns, in Mongolian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42853", "revid": "29463730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42853", "title": "Partitive case", "text": "Grammatical case denoting \"partialness\", \"without result\" or \"without specific identity\"\nThe partitive case (abbreviated PTV, PRTV, or more ambiguously PART) is a grammatical case which denotes \"partialness\", \"without result\", or \"without specific identity\". It is also used in contexts where a subgroup is selected from a larger group, or with numbers.\nFinnic languages.\nIn Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, this case is often used to express unknown identities and irresultative actions. For example, in Finnish, it is found in the following circumstances, with the characteristic ending of \"-a\" or \"-ta\":\nWhere not mentioned, the accusative case would be ungrammatical. For example, the partitive must always be used after singular numerals.\nAs an example of the irresultative meaning of the partitive, \"ammuin karhun\" (accusative) means \"I shot the bear (dead)\", whereas \"ammuin karhua\" (partitive) means \"I shot (at) the bear\" without specifying if it was even hit. Notice that Finnish has no native future tense, so that the partitive provides an important reference to the present as opposed to the future. Thus \"luen kirjaa\" means \"I am reading a/the book\" whereas \"luen kirjan\" means \"I will read a/the book\". Thus \"luen\" can mean \"I read\", \"I am reading\" or \"I will read\" depending on the case form of the word that follows. The partitive form \"kirjaa\" indicates incompleted action and hence the meaning of the verb form is present tense. The accusative form \"kirjan\" indicates completed action when used with the past tense verb but indicates planned future action when used with a verb in the present tense. Hence \"luen kirjan\" means \"I will read the book\".\nThe case with an unspecified identity is \"onko teill\u00e4 kirjoja\", which uses the partitive, because it refers to unspecified books, as contrasted to nominative \"onko teill\u00e4 (ne) kirjat?\", which means \"do you have (those) books?\"\nThe partitive case comes from the older ablative case. This meaning is preserved e.g. in \"kotoa\" (from home), \"takaa\" (from behind), where it means \"from\".\nA Western Finnish dialectal phenomenon seen in some dialects is the assimilation of the final \"-a\" into a preceding vowel, thus making the chroneme the partitive marker. For example, \"suurii\" \u2192 \"suuria\" \"some big --\".\nIn Estonian, the system is generally similar. In Estonian grammatical tradition, the term \"accusative\" is not used, since like in Finnish, the total object form coincides with the genitive in the singular, and the nominative in the plural.\nIn many Estonian words, the difference between the full and partial object cases is only in vowel or consonant quantity (long vs overlong), which is not marked in writing, except for stop consonants. Thus, the distinction between a total and partial object may be apparent in speech but not in writing. For example, the sentence \"Linn ehitab kooli\" would mean \"The city will build a/the school\" when pronounced with a long vowel \"o\" in \"kooli\" \"school (genitive case)\", and \"The city is building a/the school\" with an overlong \"o\" (partitive case).\nFor many verbs in Estonian, an additional adverb is almost always added when a completed action is meant - for example, \"ma s\u00f6\u00f6n leiba\" \"I'm eating bread\", vs \"ma s\u00f6\u00f6n leiva \u00e4ra\" \"I will eat the (whole) bread\". Since Estonian, unlike Finnish, has words where the genitive and partitive singular are identical even in pronunciation, this can provide disambiguation in those cases - e.g \"ma s\u00f6\u00f6n kala\" \"I'm eating fish\", vs \"ma s\u00f6\u00f6n kala \u00e4ra\" \"I will eat (all of) the fish\".\nS\u00e1mi.\nOf the S\u00e1mi languages, Inari and Skolt S\u00e1mi still have a partitive, although it is slowly disappearing and its function is being taken over by other cases.\nSkolt S\u00e1mi.\nThe partitive is used only in the singular and can always be replaced by the genitive. The partitive marker is \"-d\".\nDutch.\nIn Dutch there are many adjectives ending in \"-s\", which is called the partitive case. This case is derived from the genitive case in the older declension system and is used after words that signify quantity, such as the Dutch \"veel\", \"weinig\" or \"niets\" (respectively meaning many/much/a lot, few/little or nothing):\n \"Dat is niets nieuws.\" \n That's nothing new.\n \"Men verwacht er veel goeds van.\" \n People expect a lot from it.\nThe partitive case can also be used as a comparative:\n \"Heb je niets beters?\" \n Don't you have anything better?\nIf an adjective already ends in an alveolar fricative (like s in \"suit\"), the \"-s\" drops:\n \"Geef mij maar iets fris.\" \n Give me something fresh.\n \"Dat is iets fantastisch!\" \n That is something fantastic!\nRussian.\nThe Russian language usually uses the genitive case to express partialness. However, some Russian mass nouns have developed a distinct partitive case, also referred to as the \"second genitive case\". The partitive arose from the merger of the declensions of \"*-\u014f\" and \"*-\u016d\" stem nouns in Old East Slavic, which left the former \"*-\u016d\" stem genitive suffix available for a specialized use.\nIn modern Russian, use of the partitive case is often facultative. In many situations, the partitive and the genitive can be used almost synonymously: , ' (partitive) and ' (genitive) both mean \"a cup of tea\"; , ' (partitive) and ' (genitive) both mean \"lots of smoke\". The partitive variant is preferred with verbs: , ', \"to have a drink of tea\". The genitive variant is used more frequently when the mass noun is modified by an adjective: ', \"a cup of hot tea\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contrasts with the marked ergative case, which marks the subject of a transitive verb.\nFor example, in Basque the noun 'boy' takes the bare singular article both as the subject of the intransitive clause ('the boy came') and as the object of the transitive clause ('the teacher has seen the boy') in which the agent bears the ergative ending .\nIn a very few cases, a marked absolutive has been reported, including in Nias and Sochiapam Chinantec.\nOther uses.\nOccasionally, the term 'absolutive case' (or also: 'absolute case') is used for the unmarked case form in languages with other alignment types. This is especially common in the tradition of descriptive linguistics of African languages. In marked nominative languages, where the nominative has case inflection, the accusative is unmarked and also serves as citation form. In these languages, the unmarked accusative/citation form is thus often called 'absolutive'. On the other hand, in certain nominative\u2013accusative languages, it is the accusative which is explicitly marked for case, whereas the nominative is unmarked and serves as citation form. In such situations, the term 'absolutive' is occasionally used to describe the unmarked nominative/citation form.\nIn tripartite languages.\nIn tripartite languages, both the agent and object of a transitive clause have case forms, ergative and accusative, and the agent of an intransitive clause is the unmarked citation form. It is occasionally called the intransitive case, but \"absolutive\" is also used and is perhaps more accurate since it is not limited to core agents of intransitive verbs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Boulle's novel and the film's screenplay are almost entirely fictional but use the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942\u20131943 as its historical setting. It stars William Holden, Alec Guinness, and Jack Hawkins, with Sessue Hayakawa, James Donald, Ann Sears, and Geoffrey Horne in supporting roles.\nThe film was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson. Both writers had to work in secret since they were on the Hollywood blacklist and had fled to the UK in order to continue working. As a result, Boulle, who did not speak English, was credited and received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; many years later, Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award.\n\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" is now widely recognized as one of the greatest films of the 1950s. It was the highest-grossing film of 1957 and received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The film won seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards. In 1997, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. It has been included on the American Film Institute's list of best American films ever made. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" the 11th greatest British film of the 20th century.\nPlot.\nIn February 1943, a contingent of British prisoners of war, led by Colonel Nicholson, arrive at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand. United States Navy Commander Shears describes the horrific conditions to Nicholson, who forbids any escape attempts because they had been ordered to surrender by their own headquarters.\nColonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the prisoners the camp needs no fences because the surrounding jungle makes escape impossible and that they will be used as labour to construct a bridge over the River Kwai for the railway connecting Thailand and Burma. Nicholson objects, citing the Geneva Convention exempting officers from manual labour. Saito threatens to have the officers shot, but Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns him there are too many witnesses. The officers are left standing in the intense heat until evening when Saito confines them to a punishment hut. Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box. Shears becomes the only survivor of an escape attempt and recuperates in British Ceylon after being tended to by Thai civilians.\nBritish sabotage and deliberately slow work impedes bridge construction, made worse by incompetent Japanese engineering. When Nicholson is released from confinement, he is shocked by the poor job his men have done and orders the construction of a proper bridge that he feels will be a lasting tribute to the British Army's superiority. Clipton unsuccessfully argues it is collaboration with the enemy. Even though Saito had given in to his principled stand and excused the British officers from manual labour, Nicholson volunteers them to join in the physical work.\nShears' comfortable life in Ceylon is shaken up when Major Warden tries to recruit him for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears reveals he impersonated an officer to get better treatment in the camp, but Warden already knew of his deception and arranged his attachment to the British military, forcing him to participate. Warden, Shears, Chapman and Joyce parachute into Thailand. Chapman dies on landing, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol. Khun Yai, a village chief, and a group of Thai women guide the trio to the river. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives at the base of the bridge towers and plan to destroy it and the first train to cross, scheduled for the next morning.\nSunrise reveals the river level has dropped, exposing the wire leading to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire, and he and Saito investigate as the train approaches. Nicholson pulls up the wire on the riverbank, leading them toward Joyce, who is manning the detonator. Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson calls for help and attempts to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. After Joyce is shot, Shears swims across the river to detonate the explosives but is fatally wounded. Recognizing Shears, Nicholson exclaims, \"What have I done?\" Warden fires a mortar, wounding Nicholson. Dazed, Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge; the train tumbles into the river. Warden, turning toward the group's horrified guides, pleads, \"I had to do it! They might have been taken alive!\". Witnessing the carnage, Clipton exclaims, \"Madness!\u00a0... Madness!\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* William Holden as \"Commander\" Shears, U.S. Navy (later Brevet Major, Force 316)\nProduction.\nScreenplay.\nThe screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, were on the Hollywood blacklist and even though living in exile in England could only work on the film in secret. The two did not collaborate on the script; Wilson took over after Lean was dissatisfied with Foreman's work. The official credit was given to Pierre Boulle (who did not speak English), and the resulting Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) was awarded to him. Only in 1984 did the Academy rectify the situation by retroactively awarding the Oscar to Foreman and Wilson, posthumously in both cases. Subsequent releases of the film finally gave them proper screen credit. David Lean himself also claimed that producer Sam Spiegel cheated him out of his rightful part in the credits since he had had a major hand in the script.\nThe film was relatively faithful to the novel, with two major exceptions. Shears, who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel, becomes an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp. Also, in the novel, the bridge is not destroyed: the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden, but Nicholson (never realising \"what have I done?\") does not fall onto the plunger, and the bridge suffers only minor damage. Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version, though he disagreed with its climax.\nCasting.\nAlthough Lean later denied it, Charles Laughton was his first choice for the role of Nicholson. Laughton was in his habitually overweight state and was either denied insurance coverage or was simply not keen on filming in a tropical location. Cary Grant was offered the role of Nicholson but turned it down in favor of \"The Pride and the Passion\" to work with Marlon Brando before he was replaced by Frank Sinatra on that film. Guinness admitted that Lean \"didn't particularly want me\" for the role, and thought about immediately returning to England when he arrived in Ceylon and Lean reminded him that he wasn't the first choice.\nWilliam Holden's deal\u2014he received 10% of the film's gross receipts\u2014was considered one of the best ever for an actor at the time.\nFilming.\nMany directors were considered for the project, among them John Ford, William Wyler, Howard Hawks, Fred Zinnemann, and Orson Welles (who was also offered a starring role).\nThe film was an international co-production between companies in Britain and the United States.\nDirector David Lean clashed repeatedly with his cast members, particularly Guinness and James Donald, who thought the novel was anti-British. Lean had a lengthy row with Guinness over how to play the role of Nicholson; the actor wanted to play the part with a sense of humour and sympathy, while Lean thought Nicholson should be \"a bore.\" On another occasion, they argued over the scene where Nicholson reflects on his career in the army. Lean filmed the scene from behind Guinness and angrily exploded when Guinness asked him why he was doing this. After Guinness was done with the scene, Lean said, \"Now you can all fuck off and go home, you English actors. Thank God that I'm starting work tomorrow with an American actor (William Holden).\"\nThe film was made in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala. The Mount Lavinia Hotel was used as a location for the hospital.\nGuinness later said that he subconsciously based his walk while emerging from \"the Oven\" on that of his eleven-year-old son Matthew, who was recovering from polio at the time, a disease that left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Guinness later reflected on the scene, calling it the \"finest piece of work\" he had ever done.\nLean nearly drowned when he was swept away by the river current during a break from filming.\nIn a 1988 interview with Barry Norman, Lean confirmed that Columbia almost stopped filming after three weeks because there was no white woman in the film, forcing him to add what he called \"a very terrible scene\" between Holden and a nurse on the beach.\nThe filming of the bridge explosion was to be done on 10 March 1957, in the presence of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, and a team of government dignitaries. However, cameraman Freddy Ford was unable to get out of the way of the explosion in time, and Lean had to stop filming. The train crashed into a generator on the other side of the bridge and was wrecked. It was repaired in time to be blown up the next morning, with Bandaranaike and his entourage present.\nMusic and soundtrack.\nBritish composer Malcolm Arnold recalled that he had \"ten days to write around forty-five minutes worth of music\"\u2014much less time than he was used to. He described the music for \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" as the \"worst job I ever had in my life\" because of the time constraint. Despite this, he won an Oscar and a Grammy.\n The film's soundtrack was released on LP soon after the film (Columbia CL 1100). In 1990, Christopher Palmer arranged a concert suite for large orchestra for Arnold's 70th birthday.\nA memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs\u2014the first strain of the \"Colonel Bogey March\"\u2014when they enter the camp. Gavin Young recounts meeting Donald Wise, a former prisoner of the Japanese who had worked on the Burma Railway. Young: \"Donald, did anyone whistle \"Colonel Bogey\" ... as they did in the film?\" Wise: \"I never heard it in Thailand. We hadn't much breath left for whistling. But in Bangkok I was told that David Lean, the film's director, became mad at the extras who played the prisoners\u2014us\u2014because they couldn't march in time. Lean shouted at them, 'For God's sake, whistle a march to keep time to.' And a bloke called George Siegatz... \u2014an expert whistler\u2014began to whistle \"Colonel Bogey\", and a hit was born.\"\nThe march was written in 1914 by Kenneth J. Alford, a pseudonym of British Bandmaster Frederick J. Ricketts. For the film, Arnold wrote an accompanying counter-melody to the Colonel Bogey strain using the same chord progressions, then continued with his own \"The River Kwai March,\" played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers, though Arnold's march was not heard in completion on the soundtrack (apparently for copyright reasons). Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.\nIn many tense, dramatic scenes, only the sounds of nature are used. An example of this is when commandos Warden and Joyce hunt a fleeing Japanese soldier through the jungle, desperate to prevent him from alerting other troops.\nHistorical accuracy.\nThe plot and characters of Boulle's novel and the screenplay were almost entirely fictional. There are many historical inaccuracies in the film, as noted by historians citing eyewitnesses to the building of the real Burma Railway.\nThe conditions to which POW and civilian labourers were subjected were far worse than the film depicted. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The notorious Burma-Siam railway, built by Commonwealth, Dutch and American prisoners of war, was a Japanese project driven by the need for improved communications to support the large Japanese army in Burma. During its construction, approximately 13,000 prisoners of war died and were buried along the railway. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians also died in the course of the project, chiefly forced labour brought from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, or conscripted in Siam (Thailand) and Burma. Two labour forces, one based in Siam and the other in Burma, worked from opposite ends of the line towards the centre.\nLieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey of the British Army was the real senior Allied officer at the bridge in question. Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. In fact, Toosey strove to delay construction. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: termites were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed. Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of the then Lt. Col. Toosey.\nOn a BBC \"Timewatch\" programme, a former prisoner at the camp states that it is unlikely that a man like the fictional Nicholson could have risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and, if he had, due to his collaboration he would have been \"quietly eliminated\" by the other prisoners.\nJulie Summers, in her book \"The Colonel of Tamarkan\", writes that Boulle, who had been a prisoner of war in Thailand, created the fictional Nicholson character as an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers. He strongly denied the claim that the book was anti-British, although many involved in the film itself (including Alec Guinness) felt otherwise.\nErnest Gordon, a survivor of the railway construction and POW camps described in the novel/film, stated in his 1962 book, \"Through the Valley of the Kwai\": \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Pierre Boulle's book \"The Bridge over the River Kwai\" and the film which was based on it, the impression was given that British officers not only took part in building the bridge willingly, but finished in record time to demonstrate to the enemy their superior efficiency. This was an entertaining story. But I am writing a factual account, and in justice to these men\u2014living and dead\u2014who worked on that bridge, I must make it clear that we never did so willingly. We worked at bayonet point and under bamboo lash, taking any risk to sabotage the operation whenever the opportunity arose.\nA 1969 BBC television documentary, \"Return to the River Kwai\", made by former POW John Coast, sought to highlight the real history behind the film (partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis, for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt-Col Alfred Knights), which angered many former POWs. The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 (\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974) as \"Following the movie, this is a rerun of the antidote.\"\nSome of the characters in the film use the names of real people who were involved in the Burma Railway. Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends. Some Japanese viewers objected to the film's \"implication that they are incapable engineers\".\nThe major railway bridge described in the novel and film did not actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai. However, in 1943 a railway bridge was built by Allied POWs over the Mae Klong river\u2014renamed Khwae Yai in the 1960s as a result of the film\u2014at Tha Ma Kham, five kilometres from Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Boulle had never been to the bridge. He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" was a massive commercial success. It was the highest-grossing film of 1957 in the United States and Canada and was also the most popular film at the British box office that year. According to \"Variety\", the film earned estimated domestic box office revenues of $18,000,000 although this was revised downwards the following year to $15,000,000, which was still the biggest for 1958 and Columbia's highest-grossing film at the time. By October 1960, the film had earned worldwide box office revenues of $30 million.\nThe film was re-released in 1964 and earned a further estimated $2.6 million at the box office in the United States and Canada but the following year its revised total US and Canadian revenues were reported by \"Variety\" as $17,195,000.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 96% based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"This complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" praised the film as \"a towering entertainment of rich variety and revelation of the ways of men\". Mike Kaplan, reviewing for \"Variety\", described it as \"a gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.\" Kaplan further praised the actors, especially Alec Guinness, later writing \"the film is unquestionably\" his. William Holden was also credited for his acting for giving a solid characterization that was \"easy, credible and always likeable in a role that is the pivot point of the story\". Edwin Schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" claimed the film's strongest points were for being \"excellently produced in virtually all respects and that it also offers an especially outstanding and different performance by Alec Guinness. Highly competent work is also done by William Holden, Jack Hawkins and Sessue Hayakawa\". \"Time\" magazine praised Lean's directing, noting he demonstrates \"a dazzlingly musical sense and control of the many and involving rhythms of a vast composition. He shows a rare sense of humor and a feeling for the poetry of situation; and he shows the even rarer ability to express these things, not in lines but in lives.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" described the film as an \"excellent World War II adventure melodrama\" in which the \"production values are first-rate and so is the photography.\"\nAmong retrospective reviews, Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, noting that it is one of the few war movies that \"focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals\", but commented that the viewer is not certain what is intended by the final dialogue due to the film's shifting points of view. \"Slant\" magazine gave the film four out of five stars. \"Slant\" stated that \"the 1957 epic subtly develops its themes about the irrationality of honor and the hypocrisy of Britain's class system without ever compromising its thrilling war narrative\", and in comparing to other films of the time said that \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" \"carefully builds its psychological tension until it erupts in a blinding flash of sulfur and flame.\"\nBalu Mahendra, the Tamil film director, observed the shooting of this film at Kitulgala, Sri Lanka during his school trip and was inspired to become a film director. Warren Buffett said it was his favorite movie. In an interview, he said that \"[t]here were a lot of lessons in that... The ending of that was sort of the story of life. He created the railroad. Did he really want the enemy to come in across it?\"\nAccolades.\nAmerican Film Institute lists:\nThe film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nThe British Film Institute placed \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" as the 11th greatest British film.\nFirst TV broadcast.\nABC paid a record $1.8 million for the television rights for two TV broadcasts in the United States. The 167-minute film was first broadcast uncut and in color on the evening of 25 September 1966, as an ABC Movie Special, sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. The broadcast of the film was over three hours long, including commercial breaks. It was highly unusual at that time for a television network to show such a long film in one evening; most longer films were generally shown in two parts over two consecutive evenings. The movie drew huge ratings for ABC, with a record audience of 72 million and a Nielsen rating of 38.3 and an audience share of 61%.\nRestorations and home video releases.\nIn 1972, the movie was among the first selection of films released on the early Cartrivision video format, alongside classics such as \"The Jazz Singer\" and \"Sands of Iwo Jima\".\nThe film was restored in 1985 by Columbia Pictures. The separate dialogue, music and effects were located and remixed with newly recorded \"atmospheric\" sound effects. The image was restored by OCS, Freeze Frame, and Pixel Magic with George Hively editing.\nOn 2 November 2010 Columbia Pictures released a newly restored \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" for the first time on Blu-ray. According to Columbia Pictures, they followed an all-new 4K digital restoration from the original negative with newly restored 5.1 audio. The original negative for the feature was scanned at 4K (four times the resolution in High Definition), and the colour correction and digital restoration were also completed at 4K. The negative itself manifested many of the kinds of issues one would expect from a film of this vintage: torn frames, embedded emulsion dirt, scratches through every reel, colour fading. Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42858", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42858", "title": "Sudetenland", "text": "Historical name for areas of Czechoslovakia\nThe Sudetenland ( , ; Czech and ) is a German name for the northern, southern, and western areas of former Czechoslovakia which were inhabited primarily by Sudeten Germans. These German speakers had predominated in the border districts of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia since the Middle Ages.\nThe word \"Sudetenland\" did not come into being until the early part of the 20th century and did not come to prominence until almost two decades into the century, after World War I, when Austria-Hungary disintegrated and the Sudeten Germans found themselves living in the new country of Czechoslovakia. The \"Sudeten crisis\" of 1938 was provoked by the Pan-Germanist demands of Nazi Germany that the Sudetenland be annexed to Germany, which happened after the later Munich Agreement. Part of the borderland was invaded and annexed by Poland. Afterwards, the formerly unrecognized Sudetenland became an administrative division of Germany. When Czechoslovakia was reconstituted after World War II, the Sudeten Germans were expelled and the region today is inhabited almost exclusively by Czech speakers.\nThe word \"Sudetenland\" is a German compound of \"Sudeten\", the name of the Sudeten Mountains, which run along the northern Czech border and Lower Silesia (now in Poland), and \"Land\", meaning \"country\". The Sudetenland encompassed areas well beyond those mountains, however.\nParts of the now-Czech regions of Karlovy Vary, Liberec, Olomouc, Moravia-Silesia, South Moravia and \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem are within the former Sudetenland.\nHistory.\nThe areas later known as the Sudetenland never formed a single historical region, which makes it difficult to distinguish the history of the Sudetenland separately from that of Bohemia until the advent of nationalism in the 19th century.\nEarly origins.\nThe Celtic Boii settled there and the region was first mentioned on the map of Ptolemaios in the 2nd century AD. The Germanic tribe of the Marcomanni dominated the entire core of the region in later centuries. Those tribes already built cities like Brno, but moved west during the Migration Period. In the 7th century AD Slavic people moved in and were united under Samo's realm. Later in the High Middle Ages Germans settled into the less populated border region.\nIn the Middle Ages the regions situated on the mountainous border of the Duchy and the Kingdom of Bohemia (Crown of Saint V\u00e1clav) had since the Migration Period been settled mainly by western Slavic Czechs. Along the Bohemian Forest in the west, the Czech lands bordered on the German Slavic tribes (German Sorbs) stem duchies of Bavaria and Franconia; marches of the medieval German kingdom had also been established in the adjacent Austrian lands south of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands and the northern Meissen region beyond the Ore Mountains. In the course of the \"Ostsiedlung\" (settlement of the east), German settlement from the 13th century onwards continued to move into the Upper Lusatia region and the duchies of Silesia north of the Sudetes mountain range.\nFrom as early as the second half of the 13th century onwards these Bohemian border regions were settled by ethnic Germans, who were invited by the P\u0159emyslid Bohemian kings\u2014especially by Ottokar II (1253\u20131278) and Wenceslaus II (1278\u20131305). After the extinction of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty in 1306, the Bohemian nobility backed John of Luxembourg as king against his rival Duke Henry of Carinthia. In 1322, King John of Bohemia acquired (for the third time) the formerly Imperial Egerland region in the west and vassalized most of the Piast Silesian duchies, as acknowledged by King Casimir III of Poland by the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin. His son, Bohemian King Charles IV, was elected King of the Romans in 1346 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1355. He added the Lusatias to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, which then comprised large territories with a significant German population.\nIn the hilly border regions German settlers established major manufactures of forest glass. The situation of the German population was aggravated by the Hussite Wars (1419\u20131434), though there were also some Germans among the Hussite insurgents. Despite the hardships of the Hussite Wars, the German population remained dominant in the border regions.\nBy then Germans largely settled the hilly Bohemian border regions as well as the cities of the lowlands; mainly people of Bavarian descent in the South Bohemian and South Moravian Region, in Brno, Jihlava, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and the West Bohemian Plze\u0148 Region; Franconian people in \u017datec; Upper Saxons in adjacent North Bohemia, where the border with the Saxon Electorate was fixed by the 1459 Peace of Eger; Germanic Silesians in the adjacent Sudetes region with the County of Kladsko, in the Moravian\u2013Silesian Region, in Svitavy and Olomouc. The city of Prague had a German-speaking majority from the last third of the 17th century until 1860, but after 1910 the proportion of German speakers had decreased to 6.7% of the population.\nFrom the Luxembourgs, rule over Bohemia passed through George of Podiebrad to the Jagiellon dynasty and finally to the House of Habsburg in 1526. Both Czech and German Bohemians suffered heavily in the Thirty Years' War. Bohemia lost 70% of its population. From the defeat of the Bohemian Revolt that collapsed at the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburgs gradually integrated the Kingdom of Bohemia into their monarchy. During the subsequent Counter-Reformation, less populated areas were resettled with Catholic Germans from the Austrian lands. From 1627, the Habsburgs enforced the so-called \"Verneuerte Landesordnung\" (\"Renewed Land's Constitution\"), and one of its consequences was that German, according to mother tongue, gradually became the primary and official language, while Czech declined to a secondary role in the Empire. In 1749, the Austrian Empire enforced German as the official language again. Emperor Joseph II in 1780 renounced the coronation ceremony as Bohemian king and unsuccessfully tried to push German through as sole official language in all Habsburg lands (including Hungary). Nevertheless, German cultural influence grew stronger during the Age of Enlightenment and Weimar Classicism.\nContrastingly, in the course of the Romanticism movement national tensions arose, both in the form of the Austroslavism ideology developed by Czech politicians like Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd and Pan-Germanist activist raising the German question. Conflicts between Czech and German nationalists emerged in the 19th century, for instance in the Revolutions of 1848: while the German-speaking population of Bohemia and Moravia wanted to participate in the building of a German nation state, the Czech-speaking population insisted on keeping Bohemia out of such plans. The Bohemian Kingdom remained a part of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary until its dismemberment after the World War I.\nEmergence of the term.\nIn the wake of growing nationalism, the name \"\"Sudetendeutsche\"\" (Sudeten Germans) emerged by the early 20th century. It originally constituted part of a larger classification of three groupings of Germans within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which also included \"\"Alpine Deutschen\"\" (\"Alpine Germans\") in what later became the Republic of Austria and \"\"Balkandeutsche\"\" (\"Balkan Germans\") in Hungary and the regions east of it. Of these three terms, only the term \"\"Sudetendeutsche\"\" survived, because of the ethnic and cultural conflicts within Bohemia.\nWorld War I and aftermath.\nDuring World War I, what later became known as the Sudetenland experienced a rate of war deaths that was higher than most other German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary and exceeded only by German South Moravia and Carinthia. Thirty-four of each 1,000 inhabitants were killed.\nAustria-Hungary broke apart at the end of World War I. In late October 1918, an independent Czechoslovak state, consisting of the lands of the Bohemian kingdom and areas belonging to the Kingdom of Hungary, was proclaimed. The German deputies of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia in the Imperial Council (\"Reichsrat\") referred to the Fourteen Points of US President Woodrow Wilson and the right proposed therein to self-determination and attempted to negotiate the union of the German-speaking territories with the new Republic of German Austria, which itself aimed at joining Weimar Germany.\nThe German-speaking parts of the former Lands of the Bohemian Crown were to be part of a newly created Czechoslovakia, a multi-ethnic state of several nations: Czechs, Germans, Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles and Ruthenians. On 20 September 1918, the Prague government asked for the opinion of the United States on the Sudetenland. Wilson sent Ambassador Archibald Coolidge into Czechoslovakia. Coolidge insisted on respecting the Germans' right to self-determination and uniting all German-speaking areas with either Germany or Austria, with the exception of northern Bohemia. However, the American delegation at the Paris talks decided not to follow Coolidge's proposal. Allen Dulles was the American's chief diplomat in the Czechoslovak Commission and emphasized preserving the unity of the Czech lands.\nFour regional governmental units were established:\nThe U.S. commission to the Paris Peace Conference issued a declaration, which gave unanimous support for \"unity of Czech lands\". In particular the declaration stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Commission was... unanimous in its recommendation that the separation of all areas inhabited by the German-Bohemians would not only expose Czechoslovakia to great dangers but equally create great difficulties for the Germans themselves. The only practicable solution was to incorporate these Germans into Czechoslovakia.\nSeveral German minorities according to their mother tongue in Moravia, including German-speaking populations in Brno, Jihlava and Olomouc, also attempted to proclaim their union with German Austria.\nIn sum, the Czechs rejected the aspirations of the German Bohemians and demanded the inclusion of the lands inhabited by ethnic Germans in their state, on the grounds that they had always been part of the lands of the Bohemian Crown. These lands were in some instances more than 90% (as of 1921) ethnically German, which made the whole of Czechoslovakia 23.4% German.\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1919 affirmed the inclusion of the German-speaking territories within Czechoslovakia. Over the next two decades, some Germans in the Sudetenland continued to strive for a separation of the regions from Czechoslovakia.\nAccording to Elizabeth Wiskemann, despite the initial resistance to the Czechoslovak rule, the Sudeten German population was not entirely opposed to annexation by Czechoslovakia. Sudeten economy and industry relied on the rest of Bohemia, and local industrialists were afraid of \"Reich German competition and therefore of the talk of handing them over\". Many Sudeten Germans also opposed joining Austria, arguing that being incorporated into Austria would turn Sudeten lands into \"economically helpless Austrian enclaves\". Because of this, Sudetenland becoming part of Czechoslovakia was the preferable choice of \"a good deal of cautious middle-class\" amongst Sudeten Germans. Silesian-Sudeten Germans were particularly pro-Czechoslovak, as they strongly preferred Czechoslovak rule to the prospect of becoming a part of Poland.\nWithin the Czechoslovak Republic (1918\u20131938).\nAccording to the February 1921 census, 3,123,000 native German speakers lived in Czechoslovakia, 23.4% of the total population. The controversies between the Czechs and the German-speaking minority lingered on throughout the 1920s and intensified in the 1930s.\nDuring the Great Depression, the mostly-mountainous regions populated by the German minority, together with other peripheral regions of Czechoslovakia, were hurt by the economic depression more than the interior of the country was. Unlike the less developed regions (Carpathian Ruthenia, Moravian Wallachia), the Sudetenland had a high concentration of vulnerable export-dependent industries (such as glass works, textile industry, paper-making and toy-making industry). Sixty percent of the bijouterie and glassmaking industry were located in the Sudetenland, and 69% of employees in the sector were German-speaking according to mother tongue, and 95% of bijouterie and 78% of other glassware was produced for export. The glass-making sector was affected by decreased spending power and by protective measures in other countries, and many German workers lost their work.\nThe high unemployment, as well as the imposition of Czech in schools and all public spaces, made people more open to populist and extremist movements such as fascism, communism and German irredentism. In those years, parties of German nationalists and later the Sudeten German Party (SdP), with its radical demands gained immense popularity, among Germans in Czechoslovakia.\nSudeten Crisis.\nThe increasing aggressiveness of Hitler prompted the Czechoslovak military to start to build extensive border fortifications in 1936 to defend the troubled border region. Immediately after the \"Anschluss\" of Austria into the German Reich in March 1938, Hitler made himself the advocate of ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia, which triggered the Sudeten Crisis. The following month, Sudeten Nazis, led by Konrad Henlein, agitated for autonomy. On 24 April 1938, the SdP proclaimed the Karlsbader Programm, which demanded in eight points the complete equality between the Sudeten Germans and the Czech people. The government accepted those claims on 30 June 1938.\nIn August, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sent Lord Runciman on a mission to Czechoslovakia to see if he could obtain a settlement between the Czechoslovak government and the Germans in the Sudetenland. Runciman's first day included meetings with President Bene\u0161 and Prime Minister Milan Hod\u017ea as well as a direct meeting with the Sudeten Germans from Henlein's SdP. On the next day, he met with Dr and Mme Bene\u0161 and later met non-Nazi Germans in his hotel.\nA full account of his report, including summaries of the conclusions of his meetings with the various parties, which he made in person to the Cabinet on his return to the United Kingdom, is found in the Document CC 39(38). Lord Runciman expressed sadness that he could not bring about agreement with the various parties, but he agreed with Lord Halifax that the time that had been gained was important. He reported on the situation of the Sudeten Germans and gave details of four plans that had been proposed to deal with the crisis, each of which had points that, he reported, made it unacceptable to the other parties to the negotiations.\nThe four plans included, first, the transfer of the Sudetenland to the Reich, second, holding a plebiscite on the transfer of the Sudetenland to the Reich, third, organising a Four-Power Conference on the matter and, fourth, creating a federal Czechoslovakia. At the meeting, he said that he was very reluctant to offer his own solution and had not seen that as his task. The most that Halifax said was that the great centres of opposition were in Eger and Asch, in the northwestern corner of Bohemia, where about 800,000 Germans and very few others lived.\nHalifax said that the transfer of these areas to Germany would almost certainly be a good thing adding that the Czechoslovak army would certainly oppose that very strongly and that Bene\u0161 had said that it would fight, rather than accept it.\nBritish Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met Adolf Hitler in Berchtesgaden on 15 September and agreed to the cession of the Sudetenland. Three days later, French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Daladier did the same. No Czechoslovak representative was invited to the discussions. Germany was now able to walk into the Sudetenland without firing a shot.\nChamberlain met Hitler in Godesberg on 22 September 1938 to confirm the agreements. Hitler, aiming to use the crisis as a pretext for war, now demanded not only the annexation of the Sudetenland but also the immediate military occupation of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, thus giving the Czechoslovak army no time to adapt its defence measures to the new borders.\nHitler, in a speech at the Sportpalast in Berlin, claimed that the Sudetenland was \"the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe\" and gave Czechoslovakia a deadline of 28 September 1938 at 2:00\u00a0p.m. to cede the Sudetenland to Germany or face war.\nTo achieve a solution, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, suggested a conference of the major powers in Munich, and on 29 September, Hitler, Daladier and Chamberlain met and agreed to Mussolini's proposal (actually prepared by Hermann G\u00f6ring) and signed the Munich Agreement. They accepted the immediate occupation of the Sudetenland. The Czechoslovak government, though not party to the talks, submitted to compulsion and promised to abide by the agreement on 30 September.\nThe Sudetenland was assigned to Germany between 1 and 10 October 1938. The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was subsequently invaded by Germany in March 1939, with a portion being annexed and the remainder turned into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The Slovak part declared its independence from Czechoslovakia and became the Slovak Republic (Slovak State), a satellite state allied to Germany. (The Ruthenian part, Subcarpathian Rus, made also an attempt to declare its sovereignty as Carpatho-Ukraine but only with ephemeral success since the area was soon annexed by Hungary.)\nAlthough \"Henlein and the SdP had become accessories in Hitler's escalating campaign to annex the Sudetenland to the German Reich\" by the summer of 1938, the supporters of the SdP supported autonomy within Czechoslovakia rather than annexation into Germany. Contemporary reports of The Times found that there was a \"large number of Sudetenlanders who actively opposed annexation\", and that the pro-German policy was challenged by the moderates within the SdP as well; according to Wickham Steed, over 50% of Henlein's supporters favoured greater autonomy within Czechoslovakia rather than joining Germany. Sudeten German historian Emil Franzel argues that the mainstream wing of Henlein's party was \"not striving for annexation to Germany, but for genuine autonomy\", and the majority of negotiators who conducted talks with Hod\u017ea and Bene\u0161 belonged to the pro-autonomy wing and were unaware of Henlein's agreements with Hitler.\nPart of the borderland had an ethnic Polish majority and was invaded and annexed by Poland in 1938.\nSudetenland as part of Germany.\nThe Sudetenland was initially put under military administration, with General Wilhelm Keitel as military governor. On 14 April 1939, the annexed territories were divided, with the southern parts being incorporated into the neighbouring Reichsgaue of \"Niederdonau\", \"Oberdonau\" and \"Bayerische Ostmark\".\nThe northern and the western parts were reorganised as the \"Reichsgau Sudetenland\", with the city of Reichenberg (present-day Liberec) established as its capital. Konrad Henlein (now openly an NSDAP member) administered the district first as \"Reichskommissar\" (until 1 May 1939) and then as \"Reichsstatthalter\" (1 May 1939\u00a0\u2013 4 May 1945). The Sudetenland consisted of three administrative districts (\"Regierungsbezirke\"): Eger (with Karlsbad as capital), Aussig (Aussig) and Troppau (Troppau).\nBefore the occupation, Jews in the area had become targeted during the Holocaust in the Sudetenland. Only a few weeks later, the Kristallnacht occurred. As elsewhere in Germany, many synagogues were set on fire and numerous leading Jews were sent to concentration camps. Jews and Czechs were not the only afflicted peoples since German socialists, communists and pacifists were widely persecuted as well. Some of the German socialists fled the Sudetenland via Prague and London to other countries. The \"Gleichschaltung\" would permanently alter the community in the Sudetenland.\nHowever, on 4 December 1938, there were elections in Reichsgau Sudetenland in which 97.32% of the adult population voted for the NSDAP. About a half million Sudeten Germans joined the Nazi Party, 17.34% of the total German population in the Sudetenland (the average NSDAP membership participation in Germany was merely 7.85% in 1944). That means the Sudetenland was one of the most pro-Nazi regions of Nazi Germany. Because of their knowledge of the Czech language, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the ethnic Czech Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as well as in Nazi organizations (Gestapo etc.). The most notable one was Karl Hermann Frank, the SS and police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.\nNazi Germany occupied Sudetenland from 1938 to 1945. The annexation was supported by many Bohemian and Moravian Germans. The new Sudetengau was treated as an \u201cendangered borderland.\u201d Using the same borderland funding that Saxony and Bavaria had received since 1931, the German government flooded northern Bohemia with funds to boost social welfare aid and to reduce unemployment. However, Bohemian Germans soon complained that the German occupation had also brought inflation, a declining standard of living, and a new form of outside rule, as Altreich bureaucrats filled business and government positions in the Sudetengau.\nExpulsions and resettlement after World War II.\nShortly after the liberation of Czechoslovakia in May 1945, the use of the term \"Sudety\" (Sudetenland) in official communications was banned and replaced by the term \"pohrani\u010dn\u00ed \u00fazem\u00ed\" (border territory). The Berlin Declaration of 5 June 1945 disabled German annexation of Sudetenland legally.\nIn the summer of 1945, the Potsdam Conference decided that Sudeten Germans would have to leave Czechoslovakia. As a consequence of the immense hostility against all Germans that had grown within Czechoslovakia because many of them had helped the Nazis, the overwhelming majority of Germans were expelled though the relevant Czechoslovak legislation had provided for Germans to remain if they could prove their anti-Nazi affiliation.\nThe number of expelled Germans in the early phase (spring-summer 1945) is estimated to be around 500,000 people. After the Bene\u0161 decrees, nearly all Germans were expelled starting in 1946 and in 1950 only 159,938 (from 3,149,820 in 1930) still lived in the Czech Republic. The remaining Germans, who were proven antifascists and skilled laborers, were allowed to stay in Czechoslovakia but were later forcefully dispersed within the country. Some German refugees from Czechoslovakia are represented by the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft.\nMany of the Germans who stayed in Czechoslovakia later emigrated to West Germany (more than 100,000). As the German population was transferred out of the country, the former Sudetenland was resettled mostly by Czechs but also by other nationalities of Czechoslovakia: Slovaks, Greeks (arriving in the wake of the Greek Civil War 1946\u201349), Carpathian Ruthenians, Romani people and Jews who had survived the Holocaust, and Hungarians (though the Hungarians were forced to do so and later returned home\u2014see Hungarians in Slovakia: Population exchanges).\nSome areas, such as part of Czech Silesian-Moravian borderland, southwestern Bohemia (\u0160umava National Park), western and northern parts of Bohemia, remained depopulated for several strategic reasons (extensive mining and military interests) or are now protected national parks and landscapes. Moreover, before the establishment of the Iron Curtain in 1952 to 1955, the so-called \"forbidden zone\" was established by means of engineer equipment up to 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) from the border in which no civilians could reside. A wider region, or \"border zone\", existed up to 12\u00a0km (7 miles) from the border in which no \"disloyal\" or \"suspect\" civilians could reside or work. Thus, the entire A\u0161-Bulge fell within the border zone, a status that remained until the Velvet Revolution in 1989.\nThere remained areas with noticeable German minorities in the westernmost borderland around Cheb, where skilled ethnic German miners and workers continued in mining and industry, until 1955, as sanctioned under the Yalta Conference protocols; in the Egerland, German minority organizations continue to exist.\nIn the 2021 census, 24,632 people in the Czech Republic claimed German ethnicity, 15,504 of which in combination with another ethnicity, a sharp reduce compared to the 3,123,568 Germans reportedly living in the Czechoslovak Republic in 1921. In the modern day, the Bohemian German dialects and the Moravian German dialects have largely disappeared because remaining Germans employ Standard German.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The play dramatizes the experiences of Blanche DuBois, a former Southern belle who, after encountering a series of personal losses, leaves her once-prosperous situation to move into a shabby apartment in New Orleans rented by her younger sister Stella and brother-in-law Stanley.\n\"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is one of the most critically acclaimed plays of the 20th century and Williams's most popular work. It still ranks among his most performed plays, and has inspired many adaptations in other forms, notably a critically acclaimed film that was released in 1951.\nName.\nBlanche is mentioned in the play as arriving at Stella's apartment by riding in a streetcar on the Desire streetcar line. Tennessee Williams was living in an apartment on Toulouse Street in New Orleans' French Quarter when he wrote \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". The old Desire streetcar line ran only a half-block away.\nIn the 1951 film, Blanche is shown riding the car. In the interim between writing the play and shooting the film, though, the line was converted into a bus service (1948), and the production team had to seek permission from the authorities to hire out a streetcar with the \"Desire\" name on it.\nPlot.\nAfter the loss of her family home to creditors, Blanche DuBois travels from Laurel, Mississippi, to the New Orleans French Quarter to live with her younger married sister, Stella, and Stella's husband, Stanley Kowalski. She is in her thirties and, with no money, has nowhere else to go.\nBlanche tells Stella that she has taken a leave of absence from her English-teaching position because of her nerves (which is later revealed to be a lie). Blanche laments the shabbiness of her sister's two-room flat. She finds Stanley loud and rough, eventually referring to him as \"common\". Stanley, in return, is suspicious of Blanche, does not care for her manners and resents her presence which is already interfering with his regimented but hedonistic lifestyle.\nFrom the first scene, Blanche is nervous and jittery. She is reluctant to be seen in the glare of light and seems to have a drinking problem. She is also deceptive and is critical of her sister and brother-in-law.\nStanley later questions Blanche about her earlier marriage. Blanche had married when she was very young, but her husband committed suicide. This memory causes her obvious distress. The audience later learns she suffers from guilt due to the way she had reacted to finding out her husband's homosexuality and his fatal reaction. Stanley, worried that he has been cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. He tells Stella about the Napoleonic Code, stating that with it a husband had control over his wife's financial affairs. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband. For a moment, Stanley seems caught off guard over her proclaimed feelings. Afterwards, he informs Blanche that Stella is going to have a baby.\nThe night after Blanche's arrival, during one of Stanley's poker games, Blanche meets Mitch, one of Stanley's poker player buddies. His courteous manner sets him apart from the other men. Their chat becomes flirtatious and friendly, and Blanche easily charms him; they like each other. Suddenly becoming upset over repeated interruptions, Stanley explodes in a drunken rage and strikes Stella. Blanche and Stella take refuge with the upstairs neighbor, Eunice Hubbell. When Stanley recovers, he cries out from the courtyard below for Stella to come back by repeatedly calling her name until she comes down and allows herself to be carried off to bed. Blanche is shocked to see that her sister has returned to her husband right after he assaulted her. After Stella returns to Stanley, Blanche and Mitch sit at the bottom of the steps in the courtyard, where Mitch apologizes for Stanley's coarse behavior.\nThe next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and describes Stanley as subhuman, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley are fine. Stanley overhears the conversation but keeps silent. When Stanley comes in, Stella hugs and kisses him, letting Blanche know that her low opinion of Stanley does not matter.\nAs the weeks pass, the friction between Blanche and Stanley continues to grow. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella that she wants to go away with him and not be anyone's problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later killed himself when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. Mitch also has lost someone and seems to have empathy with Blanche's situation.\nLater, Stanley repeats gossip to Stella from a seedy salesman with contacts in Laurel that Blanche was fired from her teaching job for involvement with an under-age student and that she lived at a hotel known for prostitution. Stella erupts in anger over Stanley's cruelty after he reveals he has already told Mitch. Later that evening, at Blanche's birthday party, there is an empty seat at the table for Mitch. Stanley gives Blanche a birthday \"present\", a one-way ticket back to Laurel by Greyhound bus. An argument ensues between Stella and Stanley, but is cut short as Stella goes into unexpected labor and is taken by her husband to the hospital.\nAs Blanche waits at home alone, Mitch arrives and confronts Blanche with the stories that Stanley has told him. She eventually confesses that the stories are true. She pleads for forgiveness. An angry and humiliated Mitch rejects her. Nevertheless, he demands sex from her, suggesting that it is his right since he has waited for so long for nothing. Blanche threatens to cry fire and tells him to get out.\nStanley returns home to find Blanche alone in the apartment. She has descended into another fantasy about an old suitor coming to provide financial support and take her away from New Orleans. She falsely claims that Mitch had asked for her forgiveness, but she had rejected him. Stanley goes along with the act before angrily scorning Blanche's lies, hypocrisy and behavior, and calling out her lie about Mitch. He advances toward her; in response, she threatens to attack him with a broken bottle, but is overpowered. Blanche collapses on the floor and Stanley is last seen taking her unconscious into his bed.\nSome time in the near future, during a poker game at the Kowalski apartment, Stella and Eunice are seen packing Blanche's meager belongings while Blanche takes a bath in a catatonic state, having suffered a mental breakdown. Although Blanche has told Stella about Stanley raping her (which he denies), Stella cannot bring herself to believe her sister's story. When a doctor and a matron arrive to take Blanche to the hospital, she initially resists them and the nurse painfully restrains her. Mitch, present at the poker game, breaks down in tears. The doctor is far more gentle and she goes willingly with him, saying, \"Whoever you are \u2013 I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\" The poker game continues, uninterrupted.\nCast and characters.\nNotable productions\nProduction history.\nOriginal Broadway production.\nThe original Broadway production was produced by Irene Mayer Selznick and directed by Elia Kazan. It opened at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in early November 1947, then played the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia before moving to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on December 3, 1947. Selznick originally wanted to cast Margaret Sullavan and John Garfield, but settled on the less well-known Jessica Tandy and a virtual unknown at the time, Marlon Brando. The opening night cast also included Kim Hunter as Stella and Karl Malden as Mitch. Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play \"Portrait of a Madonna\". Williams believed that casting Brando, who was young for the part as it was originally conceived, would evolve Kowalski from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to youthful ignorance. Despite its shocking scenes and gritty dialogue, the audience applauded the debut performance. Brooks Atkinson, reviewing the opening in \"The New York Times\", described Tandy's \"superb performance\" as \"almost incredibly true\", concluding that Williams \"has spun a poignant and luminous story\".\nLater in the run, Uta Hagen succeeded Tandy, Carmelita Pope succeeded Hunter, and Anthony Quinn succeeded Brando. Hagen and Quinn took the show on a national tour directed by Harold Clurman, and then returned to Broadway for additional performances. Ralph Meeker also took on the part of Stanley both in the Broadway and touring companies. Tandy received a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 1948, sharing the honor with Judith Anderson and Katharine Cornell. The original Broadway production closed, after 855 performances, in 1949.\nThe original cast included, Jessica Tandy as Blanche DuBois, Karl Malden as Harold \"Mitch\" Mitchell, Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski, Kim Hunter as Stella Kowalski, Rudy Bond as Steve Hubbell, Nick Dennis as Pablo Gonzales, Peg Hillias as Eunice Hubbell, Vito Christi as Young Collector, Richard Garrick as Doctor, Ann Dere as Nurse (later called the Matron), Gee Gee James as Negro Woman and Edna Thomas as Mexican Woman.\nOther early productions.\nThe first adaptation of \"Streetcar\" in Greece was performed in 1948 by Koun's Art Theater, two years before its film adaptation and one year before its London premiere, directed by Karolos Koun starring Melina Mercouri as Blanche and Vasilis Diamantopoulos as Stanley, with original music by Manos Hadjidakis.\nThe London production, directed by Laurence Olivier, opened at the Aldwych Theatre on October 12, 1949. It starred Bonar Colleano as Stanley, Vivien Leigh as Blanche, Ren\u00e9e Asherson as Stella and Bernard Braden as Mitch.\nAn Australian production with Viola Keats as Blanche and Arthur Franz as Stanley opened at the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne in February 1950.\nRevivals.\nThe first all-black production of \"Streetcar\" was likely performed by the Summer Theatre Company at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, in August 1953 and directed by one of Williams's former classmates at Iowa, Thomas D. Pawley, as noted in the \"Streetcar\" edition of the \"Plays in Production\" series published by Cambridge University Press.\nTallulah Bankhead, for whom Williams originally had written the role of Blanche, starred in a 1956 New York City Center Company production directed by Herbert Machiz.\nIn 1972, American composer Frances Ziffer set \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" to music.\nThe first Broadway revival of the play was in 1973. It was produced by the Lincoln Center, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, and starred Rosemary Harris as Blanche, James Farentino as Stanley and Patricia Conolly as Stella.\nIn 1976, Rip Torn enlisted director Jack Gelber to helm a revival at the once celebrated Academy Festival Theatre in Lake Forest, Illinois starring himself as Stanley and his wife Geraldine Page as Blanche. The production was threateningly realistic, projecting a\nbrightly lit, garbage-filled stage reflecting a hostile, predatory world and immersing the audience in a total\ntheatre experience. Gelber's Streetcar was troubling for the critics because it was raw, even\ndangerous. It pushed the Streetcar script to the farthest reaches of\nurban violence and unabated naturalism. One review said \"This is not the Blanche of butterfly wings. This is gossamer with guts.\" Page's performance was described as displaying little of Leigh's hysteria or Tandy's forlorn helplessness.\nThe spring 1988 revival at the Circle in the Square Theatre starred Aidan Quinn opposite Blythe Danner as Blanche and Frances McDormand as Stella.\nA highly publicized and acclaimed revival in 1992 starred Alec Baldwin as Stanley and Jessica Lange as Blanche. It was staged at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where the original production was staged. This production proved so successful that it was filmed for television. It featured Timothy Carhart as Mitch and Amy Madigan as Stella, as well as future \"Sopranos\" stars James Gandolfini and Aida Turturro. Gandolfini was Carhart's understudy.\nIn 1997, Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carr\u00e9 in New Orleans mounted a 50th Anniversary production, with music by the Marsalis family, starring Michael Arata and Shelly Poncy. In 2009, the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, where the original pre-Broadway tryout was held, staged a production of the play.\nIn 1997, at Steppenwolf Theatre, Chicago IL, Gary Sinise as Stanley, John C Reilly as Mitch, Kathryn Erbe as Stella, and Laila Robins as Blanche.\nGlenn Close starred in Trevor Nunn's 2002 production for the National Theatre at the Lyttleton Theatre, London.\nThe 2005 Broadway revival was directed by Edward Hall and produced by The Roundabout Theater Company. It starred John C. Reilly as Stanley, Amy Ryan as Stella, and Natasha Richardson as Blanche. The production was Richardson's final appearance on Broadway; she died in 2009 following a skiing accident.\nBette Bourne and Paul Shaw of the British gay theater company Bloolips, and Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver of the American lesbian theater company Split Britches, collaborated and performed a gender-bent adaptation titled \"Belle Reprieve\". Blanche was played as \"man in a dress\", Stanley as a \"butch lesbian\", Mitch as a \"fairy disguised as a man\", and Stella as a \"woman disguised as a woman\".\nThe Sydney Theatre Company production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" premiered on September 5 and ran until October 17, 2009. This production, directed by Liv Ullmann, starred Cate Blanchett as Blanche, Joel Edgerton as Stanley, Robin McLeavy as Stella and Tim Richards as Mitch.\nFrom July 2009 until October 2009, Rachel Weisz and Ruth Wilson starred in a highly acclaimed revival of the play in London's West End at the Donmar Warehouse directed by Rob Ashford.\nIn April 2012, Blair Underwood, Nicole Ari Parker, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Wood Harris starred in a multiracial adaptation at the Broadhurst Theatre. Theatre review aggregator \"Curtain Critic\" gave the production a score of 61 out of 100 based on the opinions of 17 critics.\nA production at the Young Vic, London, opened on July 23, 2014, and closed on September 19, 2014. Directed by Benedict Andrews and starring Gillian Anderson, Ben Foster, Vanessa Kirby and Corey Johnson; this production garnered critical acclaim and is the fastest-selling show produced by the Young Vic. On September 16, 2014, the performance was relayed live to over one thousand cinemas in the UK as part of the National Theatre Live project. Thus far, the production has been screened in over 2000 venues. From April 23, 2016, until June 4, 2016, the production was reprised at the new St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. In 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns, it was released for free on YouTube as part of the National Theatre At Home series.\nIn 2016 Sarah Frankcom directed a production at the Royal Exchange in Manchester starring Maxine Peake, Ben Batt, Sharon Duncan Brewster and Youssef Kerkour. It opened on 8 September and closed on 15 October. It was well-received, and Peake's performance in particular received praise.\nIn 2018, it headlined the third annual Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis at the Grandel Theatre. Carrie Houk, the Festival's Executive Artistic Director, and Tim Ocel, the director of the play, chose to cast the play with actors whose ages were close to Tennessee Williams' original intentions. (The birthday party is for Blanche's 30th birthday.) Sophia Brown starred as Blanche, with Nick Narcisi as Stanley, Lana Dvorak as Stella, and Spencer Sickmann as Mitch. Henry Polkes composed the original score, and James Wolk designed the set. The critics were unanimous in their praise.\nThe play was revived again in 2022 at London's Almeida Theatre under the direction of Rebecca Frecknall, with Patsy Ferran taking the role of Blanche opposite Paul Mescal as Stanley, and Anjana Vasan as Stella. The play received widespread critical acclaim and its West End transfer became the fastest-selling production to date in any Ambassador Theatre Group venue. The revival received 6 Laurence Olivier Awards nominations, winning 3: Best Revival; and Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress for Mescal and Vasan respectively.\nIn February 2024, , a liberal arts school that received much of Tennessee Williams' estate, revived the play, under the direction of James Crawford. The Tennessee Williams Center in Sewanee houses the university's theatre departments while the school owns the rights to Williams' works. With the show being sold out within days, the production received local acclaim from residents and the student body.\nA Pitlochry Festival Theatre production of the play, directed by Elizabeth Newman and with Kirsty Stuart in the role of Blanche DuBois, was staged at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh in October and November 2024.\nThe 2022 Almeida Theatre production is scheduled to return to the West End for a limited three week run at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre from 3 February 2025. The show is then scheduled to transfer to New York City at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 28 February 2025. The entire 2022 revival cast is expected to reprise their roles.\nIn March 2025 a Sheffield Theatres production is running at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Directed by Josh Seymour. The cast includes Joanna Vanderham as Blanche. With Amara Okereke as Stella, Jake Dunn as Stanley and Taylor Kovacevic-Ebong as Mitch.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nIn 1951, Warner Bros. released a film adaptation of the play, directed by Elia Kazan. Malden, Brando, Dennis, and Hunter reprised their Broadway roles. They were joined by Vivien Leigh from the London production in the part of Blanche. The movie won four Academy Awards, including three acting awards (Leigh for Best Actress, Malden for Best Supporting Actor and Hunter for Best Supporting Actress), the first time a film won three out of four acting awards (Brando was nominated for Best Actor but lost). Composer Alex North received an Academy Award nomination for this, his first film score. Jessica Tandy was the only lead actor from the original Broadway production not to appear in the 1951 film. The ending was slightly altered. Stella does not remain with Stanley as she does in the play.\nPedro Almod\u00f3var's 1999 Academy Award-winning film \"All About My Mother\" features a Spanish-language version of the play being performed by some of the supporting characters and the play plays an important role in the film. However, some of the film's dialogue is taken from the 1951 film version, not the original stage version.\nThe 1973 Woody Allen film \"Sleeper\" includes a late scene in which Miles (Woody) and Luna (Diane Keaton) briefly take on the roles of Stanley (Luna) and Blanche (Miles).\nIt was noted by many critics that the 2013 Academy Award-winning Woody Allen film \"Blue Jasmine\" had much in common with \"Streetcar\" and is most likely a loose adaptation. It shares a very similar plot and characters, although it has been suitably updated for modern film audiences.\nIn 2014, Gillian Anderson directed and starred in a short prequel to \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", titled \"The Departure\". The short film was written by the novelist Andrew O'Hagan and is part of Young Vic's short film series, which was produced in collaboration with \"The Guardian\".\nOpera.\nIn 1995, an opera was adapted and composed by Andr\u00e9 Previn with a libretto by Philip Littell. It had its premiere at the San Francisco Opera during the 1998\u20131999 season, and featured Ren\u00e9e Fleming as Blanche.\nBallet.\nA 1952 ballet production with choreography by Valerie Bettis, which Mia Slavenska and Frederic Franklin's Slavenska-Franklin Ballet debuted at Her Majesty's Theatre in Montreal, featured the music of Alex North, who had composed the music for the 1951 film.\nAnother ballet production was staged by John Neumeier in Frankfurt in 1983. Music included \"Visions fugitives\" by Prokofiev and Alfred Schnittke's First Symphony.\nIn the mid-2000s, another production was staged by Winthrop Corey, then artistic director of Mobile Ballet.\nIn 2006, a production was staged by John Alleyne, then artistic director of Ballet BC.\nIn 2012, Scottish Ballet collaborated with theatre and film director Nancy Meckler and international choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa to create a staging of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".\nIn 2018, the Erkel Theatre in Budapest revisited the production with Marianna Venekei choreographing, Iurii Kekalo dancing as Stanley Kowalski, Lea F\u00f6ldi as Blanche DuBois, and Anna Krupp as Stella.\nTelevision.\nIn 1955, the television program \"Omnibus\" featured Jessica Tandy reviving her original Broadway performance as Blanche, with her husband, Hume Cronyn, as Mitch. It aired only portions of the play that featured the Blanche and Mitch characters.\nThe 1984 television version featured Ann-Margret as Blanche, Treat Williams as Stanley, Beverly D'Angelo as Stella and Randy Quaid as Mitch. It was directed by John Erman and the teleplay was adapted by Oscar Saul. The music score by composed by Marvin Hamlisch. Ann-Margret, D'Angelo and Quaid were all nominated for Emmy Awards, but none won. However, it did win four Emmys, including one for cinematographer Bill Butler. Ann-Margret won a Golden Globe award for her performance, and Treat Williams was nominated for Best Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie.\nA 1995 television version was based on the highly successful Broadway revival that starred Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange. However, only Baldwin and Lange were from the stage production. The TV version added John Goodman as Mitch and Diane Lane as Stella. This production was directed by Glenn Jordan. Baldwin, Lange and Goodman all received Emmy Award nominations. Lange won a Golden Globe award (for Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie), and Baldwin was nominated for Best Actor.\nIn 1998, PBS aired a taped version of the opera adaptation that featured the original San Francisco Opera cast. The program received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Classical Music/Dance Program.\nIn a 1992 episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"A Streetcar Named Marge\", a musical version of the play, titled \"Oh, Streetcar!\", was featured. Ned Flanders and Marge Simpson took the leading roles as Stanley and Blanche, respectively.\nIn 2014, singer Sinead O'Connor released \"Streetcars,\" a song that references the play in its title and themes.\nIn a 2016 episode of \"The Originals\", titled \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", Klaus Mikaelson and Elijah Mikaelson are forced to face two siblings, Tristan and Aurora de Martel, once friends but now foes.\nInspirations.\nThe Desire Line ran from 1920 to 1948, at the height of streetcar use in New Orleans. The route ran down Royal, through the Quarter, to Desire Street in the Bywater district, and back up to Canal. Blanche's route in the play\u2014\"They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at\u2014Elysian Fields!\"\u2014is allegorical, taking advantage of New Orleans's colorful street names: the Desire line crossed Elysian Fields Avenue on its way to Canal Street. There, one could transfer to the Cemeteries line, which ran along Canal, blocks away from Elysian Fields.\nThe character of Blanche is thought to be based on Williams' sister, Rose Williams, who struggled with mental health problems and became incapacitated after a lobotomy. The success of the play enabled Williams to finance his sister's care. Other biographical elements include Williams' mother being a Southern lady reflected in the Southern background of Stella and Blanche, and his father being a travelling salesman (as reflected in Stanley's character) who enjoyed drinking and playing poker with his friends. Williams was born in Columbus, Mississippi and had a family home in St. Louis. The common motifs of homosexuality and mental illness in the play come from his struggle with his sexual orientation and his experience with his sister's mental illness. Stanley's loathing for Blanche's prim and proper attitude probably was inspired by Williams's father's aversion to his mother's Southern airs.\nThe theatre critic and former actress Blanche Marvin, a friend of Williams, says the playwright used her name for the character Blanche DuBois, named the character's sister Stella after Marvin's former surname Zohar (which means Star), and took the play's line \"I've always depended on the kindness of strangers\" from something she said to him.\n\"A Streetcar Named Success\".\n\"A Streetcar Named Success\" is an essay by Tennessee Williams about art and the artist's role in society. It often is included in paper editions of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". A version of this essay first appeared in \"The New York Times\" on November 30, 1947, four days before the opening of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". Another version of this essay, titled \"The Catastrophe of Success\", is sometimes used as an introduction to \"The Glass Menagerie\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It provides generic messaging models, able to handle the producer\u2013consumer problem, that can be used to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages between software systems. Jakarta Messaging is a part of Jakarta EE and was originally defined by a specification developed at Sun Microsystems before being guided by the Java Community Process.\nGeneral idea of messaging.\nMessaging is a form of \"loosely coupled\" distributed communication, where in this context the term 'communication' can be understood as an exchange of messages between software components. Message-oriented technologies attempt to relax \"tightly coupled\" communication (such as TCP network sockets, CORBA or RMI) by the introduction of an intermediary component. This approach allows software components to communicate with each other indirectly. Benefits of this include message senders not needing to have precise knowledge of their receivers.\nThe advantages of messaging include the ability to integrate heterogeneous platforms, reduce system bottlenecks, increase scalability, and respond more quickly to change.\nElements.\nThe following are JMS elements:\n An implementation of the JMS interface for message-oriented middleware (MOM). Providers are implemented as either a Java JMS implementation or an adapter to a non-Java MOM.\n An application or process that produces and/or receives messages.\n A JMS client that creates and sends messages.\n A JMS client that receives messages.\n An object that contains the data being transferred between JMS clients.\n A staging area that contains messages that have been sent and are waiting to be read (by only one consumer). As the name queue suggests, the messages are delivered in the order sent. A JMS queue guarantees that each message is processed only once.\n A distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers.\nModels.\nThe JMS API supports two distinct models:\nPoint-to-point model.\nUnder the \"point-to-point\" messaging system, messages are routed to individual consumers who maintain queues of incoming messages. This messaging type is built on the concept of message queues, senders, and receivers. Each message is addressed to a specific queue, and the receiving clients extract messages from the queues established to hold their messages. While any number of producers can send messages to the queue, each message is guaranteed to be delivered, and consumed by one consumer. Queues retain all messages sent to them until the messages are consumed or until the messages expire. If no consumers are registered to consume the messages, the queue holds them until a consumer registers to consume them.\nPublish-and-subscribe model.\nThe \"publish-and-subscribe\" model supports publishing messages to a particular message \"topic\". \"Subscribers\" may register interest in receiving messages \"published\" on a particular message topic. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber knows about each other. A good analogy for this is an anonymous bulletin board.\nJMS provides a way of separating the application from the transport layer of providing data. The same Java classes can be used to communicate with different JMS providers by using the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) information for the desired provider. The classes first use a \"connection factory\" to connect to the queue or topic, and then use populate and send or publish the messages. On the receiving side, the clients then receive or subscribe to the messages.\nURI scheme.\nRFC 6167 defines a codice_1 URI scheme for the Java Message Service.\nProvider implementations.\nTo use JMS, one must have a JMS provider that can manage the sessions, queues and topics. Starting from Java EE version 1.4, a JMS provider has to be contained in \"all\" Java EE application servers. This can be implemented using the message inflow management of the Java EE Connector Architecture, which was first made available in that version.\nThe following is a list of common JMS providers:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On September 12, 2017, Oracle Corporation announced that it would submit Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. The Eclipse top-level project has been named Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J). The Eclipse Foundation could not agree with Oracle over the use of and Java trademarks. Oracle owns the trademark for the name \"Java\" and the platform was renamed from Java EE to Jakarta EE. The name refers to the largest city on the island of Java and also the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta. The name should not be confused with the former Jakarta Project which fostered a number of current and former Java projects at the Apache Software Foundation.\nSpecifications.\nJakarta EE includes several specifications that serve different purposes, like generating web pages, reading and writing from a database in a transactional way, and managing distributed queues.\nThe Jakarta EE APIs include several technologies that extend the functionality of the base Java SE APIs, such as Jakarta Enterprise Beans, connectors, servlets, Jakarta Server Pages and several web service technologies.\nWeb profile.\nIn an attempt to limit the footprint of web containers, both in physical and in conceptual terms, the web profile was created, a subset of the Jakarta EE specifications. The Jakarta EE web profile comprises the following:\nCertified referencing runtimes.\nAlthough by definition all Jakarta EE implementations provide the same base level of technologies (namely, the Jakarta EE spec and the associated APIs), they can differ considerably with respect to extra features (like connectors, clustering, fault tolerance, high availability, security, etc.), installed size, memory footprint, startup time, etc.\nCode sample.\nThe code sample shown below demonstrates how various technologies in Java EE 7 are used together to build a web form for editing a user.\nIn Jakarta EE a (web) UI can be built using Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Server Pages (\"JSP\"), or Jakarta Faces (\"JSF\") with Facelets. The example below uses Faces and Facelets. Not explicitly shown is that the input components use the Jakarta EE Bean Validation API under the covers to validate constraints.\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n xmlns:h=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html\" xmlns:f=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core\"&gt;\n &lt;f:metadata&gt;\n &lt;f:viewParam name=\"user_id\" value=\"#{userEdit.user}\" converter=\"#{userConvertor}\" /&gt;\n &lt;/f:metadata&gt;\n &lt;h:body&gt;\n &lt;h:messages /&gt;\n &lt;h:form&gt;\n &lt;h:panelGrid columns=\"2\"&gt;\n &lt;h:outputLabel for=\"firstName\" value=\"First name\" /&gt;\n &lt;h:inputText id=\"firstName\" value=\"#{userEdit.user.firstName}\" label=\"First name\" /&gt;\n &lt;h:outputLabel for=\"lastName\" value=\"Last name\" /&gt;\n &lt;h:inputText id=\"lastName\" value=\"#{userEdit.user.lastName}\" label=\"Last name\" /&gt;\n &lt;h:commandButton action=\"#{userEdit.saveUser}\" value=\"Save\" /&gt;\n &lt;/h:panelGrid&gt;\n &lt;/h:form&gt;\n &lt;/h:body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nExample Backing Bean class.\nTo assist the view, Jakarta EE uses a concept called a \"Backing Bean\". The example below uses http:// and Jakarta Enterprise Beans (\"EJB\").\nimport java.io.Serializable;\nimport jakarta.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.faces.view.ViewScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n@Named\n@ViewScoped\npublic class UserEdit implements Serializable {\n private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n private User user;\n @Inject\n private UserDAO userDAO;\n public String saveUser() {\n userDAO.save(this.user);\n addFlashMessage(String.format(\"User %d saved\", this.user.getId()));\n return \"users.xhtml?faces-redirect=true\";\n public void setUser(User user) {\n this.user = user;\n public User getUser() {\n return user;\nExample Data Access Object class.\nTo implement business logic, Jakarta Enterprise Beans (\"EJB\") is the dedicated technology in Jakarta EE. For the actual persistence, JDBC or Jakarta Persistence (JPA) can be used. The example below uses EJB and JPA. Not explicitly shown is that JTA is used under the covers by EJB to control transactional behavior.\nimport java.util.List;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;\nimport jakarta.persistence.TypedQuery;\n@Stateless\npublic class UserDAO {\n @PersistenceContext\n private EntityManager entityManager;\n public void save(User user) {\n entityManager.persist(user);\n public void update(User user) {\n entityManager.merge(user);\n public List&lt;User&gt; getAll() {\n return entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"User.getAll\", User.class)\n .getResultList();\nExample Entity class.\nFor defining entity/model classes Jakarta EE provides the Jakarta Persistence (\"JPA\"), and for expressing constraints on those entities it provides the Bean Validation API. The example below uses both these technologies.\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;\n@Entity\npublic class User {\n @Id\n @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)\n private Integer id;\n @Size(min = 2, message=\"First name too short\")\n private String firstName;\n @Size(min = 2, message=\"Last name too short\")\n private String lastName;\n public Integer getId() {\n return id;\n public void setId(Integer id) {\n this.id = id;\n public String getFirstName() {\n return firstName;\n public void setFirstName(String firstName) {\n this.firstName = firstName;\n public String getLastName() {\n return lastName;\n public void setLastName(String lastName) {\n this.lastName = lastName;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Java\u00a0ME was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition or J2ME. \nThe platform uses the object-oriented Java programming language, and is part of the Java software-platform family. It was designed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) and replaced a similar technology, PersonalJava.\nIn 2013, with more than 3 billion Java\u00a0ME enabled mobile phones in the market, the platform was in continued decline as smartphones have overtaken feature phones.\nHistory.\nThe platform used to be popular in feature phones, such as Nokia's Series 40 models. It was also supported on the Bada operating system and on Symbian OS along with native software. Users of Windows CE, Windows Mobile, Maemo, MeeGo and Android could download Java\u00a0ME for their respective environments (\"proof-of-concept\" for Android).\nOriginally developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 68, the different flavors of Java\u00a0ME have evolved in separate JSRs. Java ME devices implement a \"profile\". The most common of these are the Mobile Information Device Profile aimed at mobile devices such as cell phones, and the Personal Profile aimed at consumer products and embedded devices like set-top boxes and PDAs. Profiles are subsets of \"configurations\", of which there are currently two: the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and the Connected Device Configuration (CDC).\nIn 2008, Java\u00a0ME platforms were restricted to JRE 1.3 features and use that version of the class file format (internally known as version 47.0).\nImplementations.\nOracle provides a reference implementation of the specification, and some configurations and profiles for MIDP and CDC. Starting with the JavaME 3.0 SDK, a NetBeans-based IDE supported them in a single IDE.\nIn contrast to the numerous binary implementations of the Java Platform built by Sun for servers and workstations, Sun tended not to provide binaries for the platforms of Java\u00a0ME targets, and instead relied on third parties to provide their own. \nThe exception was an MIDP 1.0 JRE (JVM) for Palm OS. Sun provides no J2ME JRE for the Microsoft Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) based devices, despite an open-letter campaign to Sun to release a rumored internal implementation of PersonalJava known by the code name \"Captain America\". Third party implementations are widely used by Windows Mobile vendors.\nAt some point, Sun released a now-abandoned reference implementation under the name phoneME.\nOperating systems targeting Java ME have been implemented by DoCoMo in the form of DoJa, and by SavaJe as SavaJe OS. The latter company was purchased by Sun in April 2007 and now forms the basis of Sun's JavaFX Mobile.\nThe open-source Mika VM aims to implement JavaME CDC/FP, but is not certified as such (certified implementations are required to charge royalties, which is impractical for an open-source project). Consequently, devices which use this implementation are not allowed to claim JavaME CDC compatibility.\nThe Linux-based Android operating system uses a proprietary version of Java that is similar in intent, but very different in many ways from Java ME.\nEmulators.\nThere are other emulators, including emulators provided as part of development kits by phone manufacturers, such as Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, Siemens Mobile, etc.\nConnected Limited Device Configuration.\nThe Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) contains a strict subset of the Java-class libraries, and is the minimum amount needed for a Java virtual machine to operate. CLDC is basically used for classifying myriad devices into a fixed configuration.\nA configuration provides the most basic set of libraries and virtual-machine features that must be present in each implementation of a J2ME environment. When coupled with one or more profiles, the Connected Limited Device Configuration gives developers a solid Java platform for creating applications for consumer and embedded devices.\nThe configuration is designed for devices with 160KB to 512KB total memory, which has a minimum of 160KB of ROM and 32KB of RAM available for the Java platform.\nMobile Information Device Profile.\nDesigned for mobile phones, the Mobile Information Device Profile includes a GUI, and a data storage API, and MIDP 2.0 includes a basic 2D gaming API. Applications written for this profile are called MIDlets.\n\"JSR 271: Mobile Information Device Profile 3\" (Final release on Dec 9, 2009) specified the 3rd generation Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP3), expanding upon the functionality in all areas as well as improving interoperability across devices. A key design goal of MIDP3 is backward compatibility with MIDP2 content.\nInformation Module Profile.\nThe Information Module Profile (IMP) is a profile for embedded, \"headless\" devices such as vending machines, industrial embedded applications, security systems, and similar devices with either simple or no display and with some limited network connectivity.\nOriginally introduced by Siemens Mobile and Nokia as JSR-195, IMP 1.0 is a strict subset of MIDP 1.0 except that it does not include user interface APIs \u2014 in other words, it does not include support for the Java package codice_1. JSR-228, also known as IMP-NG, is IMP's next generation that is based on MIDP 2.0, leveraging MIDP 2.0's new security and networking types and APIs, and other APIs such as codice_2 and codice_3, but again it does not include UI APIs, nor the game API.\nConnected Device Configuration.\nThe Connected Device Configuration is a subset of Java SE, containing almost all the libraries that are not GUI related. It is richer than CLDC.\nFoundation Profile.\nThe Foundation Profile is a Java\u00a0ME Connected Device Configuration (CDC) profile. This profile is intended to be used by devices requiring a complete implementation of the Java virtual machine up to and including the entire Java Platform, Standard Edition API. Typical implementations will use some subset of that API set depending on the additional profiles supported. This specification was developed under the Java Community Process.\nPersonal Basis Profile.\nThe Personal Basis Profile extends the Foundation Profile to include lightweight GUI support in the form of an AWT subset. This is the platform that BD-J is built upon.\nESR.\nThe ESR consortium is devoted to Standards for embedded Java. Especially cost effective Standards.\nTypical applications domains are industrial control, machine-to-machine, medical, e-metering, home automation, consumer, human-to-machine-interface, ...\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Java SE was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE).\nThe platform uses the Java programming language and is part of the Java software-platform family. Java SE defines a range of general-purpose APIs\u2014such as Java APIs for the Java Class Library\u2014and also includes the Java Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification.\nOpenJDK is the official reference implementation since version 7.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNomenclature, standards and specifications.\nThe platform was known as \"Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition\" or \"J2SE\" from version 1.2, until the name was changed to \"Java Platform, Standard Edition\" or \"Java SE\" in version 1.5. The \"SE\" is used to distinguish the base platform from the Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Micro Edition (Java ME) platforms. The \"2\" was originally intended to emphasize the major changes introduced in version 1.2, but was removed in version 1.6. The naming convention has been changed several times over the Java version history. Starting with J2SE 1.4 (Merlin), Java SE has been developed under the Java Community Process, which produces descriptions of proposed and final specifications for the Java platform called Java Specification Requests (JSR). JSR 59 was the umbrella specification for J2SE 1.4 and JSR 176 specified J2SE 5.0 (Tiger). Java SE 6 (Mustang) was released under JSR 270.\nJava Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a related specification that includes all the classes in Java SE, plus a number that are more useful to programs that run on servers as opposed to workstations.\nJava Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) is a related specification intended to provide a certified collection of Java APIs for the development of software for small, resource-constrained devices such as cell phones, PDAs and set-top boxes.\nThe Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Development Kit (JDK) are the actual files downloaded and installed on a computer to run or develop Java programs, respectively.\nGeneral purpose packages.\nThe majority of these packages are exported by the codice_1 module of the Java Platform Module System (since Java 9).\njava.lang.\nThe Java package contains fundamental classes and interfaces closely tied to the language and runtime system. This includes the root classes that form the class hierarchy, types tied to the language definition, basic exceptions, math functions, threading, security functions, as well as some information on the underlying native system. This package contains 22 of 32 codice_2 classes provided in JDK 6.\nThe main classes and interfaces in codice_3 are:\nClasses in codice_3 are automatically imported into every source file.\njava.lang.ref.\nThe package provides more flexible types of references than are otherwise available, permitting limited interaction between the application and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) garbage collector. It is an important package, central enough to the language for the language designers to give it a name that starts with \"java.lang\", but it is somewhat special-purpose and not used by a lot of developers. This package was added in J2SE 1.2.\nJava has an expressive system of references and allows for special behavior for garbage collection. A normal reference in Java is known as a \"strong reference\". The codice_8 package defines three other types of references\u2014soft, weak, and phantom references. Each type of reference is designed for a specific use.\nEach of these reference types extends the class, which provides the method to return a strong reference to the referent object (or codice_9 if the reference has been cleared or if the reference type is phantom), and the method to clear the reference.\nThe codice_8 also defines the class , which can be used in each of the applications discussed above to keep track of objects that have changed reference type. When a codice_11 is created it is optionally registered with a reference queue. The application polls the reference queue to get references that have changed reachability state.\njava.lang.reflect.\nReflection is a constituent of the Java API that lets Java code examine and \"reflect\" on Java components at runtime and use the reflected members. Classes in the package, along with codice_12 and accommodate applications such as debuggers, interpreters, object inspectors, class browsers, and services such as object serialization and JavaBeans that need access to either the public members of a target object (based on its runtime class) or the members declared by a given class. This package was added in JDK 1.1.\nReflection is used to instantiate classes and invoke methods using their names, a concept that allows for dynamic programming. Classes, interfaces, methods, fields, and constructors can all be discovered and used at runtime. Reflection is supported by metadata that the JVM has about the program.\nTechniques.\nThere are basic techniques involved in reflection:\nDiscovery.\nDiscovery typically starts with an object and calling the method to get the object's codice_13. The codice_13 object has several methods for discovering the contents of the class, for example:\nUse by name.\nThe codice_13 object can be obtained either through discovery, by using the \"class literal\" (e.g. codice_20) or by using the name of the class (e.g. ). With a codice_13 object, member codice_22, codice_23, or codice_24 objects can be obtained using the symbolic name of the member. For example:\ncodice_22, codice_23, and codice_24 objects can be used to dynamically access the represented member of the class. For example:\nArrays and proxies.\nThe codice_47 package also provides an class that contains static methods for creating and manipulating array objects, and since J2SE 1.3, a class that supports dynamic creation of proxy classes that implement specified interfaces.\nThe implementation of a codice_48 class is provided by a supplied object that implements the interface. The codice_49's method is called for each method invoked on the proxy object\u2014the first parameter is the proxy object, the second parameter is the codice_22 object representing the method from the interface implemented by the proxy, and the third parameter is the array of parameters passed to the interface method. The codice_40 method returns an codice_33 result that contains the result returned to the code that called the proxy interface method.\njava.io.\nThe package contains classes that support input and output. The classes in the package are primarily stream-oriented; however, a class for random access files is also provided. The central classes in the package are and , which are abstract base classes for reading from and writing to byte streams, respectively. The related classes and are abstract base classes for reading from and writing to character streams, respectively. The package also has a few miscellaneous classes to support interactions with the host file system.\nStreams.\nThe stream classes follow the decorator pattern by extending the base subclass to add features to the stream classes. Subclasses of the base stream classes are typically named for one of the following attributes:\nThe stream subclasses are named using the naming pattern codice_53 where codice_54 is the name describing the feature and codice_55 is one of codice_56, codice_57, codice_58, or codice_59.\nThe following table shows the sources/destinations supported directly by the codice_60 package:\nOther standard library packages provide stream implementations for other destinations, such as the codice_56 returned by the method or the Java EE class.\nData type handling and processing or filtering of stream data is accomplished through stream filters. The filter classes all accept another compatible stream object as a parameter to the constructor and \"decorate\" the enclosed stream with additional features. Filters are created by extending one of the base filter classes , , , or .\nThe codice_58 and codice_59 classes are really just byte streams with additional processing performed on the data stream to convert the bytes to characters. They use the default character encoding for the platform, which as of J2SE 5.0 is represented by the returned by the static method. The class converts an codice_56 to a codice_58 and the class converts an codice_57 to a codice_59. Both these classes have constructors that support specifying the character encoding to use. If no encoding is specified, the program uses the default encoding for the platform.\nThe following table shows the other processes and filters that the codice_60 package directly supports. All these classes extend the corresponding codice_69 class.\nRandom access.\nThe class supports \"random access\" reading and writing of files. The class uses a \"file pointer\" that represents a byte-offset within the file for the next read or write operation. The file pointer is moved implicitly by reading or writing and explicitly by calling the or methods. The current position of the file pointer is returned by the method.\nFile system.\nThe class represents a file or directory path in a file system. codice_70 objects support the creation, deletion and renaming of files and directories and the manipulation of file attributes such as \"read-only\" and \"last modified timestamp\". codice_70 objects that represent directories can be used to get a list of all the contained files and directories.\nThe class is a file descriptor that represents a source or sink (destination) of bytes. Typically this is a file, but can also be a console or network socket. codice_72 objects are used to create codice_70 streams. They are obtained from codice_70 streams and codice_75 sockets and datagram sockets.\njava.nio.\nIn J2SE 1.4, the package (NIO or Non-blocking I/O) was added to support memory-mapped I/O, facilitating I/O operations closer to the underlying hardware with sometimes dramatically better performance. The codice_76 package provides support for a number of buffer types. The subpackage provides support for different character encodings for character data. The subpackage provides support for \"channels,\" which represent connections to entities that are capable of performing I/O operations, such as files and sockets. The codice_77 package also provides support for fine-grained locking of files.\njava.math.\nThe package supports multiprecision arithmetic (including modular arithmetic operations) and provides multiprecision prime number generators used for cryptographic key generation. The main classes of the package are:\njava.net.\nThe package provides special IO routines for networks, allowing HTTP requests, as well as other common transactions.\njava.text.\nThe package implements parsing routines for strings and supports various human-readable languages and locale-specific parsing.\njava.util.\nData structures that aggregate objects are the focus of the package. Included in the package is the Collections API, an organized data structure hierarchy influenced heavily by the design patterns considerations.\nSpecial purpose packages.\njava.applet.\nCreated to support Java applet creation, the package lets applications be downloaded over a network and run within a guarded sandbox. Security restrictions are easily imposed on the sandbox. A developer, for example, may apply a digital signature to an applet, thereby labeling it as safe. Doing so allows the user to grant the applet permission to perform restricted operations (such as accessing the local hard drive), and removes some or all the sandbox restrictions. Digital certificates are issued by certificate authorities.\nBecause Java applets are now deprecated, this package is itself deprecated.\njava.beans.\nIncluded in the package are various classes for developing and manipulating beans, reusable components defined by the JavaBeans architecture. The architecture provides mechanisms for manipulating properties of components and firing events when those properties change.\nThe APIs in codice_81 are intended for use by a bean editing tool, in which beans can be combined, customized, and manipulated. One type of bean editor is a GUI designer in an integrated development environment.\njava.awt.\nThe , or Abstract Window Toolkit, provides access to a basic set of GUI widgets based on the underlying native platform's widget set, the core of the GUI event subsystem, and the interface between the native windowing system and the Java application. It also provides several basic layout managers, a datatransfer package for use with the Clipboard and Drag and Drop, the interface to input devices such as mice and keyboards, as well as access to the system tray on supporting systems. This package, along with codice_82 contains the largest number of enums (7 in all) in JDK 6.\njava.rmi.\nThe package provides Java remote method invocation to support remote procedure calls between two java applications running in different JVMs.\njava.security.\nSupport for security, including the message digest algorithm, is included in the package.\njava.sql.\nAn implementation of the JDBC API (used to access SQL databases) is grouped into the package.\njavax.rmi.\nThe codice_83 package provided support for the remote communication between applications, using the RMI over IIOP protocol. This protocol combines RMI and CORBA features.\nhttp://\njavax.swing.\nSwing is a collection of routines that build on codice_84 to provide a platform independent widget toolkit. uses the 2D drawing routines to render the user interface components instead of relying on the underlying native operating system GUI support.\nThis package contains the largest number of classes (133 in all) in JDK 6. This package, along with codice_84 also contains the largest number of enums (7 in all) in JDK 6. It supports pluggable looks and feels (PLAFs) so that widgets in the GUI can imitate those from the underlying native system. Design patterns permeate the system, especially a modification of the model\u2013view\u2013controller pattern, which loosens the coupling between function and appearance. One inconsistency is that (as of J2SE 1.3) fonts are drawn by the underlying native system, and not by Java, limiting text portability. Workarounds, such as using bitmap fonts, do exist. In general, \"layouts\" are used and keep elements within an aesthetically consistent GUI across platforms.\njavax.swing.text.html.parser.\nThe package provides the error tolerant HTML parser that is used for writing various web browsers and web bots.\njavax.xml.bind.annotation.\nThe codice_83 package contained the largest number of Annotation Types (30 in all) in JDK 6. It defines annotations for customizing Java program elements to XML Schema mapping.\nW3C packages.\nJava contains packages for World Wide Web Consortium utilities (primarily XML) under namespace codice_87. Many of these exist in the codice_88 module.\nDOM packages.\nThe packages provide interfaces for the Document Object Model (DOM).\nSAX packages.\nThe packages provide interfaces for the Simple API for XML (SAX).\nOMG packages.\norg.omg.CORBA.\nThe codice_83 package provided support for the remote communication between applications using the General Inter-ORB Protocol and supports other features of the common object request broker architecture. Same as RMI and RMI-IIOP, this package is for calling remote methods of objects on other virtual machines (usually via network).\nThis package contained the largest number of codice_90 classes (45 in all) in JDK 6. From all communication possibilities CORBA is portable between various languages; however, with this comes more complexity.\nThese packages were deprecated in Java 9 and removed from Java 11.\norg.omg.PortableInterceptor.\nThe codice_83 package contained the largest number of interfaces (39 in all) in JDK 6. It provides a mechanism to register ORB hooks through which ORB services intercept the normal flow of execution of the ORB.\nSecurity.\nSeveral critical security vulnerabilities have been reported. Security alerts from Oracle announce critical security-related patches to Java SE.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced \"Method Acting\" under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including \"City for Conquest\" (1940).\nHis films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with antisemitism in the United States. It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\" (1949), one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. Three years later, he directed Brando again in \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. It also received twelve Oscar nominations, winning eight. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", starring James Dean.\nA turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a \"friendly witness\" before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 at the height of the Hollywood blacklist. His decision to cooperate and name names brought him strong negative reactions from many friends and associates. His harshly anti-communist testimony \"damaged if not shattered the careers of his former colleagues, Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, both actors, and the playwright Clifford Odets\". In his memoirs, Kazan writes that he and Odets had made a pact at the time to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his actions by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong\". Nearly a half-century later, his 1952 HUAC testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.\nKazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses\". Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous\". Orson Welles said \"Kazan is a traitor ... [but] he is a very good director\". In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film \"A Letter to Elia\" as a personal tribute to Kazan.\nEarly life.\nKazan was born Elias Kazantzoglou in the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y district of Constantinople (now Istanbul), to Cappadocian Greek parents, originally from Kayseri in Anatolia; the family name comes from the Turkish \"Kazanc\u0131\" (), meaning \"pot maker\". He arrived in the United States with his parents, Athena (n\u00e9e\u00a0Shishmanoglou) and George Kazantzoglou, on July 8, 1913. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Elias Kazantzoglou. His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. Elia's brother, Avraam, was born in Berlin and later became a psychiatrist.\nKazan was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church and attended Greek Orthodox services every Sunday, where he had to stand for several hours with his father. His mother read the Bible but did not go to church. When Kazan was about eight years old, the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, and his father sent him to a Catholic catechism school because there was no Orthodox church nearby. When meeting with the Turkish filmmaker Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney, it was revealed he had retained fluency in the Turkish language from childhood.\nAs a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates characterized him as more of a loner. Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, \"America America\", which he made into a 1963 film. In it, he describes his family as \"alienated\" from both their parents' Greek Orthodox values and from those of \"mainstream America\". His mother's family were cotton merchants who imported cotton from England and sold it wholesale. His father had become a rug merchant after immigrating to the United States, and he expected his son would someday take over the family business.\nAfter attending public schools through high school, Kazan enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes; he still graduated \"cum laude\". He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname \"Gadg\" (for Gadget) because, he said, \"I was small, compact, and handy to have around.\" The nickname was eventually taken up by his stage and film stars. In \"America America\", Kazan tells how and why his family left Turkey and moved to the United States. Kazan observes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that \"it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to Istanbul ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances. ... It's also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store.\"\nKazan noted some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film: \"I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.\" To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I hesitated about that for a long time. A lot of people, who don't understand how desperate people can get, advised me to cut it. When I am accused of being excessive by the critics, they're talking about moments like that. But I wouldn't take it out for the world. It actually happened. Believe me, if a Turk could get out of Turkey and come here, even now, he would kiss the ground. To oppressed people, America is still a dream.\nBefore undertaking \"America America\", Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a \"deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'\" His mother gave him the answer: \"A.E. brought us here.\" Kazan states that \"A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehow\u2014this was the wonder\u2014he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.\" Kazan writes of \"America America\", \"It's my favorite of all the films I've made; the first film that was entirely mine.\"\nCareer.\n1930s: Stage career.\nIn 1932, after spending two years at the Yale University School of Drama, he moved to New York City to become a professional stage actor. He continued his professional studies at the Juilliard School where he studied singing with Lucia Dunham. His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing \"social commentary\". They were called the Group Theatre, which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages. After struggling to be accepted by them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the \"family of the Group Theatre, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time\", writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.\nIn his autobiography, Kazan writes of the \"lasting impact on him of the Group\", noting in particular Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as \"father figures\", along with his close friendship with playwright Clifford Odets. During an interview with Michel Ciment, Kazan described the Group:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKazan also praised Strasberg as a vital leader of the Group:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKazan's first national success came as a New York theatrical director. Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group's most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by Clifford Odets, \"Waiting for Lefty\", and his performance was called \"dynamic\", leading some to label him the \"proletarian thunderbolt\". Among the themes that would run through all of his work were \"personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice\", writes film critic William Baer. Other critics have likewise noted his \"strong commitment to the social and social psychological\u2014rather than the purely political\u2014implications of drama\".\nBy the mid-1930s, when he was 26, Kazan began directing a number of the Group Theatre's plays, including Robert Ardrey's well-known play \"Thunder Rock\". In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by Thornton Wilder, \"The Skin of Our Teeth\", starring Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a Pulitzer Prize. Kazan won the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct \"Death of a Salesman\" by Arthur Miller, and then directed \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" by Tennessee Williams, both of which were also successful. Kazan's wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a \"prize that launched his career\".\nThe Group Theatre's summer rehearsal headquarters was at Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists, including Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Luise Rainer, Frances Farmer, Will Geer, Howard da Silva, Clifford Odets, Lee J. Cobb, and Irwin Shaw.\n1940s: The Actors Studio, early films.\nIn 1940, Kazan had a large supporting role as a flamboyantly dressed gangster in the boxing thriller \"City for Conquest\" starring James Cagney, Ann Sheridan and Anthony Quinn. His stylishly distinctive but raffish clothing seems to have been copied by Frank Sinatra a decade and a half later and his part is both sympathetic and extremely dramatic. In 1947, he founded the Actors Studio, a non-profit workshop, with actors Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford. In 1951, Lee Strasberg became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the \"Method\" to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of Konstantin Stanislavski's teachings. The \"Method\" school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.\nAmong Strasberg's students were Montgomery Clift, Mildred Dunnock, Julie Harris, Karl Malden, Patricia Neal, Maureen Stapleton, Eli Wallach, and James Whitmore. Kazan directed two of the Studio's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Karl Malden and Marlon Brando, in the Tennessee Williams play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". Although he was at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films but his first feature film was \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed \"Gentleman's Agreement\", where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in the United States, antisemitism, for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1947, he directed the courtroom drama \"Boomerang!\" In 1949, he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed \"Pinky\", which dealt with issues of racism in the United States, and was nominated for three Academy Awards.\n1950s: Rise to prominence.\nIn 1950, Kazan directed \"Panic in the Streets\", starring Richard Widmark, a thriller shot on the streets of New Orleans. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in \"energizing\" the action scenes. He won the Venice Film Festival International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that Zero Mostel also act in the film, despite Mostel being \"blacklisted\" as a result of HUAC testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each director has a favorite in his cast\u2026 my favorite this time was Zero Mostel\u2026 I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I'd ever met\u2026 I constantly sought his company\u2026 He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the \"industry's\" blacklist\u2026 For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.\nIn 1951, after introducing and directing Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", which won four Oscars and was nominated for twelve. Despite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater; though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On \"Streetcar\" we worked very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I actually did was to make the set smaller. As the story progressed\u2026 the set got smaller and smaller.\nKazan's next film was \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his \"first real film\" because of those factors. In 1954, he again used Brando as a star in \"On the Waterfront\". As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, and won eight, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Marlon Brando. \"On the Waterfront\" was also the screen debut for Eva Marie Saint, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I ended up crying. Crying and laughing... I mean there was such an attraction there... That smile of his... He was very tender and funny... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.\n\"Life\" magazine described \"On the Waterfront\" as the \"most brutal movie of the year\" but with \"the year's tenderest love scenes\", and stating that Saint was a \"new discovery\" in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in \"On the Waterfront\" that she \"starts her real trip to fame\".\nThe film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer Leonard Bernstein.\nAfter the success of \"On the Waterfront\", he went on to direct another screen adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel, \"East of Eden\" (1955). As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, James Dean. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag. The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955), directed by Kazan's friend Nicholas Ray, and then \"Giant\" (1956), directed by George Stevens.\nAuthor Douglas Rathgeb recounts the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he \"kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.\" As a result, Kazan was forced to \"baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers\", so he would not run away during production. Co-star Julie Harris worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that \"his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears\".\nDean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director Nicholas Ray to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in \"Rebel Without a Cause\". Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it seemed impossible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. \"Dean himself did not seem to believe it\", notes Rathgeb. \"He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.\" The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car about 200 miles north of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was \"East of Eden\".\n1960s: Continued work.\nIn 1961, Kazan introduced Warren Beatty in his first screen appearance with a starring role in \"Splendor in the Grass\" (1961), with Natalie Wood; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan \"was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.\" Biskind notes also that they \"were wildly dissimilar\u2014mentor vs. prot\u00e9g\u00e9, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.\" Kazan later recorded his impressions of Beatty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Warren\u2014it was obvious the first time I saw him\u2014wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.\nBiskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: \"The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HCUA. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something\u2014why did you name all those names?'\"\nBeatty recalled the episode: \"In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.\" Biskind relates how \"Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.\" Beatty, years later, during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan \"had given him the most important break in his career\".\nBeatty's costar, Natalie Wood, was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer Suzanne Finstad notes that a \"turning point\" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film \"A Streetcar Named Desire\": \"She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance... [who] became a role model for Natalie.\" In 1961, after a \"series of bad films, her career was already in decline\", notes Rathgeb. Kazan writes that the \"sages\" of the film community declared her as \"washed up\" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J. [Wagner, Wood's husband], I said to myself. I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.\nKazan cast her as the female lead in \"Splendor in the Grass\", and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, \"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on \"Splendor\".\" She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of \"Kazan's wizardry... produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.\"\nActor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that \"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.\" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). Kazan recalled: \"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it. And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.\" \nCollaborators.\nKazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge; in film, he worked again with Willams (\"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"Baby Doll\"), Inge (\"Splendor in the Grass\"), Budd Schulberg (\"On the Waterfront\" and \"A Face in the Crowd\"), John Steinbeck (\"Viva Zapata!\"), and Harold Pinter (\"The Last Tycoon\"). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, \"he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.\" In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, \"The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond\", was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.\nAmong Kazan's other films were \"Panic in the Streets\" (1950), \"East of Eden\" (1955), \"Baby Doll\" (1956), \"Wild River\" (1960), and \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976). Williams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of \"creative slumps\" by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, \"Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.\"\nDirecting style.\nPreference for unknown actors.\nKazan strove for \"cinematic realism\", a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict \"social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity\". He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure. As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Warren Beatty, Andy Griffith, Eva Marie Saint, James Dean and Jack Palance their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer George Stevens Jr. that he felt that \"big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits... they're not pliable anymore.\" Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.\nAs an example, Kazan recalled during an interview how he came to understand James Dean:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I met him he said, \"I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike...\" It was his way of communicating with me, saying \"I hope you like me...\" I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love... I went to Jack Warner and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, \"Go ahead.\"\nTopics of personal and social realism.\nKazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With \"East of Eden\"... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.\nFilm historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on \"reality\", although his style was not defined as \"naturalistic\". She adds: \"He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.\" Kazan stated that \"unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.\" In his later years, he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a \"collective art\", as he once believed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFilm author Peter Biskind described Kazan's career as \"fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work\". Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.\nNonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", written by screenwriter Budd Schulberg, which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it \"one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema\". Another political film was \"A Face in the Crowd\" (1957). His protagonist, played by Andy Griffith (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn \"of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation\". Kazan states, \"Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.\"\nUse of \u201cmethod\u201d acting.\nAs a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of \"Method\" actors, especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, \"I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance \"including\" so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends... The director is a \"desperate beast!\"... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.\" Actor Robert De Niro called him a \"master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting\". Kazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.\nKazan explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKazan held strong ideas about the scenes and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in \"Baby Doll\", for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker, he privately asked Wallach, \"Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?\" Wallach writes, \"I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered... 'No'.\" Kazan replies, \"Good idea, play it that way.\" Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBeing an \u201cactor's director\u201d.\nJoanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director Nicholas Ray considered him \"the best actor's director the United States has ever produced\". Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that \"he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism\".\nAmong the actors who described Kazan as an important influence in their career was Patricia Neal, who co-starred with Andy Griffith in \"A Face in the Crowd\" (1957): \"He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.\" Anthony Franciosa, a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He would always say, \"Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.\" You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side\u2014no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.\nIn order to get quality acting from Andy Griffith, in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls \"an astonishing movie debut\", Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: \"I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.\" Actress Terry Moore calls Kazan her \"best friend\", and notes that \"he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life\". \"He would find out if your life was like the character\", says Carroll Baker, star of \"Baby Doll\"; \"he was the best director with actors\".\nKazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976). He remembered that Robert De\u00a0Niro, the star of the film, \"would do almost anything to succeed\", and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De\u00a0Niro \"is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.\"\nThe powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal traits. Although he did not know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, \"Bobby is more meticulous... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.\" Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film. Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De\u00a0Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that \"for De\u00a0Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in \"The Godfather, part\u00a0II\"... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest\". Marlon Brando, in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have worked with many movie directors\u2014some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation... He gave his cast freedom and... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.\nHe was an arch-manipulator of actors' feelings, and he was extraordinarily talented; perhaps we will never see his like again.\nHUAC testimony.\nKazan testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 during the midst of the Red Scare that journalist Michael Mills calls \"arguably the most controversial period in Hollywood history\". When Kazan was in his mid-20s in the Depression years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the Communist Party USA.\nIn April 1952, the HUAC called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former Group Theatre members who he said had been Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller (who later married Lee Strasberg). He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time he did. Kazan alleged that all the persons named were already known to the HUAC, although this has been contested. He later acknowledged that he received a letter detailing how his naming of Art Smith damaged the actor's career. Kazan's naming names cost him many friends within the film industry, including playwright Arthur Miller, although Kazan notes the two did work together again.\nIn his book \"How We Forgot the Cold War\" (2012), historian Jon Wiener wrote: \"Lots of people named names, but Kazan went further than any of them, when, two days later [after his April 1952 testimony], he took out an ad in the \"New York Times\" explaining his reasons for naming names and urging others to follow his example.\" In his large, defiant ad entitled \"A STATEMENT by Elia Kazan\", the director briefly chronicled his 1934\u201336 experiences in the Communist Party, and then he wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The question will be asked why I did not tell this story sooner. I was held back, primarily, by concern for the reputations and employment of people who may, like myself, have left the Party many years ago. Kazan added that his time in the Party \"left me with the passionate conviction that we must never let the Communists get away with the pretense that they stand for the very things which they kill in their own countries.\" Decades later in his memoirs, he still struck a defiant tone when describing his \"warrior pleasure at withstanding his 'enemies,' who judged him for giving names to the HUAC\". He also insisted that despite the snubs he received, he felt no lingering guilt: \"There's a normal sadness about hurting people, but I'd rather hurt them a little than hurt myself a lot.\"\nWhen Kazan received an Honorary Academy Award in 1999, the audience was noticeably divided in their reaction, with some, including Jack Nicholson, Nick Nolte, Ed Harris, Ian McKellen, Frank Langella and Amy Madigan, refusing to applaud, and others, such as actors Kathy Bates, Meryl Streep, Karl Malden, Debbie Allen, and Warren Beatty, and producer George Stevens Jr., standing and applauding. Stevens speculates on why he, Beatty, and many others in the audience chose to stand and applaud:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I never discussed it with Warren, but I believe we were both standing for the same reason\u2014out of regard for the creativity, the stamina and the many fierce battles and lonely nights that had gone into the man's twenty motion pictures.\nIn an interview for the Associated Press, actor Liam Neeson said: \"We \"are\" honoring an extraordinary artist. Period. That's what this evening's about.\" Director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro presented the award to Kazan, whom he thanked in his acceptance speech. He ended by saying: \"I want to thank you all very much. I think I can just slip away.\"\nIn 1982, Orson Welles was asked a question about Kazan at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise in Paris. Welles replied, \"Ch\u00e8re mademoiselle, you have chosen the wrong metteur en sc\u00e8ne, because Elia Kazan is a traitor. He is a man who sold to McCarthy all his companions at a time when he could continue to work in New York at high salary, and having sold all his people to McCarthy, he then made a film called \"On the Waterfront\" which was a celebration of the informer.\" While the audience applauded, Welles said, \"I have to add that he is a very good director.\"\n\"Los Angeles Times\" film critic Kenneth Turan wrote, \"The only criterion for an award like this is the work.\" Kazan was already \"denied accolades\" from the American Film Institute, and other film critics' associations. According to Mills, \"It's time for the Academy to recognize this genius\", adding that \"We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.\" In response, Joseph McBride, former vice president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, claimed that an honorary award recognizes \"the totality of what he represents, and Kazan's career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people's careers.\" In subsequent interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first \"family\", and the \"best thing professionally\" that ever happened to him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Group Theatre said that we shouldn't be committed to any fixed political program set by other people outside the organization. I was behaving treacherously to the Group when I met downtown at CP [Communist Party] headquarters, to decide among the Communists what we should do in the Group, and then come back and present a united front, pretending we had not been in caucus ...\nI was tried by the Party and that was one of the reasons I became so embittered later. The trial was on the issue of my refusal to follow instructions, that we should strike in the Group Theatre, and insist that the membership have control of its organization. I said it was an artistic organization, and I backed up Clurman and Strasberg who were not Communists ... The trial left an indelible impression on me ... Everybody else voted against me and they stigmatized me and condemned my acts and attitude. They were asking for confession and self-humbling. I went home that night and told my wife \"I am resigning.\" But for years after I resigned, I was still faithful to their way of thinking. I still believed in it. But not in the American Communists. I used to make a difference and think: \"These people here are damned fools but in Russia they have got the real thing\", until I learned about the Hitler-Stalin pact, and gave up on the USSR.\nMills observes that prior to becoming a \"friendly witness\", Kazan discussed his decision-making process during a visit at his Connecticut home from longtime friend Arthur Miller:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To defend a secrecy I don't think right and to defend people who have already been named or soon would be by someone else\u2026 I hate the Communists and have for many years, and don't feel right about giving up my career to defend them. I will give up my film career if it is in the interests of defending something I believe in, but not this.\nMiller put his arm around Kazan and said, \"Don't worry about what I'll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.\" Miller had recorded in his journal his own perceptions about this visit. He recalled his sentiments as \"being more complex. His anger was not at Kazan, whom he loved like a brother, but at the committee. At the same time he saw a side to his friend that frightened him: 'He would have sacrificed me as well.'\"\nIn his memoirs, Kazan writes that, as a result of his testimony, \"the big shot had become the outsider\". He also says that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, Tennessee Williams, with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams \"the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.\" Kazan appears as a character in \"Names\", Mark Kemble's play about former Group Theatre members' struggles with the House Un-American Activities Committee.\nPersonal life and death.\nKazan was married three times. His first wife was playwright Molly Day Thacher. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter Nicholas Kazan. Molly became an especially bitter anti-communist. Film critic Leo Braudy contends that it was Molly who was the principal author of the April 1952 \"New York Times\" ad that further estranged Kazan from the Hollywood community.\nHis second marriage, to the actress Barbara Loden, lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to Frances Rudge continued until his death in 2003. In the early 1930s, Kazan and Molly moved into an 1885 farmhouse in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, where they raised their four children. The family continued to use the property as a summer and weekend retreat until 1998 when the property was put up for sale. In 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to his birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKazan also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment on September 28, 2003, aged 94. \nSexual assault allegation.\nIn 2017, Carol Drinkwater accused Kazan of sexual harassment and attempted rape in 1975 when she was under consideration for a part in Kazan's film \"The Last Tycoon\".\nFilmography.\nDocumentary\nAs an actor\nAwards and nominations.\nIn addition to these awards, Kazan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located on 6800 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.\nDirected Academy Award Performances.\nUnder Kazan's direction, these actors have received Oscar nominations (and wins) for their performances in their respective roles.\nLegacy.\nKazan became known as an \"actor's director\" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 24 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars. He won as Best Director for \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947) and for \"On the Waterfront\" (1954). Both \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951) and \"On the Waterfront\" were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight. With his many years with the Group Theatre and Actors Studio in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous \"for the power and intensity of his actors' performances\". He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of Marlon Brando, James Dean, Julie Harris, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Warren Beatty, Lee Remick, Karl Malden, and many others. Seven of Kazan's films won a total of 20 Academy Awards. Dustin Hoffman commented that he \"doubted whether he, Robert De Niro, or Al Pacino, would have become actors without Mr. Kazan's influence.\"\nUpon his death, at the age of 94, \"The New York Times\" characterized him as \"one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history\". \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career \"he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations\", adding that \"he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema\". Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.\nHis controversial appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952 was the low point in his career, although he remained convinced he made the right decision to give the names of Group Theatre colleagues who had been Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that \"I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn't betray it. I made a difficult decision.\"\nDuring his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who wrote \"On the Waterfront\", thanked his lifelong friend saying, \"Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.\"\nIn 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro presented the Honorary Oscar to Kazan. This would be a controversial pick for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences due to Kazan's history regarding his involvement with the Hollywood Blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.\nMartin Scorsese directed a film documentary, \"A Letter to Elia\" (2010), considered to be an \"intensely personal and deeply moving tribute\" to Kazan. Scorsese was \"captivated\" by Kazan's films as a young man, and the documentary mirrors his own life story while he also credits Kazan as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker. It won a Peabody Award in 2010.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "42878", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42878", "title": "Nevil Maskelyne", "text": "British astronomer and physicist (1732\u20131811)\nNevil Maskelyne (; 6 October 1732 \u2013 9 February 1811) was the fifth British Astronomer Royal. He held the office from 1765 to 1811. He was the first person to scientifically measure the mass of the planet Earth. He created \"The Nautical Almanac\", in full the \"British Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the Meridian of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich\", using Tobias Mayer's corrections for Leonhard Euler's \"Lunar Theory\" tables.\nBiography.\nMaskelyne was born in London, the third son of Edmund Maskelyne of Purton in Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Booth. Maskelyne's father died when he was 12, leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Maskelyne attended Westminster School and was still a pupil there when his mother died in 1748. His interest in astronomy had begun while at Westminster School, shortly after the eclipse of 14 July 1748.\nMaskelyne entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in 1749, graduating as seventh wrangler in 1754. Ordained as a minister in 1755, he became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1756 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1758. Maskelyne became a member of the American Philosophical Society, elected in 1771.\nOriginally pursuing his career as a Church of England minister, he was Rector of Shrawardine in Shropshire from 1775 to 1782 and then Rector of North Runcton in Norfolk from 1782. In 1784 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Playfair, John Robison and Dugald Stewart. \nOn 21 August 1784 Maskelyne married Sophia Rose, then of St Andrew Holborn, Middlesex. Their only child, Margaret (25 June 1785\u20131858), was the mother of Mervyn Herbert Nevil Story-Maskelyne (1823\u20131911) professor of mineralogy at Oxford (1856\u201395). Maskelyne's younger sister, Margaret, married Robert Clive.\nMaskelyne is buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, the parish church of the village of Purton, Wiltshire, England.\nCareer.\nMeasurement of longitude.\nIn 1760 the Royal Society appointed Maskelyne as an astronomer on one of their expeditions to observe the 1761 transit of Venus. He and the mathematician Robert Waddington were sent to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. This was an important observation since accurate measurements would allow the accurate calculation of Earth's distance from the Sun, which would in turn allow the actual rather than the relative scale of the Solar System to be calculated. This would allow, it was argued, the production of more accurate astronomical tables, in particular those predicting the motion of the Moon.\nBad weather prevented observation of the transit, but Maskelyne used his journey to trial a method of determining longitude using the position of the moon, which became known as the lunar distance method. He returned to England, resuming his position as curate at Chipping Barnet in 1761, and began work on a book, publishing the lunar-distance method of longitude calculation and providing tables to facilitate its use in 1763 in \"The British Mariner's Guide\", which included the suggestion that to facilitate the finding of longitude at sea, lunar distances should be calculated beforehand for each year and published in a form accessible to navigators.\nIn 1763 the Board of Longitude sent Maskelyne to Barbados in order to carry out an official trial of three contenders for a Longitude reward. He was to carry out observations on board ship and to calculate the longitude of the capital, Bridgetown by observation of Jupiter's satellites. The three methods on trial were John Harrison's sea watch (now known as H4), Tobias Mayer's lunar tables and a marine chair made by Christopher Irwin, intended to help observations of Jupiter's satellites on board ship. Both Harrison's watch and lunar-distance observations based on Mayer's lunar tables produced results within the terms of the Longitude Act, although the former appeared to be more accurate. Harrison's watch had produced Bridgetown's longitude with an error of less than ten miles, while the lunar-distance observations were accurate to within 30 nautical miles.\nMaskelyne reported the results of the trial to the Board of Longitude on 9 February 1765. On 26 February 1765 he had been appointed Astronomer Royal following the unexpected death of Nathaniel Bliss in 1764; making him \"ex officio\" a Commissioner of Longitude. The Commissioners understood that the timekeeping and astronomical methods of finding longitude were complementary. The lunar-distance method could more quickly be rolled out, with Maskelyne's proposal that tables like those in his \"The British Mariner's Guide\" be published for each year. This proposal led to the establishment of The Nautical Almanac, the production of which, as Astronomer Royal, Maskelyne oversaw. Taking even occasional astronomical observations was also the only way to check that a timekeeper was keeping good time over the course of a long voyage. The Commissioners also needed to know that more than one sea watch could be made, and that Harrison's methods could be communicated to other watchmakers.\nThe Board of Longitude therefore decided that rewards should be given to Harrison (\u00a310,000), Mayer (\u00a33000, posthumously) and others involved in helping to develop the lunar-distance method. Harrison was told that a further reward of \u00a310,000 would be forthcoming if he could demonstrate the replicability of his watch. Although Harrison and his son later accused Maskelyne of bias against the timekeeping method, charges repeated by authors such as Dava Sobel and Rupert Gould, Maskelyne never submitted a method or an idea of his own for consideration by the Board of Longitude. He was to play a significant role in having marine timekeepers, as well as the lunar-distance method, developed, tested and used on board voyages of exploration.\nSince the observations that fed into the \"Nautical Almanac\" were made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the Greenwich meridian became the reference for measurements of longitude in the Royal Navy, and on British Admiralty charts. It was subsequently chosen for adoption as the international Prime Meridian in 1884.\nMeasurement of latitude.\nMaskelyne took a great interest in various geodetical operations, including the measurement of the length of a degree of latitude in Maryland and Pennsylvania, executed by Mason and Dixon in 1766 \u2013 1768, and later the determination of the relative longitude of Greenwich and Paris. On the French side the work was conducted by Count Cassini, Legendre, and M\u00e9chain; on the English side by General Roy. This triangulation was the beginning of the great trigonometrical survey which was subsequently extended all over Britain. His observations appeared in four large folio volumes from 1776 to 1811, some of them being reprinted in Samuel Vince's \"Elements of Astronomy\".\nSchiehallion experiment.\nIn 1772 Maskelyne proposed to the Royal Society what was to become known as the Schiehallion experiment (named after the Scottish mountain on which it was performed), for the determination of the Earth's density using a plumb line. He was not the first to suggest this, Pierre Bouguer and Charles-Marie de la Condamine having attempted the same experiment in 1738 in the Andes.\nMaskelyne performed his experiment in 1774 on Schiehallion in Perthshire, Scotland, the mountain being chosen due to its regular conical shape which permitted a reasonably accurate determination of its volume. The apparent difference of latitude between two stations on opposite sides of the mountain were compared with the real difference of latitude obtained by triangulation.\nFrom Maskelyne's observations Charles Hutton deduced a density for the earth 4.5 times that of water (the modern value is 5.515).\nOther work.\nMaskelyne's first contribution to astronomical literature was \"A Proposal for Discovering the Annual Parallax of Sirius\", published in 1760. Subsequent contributions to the \"Transactions\" contained his observations of the transits of Venus (1761 and 1769), on the tides at Saint Helena (1762), and on various astronomical phenomena at Saint Helena (1764) and at Barbados (1764).\nMaskelyne also introduced several practical improvements, such as the measurement of time to tenths of a second and prevailed upon the government to replace Bird's mural quadrant by a repeating circle 6 feet (1.8 m) in diameter. The new instrument was constructed by Edward Troughton but Maskelyne did not live to see it completed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42880", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42880", "title": "John Flamsteed", "text": "English astronomer (1646\u20131719)\nJohn Flamsteed (19 August 1646 \u2013 31 December 1719) was an English astronomer and the first Astronomer Royal. His main achievements were the preparation of a 3,000-star catalogue, \"Catalogus Britannicus\", and a star atlas called \"Atlas Coelestis\", both published posthumously. He also made the first recorded observations of Uranus, although he mistakenly catalogued it as a star, and he laid the foundation stone for the Royal Greenwich Observatory.\nLife.\nFlamsteed was born in Denby, Derbyshire, England, the only son of Stephen Flamsteed and his first wife, Mary Spadman. He was educated at the free school of Derby and at Derby School, in St Peter's Churchyard, Derby, near where his father carried on a malting business. At that time, most masters of the school were Puritans. Flamsteed had a solid knowledge of Latin, essential for reading the scientific literature of the day, and a love of history, leaving the school in May 1662.\nHis progress to Jesus College, Cambridge, recommended by the Master of Derby School, was delayed by some years of chronic ill health. During those years, Flamsteed gave his father some help in his business, and from his father learnt arithmetic and the use of fractions, developing a keen interest in mathematics and astronomy. In July 1662, he was fascinated by the thirteenth-century work of Johannes de Sacrobosco, \"De sphaera mundi\", and on 12 September 1662 observed his first partial solar eclipse. Early in 1663, he read Thomas Fale's \"Horologiographia: The Art of Dialling\", which set off an interest in sundials. In the summer of 1663, he read Wingate's \"Canon\", William Oughtred's \"Canon\", and Thomas Stirrup's \"Art of Dialling\". At about the same time, he acquired Thomas Street's \"Astronomia Carolina, or A New Theory of the Celestial Motions\" (\"Caroline Tables\"). He associated himself with local gentlemen interested in astronomy, including William Litchford, whose library included the work of the astrologer John Gadbury which included astronomical tables by Jeremiah Horrocks, who had died in 1641 at the age of twenty-two. Flamsteed was greatly impressed (as Isaac Newton had been) by the work of Horrocks.\nIn August 1665, at the age of nineteen and as a gift for his friend Litchford, Flamsteed wrote his first paper on astronomy, entitled \"Mathematical Essays\", concerning the design, use and construction of an astronomer's quadrant, including tables for the latitude of Derby. In September 1670, Flamsteed visited Cambridge and entered his name as an undergraduate at Jesus College. While it seems he never took up full residence, he was there for two months in 1674, and had the opportunity to hear Isaac Newton's \"Lucasian Lectures\".\nOrdained a deacon, he was preparing to take up a living in Derbyshire when he was invited to London by his patron Jonas Moore, Surveyor-General of the Ordnance. Moore had recently made an offer to the Royal Society to pay for the establishment of an observatory. These plans were, however, preempted when Charles II was persuaded by his mistress, Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, to hear about a proposal to find longitude by the position of the Moon from an individual known as Le Sieur de St Pierre. Charles appointed a Royal Commission to examine the proposal in December 1674, consisting of Lord Brouncker, Seth Ward, Samuel Moreland, Christopher Wren, Silius Titus, John Pell and Robert Hooke.\nHaving arrived in London on 2 February 1675, and staying with Jonas Moore at the Tower of London, Flamsteed had the opportunity to be taken by Titus to meet the King. He was subsequently admitted as an official Assistant to the Royal Commission and supplied observations in order to test St Pierre's proposal and to offer his own comments. The commission's conclusions were that, although St Pierre's proposal was not worth further consideration, the King should consider establishing an observatory and appointing an observer in order to better map the stars and the motions of the Moon in order to underpin the successful development of the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.\nOn 4 March 1675 Flamsteed was appointed by royal warrant \"The King's Astronomical Observator\" \u2013 the first English Astronomer Royal, with an allowance of \u00a3100 a year. The warrant stated his task as \"rectifieing the Tables of the motions of the Heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired Longitude of places for Perfecteing the Art of Navigation\". In June 1675, another royal warrant provided for the founding of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and Flamsteed laid the foundation stone on 10 August.\nIn February 1676, he was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in July, he moved into the Observatory. In 1684 he was \"[e]levated to the priesthood [and] appointed rector\" of the small village of Burstow, near Crawley in Surrey. He held that office, as well as that of Astronomer Royal, until his death in 1719. He is buried at Burstow, and the east window in the church was dedicated to him as a memorial. \n The will of Flamsteed's widow, Margaret, left instructions for her own remains to be deposited \"in the same Grave in which Mr John Flamsteed is buryed in the Chancell of Burstow Church\". She also left instructions, and twenty five pounds, for the executor of her will to place \"in the aforesaid Chancell of Burstow \u2026 A Marble stone or Monument, with an inscription in Latin, in memory of the late Reverend Mr. John Flamsteed\". It seems no such monument was created, and almost 200 years later, a plaque was placed to mark his burial in the chancel. After his death, his papers and scientific instruments were taken by his widow. The papers were returned many years later, but the instruments disappeared.\nScientific work.\nFlamsteed accurately calculated the solar eclipses of 1666 and 1668. He was responsible for several of the earliest recorded sightings of the planet Uranus, which he mistook for a star and catalogued as '34 Tauri'. The first of these was in December 1690, which remains the earliest known sighting of Uranus by an astronomer.\nIn October 1672, when Mars was in opposition, Flamsteed used eyepieces with illuminated micrometer reticle carrying double cross-hairs, to measure Mars' diurnal parallax, thus allowing Flamsteed to estimate the distance to Mars and hence the astronomical unit. To this end, Flamsteed compared the apparent shift of Mars during the night with respect to other stars, this shift being superimposed on Mars' apparent night-to-night course among the stars.\nOn 16 August 1680 Flamsteed catalogued a star, 3 Cassiopeiae, that later astronomers were unable to corroborate. Three hundred years later, the American astronomical historian William Ashworth suggested that what Flamsteed may have seen was the most recent supernova in the galaxy's history, an event which would leave as its remnant the strongest radio source outside of the Solar System, known in the third Cambridge (3C) catalogue as 3C 461 and commonly called Cassiopeia A by astronomers. Because the position of \"3 Cassiopeiae\" does not precisely match that of Cassiopeia A, and because the expansion wave associated with the explosion has been worked backward to the year 1667 and not 1680, some historians feel that all Flamsteed may have done was incorrectly note the position of a star already known.\nIn 1681 Flamsteed proposed that the two great comets observed in November and December 1680 were not separate bodies, but rather a single comet travelling first towards the Sun and then away from it. Although Isaac Newton first disagreed with Flamsteed, he later came to agree with him and theorized that comets, like planets, moved around the Sun in large, closed elliptical orbits. Flamsteed later learned that Newton had gained access to his observations and data through Edmond Halley, his former assistant with whom he previously had a cordial relationship.\nAs Astronomer Royal, Flamsteed spent some forty years observing and making meticulous records for his star catalogue, which would eventually triple the number of entries in Tycho Brahe's sky atlas. Unwilling to risk his reputation by releasing unverified data, he kept the incomplete records under seal at Greenwich. In 1712, Isaac Newton, then President of the Royal Society, and Edmond Halley again obtained Flamsteed's data and published a pirated star catalogue. Flamsteed managed to gather three hundred of the four hundred printings and burned them. \"If Sir I.N. would be sensible of it, I have done both him and Dr. Halley a great kindness,\" he wrote to his assistant Abraham Sharp. The data from the pirated catalogue were used by the London cartographer John Senex to produce star charts in the 1720s before Flamsteed's own charts were ready.\nIn 1725 Flamsteed's own version of \"Historia Coelestis Britannica\" was published posthumously, edited by his wife, Margaret Flamsteed. This contained Flamsteed's observations, and included a catalogue of 2,935 stars to much greater accuracy than any prior work. It was considered the first significant contribution of the Greenwich Observatory, and the numerical Flamsteed designations for stars that were added subsequently to a French edition are still in use. In 1729 his wife published his \"Atlas Coelestis\", assisted by Joseph Crosthwait and Abraham Sharp, who were responsible for the technical side.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ancient Greece developed a cosmogony focused on the origin of matter, space, and time with a transition from Chaos to Cosmos. This was a form of \"philosophical cosmogony\" that is distinct from modern empirical science but which nevertheless dealt with many similar questions. Another type of cosmogony focuses on the formation and evolution of the Solar System. or sometimes the formation of galaxies. The standard cosmological model of the early development of the universe is the Big Bang theory, but it is based on a model known to fail at the very earliest times. Thus modern cosmogony is not generally a consequence of modern cosmology theories.\nScientific cosmogenesis.\nA Big Bang model for the dynamics of the universe is widely agreed among cosmologists. Like most physical models, Big Bang models describe changes of state. Few physical models are designed to determine initial conditions: initial states are given by experimental measurements or by hypothesis.\nIn cosmology, the initial state would be the origin of the universe. It is considered a valid challenge to address but there are significant disagreements over even the form of acceptable answers.\nInitial singularity.\nSince the Big Bang model describes an expanding and cooling universe, it must have been denser and hotter in the past. Conceptually the model can be extrapolated back to time zero. However, this process cannot be run all the way back to time zero: the standard model assumes a density low enough to avoid quantum effects. As the model is followed to smaller times the density exceeds the validity of general relativity. This point in time is called the Planck time.\nGeneral relativity initial state.\nOne approach to the limitations of running Big Bang model back to time zero simply stops extrapolating when the limit of valid general relativity is reached. This model by itself fails in several ways. First, the observable universe is much more homogeneous than an extrapolated Big Bang can account for. This problem is called the horizon problem because events on opposite sides of the horizon could not have mixed in the early universe and thus should not be homogeneous now. Second, the expansion of the universe reduces curvature or equivalently increases flatness. Since the universe now is observed to be close to flat, a universe extrapolated back in time would have to be extremely flat. This almost but not quite zero curvature seems unnatural, an issue called the flatness problem. Third, this extrapolation gives poor results when compared to measurements of large scale structure and of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nInitial state theories.\nSeveral different theories have been proposed as alternative to simple extrapolation of general relativity. The most successful approach is called inflation. In this model the universe goes through a very short phase of intense expansion not predicted by general relativity. The expansion is so immense and fast that all pre-existing particles are diluted and replaced by particles emerging from the field that drove inflation in an process called reheating. An initially homogeneous universe, inflated by an enormous factor explains why we can see homogeneous features across distances which ordinary causality asserts are independent.\nWhen combined with the Big Bang and other concepts of cosmology, inflation becomes the \nconsensus or standard model of cosmology, a model which successfully predicts details of large scale structure and the CMB. While inflation has been successful in developing an initial state for Big Bang models, it does not by itself describe the origin of the universe. The rapid expansion erases evidence of physical processes occurring before inflation.\nQuantum cosmology.\nSean M. Carroll, who specializes in theoretical cosmology and field theory, explains two competing explanations for the origins of the singularity, which is the center of a space in which a characteristic is limitless (one example is the singularity of a black hole, where gravity is the characteristic that becomes limitless\u200a\u2014\u200ainfinite).\nWhen the universe started to expand, the Big Bang occurred, which evidently began the universe. The other explanation, the Hartle\u2013Hawking state, held by proponents such as Stephen Hawking, asserts that time did not exist when it emerged along with the universe. This assertion implies that the universe does not have a beginning, as time did not exist \"prior\" to the universe. Hence, it is unclear whether properties such as space or time emerged with the singularity and the known universe.\nMythology.\nIn mythology, creation or cosmogonic myths are narratives describing the beginning of the universe or cosmos.\nSome methods of the creation of the universe in mythology include:\nCreation myths may be etiological, attempting to provide explanations for the origin of the universe. For instance, Eridu Genesis, the oldest known creation myth, contains an account of the creation of the world in which the universe was created out of a primeval sea (Abzu). Creation myths vary, but they may share similar deities or symbols. For instance, the ruler of the gods in Greek mythology, Zeus, is similar to the ruler of the gods in Roman mythology, Jupiter. Another example is the ruler of the gods in Tagalog mythology, Bathala, who is similar to various rulers of certain pantheons within Philippine mythology such as the Bisaya's Kaptan.\nCompared with cosmology.\nIn the humanities, the distinction between cosmogony and cosmology is blurred. For example, in theology, the cosmological argument for the existence of God (pre-cosmic cosmogonic bearer of personhood) is an appeal to ideas concerning the origin of the universe and is thus cosmogonical. Some religious cosmogonies have an impersonal first cause (for example Taoism).\nHowever, in astronomy, cosmogony can be distinguished from cosmology, which studies the universe and its existence, but does not necessarily inquire into its origins. There is therefore a scientific distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. Physical cosmology is the science that attempts to explain all observations relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe on its largest scale. Some questions regarding the behaviour of the universe have been described by some physicists and cosmologists as being extra-scientific or metaphysical. Attempted solutions to such questions may include the extrapolation of scientific theories to untested regimes (such as the Planck epoch), or the inclusion of philosophical or religious ideas.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman with Jude Law, Loren Dean, Ernest Borgnine, Gore Vidal, and Alan Arkin appearing in supporting roles. The film presents a future society driven by eugenics where children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents. The principal character, Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome genetic discrimination to realize his dream of going into space.\nThe film draws on concerns over reproductive technologies that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of destiny and the ways in which it can and does govern lives. Characters in \"Gattaca\" continually battle both with society and with themselves to find their place in the world and who they are destined to be according to their genes.\nThe film's title is based on the letters G, A, T, and C, which stand for guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine, the four nucleobases of DNA. It was a 1997 nominee for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. A follow-up series was in development at Showtime, but has been cancelled as of 2023.\nPlot.\nIn the \"not-too-distant\" future, eugenics is common. A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those created through IVF \"valids\" while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"in-valids\". Genetic discrimination is illegal, but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial labor.\nVincent Freeman was conceived naturally, and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their second child, Anton Jr. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"chicken\" by swimming out to sea as far as possible, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel, but is constantly reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\nYears later, Vincent works cleaning office spaces, including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using donated hair, skin, blood, and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow, who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome's genetic profile, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca and is assigned as a navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn's moon Titan. To conceal his identity, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples, and hide his heart defect.\nWhen a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a possible launch, the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes near the crime scene, but can only identify it as from an \"unregistered\" in-valid, and thus launch an investigation to find who owns the eyelash. During this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any deep space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing silver in the Olympics, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet somehow wasn't, and is suffering because of this.\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director Josef killed the administrator because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who consequently has discovered Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night, Vincent's stamina surprises Anton, so Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him again and swims them back to shore.\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board, but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, who oversees background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, who is genetically selected, but \"not all that they were promised\", could exceed his potential just as Vincent has. The doctor changes the test results, allowing Vincent to pass.\nAs the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and immolates himself in his home's incinerator. Vincent opens the note to find a lock of Jerome's hair.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nThe film was shot under the working title \"The Eighth Day\", a reference to the seven days of creation in the Bible. However, by the time its release was scheduled for the fall of 1997, the Belgian film had already been released in the US under the title \"The Eighth Day\". As a result, the film was retitled \"Gattaca\", which takes inspiration from the letters G, A, T, and C, derived from four of the nucleobases of DNA: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine.\nFilming.\nThe exteriors (including the roof scene) and some of the interior shots of the Gattaca complex were filmed at Frank Lloyd Wright's 1960 Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California. The speakers in the complex broadcast announcements in both Esperanto and English; Miko Sloper from the Esperanto League of North America went to the recording studio to handle the Esperanto part.\nDesign.\nThe movie uses a swimming treadmill in the opening minutes to punctuate the swimming and futuristic themes. The production design makes heavy use of retrofuturism; the futuristic electric cars are based on 1960s car models like Rover P6, Citro\u00ebn DS19 and Studebaker Avanti.\nTitle sequence.\nThe opening title sequence, created by Michael Riley, features closeups of body matter (fingernails and hair), which are later revealed to be from Vincent's daily bodily scourings, hitting the floor accompanied by loud sounds as the objects strike the ground. According to Riley, oversized models of the fingernails and hair were created for the effect.\nMusic and soundtrack.\nThe score for \"Gattaca\" was composed by Michael Nyman, and the original soundtrack was released on October 21, 1997.\nRelease.\nBox office.\n\"Gattaca\" was released in theaters on October 24, 1997, in the United States by Columbia Pictures and opened at number 5 at the box office; trailing \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"The Devil's Advocate\", \"Kiss the Girls\" and \"Seven Years in Tibet\". Over the first weekend the film brought in $4.3 million. It ended its theatrical run with a domestic total of $12.5 million against a reported production budget of $36 million.\nHome media.\n\"Gattaca\" was released on DVD on July 1, 1998, and was also released on Superbit DVD. Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray versions were released on March 11, 2008. Both editions contain a deleted scene featuring historical figures like Einstein, Lincoln, etc., who are described as having been genetically deficient.\n\"Gattaca\" was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in 2021.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Gattaca\" received positive reviews from critics. The film received an approval rating of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 66 reviews, with a rating average of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus states that \"Intelligent and scientifically provocative, \"Gattaca\" is an absorbing sci-fi drama that poses important interesting ethical questions about the nature of science.\" On Metacritic, the film received \"generally favorable\" reviews with a score of 64 out of 100, based on 20 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.\nSiskel and Ebert gave the film two thumbs up on the October 25, 1997, episode of their program, with Gene Siskel commenting that the film had a \"smart script\". In his other review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert stated, \"This is one of the smartest and most provocative of science fiction films, a thriller with ideas.\" James Berardinelli praised it for \"energy and tautness\" and its \"thought-provoking script and thematic richness.\"\nAlthough critically acclaimed, \"Gattaca\" was not a box office success, but it is said to have crystallized the debate over the controversial topic of human genetic engineering. The film's dystopian depiction of \"genoism\" has been cited by many bioethicists and laypeople in support of their hesitancy about, or opposition to, eugenics and the societal acceptance of the genetic-determinist ideology that may frame it. In a 1997 review of the film for the journal \"Nature Genetics\", molecular biologist Lee M. Silver stated that \"\"Gattaca\" is a film that all geneticists should see if for no other reason than to understand the perception of our trade held by so many of the public-at-large\".\nContinuation.\nOn October 30, 2009, \"Variety\" reported that Sony Pictures Television was developing a television adaptation of the feature film as a one-hour police procedural set in the future. The show was to be written by Gil Grant, who has written for \"24\" and \"NCIS\". A \"Gattaca\" television series was revealed to be in development at Sony and Showtime in March 2023. It was intended to take place one generation after the events of the film. Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa were tapped as showrunners, and were also expected to serve as screenwriters alongside Craig Borten. Gordon, Gansa, Glenn Gellar, and actor Danny DeVito (who produced the film) would have served as executive producers. However, in June 2023, Showtime announced that they had abandoned plans to produce the show.\nLegacy.\nInfluence on \"In Time\".\nWriter-director Andrew Niccol has called his 2011 film \"In Time\" a \"bastard child of \"Gattaca\"\". Both films feature classic cars in a futuristic dystopia as well as a caste privilege schism which the protagonist challenges and which prejudices the authorities into neglecting a thorough investigation in favor of condemning the protagonist.\nPolitical references.\nU.S. Senator Rand Paul used near-verbatim portions of the plot summary from the English Wikipedia entry on \"Gattaca\" in a speech at Liberty University on October 28, 2013, in support of Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli's campaign for Governor of Virginia. Paul said that abortion rights advocates are advancing eugenics in a manner similar to the events in \"Gattaca\".\nTranshumanism.\nIn the 2004 democratic transhumanist book \"Citizen Cyborg\", bioethicist James Hughes criticized the premise and influence of the film as fear-mongering, arguing:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "42888", "revid": "43866522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42888", "title": "Human genome", "text": "Complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans\nThe human genome is a complete set of DNA sequences for each of the 22 autosomes and the two distinct sex chromosomes (X and Y). A small DNA molecule is found within individual mitochondria. These are usually treated separately as the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome. \nHuman genomes include both genes and various other types of functional DNA elements. The latter is a diverse category that includes regulatory DNA scaffolding regions, telomeres, centromeres, and origins of replication. In addition, there are large numbers of transposable elements, inserted viral DNA, non-functional pseudogenes and simple, highly repetitive sequences. Introns make up a large percentage of the human genome. \nSome of the genome is non-functional junk DNA, such as pseudogenes, but there is no firm consensus on the total amount of junk DNA.\nSize of the human genome.\nIn 2000, scientists reported the sequencing of 88% of human genome, but as of 2020, at least 8% was still missing. In 2021, scientists reported sequencing a complete, female genome (i.e., without the Y chromosome). The human Y chromosome, consisting of 62,460,029 base pairs from a different cell line and found in all males, was sequenced completely in January 2022.\nThe current version of the standard reference genome is called GRCh38.p14 (July 2023). It consists of 22 autosomes plus one copy of the X chromosome and one copy of the Y chromosome. It contains approximately 3.1 billion base pairs. This represents the size of a composite genome based on data from multiple individuals but it is a good indication of the typical amount of DNA in a haploid set of chromosomes because the Y chromosome is quite small. Most human cells are diploid so they contain twice as much DNA (~6.2 billion base pairs). \nIn 2023, a draft human pangenome reference was published. It is based on 47 genomes from persons of varied ethnicity. Plans are underway for an improved reference capturing still more biodiversity from a still wider sample.\nWhile there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1% due to single-nucleotide variants and 0.6% when considering indels), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the bonobos and chimpanzees (~1.1% fixed single-nucleotide variants and 4% when including indels).\nMolecular organization and gene content.\nThe total length of the human reference genome does not represent the sequence of any specific individual, nor does it represent the sequence of all of the DNA found within a cell. The human reference genome only includes one copy of each of the paired, homologous autosomes plus one copy of each of the two sex chromosomes (X and Y). The total amount of DNA in this reference genome is 3.1 billion base pairs.\nProtein-coding genes.\nProtein-coding sequences represent the most widely studied and best understood component of the human genome. These sequences ultimately lead to the production of all human proteins, although several biological processes (e.g. DNA rearrangements and alternative pre-mRNA splicing) can lead to the production of many more unique proteins than the number of protein-coding genes. \nThe human reference genome contains somewhere between 19,000 and 20,000 protein-coding genes. These genes contain an average of 10 introns and the average size of an intron is about 6 kb (6,000 bp). This means that the average size of a protein-coding gene is about 62 kb and these genes take up about 40% of the genome.\nExon sequences consist of coding DNA and untranslated regions (UTRs) at either end of the mature mRNA. The total amount of coding DNA is about 1-2% of the genome.\nMany people divide the genome into coding and non-coding DNA based on the idea that coding DNA is the most important functional component of the genome. About 98\u201399% of the human genome is non-coding DNA.\nNon-coding genes.\nNoncoding RNA molecules play many essential roles in cells, especially in the many reactions of protein synthesis and RNA processing. Noncoding genes include those for tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, microRNAs, snRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The number of reported non-coding genes continues to rise slowly but the exact number in the human genome is yet to be determined. Many RNAs are thought to be non-functional.\nMany ncRNAs are critical elements in gene regulation and expression. Noncoding RNA also contributes to epigenetics, transcription, RNA splicing, and the translational machinery. The role of RNA in genetic regulation and disease offers a new potential level of unexplored genomic complexity.\nPseudogenes.\nPseudogenes are inactive copies of protein-coding genes, often generated by gene duplication, that have become nonfunctional through the accumulation of inactivating mutations. The number of pseudogenes in the human genome is on the order of 13,000, and in some chromosomes is nearly the same as the number of functional protein-coding genes. Gene duplication is a major mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular evolution.\nFor example, the olfactory receptor gene family is one of the best-documented examples of pseudogenes in the human genome. More than 60 percent of the genes in this family are non-functional pseudogenes in humans. By comparison, only 20 percent of genes in the mouse olfactory receptor gene family are pseudogenes. Research suggests that this is a species-specific characteristic, as the most closely related primates all have proportionally fewer pseudogenes. This genetic discovery helps to explain the less acute sense of smell in humans relative to other mammals.\nRegulatory DNA sequences.\nThe human genome has many different regulatory sequences which are crucial to controlling gene expression. Some scientists believe that these sequences make up 8% of the genome, but other scientists predict that 20% or more of the human genome might be devoted to regulatory sequences. \nA value of 8% would correspond to approximately 10,000 bp of regulatory DNA per gene and a value of 20% corresponds to 25,000 bp of regulatory DNA per gene. Many scientists think that these estimates are unreasonably high and conflict with the view that only 10% of the genome is functional and 90% is junk DNA.\nRegulatory sequences have been known since the late 1960s. The first identification of regulatory sequences in the human genome relied on recombinant DNA technology. Later with the advent of genomic sequencing, the identification of these sequences could be inferred by evolutionary conservation. The evolutionary branch between the primates and mouse, for example, occurred 70\u201390 million years ago. So computer comparisons of gene sequences that identify conserved sequences will be an indication of their importance in functions such as gene regulation.\nThe results indicate that about 10% of the human genome is conserved. Several hundred thousand human genome sequences have been sequenced and there is a considerable amount of variation between individuals. Only 10% of the genome seems to be protected from mutations by purifying selection.\nAs of 2012, the efforts have shifted toward finding interactions between DNA and regulatory proteins by the technique ChIP-Seq, or gaps where the DNA is not packaged by histones (DNase hypersensitive sites), both of which tell where there are potential regulatory sequences in the investigated cell type.\nRepetitive DNA sequences.\nRepetitive DNA sequences comprise approximately 50% of the human genome.\nAbout 8% of the human genome consists of tandem DNA arrays or tandem repeats, low complexity repeat sequences that have multiple adjacent copies (e.g. \"CAGCAGCAG...\"). The tandem sequences may be of variable lengths, from two nucleotides to tens of nucleotides. These sequences are highly variable, even among closely related individuals, and so are used for genealogical DNA testing and forensic DNA analysis.\nRepeated sequences of fewer than ten nucleotides (e.g. the dinucleotide repeat (AC)n) are termed microsatellite sequences. Among the microsatellite sequences, trinucleotide repeats are of particular importance, as sometimes occur within coding regions of genes for proteins and may lead to genetic disorders. For example, Huntington's disease results from an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n within the \"Huntingtin\" gene on human chromosome 4. Telomeres (the ends of linear chromosomes) end with a microsatellite hexanucleotide repeat of the sequence (TTAGGG)n.\nTandem repeats of longer sequences (arrays of repeated sequences 10\u201360 nucleotides long) are termed minisatellites.\nTransposable genetic elements, DNA sequences that can replicate and insert copies of themselves at other locations within a host genome, are an abundant component in the human genome. The most abundant transposon lineage, \"Alu\", has about 50,000 active copies, and can be inserted into intragenic and intergenic regions. One other lineage, LINE-1, has about 100 active copies per genome (the number varies between people). Together with non-functional relics of old transposons, they account for over half of total human DNA. Sometimes called \"jumping genes\", transposons have played a major role in sculpting the human genome. Some of these sequences represent endogenous retroviruses, DNA copies of viral sequences that have become permanently integrated into the genome and are now passed on to succeeding generations. There are also a significant number of retroviruses in human DNA, at least 3 of which have been proven to possess an important function (i.e., HIV-like functional HERV-K; envelope genes of non-functional viruses HERV-W and HERV-FRD play a role in placenta formation by inducing cell-cell fusion).\nMobile elements within the human genome can be classified into LTR retrotransposons (8.3% of total genome), SINEs (13.1% of total genome) including Alu elements, LINEs (20.4% of total genome), SVAs (SINE-VNTR-Alu) and Class II DNA transposons (2.9% of total genome).\nJunk DNA.\nThere is no consensus on what constitutes a \"functional\" element in the genome since geneticists, evolutionary biologists, and molecular biologists employ different definitions and methods. Due to the ambiguity in the terminology, different schools of thought have emerged. In evolutionary definitions, \"functional\" DNA, whether it is coding or non-coding, contributes to the fitness of the organism, and therefore is maintained by negative evolutionary pressure whereas \"non-functional\" DNA has no benefit to the organism and therefore is under neutral selective pressure. This type of DNA has been described as junk DNA. In genetic definitions, \"functional\" DNA is related to how DNA segments manifest by phenotype and \"nonfunctional\" is related to loss-of-function effects on the organism. In biochemical definitions, \"functional\" DNA relates to DNA sequences that specify molecular products (e.g. noncoding RNAs) and biochemical activities with mechanistic roles in gene or genome regulation (i.e. DNA sequences that impact cellular level activity such as cell type, condition, and molecular processes). There is no consensus in the literature on the amount of functional DNA since, depending on how \"function\" is understood, ranges have been estimated from up to 90% of the human genome is likely nonfunctional DNA (junk DNA) to up to 80% of the genome is likely functional. It is also possible that junk DNA may acquire a function in the future and therefore may play a role in evolution, but this is likely to occur only very rarely. Finally DNA that is deleterious to the organism and is under negative selective pressure is called garbage DNA.\nSequencing.\nThe first human genome sequences were published in nearly complete draft form in February 2001 by the Human Genome Project and Celera Corporation. Completion of the Human Genome Project's sequencing effort was announced in 2004 with the publication of a draft genome sequence, leaving just 341 gaps in the sequence, representing highly repetitive and other DNA that could not be sequenced with the technology available at the time. The human genome was the first of all vertebrates to be sequenced to such near-completion, and as of 2018, the diploid genomes of over a million individual humans had been determined using next-generation sequencing.\nThese data are used worldwide in biomedical science, anthropology, forensics and other branches of science. Such genomic studies have led to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and to new insights in many fields of biology, including human evolution.\nBy 2018, the total number of genes had been raised to at least 46,831, plus another 2300 micro-RNA genes. A 2018 population survey found another 300 million bases of human genome that was not in the reference sequence. Prior to the acquisition of the full genome sequence, estimates of the number of human genes ranged from 50,000 to 140,000 (with occasional vagueness about whether these estimates included non-protein coding genes). As genome sequence quality and the methods for identifying protein-coding genes improved, the count of recognized protein-coding genes dropped to 19,000\u201320,000.\nIn 2022, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium reported the complete sequence of a human female genome, filling all the gaps in the X chromosome (2020) and the 22 autosomes (May 2021). The previously unsequenced parts contain immune response genes that help to adapt to and survive infections, as well as genes that are important for predicting drug response. The completed human genome sequence will also provide better understanding of human formation as an individual organism and how humans vary both between each other and other species.\nAlthough the 'completion' of the human genome project was announced in 2001, there remained hundreds of gaps, with about 5\u201310% of the total sequence remaining undetermined. The missing genetic information was mostly in repetitive heterochromatic regions and near the centromeres and telomeres, but also some gene-encoding euchromatic regions. There remained 160 euchromatic gaps in 2015 when the sequences spanning another 50 formerly unsequenced regions were determined. Only in 2020 was the first truly complete telomere-to-telomere sequence of a human chromosome determined, namely of the X chromosome. The first complete telomere-to-telomere sequence of a human autosomal chromosome, chromosome 8, followed a year later. The complete human genome (without Y chromosome) was published in 2021, while with Y chromosome in January 2022.\nIn 2023, a draft human pangenome reference was published. It is based on 47 genomes from persons of varied ethnicity. Plans are underway for an improved reference capturing still more biodiversity from a still wider sample.\nGenomic variation in humans.\nHuman reference genome.\nWith the exception of identical twins, all humans show significant variation in genomic DNA sequences. The human reference genome (HRG) is used as a standard sequence reference.\nThere are several important points concerning the human reference genome:\nThe Genome Reference Consortium is responsible for updating the HRG. Version 38 was released in December 2013.\nMeasuring human genetic variation.\nMost studies of human genetic variation have focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are substitutions in individual bases along a chromosome. Most analyses estimate that SNPs occur 1 in 1000 base pairs, on average, in the euchromatic human genome, although they do not occur at a uniform density. Thus follows the popular statement that \"we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9% the same\", although this would be somewhat qualified by most geneticists. For example, a much larger fraction of the genome is now thought to be involved in copy number variation. A large-scale collaborative effort to catalog SNP variations in the human genome is being undertaken by the International HapMap Project.\nThe genomic loci and length of certain types of small repetitive sequences are highly variable from person to person, which is the basis of DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies. The heterochromatic portions of the human genome, which total several hundred million base pairs, are also thought to be quite variable within the human population (they are so repetitive and so long that they cannot be accurately sequenced with current technology). These regions contain few genes, and it is unclear whether any significant phenotypic effect results from typical variation in repeats or heterochromatin.\nMost gross genomic mutations in gamete germ cells probably result in inviable embryos; however, a number of human diseases are related to large-scale genomic abnormalities. Down syndrome, Turner Syndrome, and a number of other diseases result from nondisjunction of entire chromosomes. Cancer cells frequently have aneuploidy of chromosomes and chromosome arms, although a cause and effect relationship between aneuploidy and cancer has not been established.\nMapping human genomic variation.\nWhereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome.\nAn example of a variation map is the HapMap being developed by the International HapMap Project. The HapMap is a haplotype map of the human genome, \"which will describe the common patterns of human DNA sequence variation.\" It catalogs the patterns of small-scale variations in the genome that involve single DNA letters, or bases.\nResearchers published the first sequence-based map of large-scale structural variation across the human genome in the journal \"Nature\" in May 2008. Large-scale structural variations are differences in the genome among people that range from a few thousand to a few million DNA bases; some are gains or losses of stretches of genome sequence and others appear as re-arrangements of stretches of sequence. These variations include differences in the number of copies individuals have of a particular gene, deletions, translocations and inversions.\nStructural variation.\nStructural variation refers to genetic variants that affect larger segments of the human genome, as opposed to point mutations. Often, structural variants (SVs) are defined as variants of 50 base pairs (bp) or greater, such as deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions and other rearrangements. About 90% of structural variants are noncoding deletions but most individuals have more than a thousand such deletions; the size of deletions ranges from dozens of base pairs to tens of thousands of bp. On average, individuals carry ~3 rare structural variants that alter coding regions, e.g. delete exons. About 2% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, especially rearrangements. That is, millions of base pairs may be inverted within a chromosome; ultra-rare means that they are only found in individuals or their family members and thus have arisen very recently.\nSNP frequency across the human genome.\nSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not occur homogeneously across the human genome. In fact, there is enormous diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes. The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 by the end of the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.\nPersonal genomes.\nA personal genome sequence is a (nearly) complete sequence of the chemical base pairs that make up the DNA of a single person. Because medical treatments have different effects on different people due to genetic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the analysis of personal genomes may lead to personalized medical treatment based on individual genotypes.\nThe first personal genome sequence to be determined was that of Craig Venter in 2007. Personal genomes had not been sequenced in the public Human Genome Project to protect the identity of volunteers who provided DNA samples. That sequence was derived from the DNA of several volunteers from a diverse population. However, early in the Venter-led Celera Genomics genome sequencing effort the decision was made to switch from sequencing a composite sample to using DNA from a single individual, later revealed to have been Venter himself. Thus the Celera human genome sequence released in 2000 was largely that of one man. Subsequent replacement of the early composite-derived data and determination of the diploid sequence, representing both sets of chromosomes, rather than a haploid sequence originally reported, allowed the release of the first personal genome. In April 2008, that of James Watson was also completed. In 2009, Stephen Quake published his own genome sequence derived from a sequencer of his own design, the Heliscope. A Stanford team led by Euan Ashley published a framework for the medical interpretation of human genomes implemented on Quake's genome and made whole genome-informed medical decisions for the first time. That team further extended the approach to the West family, the first family sequenced as part of Illumina's Personal Genome Sequencing program. Since then hundreds of personal genome sequences have been released, including those of Desmond Tutu, and of a Paleo-Eskimo. In 2012, the whole genome sequences of two family trios among 1092 genomes was made public. In November 2013, a Spanish family made four personal exome datasets (about 1% of the genome) publicly available under a Creative Commons public domain license. The Personal Genome Project (started in 2005) is among the few to make both genome sequences and corresponding medical phenotypes publicly available.\nThe sequencing of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity that had not been appreciated before. Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level of diversity in the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only in its very beginnings. Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.\nHuman knockouts.\nIn humans, gene knockouts naturally occur as heterozygous or homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts. These knockouts are often difficult to distinguish, especially within heterogeneous genetic backgrounds. They are also difficult to find as they occur in low frequencies.\nPopulations with high rates of consanguinity, such as countries with high rates of first-cousin marriages, display the highest frequencies of homozygous gene knockouts. Such populations include Pakistan, Iceland, and Amish populations. These populations with a high level of parental-relatedness have been subjects of human knock out research which has helped to determine the function of specific genes in humans. By distinguishing specific knockouts, researchers are able to use phenotypic analyses of these individuals to help characterize the gene that has been knocked out.\nKnockouts in specific genes can cause genetic diseases, potentially have beneficial effects, or even result in no phenotypic effect at all. However, determining a knockout's phenotypic effect and in humans can be challenging. Challenges to characterizing and clinically interpreting knockouts include difficulty calling of DNA variants, determining disruption of protein function (annotation), and considering the amount of influence mosaicism has on the phenotype.\nOne major study that investigated human knockouts is the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction study. It was found that individuals possessing a heterozygous loss-of-function gene knockout for the APOC3 gene had lower triglycerides in the blood after consuming a high fat meal as compared to individuals without the mutation. However, individuals possessing homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts of the APOC3 gene displayed the lowest level of triglycerides in the blood after the fat load test, as they produce no functional APOC3 protein.\nDNA damage.\nIn each cell of the human body, the human genome experiences, on average, tens of thousands of DNA damages per day. These damages can block genome replication or genome transcription, and if they are not repaired or are repaired incorrectly, they may lead to mutations, or other genome alterations in the human genome that threaten cell viability.\nHuman genetic disorders.\nMost aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) factors. Some inherited variation influences aspects of our biology that are not medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc.). Moreover, some genetic disorders only cause disease in combination with the appropriate environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders may be described as clinically defined diseases caused by genomic DNA sequence variation. In the most straightforward cases, the disorder can be associated with variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1,300 different mutations known.\nDisease-causing mutations in specific genes are usually severe in terms of gene function and are rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they constitute a significant component of known medical conditions, especially in pediatric medicine. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified. Currently there are approximately 2,200 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database.\nStudies of genetic disorders are often performed by means of family-based studies. In some instances, population based approaches are employed, particularly in the case of so-called founder populations such as those in Finland, French-Canada, Utah, Sardinia, etc. Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders are usually performed by a geneticist-physician trained in clinical/medical genetics. The results of the Human Genome Project are likely to provide increased availability of genetic testing for gene-related disorders, and eventually improved treatment. Parents can be screened for hereditary conditions and counselled on the consequences, the probability of inheritance, and how to avoid or ameliorate it in their offspring.\nThere are many different kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e., has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.\nWith the advent of the Human Genome and International HapMap Project, it has become feasible to explore subtle genetic influences on many common disease conditions such as diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc. Although some causal links have been made between genomic sequence variants in particular genes and some of these diseases, often with much publicity in the general media, these are usually not considered to be genetic disorders \"per se\" as their causes are complex, involving many different genetic and environmental factors. Thus there may be disagreement in particular cases whether a specific medical condition should be termed a genetic disorder.\nAdditional genetic disorders of mention are Kallman syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome (gene FGFR1), Fuchs corneal dystrophy (gene TCF4), Hirschsprung's disease (genes RET and FECH), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (genes CCDC28B and BBS1), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 (gene BBS10), and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (genes D4Z4 and SMCHD1).\nGenome sequencing is now able to narrow the genome down to specific locations to more accurately find mutations that will result in a genetic disorder. Copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are also able to be detected at the same time as genome sequencing with newer sequencing procedures available, called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). This only analyzes a small portion of the genome, around 1\u20132%. The results of this sequencing can be used for clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition, including Usher syndrome, retinal disease, hearing impairments, diabetes, epilepsy, Leigh disease, hereditary cancers, neuromuscular diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and diseases of the mitochondria. NGS can also be used to identify carriers of diseases before conception. The diseases that can be detected in this sequencing include Tay-Sachs disease, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile-X syndrome. The Next Genome Sequencing can be narrowed down to specifically look for diseases more prevalent in certain ethnic populations.\nEvolution.\nComparative genomics studies of mammalian genomes suggest that approximately 5% of the human genome has been conserved by evolution since the divergence of extant lineages approximately 200 million years ago, containing the vast majority of genes. The published chimpanzee genome differs from that of the human genome by 1.23% in direct sequence comparisons. Around 20% of this figure is accounted for by variation within each species, leaving only ~1.06% consistent sequence divergence between humans and chimps at shared genes. This nucleotide by nucleotide difference is dwarfed, however, by the portion of each genome that is not shared, including around 6% of functional genes that are unique to either humans or chimps.\nIn other words, the considerable observable differences between humans and chimps may be due as much or more to genome level variation in the number, function and expression of genes rather than DNA sequence changes in shared genes. Indeed, even within humans, there has been found to be a previously unappreciated amount of copy number variation (CNV) which can make up as much as 5\u201315% of the human genome. In other words, between humans, there could be +/- 500,000,000 base pairs of DNA, some being active genes, others inactivated, or active at different levels. The full significance of this finding remains to be seen. On average, a typical human protein-coding gene differs from its chimpanzee ortholog by only two amino acid substitutions; nearly one third of human genes have exactly the same protein translation as their chimpanzee orthologs. A major difference between the two genomes is human chromosome 2, which is equivalent to a fusion product of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13. (later renamed to chromosomes 2A and 2B, respectively).\nHumans have undergone an extraordinary loss of olfactory receptor genes during our recent evolution, which explains our relatively crude sense of smell compared to most other mammals. Evolutionary evidence suggests that the emergence of color vision in humans and several other primate species has diminished the need for the sense of smell.\nIn September 2016, scientists reported that, based on human DNA genetic studies, all non-Africans in the world today can be traced to a single population that exited Africa between 50,000 and 80,000 years ago.\nMitochondrial DNA.\nThe human mitochondrial DNA is of tremendous interest to geneticists, since it undoubtedly plays a role in mitochondrial disease. It also sheds light on human evolution; for example, analysis of variation in the human mitochondrial genome has led to the postulation of a recent common ancestor for all humans on the maternal line of descent (see Mitochondrial Eve).\nDue to the damage induced by the exposure to Reactive Oxygen Species mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage. Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, or there was strong positive selection for that mtDNA. For example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of a person's 32 ancestors contributed to that person's mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal an expected ~3% of that person's autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, yet they would have a ~97% chance of having no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA.\nEpigenome.\nEpigenetics describes a variety of features of the human genome that transcend its primary DNA sequence, such as chromatin packaging, histone modifications and DNA methylation, and which are important in regulating gene expression, genome replication and other cellular processes. Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression and one of the most highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA methylation profile experiences dramatic changes. In early germ line cells, the genome has very low methylation levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased methylation activity.\nEpigenetic patterns can be identified between tissues within an individual as well as between individuals themselves. Identical genes that have differences only in their epigenetic state are called epialleles. Epialleles can be placed into three categories: those directly determined by an individual's genotype, those influenced by genotype, and those entirely independent of genotype. The epigenome is also influenced significantly by environmental factors. Diet, toxins, and hormones impact the epigenetic state. Studies in dietary manipulation have demonstrated that methyl-deficient diets are associated with hypomethylation of the epigenome. Such studies establish epigenetics as an important interface between the environment and the genome.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The machine induces a potential difference between two metal cages, inside a vacuum. Positive ions fall down this voltage drop, building up speed. If they collide in the center, they can fuse. This is one kind of an inertial electrostatic confinement device \u2013 a branch of fusion research.\nA Farnsworth\u2013Hirsch fusor is the most common type of fusor. This design came from work by Philo T. Farnsworth in 1964 and Robert L. Hirsch in 1967. A variant type of fusor had been proposed previously by William Elmore, James L. Tuck, and Ken Watson at the Los Alamos National Laboratory though they never built the machine.\nFusors have been built by various institutions. These include academic institutions such as the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and government entities, such as the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority. Fusors have also been developed commercially, as sources for neutrons by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and as a method for generating medical isotopes. Fusors have also become very popular for hobbyists and amateurs. A growing number of amateurs have performed nuclear fusion using simple fusor machines. However, fusors are not considered a viable concept for large-scale energy production by scientists.\nMechanism.\nUnderlying physics.\nFusion takes place when nuclei approach to a distance where the nuclear force can pull them together into a single larger nucleus. Opposing this close approach are the positive charges in the nuclei, which force them apart due to the electrostatic force. In order to produce fusion events, the nuclei must have initial energy great enough to allow them to overcome this Coulomb barrier. As the nuclear force is increased with the number of nucleons, protons and neutrons, and the electromagnetic force is increased with the number of protons only, the easiest atoms to fuse are isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium with one neutron, and tritium with two. With hydrogen fuels, about 3 to 10\u00a0keV is needed to allow the reaction to take place.\nTraditional approaches to fusion power have generally attempted to heat the fuel to temperatures where the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of their resulting energies is high enough that some of the particles in the long tail have the required energy. High enough in this case is such that the rate of the fusion reactions produces enough energy to offset energy losses to the environment and thus heat the surrounding fuel to the same temperatures and produce a self-sustaining reaction known as \"ignition\". Calculations show this takes place at about 50\u00a0million\u00a0kelvin (K), although higher numbers on the order of 100\u00a0million\u00a0K are desirable in practical machines. Due to the extremely high temperatures, fusion reactions are also referred to as \"thermo\"nuclear.\nWhen atoms are heated to temperatures corresponding to thousands of degrees, the electrons become increasingly free of their nucleus. This leads to a gas-like state of matter known as a plasma, consisting of free nuclei known as ions, and their former electrons. As a plasma consists of free-moving charges, it can be controlled using magnetic and electrical fields. Fusion devices use this capability to retain the fuel at millions of degrees.\nFusor concept.\nThe fusor is part of a broader class of devices that attempts to give the fuel fusion-relevant energies by directly accelerating the ions toward each other. In the case of the fusor, this is accomplished with electrostatic forces. For every volt that an ion of \u00b11 charge is accelerated across it gains 1 electronvolt in energy. To reach the required ~10\u00a0keV, a voltage of 10\u00a0kV is required, applied to both particles. For comparison, the electron gun in a typical television cathode-ray tube is on the order of 3 to 6\u00a0kV, so the complexity of such a device is fairly limited. For a variety of reasons, energies on the order of 15\u00a0keV are used. This corresponds to the average kinetic energy at a temperature of approximately 174\u00a0million\u00a0Kelvin, a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma temperature.\nThe problem with this colliding beam fusion approach, in general, is that the ions will most likely never hit each other no matter how precisely aimed. Even the most minor misalignment will cause the particles to scatter and thus fail to fuse. It is simple to demonstrate that the scattering chance is many orders of magnitude higher than the fusion rate, meaning that the vast majority of the energy supplied to the ions will go to waste and those fusion reactions that do occur cannot make up for these losses. To be energy positive, a fusion device must recycle these ions back into the fuel mass so that they have thousands or millions of such chances to fuse, and their energy must be retained as much as possible during this period.\nThe fusor attempts to meet this requirement through the spherical arrangement of its accelerator grid system. Ions that fail to fuse pass through the center of the device and back into the accelerator on the far side, where they are accelerated back into the center again. There is no energy lost in this action, and in theory, assuming infinitely thin grid wires, the ions can circulate forever with no additional energy needed. Even those that scatter will simply take on a new trajectory, exit the grid at some new point, and accelerate back into the center again, providing the circulation that is required for a fusion event to eventually take place.\nLosses.\nIt is important to consider the actual startup sequence of a fusor to understand the resulting operation. Normally the system is pumped down to a vacuum and then a small amount of gas is placed inside the vacuum chamber. This gas will spread out to fill the volume. When voltage is applied to the electrodes, the atoms between them will experience a field that will cause them to ionize and begin accelerating inward. As the atoms are randomly distributed to begin, the amount of energy they will gain differs; atoms initially near the anode will gain some large portion of the applied voltage, say 15\u00a0keV. Those initially near the cathode will gain much less energy, possibly far too low to undergo fusion with their counterparts on the far side of the central reaction area.\nThe fuel atoms inside the inner area during the startup period are not ionized. The accelerated ions scatter with these and lose their energy, while ionizing the formerly cold atom. This process, and the scatterings off other ions, causes the ion energies to become randomly distributed and the fuel rapidly takes on a non-thermal distribution. For this reason, the energy needed in a fusor system is higher than one where the fuel is heated by some other method, as some will be \"lost\" during startup.\nReal electrodes are not infinitely thin, and the potential for scattering off the wires or even capture of the ions within the electrodes is a significant issue that causes high conduction losses. These losses can be at least five orders of magnitude higher than the energy released from the fusion reaction, even when the fusor is in star mode, which minimizes these reactions.\nThere are numerous other loss mechanisms as well. These include charge exchange between high-energy ions and low-energy neutral particles, which causes the ion to capture the electron, become electrically neutral, and then leave the fusor as it is no longer accelerated back into the chamber. This leaves behind a newly ionized atom of lower energy and thus cools the plasma. Scatterings may also increase the energy of an ion which allows it to move past the anode and escape, in this example anything above 15\u00a0keV.\nAdditionally, the scatterings of both the ions, and especially impurities left in the chamber, lead to significant Bremsstrahlung, creating X-rays that carries energy out of the fuel. This effect grows with particle energy, meaning the problem becomes more pronounced as the system approaches fusion-relevant operating conditions.\nAs a result of these loss mechanisms, no fusor has ever come close to break-even energy output and it appears it is unable to ever do so.\nThe common sources of the high voltage are ZVS flyback HV sources and neon-sign transformers. It can also be called an electrostatic particle accelerator.\nHistory.\nThe fusor was originally conceived by Philo T. Farnsworth, better known for his pioneering work in television. In the early 1930s, he investigated a number of vacuum tube designs for use in television, and found one that led to an interesting effect. In this design, which he called the \"multipactor\", electrons moving from one electrode to another were stopped in mid-flight with the proper application of a high-frequency magnetic field. The charge would then accumulate in the center of the tube, leading to high amplification. Unfortunately it also led to high erosion on the electrodes when the electrons eventually hit them, and today the multipactor effect is generally considered a problem to be avoided.\nWhat particularly interested Farnsworth about the device was its ability to focus electrons at a particular point. One of the biggest problems in fusion research is to keep the hot fuel from hitting the walls of the container. If this is allowed to happen, the fuel cannot be kept hot enough for the fusion reaction to occur. Farnsworth reasoned that he could build an electrostatic plasma confinement system in which the \"wall\" fields of the reactor were electrons or ions being held in place by the \"multipactor\". Fuel could then be injected through the wall, and once inside it would be unable to escape. He called this concept a virtual electrode, and the system as a whole the \"fusor\".\nDesign.\nFarnsworth's original fusor designs were based on cylindrical arrangements of electrodes, like the original multipactors. Fuel was ionized and then fired from small accelerators through holes in the outer (physical) electrodes. Once through the hole they were accelerated towards the inner reaction area at high velocity. Electrostatic pressure from the positively charged electrodes would keep the fuel as a whole off the walls of the chamber, and impacts from new ions would keep the hottest plasma in the center. He referred to this as inertial electrostatic confinement, a term that continues to be used to this day. The voltage between the electrodes needs to be at least 25 kV for fusion to occur.\nWork at Farnsworth Television labs.\nAll of this work had taken place at the Farnsworth Television labs, which had been purchased in 1949 by ITT Corporation, as part of its plan to become the next RCA, and had been spearheaded by Farnsworth. However, a fusion research project was not regarded as immediately profitable. In 1965, the board of directors started asking Harold Geneen to sell off the Farnsworth division, but he had his 1966 budget approved with funding until the middle of 1967. Further funding was refused, and Farnsworth became ill and entered medical retirement, which ended ITT's experiments with fusion.\nThings changed dramatically with the arrival of Robert Hirsch, and the introduction of the modified Hirsch\u2013Meeks fusor patent. New fusors based on Hirsch's design were first constructed between 1964 and 1967. Hirsch published his design in a paper in 1967. His design included ion beams to shoot ions into the vacuum chamber.\nThe team then turned to the AEC, then in charge of fusion research funding, and provided them with a demonstration device mounted on a serving cart that produced more fusion than any existing \"classical\" device. The observers were startled, but the timing was bad; Hirsch himself had recently revealed the great progress being made by the Soviets using the tokamak. In response to this surprising development, the AEC decided to concentrate funding on large tokamak projects, and reduce backing for alternative concepts.\nRecent developments.\nGeorge H. Miley at the University of Illinois reexamined the fusor and re-introduced it into the field. A low but steady interest in the fusor has persisted since. An important development was the successful commercial introduction of a fusor-based neutron generator. From 2006 until his death in 2007, Robert W. Bussard gave talks on a reactor similar in design to the fusor, now called the polywell, that he stated would be capable of useful power generation. Most recently, the fusor has gained popularity among amateurs, who choose them as home projects due to their relatively low space, money, and power requirements. An online community of \"fusioneers\", The Open Source Fusor Research Consortium, or Fusor.net, is dedicated to reporting developments in the world of fusors and aiding other amateurs in their projects. The site includes forums, articles and papers done on the fusor, including Farnsworth's original patent, as well as Hirsch's patent of his version of the invention.\nFusion in fusors.\nBasic fusion.\nNuclear fusion refers to reactions in which lighter nuclei are combined to become heavier nuclei. This process changes mass into energy which in turn may be captured to provide fusion power. Many types of atoms can be fused. The easiest to fuse are deuterium and tritium. For fusion to occur the ions must be at a temperature of at least 4\u00a0keV (kiloelectronvolts), or about 45\u00a0million kelvins. The second easiest reaction is fusing deuterium with itself. Because this gas is cheaper, it is the fuel commonly used by amateurs. The ease of doing a fusion reaction is measured by its cross section.\nNet power.\nAt such conditions, the atoms are ionized and make a plasma. The energy generated by fusion, inside a hot plasma cloud can be found with the following equation.\n formula_1\nwhere\n formula_2 is the fusion power density (energy per time per volume),\n \"n\" is the number density of species A or B (particles per volume),\n formula_3 is the product of the collision cross-section \"\u03c3\" (which depends on the relative velocity) and the relative velocity \"v\" of the two species, averaged over all the particle velocities in the system,\n formula_4 is the energy released by a single fusion reaction.\nThis equation shows that energy varies with the temperature, density, speed of collision, and fuel used. To reach net power, fusion reactions have to occur fast enough to make up for energy losses. Any power plant using fusion will hold in this hot cloud. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and leak out. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy leaves the cloud as light. Radiation increases as the temperature rises. To get net power from fusion it's necessary to overcome these losses. This leads to an equation for power output.\n formula_5\nwhere:\n \"\u03b7\" is the efficiency,\n formula_6 is the power of conduction losses as energy-laden mass leaves,\n formula_7 is the power of radiation losses as energy leaves as light,\n formula_8 is the net power from fusion.\nJohn Lawson used this equation to estimate some conditions for net power based on a Maxwellian cloud. This became the Lawson criterion. Fusors typically suffer from conduction losses due to the wire cage being in the path of the recirculating plasma.\nIn fusors.\nIn the original fusor design, several small particle accelerators, essentially TV tubes with the ends removed, inject ions at a relatively low voltage into a vacuum chamber. In the Hirsch version of the fusor, the ions are produced by ionizing a dilute gas in the chamber. In either version there are two concentric spherical electrodes, the inner one being charged negatively with respect to the outer one (to about 80 kV). Once the ions enter the region between the electrodes, they are accelerated towards the center.\nIn the fusor, the ions are accelerated to several keV by the electrodes, so heating as such is not necessary (as long as the ions fuse before losing their energy by any process). Whereas 45 megakelvins is a very high temperature by any standard, the corresponding voltage is only 4 kV, a level commonly found in such devices as neon signs and CRT televisions. To the extent that the ions remain at their initial energy, the energy can be tuned to take advantage of the peak of the reaction cross section or to avoid disadvantageous (for example neutron-producing) reactions that might occur at higher energies.\nVarious attempts have been made at increasing deuterium ionization rate, including heaters within \"ion-guns\", (similar to the \"electron gun\" which forms the basis for old-style television display tubes), as well as magnetron type devices, (which are the power sources for microwave ovens), which can enhance ion formation using high-voltage electromagnetic fields. Any method which increases ion density (within limits which preserve ion mean-free path), or ion energy, can be expected to enhance the fusion yield, typically measured in the number of neutrons produced per second.\nThe ease with which the ion energy can be increased appears to be particularly useful when \"high temperature\" fusion reactions are considered, such as proton-boron fusion, which has plentiful fuel, requires no radioactive tritium, and produces no neutrons in the primary reaction.\nCommon considerations.\nModes of operation.\nFusors have at least two modes of operation (possibly more): star mode and halo mode. Halo mode is characterized by a broad symmetric glow, with one or two electron beams exiting the structure. There is little fusion. The halo mode occurs in higher pressure tanks, and as the vacuum improves, the device transitions to star mode. Star mode appears as bright beams of light emanating from the device center.\nPower density.\nBecause the electric field made by the cages is negative, it cannot simultaneously trap both positively charged ions and negative electrons. Hence, there must be some regions of charge accumulation, which will result in an upper limit on the achievable density. This could place an upper limit on the machine's power density, which may keep it too low for power production.\nThermalization of the ion velocities.\nWhen they first fall into the center of the fusor, the ions will all have the same energy, but the velocity distribution will rapidly approach a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution. This would occur through simple Coulomb collisions in a matter of milliseconds, but beam-beam instabilities will occur orders of magnitude faster still. In comparison, any given ion will require a few minutes before undergoing a fusion reaction, so that the monoenergetic picture of the fusor, at least for power production, is not appropriate. One consequence of the thermalization is that some of the ions will gain enough energy to leave the potential well, taking their energy with them, without having undergone a fusion reaction.\nElectrodes.\nThere are a number of unsolved challenges with the electrodes in a fusor power system. To begin with, the electrodes cannot influence the potential within themselves, so it would seem at first glance that the fusion plasma would be in more or less direct contact with the inner electrode, resulting in contamination of the plasma and destruction of the electrode. However, the majority of the fusion tends to occur in microchannels formed in areas of minimum electric potential, seen as visible \"rays\" penetrating the core. These form because the forces within the region correspond to roughly stable \"orbits\". Approximately 40% of the high energy ions in a typical grid operating in star mode may be within these microchannels. Nonetheless, grid collisions remain the primary energy loss mechanism for Farnsworth\u2013Hirsch fusors. Complicating issues is the challenge in cooling the central electrode; any fusor producing enough power to run a power plant seems destined to also destroy its inner electrode. As one fundamental limitation, any method which produces a neutron flux that is captured to heat a working fluid will also bombard its electrodes with that flux, heating them as well.\nAttempts to resolve these problems include Bussard's Polywell system, D. C. Barnes' modified Penning trap approach, and the University of Illinois's fusor which retains grids but attempts to more tightly focus the ions into microchannels to attempt to avoid losses. While all three are Inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) devices, only the last is actually a \"fusor\".\nRadiation.\nCharged particles will radiate energy as light when they change velocity. This loss rate can be estimated for nonrelativistic particles using the Larmor formula. Inside a fusor there is a cloud of ions and electrons. These particles will accelerate or decelerate as they move about. These changes in speed make the cloud lose energy as light. The radiation from a fusor can (at least) be in the visible, ultraviolet and X-ray spectrum, depending on the type of fusor used. These changes in speed can be due to electrostatic interactions between particles (ion to ion, ion to electron, electron to electron). This is referred to bremsstrahlung radiation, and is common in fusors. Changes in speed can also be due to interactions between the particle and the electric field. Since there are no magnetic fields, fusors emit no cyclotron radiation at slow speeds, or synchrotron radiation at high speeds.\nIn \"Fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium\", Todd Rider argues that a quasineutral isotropic plasma will lose energy due to Bremsstrahlung at a rate prohibitive for any fuel other than D-T (or possibly D-D or D-He3). This paper is not applicable to IEC fusion, as a quasineutral plasma cannot be contained by an electric field, which is a fundamental part of IEC fusion. However, in an earlier paper, https://, Rider addresses the common IEC devices directly, including the fusor. In the case of the fusor the electrons are generally separated from the mass of the fuel isolated near the electrodes, which limits the loss rate. However, Rider demonstrates that practical fusors operate in a range of modes that either lead to significant electron mixing and losses, or alternately lower power densities. This appears to be a sort of catch-22 that limits the output of any fusor-like system.\nSafety.\nThere are several key safety considerations involved with the building and operation of a fusor. First, there is the high-voltage involved. Second, there are the x-ray and neutron emissions that are possible. Also there are the publicity / misinformation considerations with local and regulatory authorities. \nCommercial applications.\nNeutron source.\nThe fusor has been demonstrated as a viable neutron source. Typical fusors cannot reach fluxes as high as nuclear reactor or particle accelerator sources, but are sufficient for many uses. Importantly, the neutron generator easily sits on a benchtop, and can be turned off at the flick of a switch. A commercial fusor was developed as a non-core business within DaimlerChrysler Aerospace \u2013 Space Infrastructure, Bremen between 1996 and early 2001. After the project was effectively ended, the former project manager established a company which is called NSD-Fusion. To date, the highest neutron flux achieved by a fusor-like device has been 3 \u00d7 1011 neutrons per second with the deuterium-deuterium fusion reaction.\nMedical isotopes.\nCommercial startups have used the neutron fluxes generated by fusors to generate Mo-99, a precursor to Technetium-99m, an isotope used for medical care.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He commercially produced and sold a fully functioning television system\u2014complete with receiver and camera\u2014which he produced commercially through the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\nIn later life, Farnsworth invented a small nuclear fusion device, the Farnsworth Fusor, employing inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC). Like many fusion devices, it was not a practical device for generating nuclear power, although it provides a viable source of neutrons. The design of this device has been the inspiration for other fusion approaches, including the Polywell reactor concept. Farnsworth held 300 patents, mostly in radio and television.\nEarly life.\nFarnsworth was born August 19, 1906, the eldest of five children of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Latter-day Saint couple living in a small log cabin built by Lewis' father in Manderfield, near Beaver, Utah. His maternal grandfather, Jacob Bastian, was a Mormon immigrant from Denmark. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where his father supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find that his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator. He found a burned-out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants and rewound the armature; he converted his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. He developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with a distant relative, and he discovered a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of their new home. He won $25 in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nFarnsworth excelled in chemistry and physics at Rigby High School. He asked science teacher Justin Tolman for advice about an electronic television system that he was contemplating; he provided the teacher with sketches and diagrams covering several blackboards to show how it might be accomplished electronically, and Tolman encouraged him to develop his ideas.\nOne of the drawings that he did on a blackboard for his chemistry teacher was recalled and reproduced for a patent interference case between Farnsworth and RCA.\nIn 1923, the family moved to Provo, Utah, and Farnsworth attended Brigham Young High School that fall. His father died of pneumonia in January 1924 at age 58, and Farnsworth assumed responsibility for sustaining the family while finishing high school. After graduating BYHS in June 1924, he applied to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he earned the nation's second-highest score on academy recruiting tests. However, he was already thinking ahead to his television projects; he learned that the government would own his patents if he stayed in the military, so he obtained an honorable discharge within months of joining under a provision in which the eldest child in a fatherless family could be excused from military service to provide for his family. He returned to Provo and enrolled at Brigham Young University, but he was not allowed by the faculty to attend their advanced science classes based upon policy considerations. He attended anyway and made use of the university's research labs, and he earned a Junior Radio-Trician certification from the National Radio Institute, and full certification in 1925. While attending college, he met Provo High School student Elma \"Pem\" Gardner (1908\u20132006), whom he eventually married.\nFarnsworth worked while his sister Agnes took charge of the family home and the second-floor boarding house, with the help of a cousin living with the family. The Farnsworths later moved into half of a duplex, with family friends the Gardners moving into the other side when it became vacant. He developed a close friendship with Pem's brother Cliff Gardner, who shared his interest in electronics, and the two moved to Salt Lake City to start a radio repair business. The business failed, and Gardner returned to Provo.\nFarnsworth remained in Salt Lake City and became acquainted with Leslie Gorrell and George Everson, a pair of San Francisco philanthropists who were then conducting a Salt Lake City Community Chest fund-raising campaign. They agreed to fund his early television research with an initial $6,000 in backing, and set up a laboratory in Los Angeles for Farnsworth to carry out his experiments.\nFarnsworth married Pem on May 27, 1926, and the two traveled to Berkeley, California, in a Pullman coach. They rented a house at 2910 Derby Street, from which he applied for his first television patent, which was granted on August 26, 1930. By that time they had moved across the bay to San Francisco, where Farnsworth set up his new lab at 202 Green Street.\nCareer.\nA few months after arriving in California, Farnsworth was prepared to show his models and drawings to a patent attorney who was nationally recognized as an authority on electrophysics. Everson and Gorrell agreed that Farnsworth should apply for patents for his designs, a decision that proved crucial in later disputes with RCA. Most television systems in use at the time used image scanning devices (\"rasterizers\") employing rotating \"Nipkow disks\" comprising a spinning disk with holes arranged in spiral patterns such that they swept across an image in a succession of short arcs while focusing the light they captured on photosensitive elements, thus producing a varying electrical signal corresponding to the variations in light intensity. Farnsworth recognized the limitations of the mechanical systems, and that an all-electronic scanning system could produce a superior image for transmission to a receiving device.\nOn September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver in another room of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1984 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, \"There you are \u2013 electronic television!\" The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator, which meant the television system now had no mechanical parts. During the same year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a image of his wife Elma (\"Pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\nMany inventors had built electromechanical television systems before Farnsworth's seminal contribution, but Farnsworth designed and built the world's first working all-electronic television system, employing electronic scanning in both the pickup and display devices. He first demonstrated his system to the press on September 3, 1928, and to the public at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934.\nIn 1930, RCA recruited Vladimir K. Zworykin\u2014who had tried, unsuccessfully, to develop his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923\u2014to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory, and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects, and turned his attention to what became the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, \"Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [i.e., a video camera] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic [of discrete light elements], he didn't have storage. Therefore, [picture] definition was very low... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method.\" Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent number 2,087,683 for the Image Dissector (filed April 26, 1933) features the \"charge storage plate\" invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a \"low velocity\" method of electron scanning, also describes \"discrete particles\" whose \"potential\" is manipulated and \"saturated\" to varying degrees depending on their velocity. Farnsworth's patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a \"charge storage dissector\" and \"charge storage amplifier,\" respectively.\nIn 1931, David Sarnoff of RCA offered to buy Farnsworth's patents for $100,000, with the stipulation that he become an employee of RCA, but Farnsworth refused. In June of that year, Farnsworth joined the Philco company and moved to Philadelphia along with his wife and two children. RCA later filed an interference suit against Farnsworth, claiming Zworykin's 1923 patent had priority over Farnsworth's design, despite the fact it could present no evidence that Zworykin had actually produced a functioning transmitter tube before 1931. Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the U.S. Patent Office rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the image dissector to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years before Sarnoff finally agreed to pay Farnsworth royalties.\nIn 1932, while in England to raise money for his legal battles with RCA, Farnsworth met with John Logie Baird, a Scottish inventor who had given the world's first public demonstration of a working television system in London in 1926, using an electro-mechanical imaging system, and who was seeking to develop electronic television receivers. Baird demonstrated his mechanical system for Farnsworth.\nIn May 1933, Philco severed its relationship with Farnsworth because, said Everson, \"it [had] become apparent that Philo's aim at establishing a broad patent structure through research [was] not identical with the production program of Philco.\" In Everson's view the decision was mutual and amicable. Farnsworth set up shop at 127 East Mermaid Lane in Philadelphia, and in 1934 held the first public exhibition of his device at the Franklin Institute in that city.\nAfter sailing to Europe in 1934, Farnsworth secured an agreement with Goerz-Bosch-Fernseh in Germany. Some image dissector cameras were used to broadcast the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.\nFarnsworth returned to his laboratory, and by 1936 his company was regularly transmitting entertainment programs on an experimental basis. That same year, while working with University of Pennsylvania biologists, Farnsworth developed a process to sterilize milk using radio waves. He also invented a fog-penetrating beam for ships and airplanes.\nIn 1936, he attracted the attention of \"Collier's Weekly\", which described his work in glowing terms. \"One of those amazing facts of modern life that just don't seem possible\u2014namely, electrically scanned television that seems destined to reach your home next year, was largely given to the world by a nineteen-year-old boy from Utah\u00a0... Today, barely thirty years old he is setting the specialized world of science on its ears.\"\nIn 1938, Farnsworth established the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with E. A. Nicholas as president and himself as director of research. In September 1939, after a more than decade-long legal battle, RCA finally conceded to a multi-year licensing agreement concerning Farnsworth's 1927 patent for television totaling $1\u00a0million. RCA was then free, after showcasing electronic television at New York World's Fair on April 20, 1939, to sell electronic television cameras to the public.\nFarnsworth Television and Radio Corporation was purchased by International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) in 1951. During his time at ITT, Farnsworth worked in a basement laboratory known as \"the cave\" on Pontiac Street in Fort Wayne. From there, he introduced a number of breakthrough concepts, including a defense early warning signal, submarine detection devices, radar calibration equipment and an infrared telescope. \"Philo was a very deep person\u2014tough to engage in conversation, because he was always thinking about what he could do next\", said Art Resler, an ITT photographer who documented Farnsworth's work in pictures. One of Farnsworth's most significant contributions at ITT was the PPI Projector, an enhancement on the iconic \"circular sweep\" radar display, which allowed safe air traffic control from the ground. This system developed in the 1950s was the forerunner of today's air traffic control systems.\nIn addition to his electronics research, ITT management agreed to nominally fund Farnsworth's nuclear fusion research. He and staff members invented and refined a series of fusion reaction tubes called \"fusors\". For scientific reasons unknown to Farnsworth and his staff, the necessary reactions lasted no longer than thirty seconds. In December 1965, ITT came under pressure from its board of directors to terminate the expensive project and sell the Farnsworth subsidiary. It was only due to the urging of president Harold Geneen that the 1966 budget was accepted, extending ITT's fusion research for an additional year. The stress associated with this managerial ultimatum, however, caused Farnsworth to suffer a relapse. A year later he was terminated and eventually allowed medical retirement.\nIn 1967, Farnsworth and his family moved back to Utah to continue his fusion research at Brigham Young University, which presented him with an honorary doctorate. The university also offered him office space and an underground concrete bunker for the project. Realizing ITT would dismantle its fusion lab, Farnsworth invited staff members to accompany him to Salt Lake City, as team members in Philo T. Farnsworth Associates (PTFA). By late 1968, the associates began holding regular business meetings and PTFA was underway. They promptly secured a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and more possibilities were within reach\u2014but financing stalled for the $24,000 a month required for salaries and equipment rental.\nIn a 1996 videotaped interview by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, Farnsworth's wife recounted his change of heart about the value of television, after seeing Neil Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the Moon in real time on July 20, 1969, along with millions of others: \"We were watching it, and, when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, Phil turned to me and said, 'Pem, this has made it all worthwhile.' Before then, he wasn't too sure.\"\nBy Christmas 1970, PTFA had failed to secure the necessary financing, and the Farnsworths had sold all their own ITT stock and cashed in Philo's life insurance policy to maintain organizational stability. The underwriter had failed to provide the financial backing that was to have supported the organization during its critical first year. The banks called in all outstanding loans, repossession notices were placed on anything not previously sold, and the Internal Revenue Service put a lock on the laboratory door until delinquent taxes were paid. In January 1971, PTFA disbanded.\nFarnsworth began abusing alcohol in his later years.\nHe became seriously ill with pneumonia, and died on March 11, 1971 aged 64 at his home in Holladay, Utah. He was survived by his wife and their two sons.\nFarnsworth's wife Elma Gardner \"Pem\" Farnsworth fought for decades after his death to assure his place in history. Farnsworth always gave her equal credit for creating television, saying: \"my wife and I started this TV.\" She died on April 27, 2006, at age 98.\nIn 1999, \"Time\" magazine included Farnsworth in the \"\".\nInventions.\nElectronic television.\nFarnsworth worked out the principle of the image dissector in the summer of 1921, not long before his 15th birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as a series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field. In the course of a patent interference suit brought by the Radio Corporation of America in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922. Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost. Farnsworth received royalties from RCA, but he never became wealthy. The video camera tube that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin, and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as charge-coupled devices began to appear.\nFarnsworth also developed the \"image oscillite\", a cathode ray tube that displayed the images captured by the image dissector.\nFarnsworth called his device an image dissector because it converted individual elements of the image into electricity one at a time. He replaced the spinning disks with cesium, an element that emits electrons when exposed to light.\nIn 1984, Farnsworth was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\nFusor.\nThe Farnsworth fusor is an apparatus designed by Farnsworth to create nuclear fusion. Unlike most controlled fusion systems, which slowly heat a magnetically confined plasma, the fusor injects high-temperature ions directly into a reaction chamber, thereby avoiding a considerable amount of complexity.\nWhen the Farnsworth fusor was first introduced to the fusion research world in the late 1960s, the fusor was the first device that could clearly demonstrate it was producing fusion reactions at all. Hopes at the time were high that it could be quickly developed into a practical power source. However, as with other fusion experiments, development into a power source has proven difficult. Nevertheless, the fusor has since become a practical neutron source and is produced commercially for this role.\nOther inventions.\nAt the time he died, Farnsworth held 300 U.S. and foreign patents. His inventions contributed to the development of radar, infra-red night vision devices, the electron microscope, the baby incubator, the gastroscope, and the astronomical telescope.\nTV appearance.\nAlthough he was the man responsible for its technology, Farnsworth appeared only once on a television program. On July 3, 1957, he was a mystery guest (\"Doctor X\") on the CBS quiz show \"I've Got A Secret\". He fielded questions from the panel as they unsuccessfully tried to guess his secret (\"I invented electronic television.\"). For stumping the panel, he received $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes. Host Garry Moore then spent a few minutes discussing with Farnsworth his research on such projects as an early analog high-definition television system, flat-screen receivers, and fusion power. Farnsworth said, \"There had been attempts to devise a television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors\u2014all mechanical. My contribution was to take out the moving parts and make the thing entirely electronic, and that was the concept that I had when I was just a freshman in high school in the Spring of 1921 at age 14.\"\nA letter to the editor of the \"Idaho Falls Post Register\" disputed that Farnsworth had made only one television appearance. Roy Southwick claimed \"... I interviewed Mr. [Philo] Farnsworth back in 1953\u2014the first day KID-TV went on the air.\" KID-TV, which later became KIDK-TV, was then located near the Rigby area where Farnsworth grew up.\nFort Wayne sites.\nIn 2010, the former Farnsworth factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was razed, eliminating the \"cave,\" where many of Farnsworth's inventions were first created, and where its radio and television receivers and transmitters, television tubes, and radio-phonographs were mass-produced under the Farnsworth, Capehart, and Panamuse trade names. The facility was located at 3702 E. Pontiac St.\nAlso that year, additional Farnsworth factory artifacts were added to the Fort Wayne History Center's collection, including a radio-phonograph and three table-top radios from the 1940s, as well as advertising and product materials from the 1930s to the 1950s.\nFarnsworth's Fort Wayne residence from 1948 to 1967, then the former Philo T. Farnsworth Television Museum, stands at 734 E. State Blvd, on the southwest corner of E. State and St. Joseph Blvds. The residence is recognized by an Indiana state historical marker and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\nMarion, Indiana factory.\nIn addition to Fort Wayne, Farnsworth operated a factory in Marion, Indiana, that made shortwave radios used by American combat soldiers in World War II. Acquired by \nRCA after the war, the facility was located at 3301 S.

{"id": "42891", "revid": "1317019534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42891", "title": "Adjustable spanner", "text": "Wrench that can be adjusted to handle various sizes of fasteners\nAn adjustable spanner (UK), also called a shifting spanner or shifter (Australia and New Zealand) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada), is any of various styles of spanner (wrench) with a movable jaw, allowing it to be used with different sizes of fastener head (nut, bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner.\nForms and names.\nThere are many forms of adjustable spanners; many of them are screw-adjusted, whereas others use levers, and some early ones used wedges. The early taper-locking spanners needed a hammer to set the movable jaw to the size of the nut. The modern screw-adjusted spanner and lever types are easily and quickly adjusted. Some adjustable spanners automatically adjust to the size of the nut, using a motor and battery. Simpler models use a serrated edge to lock the movable jaw to size, while more sophisticated versions are digital types that use sheets or feelers to set the size.\nGeesin (2015) shows that wrenches with screw adjustment of various kinds were well known in the early 19th century and that one by William Barlow in 1808 was prescient. By the 1830s, many designs with a central screw and a lower jaw moved by a nut were well known. Geesin and others document that English engineers Richard Clyburn and Edwin Beard Budding presented some influential new designs in 1842 and 1843. The one by Clyburn had the form of thumbwheel screw with worm-on-rack arrangement that would later be the most famous via subsequent adaptations. Improvements followed. In 1885 Enoch Harris received US patent 326868 for his spanner that permitted both the jaw width and the angle of the handles to be adjusted and locked.\nOne of the most widely known forms of adjustable wrench in the 21st century is an improved version of the Clyburn type; it was developed in 1891\u20131892. The Swedish company Bahco attributes its invention to Johan Petter Johansson, who in 1892 received a Swedish patent for it. In Canada and the United States, this type is often known as a Crescent wrench owing to widespread genericization of the brand name of the company that held the original 1915 U.S. patent for this type (https://), the Crescent Tool Company. (The Crescent brand is now owned by the Apex Tool Group). As Geesin 2015 documents, the worm-on-rack type (regardless of which terminology is used to name it) was invented in Britain, and later popularized in Scandinavia via the Bahco/Johansson improvement, before its manufacture in the United States was patented. The Bahco/Johansson/Crescent category (regardless of which terminology is used to name it) became so dominant in the 20th century that in North America, the very term \"adjustable wrench\" usually elicits the meaning of this type in general usage today, unless another type is specified. In Australia it is sometimes referred to as a \"shifting spanner\" or its abbreviated form of \"shifter\".\nMonkey wrenches are another type of adjustable spanner with a long history; the origin of the name is not entirely clear, but Geesin reports that it originated in Britain with a fancied resemblance of the wrench's jaws to that of a monkey's face, and that the many convoluted folk etymologies that later developed were baseless. Before the Bahco/Johansson/Crescent type became widespread in the United States, during the industrial era of the 1860s to the 1910s, various monkey wrench types were the dominant form of adjustable wrench there.\nAnother popular type of adjustable spanner has a base and jaws that form four sides of a hexagon, and is therefore particularly suited for hexagonal nuts (\"hex nuts\") and hexagonal headed (\"hex head\") cap screws and bolts.\nIn some parts of Europe, adjustable spanners are often called a Bahco, owing to genericization of the name of the Bahco/Johansson type. In Denmark, this type of spanner is commonly referred to as a \"svenskn\u00f8gle\", which basically translates to Swedish key. The Swedes themselves call the key \"skiftnyckel\", which is translated into adjustable key (shifting key). In Australia, adjustable spanners are also referred to as \"shifters\". In Spain, this kind of spanner is commonly called \"llave inglesa\", which means literally English key. Remarking the difference with the pipe wrench, also adjustable, in Spain this one is called \"grifa\", and it does not have any accurate translation.\nDesign and use.\nThe fixed jaw can withstand bending stress far better than can the movable jaw, because the latter is supported only by the flat surfaces on either side of the guide slot, not the full thickness of the tool. The tool is therefore usually angled so that the movable jaw's area of contact is closer to the body of the tool, which means less bending stress. Still, one should avoid applying excessive force on tight bolts, since doing so can pry open the mounting of the movable jaw causing the wrench to no longer be able to be snugged to bolt heads, loosen too easily, or mar bolt heads. In some cases the jaws of the tool can break.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second largest city in Namibia and the largest coastal city in the country. The city covers an area of of land.\nThe bay is a haven for sea vessels due to its harbour, protected by the Pelican Point sand spit, which is the only natural deep-water harbour along the country's coast. Being rich in plankton and marine life, these waters also draw large numbers of southern right whales, attracting whalers and fishing vessels.\nA succession of colonists developed the location and resources of this strategic harbour settlement. The harbour's value about the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope had caught the attention of world powers since it was discovered by the outside world in 1485. The importance of the harbour, combined with its extreme isolation by land, explains the complicated political history of the town. For much of its history, Walvis Bay was governed as an exclave separate from the rest of the territory that today is Namibia.\nThe town is situated just north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the Kuiseb River delta and lies at the end of the TransNamib Railway to Windhoek, and on B2 road.\nWalvis Bay, with its large bay and dunes, is an important centre of tourism activity in Namibia. Attractions include the artificial Bird Island, centre of a guano collection industry, the Dune 7 dune, the salt works, the abundant birdlife, and a museum. Kuisebmund Stadium, home to two clubs in the Namibia Premier League, is also located in the city. The beach resort of Langstrand lies just a few kilometres north. The Walvis Bay Export Processing Zone is an important facet of the local economy.\nEtymology.\nThe Dutch referred to it as and the English as \"Whale Bay\". In its eventual formal incorporation, it was named \"Walfish Bay\", which was changed to \"Walvish Bay\", and ultimately to \"Walvis Bay\". It has also been referred to as \"Walwich Bay\" or \"Walwisch Bay\". The Herero people of the area called it .\nHistory.\nPortuguese navigator Diogo C\u00e3o reached Cape Cross, north of the bay, in 1485. There followed Bartolomeu Dias, who anchored his flagship \"S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o\" in what is now Walvis Bay on 8 December 1487, on his expedition to discover a sea route to the East via the Cape of Good Hope. He named the bay \"O Golfo de Santa Maria da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\". However, the Portuguese did not formally stake a claim to Walvis Bay.\nWalvis Bay was founded at the end of the 18th century as a stopover for sea travel between Cape Town and the Netherlands by the Dutch East India Company. No permanent (year-round) settlement was attempted and little commercial development occurred on the site until the late 19th century. In the meantime, the Cape Colony had become British, and during the Scramble for Africa, the British claimed Walvis Bay. They permitted the Cape Colony to complete the annexation of the territory in 1884, together with the Penguin Islands, following initial steps that had been taken in 1878. The land surrounding the territory was annexed by the German Empire as German South West Africa. \nIn 1910, Walvis Bay, as an exclave of the Cape Colony, became part of the newly formed Union of South Africa. A boundary dispute with Germany was settled in 1911, with Walvis Bay having a confirmed area of .\nThe exclave was overrun by the Germans during the South West Africa Campaign early in the First World War, but the Union Defence Force (UDF) of South Africa eventually ousted the Germans in 1915. Subsequently, Walvis Bay was quickly integrated into the new martial law regime in South West Africa.\nSouth Africa was later awarded control (a Class \"C\" mandate) over South West Africa by the League of Nations to administer the territory. Civilian rule was restored in South West Africa in 1921 and the administration of Walvis Bay was transferred to South West Africa under the South West Africa Affairs Act of 1922.\nDespite the territory never having been part of German South West Africa, the Act stated that: \"the port and settlement of Walvis Bay, which forms part of the Cape of Good Hope, shall for judicial and administrative purposes be regarded as if it were part of the mandated territory of South West Africa\". However, South Africa had also sought to annex South West Africa itself and had presented such a proposal to the League of Nations. Consequently, in 1949, the Act was amended to give representation in the Parliament of South Africa to whites in South West Africa.\nOn 14 December 1971, the Namibian general contract workers strike began in Walvis Bay, after starting the day before in Windhoek. The goal of the strike was the abolition of the contract labour system, to oppose apartheid, and promote Namibia's independence.\nIn 1977, following increasing international pressure to relinquish its control over South West Africa, South Africa repealed the Act, but transferred control of Walvis Bay back to the Cape Province, thereby making it an exclave. From 1980, it was represented in both the Provincial Council and the House of Assembly as part of the Green Point constituency in Cape Town, before becoming a separate constituency in 1982.\nIn response, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 432 (1978), which declared that \"the territorial integrity and unity of Namibia must be assured through the reintegration of Walvis Bay within its territory\".\nIn 1990, South West Africa gained independence as Namibia, but Walvis Bay remained under South African sovereignty, with South Africa increasing the number of troops. However, in 1992, the two countries agreed to establish a transitional Joint Administrative Authority for Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands. The Authority was headed by two Chief Executive Officers, Nangolo Mbumba, then Secretary to the Namibian Cabinet, and Carl von Hirschberg, former South African Ambassador to the United Nations.\nIn August 1993, prior to the end of apartheid, the Multiparty Negotiating Forum in South Africa passed a resolution calling for \"the incorporation-reintegration of Walvis Bay and the Off-Shore Islands into Namibia.\"\nThe Transfer of Walvis Bay to Namibia Act was passed by the Parliament of South Africa that year. Following the signing of a treaty between the two countries, South Africa formally transferred sovereignty of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands to Namibia on 1 March 1994.\nGeography.\nSuburbs.\nDue to its South African administration, Walvis Bay was developed as a segregated town. The suburb of Kuisebmond, located 3.2 kilometres (1.8\u00a0mi) northeast of Walvis Bay city centre, housed Black people; Narraville, located 3.3 kilometres (2\u00a0mi) east northeast of Walvis Bay city centre, was inhabited by Coloureds; and Whites lived in the city centre.\nAfter the incorporation of the town into Namibia, many people have settled in shacks around it. In an effort to reduce the impact of the informal settlements, the municipality formed the Tutaleni Housing Project to the northeast.\nClimate.\nDespite its location within the tropics, Walvis Bay features the very rare mild variation of the cold desert climate (\"BWk\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. It is caused by the rain shadow of the Naukluft Mountains and the cooling effect of the coastal sea temperature by the Benguela Current. Walvis Bay receives only average precipitation per year, making it one of the driest cities on Earth. Despite its dry climate, the city is relatively humid. Average relative humidity throughout the year remains above 80%. The warmest month is February with an average temperature , while the coolest months are August and September with average temperature . The diurnal temperature range is also low, averaging only .\nA weather station operated on the Pelican Point headland from 1958 to 1984. Unusually, the highest temperatures are not recorded during the summer; autumn, spring, and even winter have all seen higher temperatures than the hottest days in summer. These record highs occur when offshore winds blow downwards from the high plateau inland and are nonetheless mild by comparison to many other cities in the tropics at the same latitude. Higher temperatures have been recorded, even just slightly inland, such as a report of at the airport on 15 April 2016.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;As of the 2023 census, Walvis Bay has a population of 102,704, with significant growth from 62,096 in 2011 and 43,611 in 2001. This expansion is largely attributed to internal migration, particularly from Namibia's northern regions, driven by employment opportunities in the port and fishing industries.\nThe city is characterized by its diverse population, encompassing various ethnic groups such as the Aakwanyama, Aandonga, Ovaherero, Damara, Nama, and others. Languages commonly spoken include English, Afrikaans, German, Oshiwambo, and Damara.\nWalvis Bay's urban landscape includes suburbs like Kuisebmond, historically designated for Black residents during apartheid, and Narraville, which was inhabited by Coloureds. Post-independence, the city has experienced rapid urbanization, leading to the development of informal settlements. To address housing challenges, the municipality initiated the Tutaleni Housing Project, providing affordable housing with basic amenities.\nEconomy.\nTourism.\nTourism has had an increasing influence in the town's economy, with international tourists arriving at its airport and port facilities. Several cruise liners visit the port each year. With many tourism activities hosted by small and large tour operators the town has turned into a tourism destination.\nFishing.\nIn Walvis Bay there are a variety of fishing companies like Hangana Seafood, Caroline Fishing, Benguella Fishing Company, Cadilu Fishing, Etosha Fisheries, Kuiseb Fishing Enterprises, Blue Ocean Products, Benguella Sea Products, Consortium Fisheries, Talanam Fish Processor. These companies catch diverse types of fish, like snoek, horse mackerel, anchovy, white steenbras, kabeljou, kingklip, hake, catfish, tuna, and sardines. Hangana Seafood are processors and exporters of fish and fish products. As such, the fishing enterprise accounts for a major part of Walvis Bay's economy.\nIn May 2018, a spokesman for the National Fishing Corporation of Namibia (Fishcor), confirmed that a new N$530 million onshore processing plant would be operational by September 2018. After completion, the factory (which plans to employ 700 people of which 70% will be female), promises to be the largest pelagic processing plant in sub-Saharan Africa and will process about 80 000 tonnes of fish per annum.\nManufacturing.\nIn March 2018, the Namibian government in association with French Groupe PSA signed an investment agreement to initiate a joint-venture to assemble Opel and Peugeot vehicles in Walvis Bay. The N$190m-project has been earmarked to commence in 2018 with a forecasted annual target volume of 5000 units by 2020, a target carried by SACU countries' market demand. However, Peugeot threatened to close the plant over disputes with South Africa over import tariffs.\n\"Walvis Bay Salt\" produces approximately 1 million tons of salt per year through solar evaporation of sea water. Most of the salt is for industrial use but the company also produces table salt under the \"Cerebos\" brand.\nTransport.\nWalvis Bay is an important logistical port for the southern African region, providing port facilities for the import and export of cargo for the rest of Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Botswana. Since the Walvis Bay Corridor Group (WBCG) was established in 2000, cargo moving through the port has increased from 30,000 containers a year to 370,000 containers in 2016. As of 2017 the port was being upgraded to increase its capacity to move 1 million containers a year by 2019. Bureaucratic and logistical problems at the city's competitor port at Durban, South Africa have diverted traffic to the port at Walvis Bay. Ninety-five percent of all cargo hauled overland through Walvis Bay is carried by truck.\nThe Walvis Bay Corridor Group is gearing up to increase import/export-business opportunities in Namibia. The Namibian National Development Plan expects to complete the expansion programme of the Walvis Bay port by 2019. Because of the harbour's geographical positioning, authorities plan to gain a footprint in providing landlocked Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries with a vital logistical hub. In addition to the importance of the port, development would strengthen trade corridors which consists of current road and rail networks.\nIn an attempt to strengthen and enhance trade relations between other African countries, Namport (the Namibian Port Authority) in April 2019 signed a five-year MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with the Port Authority of Dakar, Senegal.\nWalvis Bay International Airport provides commercial flight services to the city's residents, as well as to neighbouring towns and villages. Airlink services flights between South Africa and Walvis Bay.\nIn August 2019, a new container terminal was opened, built on a 40-acre platform reclaimed from the sea. The terminal was built by the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company with funds from the Namibian government and the African Development Bank, costing N$4.2b.\nThis increases the capacity of the port to 750,000 containers per year from 350,000. The terminal also includes a dedicated cruise liner berth.\nEducation.\nWalvis Bay has a number of public (government-run), semi-public, and private schools. Among them are Duneside High School, Duinesig Primary School, International School of Walvis Bay, The Dolphin Schools, Alexanders Private School, Kuisebmond Secondary School, Walvis Bay Private School and others. A number of kindergartens cater to young children.\nThe Namibian Maritime and Fisheries Institute (NAMFI) is a tertiary education institution based in town. International University of Management (IUM), Welwitchia Health Training Center and Monitronics Success College both have branches in Walvis Bay.\nPolitics.\nWalvis Bay is governed by a municipal council that has ten seats.\nElection results.\nThe 2015 local authority election was won by the SWAPO party which gained eight seats (5,818 votes). One seat each was won by the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 565 votes) and the United Democratic Front (UDF, 433 votes).\nThe 2020 local authority election was won by the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020. The IPC obtained 5,043 votes and gained four seats. SWAPO was the runner-up, obtaining 3,348 votes and gaining three seats. One seat each went to the Landless People's Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018, 1,207 votes), the local Joint Walvis Bay Residents Association with 945 votes, and the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA) with 658 votes.\nOn 28 November 2024, Trevino Forbes of IPC was re-elected as the mayor of Walvis Bay at a special council meeting.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nWalvis Bay is twinned with:\nCulture.\nSports.\nWalvis Bay contains open spaces, scenic beauty and unique marine and plant life. It is well suited for the outdoor lifestyle, boasting sports such as sandboarding, kiting, surfing, swimming, angling, sailing, golf and other indoor and outdoor sport codes. There is Walvis Bay Lagoon and Aquatic Activities, Kuiseb River Delta and the beach itself where people enjoy swimming and catching fish.\nThe sand spit allows the adjacent water to remain smooth in very strong winds, ideal for record attempting vessels like that by the \"Vestas Sailrocket\". The ocean side of the sand spit has a world-famous surf spot known in the international surf media as \"Skeleton Bay.\"\nThe city is home to Eleven Arrows F.C. and Blue Waters F.C., football clubs that compete in the Namibia Premier Football League, and the Sparta Cricket Club Ground.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (Lutheran World Federation), Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Namibia (Lutheran World Federation), Baptist Convention of Namibia (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Catholic Church. In addition to that there are also Anglican Churches namely St Raphael Anglican Church in Mondesa, St Mathews Anglican Church close to Namport as well as Seafarers Mission at Namport. There is also a Muslim mosque.\nFilm.\nThe Namibian film Walvis Tale is set in Walvis Bay. The documentary explores the bond between the people of Walvis Bay and the sea that supports their way of life, all the while addressing broader themes of identity, sustainability and heritage.\nConservation.\nWalvis Bay is the home of non-profit environmental organization, Ocean Conservation Namibia (OCN). In September 2024, OCN held a Walvis Bay community cleanup, an initiative aimed at addressing the growing issue of marine pollution and protecting local wildlife.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

For liquids with viscosities which vary with flow conditions, an instrument called a rheometer is used. Thus, a rheometer can be considered as a special type of viscometer. Viscometers can measure only constant viscosity, that is, viscosity that does not change with flow conditions.\nIn general, either the fluid remains stationary and an object moves through it, or the object is stationary and the fluid moves past it. The drag caused by relative motion of the fluid and a surface is a measure of the viscosity. The flow conditions must have a sufficiently small value of Reynolds number for there to be laminar flow.\nAt 20\u00b0C, the dynamic viscosity (kinematic viscosity \u00d7 density) of water is 1.0038mPa\u00b7s and its kinematic viscosity (product of flow time \u00d7 factor) is 1.0022mm2/s. These values are used for calibrating certain types of viscometers.\nStandard laboratory viscometers for liquids.\nU-tube viscometers.\nThese devices are also known as glass capillary viscometers or Ostwald viscometers, named after Wilhelm Ostwald. Another version is the Ubbelohde viscometer, which consists of a U-shaped glass tube held vertically in a controlled temperature bath. In one arm of the U is a vertical section of precise narrow bore (the capillary). Above there is a bulb, with it is another bulb lower down on the other arm. In use, liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction, then allowed to flow down through the capillary into the lower bulb. Two marks (one above and one below the upper bulb) indicate a known volume. The time taken for the level of the liquid to pass between these marks is proportional to the kinematic viscosity. The calibration can be done using a fluid of known properties. Most commercial units are provided with a conversion factor.\nThe time required for the test liquid to flow through a capillary of a known diameter of a certain factor between two marked points is measured. By multiplying the time taken by the factor of the viscometer, the kinematic viscosity is obtained.\nSuch viscometers can be classified as direct-flow or reverse-flow. Reverse-flow viscometers have the reservoir above the markings, and direct-flow are those with the reservoir below the markings. Such classifications exist so that the level can be determined even when opaque or staining liquids are measured, otherwise the liquid will cover the markings and make it impossible to gauge the time the level passes the mark. This also allows the viscometer to have more than 1 set of marks to allow , therefore yielding 2 timings and allowing subsequent calculation of determinability to ensure accurate results. The use of two timings in one viscometer in a single run is only possible if the sample being measured has Newtonian properties. Otherwise the change in driving head, which in turn changes the shear rate, will produce a different viscosity for the two bulbs.\nFalling-sphere viscometers.\nStokes' law is the basis of the falling-sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameter are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerol as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. It includes many different oils and polymer liquids .\nIn 1851, George Gabriel Stokes derived an expression for the frictional force (also called drag force) exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers (e.g., very small particles) in a continuous viscous fluid by changing the small fluid-mass limit of the generally unsolvable Navier\u2013Stokes equations:\n formula_1\nwhere\n \"formula_2\" is the frictional force,\n \"formula_3\" is the radius of the spherical object,\n \"formula_4\" is the fluid viscosity,\n \"formula_5\" is the particle velocity.\nIf the particles are falling in the viscous fluid by their own weight, then a terminal velocity, also known as the settling velocity, is reached when this frictional force combined with the buoyant force exactly balance the gravitational force. The resulting settling velocity (or terminal velocity) is given by\n formula_6\nwhere:\n \"V\"s is the particle settling velocity (m/s), vertically downwards if \"\u03c1\"p &gt; \"\u03c1\"f, upwards if \"\u03c1\"p &lt; \"\u03c1\"f,\n r is the Stokes radius of the particle (m),\n g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2),\n \"\u03c1\"p is the density of the particles (kg/m3),\n \"\u03c1\"f is the density of the fluid (kg/m3),\n \u03bc is the (dynamic) fluid viscosity (Pa\u00b7s).\nNote that Stokes flow is assumed, so the Reynolds number must be small.\nA limiting factor on the validity of this result is the roughness of the sphere being used.\nA modification of the straight falling-sphere viscometer is a rolling-ball viscometer, which times a ball rolling down a slope whilst immersed in the test fluid. This can be further improved by using a patented V plate, which increases the number of rotations to distance traveled, allowing smaller, more portable devices. The controlled rolling motion of the ball avoids turbulences in the fluid, which would otherwise occur with a falling ball. This type of device is also suitable for ship board use.\nFalling-piston viscometer.\nAlso known as the Norcross viscometer after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device is based on a piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an air lifting mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain thixotropic liquids. The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The viscosity controller measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as efflux cup), Saybolt universal second (SUS) or centipoise.\nIndustrial use is popular due to simplicity, repeatability, low maintenance and longevity. This type of measurement is not affected by flow rate or external vibrations. The principle of operation can be adapted for many different conditions, making it ideal for process control environments.\nOscillating-piston viscometer.\nSometimes referred to as electromagnetic viscometer or EMV viscometer, was invented at http:// in 1986. The sensor (see figure below) comprises a measurement chamber and magnetically influenced piston. Measurements are taken whereby a sample is first introduced into the thermally controlled measurement chamber where the piston resides. Electronics drive the piston into oscillatory motion within the measurement chamber with a controlled magnetic field. A shear stress is imposed on the liquid (or gas) due to the piston travel, and the viscosity is determined by measuring the travel time of the piston. The construction parameters for the annular spacing between the piston and measurement chamber, the strength of the electromagnetic field, and the travel distance of the piston are used to calculate the viscosity according to Newton's law of viscosity.\nThe oscillating-piston viscometer technology has been adapted for small-sample viscosity and micro-sample viscosity testing in laboratory applications. It has also been adapted to high-pressure viscosity and high-temperature viscosity measurements in both laboratory and process environments. The viscosity sensors have been scaled for a wide range of industrial applications, such as small-size viscometers for use in compressors and engines, flow-through viscometers for dip coating processes, in-line viscometers for use in refineries, and hundreds of other applications. Improvements in sensitivity from modern electronics, is stimulating a growth in oscillating-piston viscometer popularity with academic laboratories exploring gas viscosity.\nVibrational viscometers.\nVibrational viscometers date back to the 1950s Bendix instrument, which is of a class that operates by measuring the damping of an oscillating electromechanical resonator immersed in a fluid whose viscosity is to be determined. The resonator generally oscillates in torsion or transversely (as a cantilever beam or tuning fork). The higher the viscosity, the larger the damping imposed on the resonator. The resonator's damping may be measured by one of several methods:\nThe vibrational instrument also suffers from a lack of a defined shear field, which makes it unsuited to measuring the viscosity of a fluid whose flow behaviour is not known beforehand.\nVibrating viscometers are rugged industrial systems used to measure viscosity in the process condition. The active part of the sensor is a vibrating rod. The vibration amplitude varies according to the viscosity of the fluid in which the rod is immersed. These viscosity meters are suitable for measuring clogging fluid and high-viscosity fluids, including those with fibers (up to 1000\u00a0Pa\u00b7s). Currently, many industries around the world consider these viscometers to be the most efficient system with which to measure the viscosities of a wide range of fluids; by contrast, rotational viscometers require more maintenance, are unable to measure clogging fluid, and require frequent calibration after intensive use. Vibrating viscometers have no moving parts, no weak parts and the sensitive part is typically small. Even very basic or acidic fluids can be measured by adding a protective coating, such as enamel, or by changing the material of the sensor to a material such as 316L stainless steel. Vibrating viscometers are the most widely used inline instrument to monitor the viscosity of the process fluid in tanks, and pipes.\nQuartz viscometer.\nThe quartz viscometer is a special type of vibrational viscometer. Here, an oscillating quartz crystal is immersed into a fluid and the specific influence on the oscillating behavior defines the viscosity. The principle of quartz viscosimetry is based on the idea of W.\u00a0P. Mason. The basic concept is the application of a piezoelectric crystal for the determination of viscosity. The high-frequency electric field that is applied to the oscillator causes a movement of the sensor and results in the shearing of the fluid. The movement of the sensor is then influenced by the external forces (the shear stress) of the fluid, which affects the electrical response of the sensor. The calibration procedure as a pre-condition of viscosity determination by means of a quartz crystal goes back to B. Bode, who facilitated the detailed analysis of the electrical and mechanical transmission behavior of the oscillating system. On the basis of this calibration, the quartz viscosimeter was developed which allows continuous viscosity determination in resting and flowing liquids.\nQuartz crystal microbalance.\nThe quartz crystal microbalance functions as a vibrational viscometer by the piezoelectric properties inherent in quartz to perform measurements of conductance spectra of liquids and thin films exposed to the surface of the crystal. From these spectra, frequency shifts and a broadening of the peaks for the resonant and overtone frequencies of the quartz crystal are tracked and used to determine changes in mass as well as the viscosity, shear modulus, and other viscoelastic properties of the liquid or thin film. One benefit of using the quartz crystal microbalance to measure viscosity is the small amount of sample required for obtaining an accurate measurement. However, due to the dependence viscoelastic properties on the sample preparation techniques and thickness of the film or bulk liquid, there can be errors up to 10% in measurements in viscosity between samples.\nAn interesting technique to measure the viscosity of a liquid using a quartz crystal microbalance which improves the consistency of measurements uses a drop method. Instead of creating a thin film or submerging the quartz crystal in a liquid, a single drop of the fluid of interest is dropped on the surface of the crystal. The viscosity is extracted from the shift in the frequency data using the following equation\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 is the resonant frequency, formula_9\u00a0is the density of the fluid, formula_10\u00a0is the shear modulus of the quartz, and formula_11\u00a0is the density of the quartz. An extension of this technique corrects the shift in the resonant frequency by the size of the drop deposited on the quartz crystal.\nRotational viscometers.\nRotational viscometers use the idea that the torque required to rotate an object in a fluid is a function of the viscosity of that fluid. They measure the torque required to rotate a disk or bob in a fluid at a known speed.\n\"Cup and bob\" viscometers work by defining the exact volume of a sample to be sheared within a test cell; the torque required to achieve a certain rotational speed is measured and plotted. There are two classical geometries in \"cup and bob\" viscometers, known as either the \"Couette\" or \"Searle\" systems, distinguished by whether the cup or bob rotates. The rotating cup is preferred in some cases because it reduces the onset of Taylor vortices at very high shear rates, but the rotating bob is more commonly used, as the instrument design can be more flexible for other geometries as well.\n\"Cone and plate\" viscometers use a narrow-angled cone in close proximity to a flat plate. With this system, the shear rate between the geometries is constant at any given rotational speed. The viscosity can easily be calculated from shear stress (from the torque) and shear rate (from the angular velocity).\nIf a test with any geometries runs through a table of several shear rates or stresses, the data can be used to plot a flow curve, that is a graph of viscosity vs shear rate. If the above test is carried out slowly enough for the measured value (shear stress if rate is being controlled, or conversely) to reach a steady value at each step, the data is said to be at \"equilibrium\", and the graph is then an \"equilibrium flow curve\". This is preferable over non-equilibrium measurements, as the data can usually be replicated across multiple other instruments or with other geometries.\nCalculation of shear rate and shear stress form factors.\nRheometers and viscometers work with torque and angular velocity. Since viscosity is normally considered in terms of shear stress and shear rates, a method is needed to convert from \"instrument numbers\" to \"rheology numbers\". Each measuring system used in an instrument has its associated \"form factors\" to convert torque to shear stress and to convert angular velocity to shear rate.\nWe will call the shear stress form factor \"C\"1 and the shear rate factor \"C\"2.\n shear stress = torque \u00f7 \"C\"1.\n shear rate = \"C\"2 \u00d7 angular velocity.\n For some measuring systems such as parallel plates, the user can set the gap between the measuring systems. In this case the equation used is\n shear rate = \"C\"2 \u00d7 angular velocity / gap.\n viscosity = shear stress / shear rate.\nThe following sections show how the form factors are calculated for each measuring system.\n formula_12\nCone and plate.\nwhere\n r is the radius of the cone,\n \u03b8 is the cone angle in radians.\n formula_13\nParallel plates.\nwhere r is the radius of the plate.\nNote: The shear stress varies across the radius for a parallel plate. The above formula refers to the 3/4 radius position if the test sample is Newtonian.\n formula_14\nCoaxial cylinders.\nwhere:\n \"r\"a \n (\"r\"i + \"r\"o)/2 is the average radius,\n \"r\"i is the inner radius,\n \"r\"o is the outer radius,\n H is the height of cylinder.\nNote: \"C\"1 takes the shear stress as that occurring at an average radius \"r\"a.\nElectromagnetically spinning-sphere viscometer (EMS viscometer).\nThe EMS viscometer measures the viscosity of liquids through observation of the rotation of a sphere driven by electromagnetic interaction: Two magnets attached to a rotor create a rotating magnetic field. The sample \u2462 to be measured is in a small test tube \u2461. Inside the tube is an aluminium sphere \u2463. The tube is located in a temperature-controlled chamber \u2460 and set such that the sphere is situated in the centre of the two magnets.\nThe rotating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the sphere. The resulting Lorentz interaction between the magnetic field and these eddy currents generate torque that rotates the sphere. The rotational speed of the sphere depends on the rotational velocity of the magnetic field, the magnitude of the magnetic field and the viscosity of the sample around the sphere. The motion of the sphere is monitored by a video camera \u2464 located below the cell. The torque applied to the sphere is proportional to the difference in the angular velocity of the magnetic field \"\u03a9\"B and that of the sphere \"\u03a9\"S. There is thus a linear relationship between (\"\u03a9\"B \u2212 \"\u03a9\"S)/\"\u03a9\"S and the viscosity of the liquid.\nThis new measuring principle was developed by Sakai et al. at the University of Tokyo. The EMS viscometer distinguishes itself from other rotational viscometers by three main characteristics: \nStabinger viscometer.\nBy modifying the classic Couette-type rotational viscometer, it is possible to combine the accuracy of kinematic viscosity determination with a wide measuring range.\nThe outer cylinder of the Stabinger viscometer is a sample-filled tube that rotates at constant speed in a temperature-controlled copper housing. The hollow internal cylinder \u2013 shaped as a conical rotor \u2013 is centered within the sample by hydrodynamic lubrication effects and centrifugal forces. In this way all bearing friction, an inevitable factor in most rotational devices, is fully avoided. The rotating fluid's shear forces drive the rotor, while a magnet inside the rotor forms an eddy current brake with the surrounding copper housing. An equilibrium rotor speed is established between driving and retarding forces, which is an unambiguous measure of the dynamic viscosity. The speed and torque measurement is implemented without direct contact by a Hall-effect sensor counting the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. This allows a highly precise torque resolution of 50\u00a0pN\u00b7m and a wide measuring range from 0.2 to 30,000\u00a0mPa\u00b7s with a single measuring system. A built-in density measurement based on the oscillating U-tube principle allows the determination of kinematic viscosity from the measured dynamic viscosity employing the relation\n formula_15\nwhere:\n \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity (mm2/s),\n \u03b7 is the dynamic viscosity (mPa\u00b7s),\n \u03c1 is the density (g/cm3).\nBubble viscometer.\nBubble viscometers are used to quickly determine kinematic viscosity of known liquids such as resins and varnishes. The time required for an air bubble to rise is directly proportional to the viscosity of the liquid, so the faster the bubble rises, the lower the viscosity. The alphabetical-comparison method uses 4 sets of lettered reference tubes, A5 through Z10, of known viscosity to cover a viscosity range from 0.005 to 1,000 stokes. The direct-time method uses a single 3-line times tube for determining the \"bubble seconds\", which may then be converted to stokes.\nThis method is considerably accurate, but the measurements can vary due to variances in buoyancy because of the changing in shape of the bubble in the tube. However, this does not cause any sort of serious miscalculation.\nRectangular-slit viscometer.\nThe basic design of a rectangular-slit viscometer/rheometer consists of a rectangular-slit channel with uniform cross-sectional area. A test liquid is pumped at a constant flow rate through this channel. Multiple pressure sensors flush-mounted at linear distances along the stream-wise direction measure pressure drop as depicted in the figure:\nMeasuring principle: The slit viscometer/rheometer is based on the fundamental principle that a viscous liquid resists flow, exhibiting a decreasing pressure along the length of the slit. The pressure decrease or drop (\u2206\"P\") is correlated with the shear stress at the wall boundary. The apparent shear rate is directly related to the flow rate and the dimension of the slit. The apparent shear rate, the shear stress, and the apparent viscosity are calculated:\n formula_16\nwhere\n formula_17 is the apparent shear rate (s\u22121),\n \u03c3 is the shear stress (Pa),\n \"\u03b7\"a is the apparent viscosity (Pa\u00b7s),\n \u2206\"P\" is the pressure difference between the leading pressure sensor and the last pressure sensor (Pa),\n Q is the flow rate (ml/s),\n w is the width of the flow channel (mm),\n h is the depth of the flow channel (mm),\n l is the distance between the leading pressure sensor and the last pressure sensor (mm).\nTo determine the viscosity of a liquid, the liquid sample is pumped through the slit channel at a constant flow rate, and the pressure drop is measured. Following these equations, the apparent viscosity is calculated for the apparent shear rate. For a Newtonian liquid, the apparent viscosity is the same as the true viscosity, and the single shear-rate measurement is sufficient. For non-Newtonian liquids, the apparent viscosity is not true viscosity. In order to obtain true viscosity, the apparent viscosities are measured at multiple apparent shear rates. Then true viscosities \u03b7 at various shear rates are calculated using Weissenberg\u2013Rabinowitsch\u2013Mooney correction factor:\n formula_18\nThe calculated true viscosity is the same as the cone and plate values at the same shear rate.\nA modified version of the rectangular-slit viscometer/rheometer can also be used to determine apparent extensional viscosity.\nKrebs viscometer.\nThe Krebs viscometer uses a digital graph and a small sidearm spindle to measure the viscosity of a fluid. It is mostly used in the paint industry.\nMiscellaneous viscometer types.\nOther viscometer types use balls or other objects. Viscometers that can characterize non-Newtonian fluids are usually called \"rheometers\" or \"plastometers\". Some instruments like capillary or VROC\u00ae viscometers can measure both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.\nIn the I.C.I \"Oscar\" viscometer, a sealed can of fluid was oscillated torsionally, and by clever measurement techniques it was possible to measure both viscosity and elasticity in the sample.\nThe Marsh funnel viscometer measures viscosity from the time (\"efflux time\") it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from the base of a cone through a short tube. This is similar in principle to the flow cups (efflux cups) like the Ford, Zahn and Shell cups which use different shapes to the cone and various nozzle sizes. The measurements can be done according to ISO 2431, ASTM D1200 - 10 or DIN 53411. \nThe https:// improves the accuracy of measurements for the lower-viscosity liquids utilizing the subtle changes in the flow field due to the flexibility of the moving or stationary blade (sometimes called wing or single-side-clamped cantilever).\nA rotating disk viscometer is the standard viscometer for measuring material viscosity and scorch time for rubber before vulcanization.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He oversaw significant reforms to the communist system during a period that became known as the Prague Spring, but his reforms were reversed and he was eventually sidelined following the Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968.\nBest known by the slogan, \"Socialism with a human face\", Dub\u010dek led a process that accelerated cultural and economic liberalization in Czechoslovakia. Reforms were opposed by conservatives inside the party who benefited from the Stalinist economy, as well as interests in the neighbouring Soviet-bloc who feared contagion, western subversion, strategic vulnerability, and loss of institutional power. For reasons of institutional interests in the Soviet Union such as those of the military and KGB, false reports, and the growing concern among the Soviet leadership that Dub\u010dek was no longer able to maintain control of the country, Czechoslovakia was invaded by half a million Soviet-led Warsaw Pact troops on the night of 20\u201321 August 1968. This was intended to enable a coup by conservative forces. That coup, however, could not materialize due to lack of a viable pro-Soviet replacement leadership and the unexpected extraordinary popularity of Dub\u010dek and the reformist leadership. Soviet intervention ushered in a period of maneuver between conservatives and reformers where conservatives relied on Soviet influence to shift the balance of power, reversing reforms of the Prague Spring.\nDub\u010dek was forced to resign as party head in April 1969, and was succeeded by Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k, a former reformer and victim of Stalinism who was ambiguously favored by Moscow. This signaled the end of the Prague Spring and the beginning of normalization. Dub\u010dek was expelled from the Communist Party in 1970, amid a purge that eventually expelled almost two-thirds of the 1968 party membership. This mostly purged the younger generation of post-Stalin communists that he represented along with many of the most competent technical experts and managers.\nDuring the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Dub\u010dek served as the Chairman of the federal Czechoslovak parliament and contended for the presidency with V\u00e1clav Havel. The European Parliament awarded Dub\u010dek the Sakharov Prize the same year. In the interim between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution, Dub\u010dek withdrew from high politics but served as a leading inspiration and symbolic leader for Eurocommunism, maintaining intermittent contact with European communist reformers, especially in Italy and the Soviet Union. Also in 1989, just before his death, Andrei Sakharov wrote, \"I am convinced that the 'breath of freedom' which the Czechs and the Slovaks enjoyed when Dub\u010dek was their leader was a prologue to the peaceful revolutions now taking place in eastern Europe and Czechoslovakia itself.\" Sakharov credited Dub\u010dek and the Prague Spring as his inspiration.\nAt the time of his death in an automobile crash in 1992, Dub\u010dek remained an important political figure. Many saw him as the destined future president of newly-formed Slovakia.\nEarly life.\nSince 1989, many historians and scholars have paraphrased Gennadi Gerasimov, a spokesman for Mikhail Gorbachev, when asked the difference between what Gorbachev and Dub\u010dek had done. He said it was 19 years. Many have questioned this since that time, better seeing nuance and particularities beyond cold war narratives. In fact, despite both future leaders profoundly questioning Stalinism at the time of Nikita Khrushchev 'secret speech' in 1956, Dub\u010dek had a family, upbringing, and early education very different from the conventional communist party training that many assume him to have, as well as fundamentally different education than both Gorbachev and Velvet Revolution leader V\u00e1clav Havel. As Ivan Laluha pointed out, his thinking was shaped by his upbringing by unconventional parents, and personal experience of, and longtime associations with, utopian and international experiments and members that emphasized a consensus-style of leadership.\nAlexander Dub\u010dek was born in Uhrovec, Slovakia (then part of Czechoslovakia), on 27 November 1921. When he was three years old, the family moved to the Soviet Union. He spent most of his childhood living on what some have called a commune in Kyrgyzstan. The settlement was in Pishpek (now Bishkek), in the Kirghiz SSR of the Soviet Union, now the independent state of Kyrgyzstan. It was a utopian Esperantist and Idist industrial cooperative, Interhelpo. Pavol Dub\u010dek, Alexander's son, described what his grandfather's family found as, \"there was nothing there but an old barracks\", after the family had come promised job opportunities and a good life. He said many of the first generation of immigrant children suffered typhus. Despite this, Pavol said it was \"impossible\" to go back at that time. In 1933 the family moved to the Central Russian city of Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod. Alexander was then 12.\nIn 1938, due to general orders by Stalin, they would have had to renounce their Czechoslovak citizenship in order to stay. With the same loyalty to their place of birth that Alexander would show for the rest of his life, the family returned to Czechoslovakia. At 17 years old, Alexander joined the then-illegal Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS), working to organize resistance at his workplace. It was here, as a factory worker in Dubnica nad V\u00e1hom, where he learned his first trade. He worked together with his brother, J\u00falius, and with his childhood friend, Anna Borsekova.\nThey fought against the wartime pro-German Slovak state headed by Jozef Tiso. In August 1944 Dub\u010dek and his brother were ordered to join the partisans. They were members of the Jan \u017di\u017eka partisan brigade during the Slovak National Uprising. His brother died in the uprising. The second and last time Alexander was wounded, he was sent to the Peterov family in Vel\u010dice to recover with Anna's help. Because of his participation in the uprising, this would be a bad mark against him during the Stalinist period, after authorities began amalgamating the activities of partisans in the uprisings with members of the wartime regime and other non-communist elements.\nDub\u010dek's father, \u0160tefan, had been a member of the party since 1921. Upon his return he became active in it once again. \u0160tefan was responsible for printing the party papers, forged and official documents, as well as producing other left-wing publications. During this time, the activities of Alexander and his family relied more on working through personal networks rather than party cells. The entire family was involved, shifting from one place to the next, eventually moving to Vel\u010dice. After the arrest of much of the KSS leadership in 1942, \u0160tefan and the Dub\u010deks worked with another former Interhelpo member, primarily organizing communist youth. Alexander was arrested himself in July, but not before having significant impact and authority. \u0160tefan was arrested, sent to prison and eventually to Mauthausen concentration camp, which he survived in part because he was there a short time.\nDub\u010dek married childhood friend, Anna Dub\u010dekov\u00e1 (n\u00e9e Borsekov\u00e1), in September, 1945. They started a home in Tren\u010d\u00edn.\nDub\u010dek began his studies at Comenius University in Bratislava, but he would return to the Soviet Union in 1955 to attend the University of Politics in Moscow, where he graduated in 1958 before he returned home. While in Moscow, Dub\u010dek's Russian friends learned of Khrushchev's 'secret speech' denouncing Stalin in 1956. It would be a couple of months before they would tell him about it. The speech had been an answer to stories circulating of those who had begun returning from false imprisonment in the gulag. As much as Dub\u010dek was disturbed by the news of what Stalin had done, he also admired Khrushchev for making the speech over the opposition of most of the leadership, who were themselves involved.\nEducation and early political career.\nIn 1948, the party he had joined was reorganized as the Slovak branch of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS\u010c). Though still outside of the higher circles, Dub\u010dek's generation represented the young idealistic rank-and-file of the party that took power in 1948, not a break from it. It was Stalinism that represented the discontinuity. It was this pre-Stalinist generation that originally seized power, allied with the younger generation of party members, who began to question the path taken by their leadership elders as they began to rise in the ranks during the 1950s and early 1960s.\nThe Slovak branch of the party emerged from the war with a smaller membership base and less connection with Slovak institutions than the Czech branches had. To recruit a mass party base for electoral politics, the party's leadership, which was over 60 years old on average, appealed to a broad segment of less ideologically motivated younger people, giving the party a more pragmatic and less orthodox culture. In contrast to the Czech branch of the party, family, regional identity, religious, professional, and inter-personal relationships formed the glue of the Slovak branch of the party. A socially idealistic Dub\u010dek, with no rigid ideological destination in mind, rose amid these ranks.\nIn 1948, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power. In June, 1949, still in Tren\u010d\u00edn, Dub\u010dek was promoted from his minor party duties at his workplace to administrative secretary of the OV KSS. He rose through the party ranks as a party functionary, first in Tren\u010d\u00edn, then being transferred to Bratislava, and then to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, while he pursued further education and training. He left for the Soviet Union in 1955, but returned in 1958 after completing his university education there. Shortly after returning from Moscow, in September 1958 he was appointed head secretary of the West Slovak Regional Committee of the KSS, and then transferred to Prague in 1960. There, as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Czech Republic for Industry, Dub\u010dek became intensely involved in the work of rehabilitation commissions (especially Drahomir Kolder's and Barnabit's, 1962\u20131963). Learning of the mechanisms of repression, Dub\u010dek would call this a watershed in his thinking that would dedicate him to reforms.\nFrom 1960 to 1968, he also participated in the National Assembly.\nIn 1963, a power struggle in the leadership of the Slovak branch unseated Karol Bac\u00edlek and Pavol David, hard-line allies of Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd, First Secretary of the KS\u010c and President of Czechoslovakia. Bac\u00edlek was removed in response to the findings of the rehabilitation commissions, due to his role in crimes as Interior Minister in the 1950s. In their place, a new generation of Slovak Communists took control of party and state organs in Slovakia, led by Dub\u010dek, who became First Secretary of the Slovak branch of the party. Along with that title, Dub\u010dek became a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the KS\u010c.\nShortly after Dub\u010dek took his new position as head of the Slovak party in 1963, he personally oversaw complete rehabilitation of those earlier convicted of being Slovak \"bourgeois nationalists\". He promoted the return of historic cultural personalities to popular awareness within Slovak society. This took the form of celebrations and commemorations, such as the 150th birthdays of 19th century leaders of the Slovak National Revival \u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far and Jozef Miloslav Hurban, the centenary of the Matica slovensk\u00e1 in 1963, and the twentieth anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising Dub\u010dek himself had taken part in. Even before this reformist take-over, the political and intellectual climate in Slovakia had been freer than that in the Czech lands.\nMeanwhile, cultural weeklies such as \"Literarni Novinv\", \"Kult\u00farny \u017eivot,\", and \"Kulturni Tvorba\" saw greatly expanded readership. Like many of the Slovak culture institutions, these publications were, however, engaged in a mostly indirect confrontation with the center, such as obvious ironic overstating of the party line. Political conflicts were commonly negotiated. This was complicated by exceptions, such as \"Kult\u00farny \u017eivot,\" the weekly newspaper of the Union of Slovak Writers, which authorities considered politically unreliable. Such direct confrontations were spreading. In 1967, Vaclav Havel's play \"The Memorandum\" and Milan Kundera's novel \"The Joke\", were seen by many writers as the beginnings of open rebellion.\nPrague Spring.\nThe Czechoslovak economy began to plateau in the early 1960s. The one-size-fits-all model of economic planning, better suited to the pre-industrialized Soviet Union of the 1930s, resulted in over-investment in heavy industry at the expense of light industry and consumer goods. Quantity was maximized regardless of costs, leading to poor quality and prices that were twice that of world prices. Along with other economists, Ota \u0160ik condemned the existing system of management as one that made further development impossible. Though production continued to grow, albeit slowly, in 1964 income began to fall. This forced then-president Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd to begin making limited concessions to liberalize the strictly planned economy. This included allowing greater freedom to companies in setting prices and wages. Though the source of the immediate crisis was the now-pressing economic effects, Dub\u010dek's generation had spent the early 1960s engaged in travel, research, and study heavily supported by academia, the state, and the party. Their body of research and experience convinced the reformers that their self-isolated country had not simply reached a growth impasse but had fallen behind the rest of the world due to a generation of stagnation in all spheres of life.\nReforms only touched some sectors, and reforms were slow, which the regime tried to make up with increased imports. Liberalizing the centralized economy threatened those in the party bureaucracy who administered the old system, resulting in their sabotage and slowing of what reforms were voted. The cultural sphere liberalized the most completely and rapidly, but the economy and national autonomy remained heavily centralized. Cultural intellectuals were able to achieve more, and gain greater leverage among the reformists because of a combination of a greater ability to connect with the public and a peculiarity of the system. Writers and publishers benefited from the autonomous profitability of the sectors they controlled, giving them fundamentally different interests than those tied to heavy industry or other sectors, who lacked financial independence.\nThe technocratic economic reformers, such as , who denounced the \"cult of the plan\", were only slightly less ideologically threatening. In many ways they were just as dangerous to the interests of conservatives in the party, but they lacked the political leverage of the moral economists who bridged the gap with the writers and intellectuals. Ota \u0160ik relied on an interdisciplinary approach and method. Writers and cultural intellectuals began to see themselves as holding the balance of power between the entrenched apparatus and reformers, which for many explains their enthusiasm for joining the party in disproportionate numbers, where their growing power could be expressed.\nRegardless, the economic reforms touched on both the nationalities and the political question. Reforming how the economy operated was tied to how the party operated, and thinking evolved to recognize the need for a diversity of interests to be represented. Cultural reform touched on economic reform, as the educated groups saw one of the principle resources the economy neglected was talent. Technical advance required abilities that were neither promoted nor respected among the conservatives, such as Novotn\u00fd, who were mostly poorly educated and often lacked fundamental competency at their jobs. They did not call, however, for capitalism and class difference but democratic compensation for additional time and expense necessary for their education.\nIn May 1967, speaking before the Plenum of the Communist Party of Slovakia, Dub\u010dek represented this rising conviction among his generation that rejected the dictatorship of a single class of workers or party officials. Instead, he appealed to a universal all-inclusive human principle that had as much in common with sociology as Marxist\u2013Leninism, in origins, practice, and aims, while still embracing both.\nIn September, 1967, Novotn\u00fd's conservatives began to impose strict censorship on films and other culture products, institutions, and culture workers. This did not quiet opposition but only further provoked it. What followed was an unprecedented mobilization of solidarity among culture workers in both Czech and Slovak lands.\nFollowing his presentation of grievances the month before, in October 1967 Dub\u010dek and Ota \u0160ik challenged First Secretary Novotn\u00fd's leadership style at a Central Committee meeting. Dub\u010dek said he acted like a dictator. Faced with lack of support at the central and local level of the party and large public demonstrations the last day of October that were badly mishandled, provoking further opposition, Novotn\u00fd secretly invited Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to visit to Prague in December 1967. He had hoped to shore up his own position.\nIn Prague, Brezhnev was stunned to learn of the extent of the opposition to Novotn\u00fd. He decided not to interfere. Brezhnev was generally supportive of Novotn\u00fd, but said he was not there to solve their problems. He was there to help restore party unity, while the KSC Presidium was deadlocked 5-5. In January, 1968, the questions of leadership and reform were turned over to the Czechoslovak Party Central Committee. They voted no confidence in Novotn\u00fd by splitting the functions of the president and party leader. He remained president but was replaced by Dub\u010dek as First Secretary. Novotn\u00fd resisted, attempting to mobilize elements of the army to prevent his loss of power. Ironically, investigation into this led to Novotn\u00fd being completely removed from office a few months later. Investigations by officials and a newly freed media of his chief accomplice, General Jan \u0160ejna, exposed a corruption scandal involving his own and his sons' shady business dealings, which was known as the 'Clover Seed Scandal'.\nDub\u010dek, with his background and training in Russia, was seen by the USSR as a safe pair of hands. \"Our Sasha\", as Brezhnev called him. Aside from the immediate personal and professional animosity of Bulgarian leader, Todor Zhivkov, who refused to acknowledge him directly, other Warsaw Pact leaders sent customary congratulations. Zhivkov received a protest for his snub from Soviet diplomats. Zhivkov's behavior was not motivated by opposition to Dub\u010dek's program of reforms but his discomfort at the manner in which his predecessor had been removed. Making no secret where he was headed, in February, with Brezhnev present, Dub\u010dek pledged: \"We shall have to remove everything that strangles artistic and scientific creativeness.\"\nThe period following Novotn\u00fd's downfall became known as the Prague Spring. During this time, Dub\u010dek and other reformers sought to liberalize the Communist government\u2014creating \"socialism with a human face\". Dub\u010dek and his allies\u2019 aim was not a return to capitalism, nor was it an end to the Communist Party's rule or its leading role in society. It was socialism marked by, \"internal democracy, unlimited and unconditioned by the party, the strengthening of the faith of the people and the working class, and its transformation into a revolutionary force and the creative power of the party.\" To that end, the Prague Spring sought to liberalize the existing regime. It continued a series of reforms that granted greater freedom of expression to the press and public, rehabilitated victims of Stalinist purges by Klement Gottwald, advanced economic decentralization, and supported fundamental human rights reforms that included an independent judiciary.\nDuring the Prague Spring, he and other reform-minded Communists enhanced popular support for the Communist government by eliminating its repressive features, allowing greater freedom of expression, and tolerating political and social organizations not under Communist control. \"Dub\u010dek! Svoboda!\" became the popular refrain of student demonstrations during this period, while a poll at home gave him 78-percent public support.\nDub\u010dek declared a 10-year program to implement reforms, but as reforms gained momentum he struggled to both maintain control and move with events. Dub\u010dek had been a compromise candidate between more radical reformers and hard-line conservatives. In power, Dub\u010dek was caught between a powerful hard-line minority in Czechoslovakia and their allies in other Warsaw Pact countries who pressured Dub\u010dek to rein in the Prague Spring, and on the other hand, more radical reformers who demanded more far-reaching and immediate reforms. While still stressing the leading role of the Party and the centrality of the Warsaw Pact, Dub\u010dek also was open to redefining the duty of party members from obedience to more creative expression. According to a CIA assessment at the time, Dub\u010dek was seen as an adept politician who might pull the balancing act off at home, which if true made Soviet military intervention all the more urgently needed by the anti-reform faction. The Soviet politburo may not have shared this view of Dub\u010dek, but they interpreted events as demonstrating dishonesty as much as lack of ability. In a phone conversation between Dub\u010dek and Brezhnev on 13 August, Dub\u010dek complained that he was on the verge of quitting in frustration, having difficulty meeting his promises because he was operating in such a fluid situation that planning was difficult and any new promises could just cause Brezhnev greater distrust when those promises couldn't be fulfilled rapidly.\nThe Soviet leadership tried to rein in events in Czechoslovakia through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at \u010cierna nad Tisou railway station, near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, Dub\u010dek defended the reform program but pledged his government's continued commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. Dub\u010dek promised to curb the media and anti-socialist tendencies and prevent the reconstitution of the Social Democratic Party. In return, the Soviets promised to withdraw troops that had been stationed in the country since exercises that June, where the Czechs had played the NATO team.\nDespite Dub\u010dek's continuing efforts to stress these commitments afterward, Brezhnev and other Warsaw Pact leaders told Dub\u010dek they remained anxious. Because so many motives were hidden behind clandestine activities, personal motives, and organizational biases, where even pro-intervention hard-liners had to make appearances so as not to be charged with treason, there was and remains confusion as to Soviet motives for the invasion that ended the Prague Spring.\nSome believed that the Soviets saw even a partly free press as threatening an end to one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and (by extension) elsewhere in Eastern Europe. This is contradicted by many eyewitnesses, such as Ken Coates. According to Coates, the charge that the party was losing control or that counter-revolutionaries were misusing reforms, including press freedom, to undermine the party position was laughable, saying: \"Anyone who was in Prague and lived in Czechoslovakia at that time knew that the Party's authority, the Party's position in the eyes of the nation had improved for the first time.\" Instead, he said that \"The Party discredited itself.\"\nHowever, the telephone conversation between Brezhnev and Dub\u010dek on 13 August suggests that media coverage was given high importance. Brezhnev had instructed Dub\u010dek to remove key people responsible for the media, specifically, \"Ji\u0159\u00ed Pelik\u00e1n, \u010cestm\u00edr C\u00edsa\u0159, Franti\u0161ek Kriegel, and other scoundrels\". Dub\u010dek's unwillingness or inability to do so created distrust around certain statements circulated in the media, which may have made the issue more significant than it actually was in itself, as it gave credence to the coup plotters.\nPress freedom began as an opening to reassessment of the Stalinist purges and the nation's historic past, but it grew into an abstract ideal as conservative criticism generalized and mounted. The question had been one more of truth-telling than of press freedom. The issues were more broad. Confusion was common. At the time of the invasion, events caught much of the world by surprise, despite widespread evidence of troop buildups and continued seeming arbitrary maneuvers on the country's borders. In an emergency meeting of the United States National Security Council called by President Lyndon B. Johnson on 20 August, Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, along with the cabinet and president could not explain Soviet actions. The invasion also erupted alongside so many destabilizing changes that some have pointed to 'press freedom' serving as a short-cut explanation.\nIn a letter written in 1974 to the widow of Josef Smrkovsk\u00fd, a close political ally who died in official political disgrace that January, Dub\u010dek said he remained unable to explain why the Soviet leadership believed \"distorted reports\" about the nature and aims of his socialist reforms. He said that these urgent warnings to the Soviet leadership were the result of party leaders and other conservatives who, \"saw all that was happening solely from the angle of the loss of their leading role in the party.\"\nAnti-reformist elements were a coalition of hard-liners in the Soviet Union, such as Yuri Andropov, whose false reports of events in Hungary had also helped overcome Khrushchev's opposition to intervention, and Warsaw Pact leaders fearing for their own positions such as East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, and Polish leader, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka. Perhaps most significantly, false high-level reports included letters secretly passed directly to the Soviet Politburo by those within the Czechoslovak regime who promoted intervention.\nOne such message was sent to Brezhnev at the time of the \u010cierna nad Tisou meeting. These letters and reports were sent by a group of anti-reformist hard-liners in the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KS\u010c), under the leadership of Slovak Communist Party chief, Vasi\u013e Bi\u013eak, working with allies in the StB and Czechoslovak People's Army. Bil'ak later wrote in his own memoirs that what he and his colleagues feared most, right up until mid-August, was that Dub\u010dek would reach an accommodation of compromise with Moscow that would forestall or prevent an invasion. Bil\u2019ak himself feared his own imminent departure from office with good reason. His hard deadlines were 26 August, the date of the Slovak Party Congress, and 20 August, a gathering of the reformist leadership. Both had been moved up to allow reformers to secure better positions. The warnings of Bil\u2019ak and his supporters stoked deliberately exaggerated fears of violent \"anti-socialist counter-revolution\" as an \"imminent threat\". This was not only to prod the Soviets to quick action but to ensure that Dub\u010dek would be removed and not even a moderate reformist government would remain to frustrate their personal prerogatives. Press freedom was only one of many reforms where no compromise at all could be tolerated.\n\"Fraternal Intervention\".\nOn the night of 20\u201321 August 1968, military forces from several Warsaw Pact member states (Albania, Romania and East Germany did not participate) invaded Czechoslovakia. Soviet media cited a call for help from unnamed representatives as the cause of the \"fraternal intervention\", publishing an unidentified appeal as proof on 22 August 1968; However, as it became clear from the first day that virtually the entire responsible leadership of the Czechoslovak government and communist parties, including Dub\u010dek, were being blamed as causes of the invasion, and even the Soviet-supported leadership fell into accusations against each other, most allied communist parties around the world rejected the Soviet pretext as a thin disguise for gross violation of national party autonomy. Even President Ludv\u00edk Svoboda had publicly issued a statement calling on occupying forces to withdraw and for reforms to continue, while Czechoslovakia's UN representatives were calling for international support against the invasion.\nThe Soviets were only partly responsible for their confusion. Closely following a long telephone conversation between Bil\u2019ak and Brezhnev on 10 August, two of Bil\u2019ak's most important allies met with the Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia on 14\u201315 August: Alois Indra, who along with Drahomir Kolder had previously been in direct contact with the Soviet Politburo, was accompanied by another KSC hard-liner, , in their meeting with ambassador Stepan Chervonenko. They assured him that as soon as Soviet \"troops move into action on the night of 20 August,\" the \"healthy forces\" in the KSC would carry out their \"plan of action\" to oust Dub\u010dek, setting up a \"provisional revolutionary government of workers and peasants.\" Indra said he could \"guarantee\" that a majority of the KSC Presidium, the KSC Central Committee, the National Assembly, and the Czechoslovak government would join with the \"healthy forces.\" He promised six of the eleven members of the KSC Presidium and 50 members of the KSC Central Committee as his supporters.\nThe Soviet Politburo received many such appeals for intervention, misleading them into confidence the viability of a hard-liner government in waiting. The KGB had also buried reports that the US and West Germany were not behind the Prague Spring. KGB Station Chief in Washington DC, Oleg Kalugin, only discovered years later that the KGB leadership had ordered his reports destroyed and not shown to anyone after they received what Kalugin thought was a more balanced assessment. Meanwhile, KGB reports to the Soviet leadership went to lengths to support the official narrative and the claims of anti-reform hard-liners. They blamed everything negative that happened in Czechoslovakia on the Prague Spring, including in some cases traffic crashes, fires, and burglaries. The KGB even manufactured evidence, directing agents to plant caches of American-made weapons near the German border in order to be discovered. They instructed agents to hang posters calling for the overthrow of communism. This was to prove a western-sponsored network was active in Dub\u010dek's reform movement as part of an imminent insurrection or coup. The KGB was only further enraged when the Czechoslovak Interior Minister revealed it all to be a deliberate Soviet provocation.\nThe KGB had many reasons for their actions, but most important may have been its institutional bias. The Pillar Commission set up to investigate the show trials of the 1950s recommended the disbandment of the secret police, and Czechoslovak security services had already ceased most cooperation with the KGB, having a major impact on the KGBs operational effectiveness and influence. The Czech security services had been vital to their effective operations. Some suggest further that they may have feared eventual reprisals against their most active and loyal agents within the StB and Interior Ministry. This motive is partly supported by the guarantees against reprisals against pro-Soviet Czechoslovaks in the Moscow Protocols. The KGB was also upset when Czechoslovak Interior Minister Josef Pavel revealed the existence of six KGB liaison agents within his office, implying that they would be removed. In an atmosphere of conformity cultivated by Brezhnev, only a few in the Kremlin voiced skepticism, such as Gennady Voronov, who asked, \"Whom was it really so necessary for us to defend, and from whom?\"\nBil\u2019ak would join Indra in reassuring the Soviets, promising that Kolder would be ready to be voted the KSC First Secretary when Soviet troops arrived. When two of their promised allies on the Presidium, and , opposed the invasion and supported Dub\u010dek, Soviet plans had to be abandoned. This forced them to retain Dub\u010dek and his government until the following year, when Dub\u010dek's government could no longer contain growing pressure to advance reforms once again, coming both from within and without the party.\nThe day of the invasion, occupying armies quickly seized control of Prague and the Central Committee's building, taking Dub\u010dek and other reformers into Soviet custody. But, before they were arrested, Dub\u010dek urged the people not to resist militarily, on the grounds that \"presenting a military defense would have meant exposing the Czech and Slovak peoples to a senseless bloodbath\". Already the previous month, when officers under General , head of the KSC's military department, began preparing contingency plans for a Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion, Dub\u010dek had immediately vetoed its implementation.\nIn the early hours of the attack, Czechoslovak radio broadcast an appeal to citizens not to resist. The presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia asked, \"all citizens of the Republic to keep the peace (and remain at their posts but) not resist the advancing armies, because the defense of our state borders is now impossible\". By making this official declaration before Soviet troops could preempt functioning of the official government, the Czechoslovak leadership ensured that both the invasion and Soviet invitation would be seen as illegitimate but also established the political and strategic framework for the resistance as symbolic and moral, where their opponent would have less control.\nControversy at that time and since has arisen as to whether Dub\u010dek knew of the invasion and hid the fact for his own reasons, perhaps explaining some of the world's surprise. Some point to the telephone conversation between Brezhnev and Dub\u010dek on 13 August where Dub\u010dek is recorded to say, \"If you on the Soviet Politburo believe we're deceiving you, you should take the measure you regard as appropriate.\" Brezhnev is recorded to respond, \"Such measures would be easier for us to adopt if you and your comrades would more openly say that these are the measures you're expecting of us.\" Historians have never accepted Dub\u010dek's foreknowledge, and Dub\u010dek has always denied it, but Czech resistance was somewhat unconventional and much is shrouded in ambiguity that created an open question for some.\nThe non-violent resistance of the Czech and Slovak population, which helped delay pacification by Warsaw Pact forces for over eight months (in contrast to the Soviet military's estimate of four days), became an example of civilian-based defense. A latter-day \"The Good Soldier \u0160vejk\" (referring to an early-20th-century Czech satirical novel) wrote of \"the comradely pranks of changing street names and road signs, of pretending not to understand Russian, and of putting out a great variety of humorous welcoming posters\". Meanwhile, for a short time government radio stations called for the invaders to return home: \"Long live freedom, Svoboda, Dub\u010dek\".\nDub\u010dek was arrested before dawn when 3 security officers, revolvers in hand and accompanied by several soldiers with machine guns bust into his office. One of them cut the telephone wires while another began to cuff him. When Dub\u010dek protested, he was beaten. His driver attempted to intervene and was immediately shot. Dub\u010dek was told, \"We will kill, if necessary, a million Czechs, threatened one of the officers, to put an end to your counter-revolution.\"\nLater on the day of the invasion, Dub\u010dek, along with Premier Old\u0159ich \u010cern\u00edk, Jozef Smrkovsky and Franti\u0161ek Kriegel were taken to the Soviet Union. At first, Dub\u010dek was taken to a mountain cottage in Ukraine; However, upon encountering massive popular resistance to their planned coup, and President Svoboda and other Czech representatives who were still in Prague refusing to accept any agreement made without approval of the official representatives of the party, the Soviets changed tactics and sent him to Moscow for negotiations.\nOn 24 August, Soviet representatives presented the Moscow Protocol. Rejecting a counter-proposal offered by Dub\u010dek's aides, they said it was non-negotiable. The only alternative was Soviet imposition of a military dictatorship now that their illusions of being welcomed as liberators proved false. Dub\u010dek and other detainees were repeatedly beaten during their detention, and Dub\u010dek reports he was drugged with sedatives to make him more compliant. Resisting nonetheless, Dub\u010dek's team gained minor but significant concessions, including refusing to accept Soviet justifications for the invasion or the right of the Soviet Union or any other country to decide their country's future, as well as not agreeing to the immediate reversal of all reforms. In the end, Dub\u010dek said they were forced to sign in order to avoid bloodshed in the room and back at home, with only Kriegel refusing to sign. This ended the Prague Spring and set the stage for a Moscow-directed reversal of reforms that Dub\u010dek was compelled to sell and implement.\nDub\u010dek and most of the reformers were returned to Prague on 27 August. At the time, the Moscow Protocol was intended to be a secret document. It was revealed to party members the subsequent week and then leaked to \"The New York Times\". Throughout the rest of the year, Dub\u010dek and other senior leaders were called back to Moscow repeatedly to receive new demands, which they returned home to deliver to their people. This led Dub\u010dek to consider quitting under extreme duress at times, but he always recovered. The Soviets made no attempt to hide their contempt. When Dub\u010dek protested that he had already met the terms of the Moscow Protocol, he is reported to have been told to 'shut up' by Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny. The Czechoslovak team were told that the Soviets would continue to turn the screws harder, undeterred by the protests of other communist parties; They dismissed them saying, \"For the next 30 or 40 years, socialism has no chance in the capitalist West.\" Gustav Hus\u00e1k reported they were treated as \"scoundrels\"\nIn January 1969, Dub\u010dek was hospitalized in Bratislava complaining of a cold and had to cancel a speech. Rumors sprang up that his illness was radiation sickness and that it was caused by radioactive strontium being placed in his soup during his stay in Moscow in an attempt to kill him. However, a U.S. intelligence report discounted this for lack of evidence. Also that month, following the self-immolation of Jan Palach, reformers renewed their offensive against conservative hardliners. Dub\u010dek pledged to hold the line against both reformers and neo-Stalinists, but opposition was moving outside the party for tactical reasons.\nDub\u010dek was forced to resign as First Secretary in April 1969, following the Czechoslovak Hockey Riots. The Soviets were not only alarmed by Dub\u010dek's failure to contain growing pressure to resume reforms but at their own failures to consolidate a neo-Stalinist regime under Indra or their other allies. Dub\u010dek was replaced by former reformer Gustav Hus\u00e1k, beginning a process of 'normalization' that would eventually purge two-thirds of the party and de-politicize the country. At the time, Leonid Brezhnev is supposed to have said: 'If we cannot find the puppets, then we will tie the strings to the leaders.'\nThough no longer party leader, Dub\u010dek had been re-elected to the Federal Assembly (as the federal parliament was renamed in 1969); Dub\u010dek became chairman on 28 April. Following the violent suppression of protests by new domestic Czech security forces, Dub\u010dek signed the 'baton law' into effect in August. Hus\u00e1k had sent this to the Federal Assembly to expand legal powers of suppression of dissent. Dub\u010dek would later call this the gravest mistake of his life. The baton law was widely seen as the end of hope for successful resistance. Despite his continued cooperation, Dub\u010dek was removed from parliamentary office on 15 October under Prime Minister Cernik's new government. Though Cernik tried to placate reformists, the new government's extreme anti-reformist faction, led by Deputy Party Chief Lubom\u00edr \u0160trougal, wanted to put Dub\u010dek on trial. Hus\u00e1k, who styled himself as a post-ideological 'realist', as well as Moscow, wanted to avoid a destabilizing return to Stalinism.\nInstead, Dub\u010dek was sent into diplomatic exile to Turkey. From head of a nation of millions and leader of 1.6 million party members, he went to heading a 7-person staff; This left him conveniently out of the country while more aggressive purges began in earnest. Some suggested at the time it would be too dangerous to post him anywhere within the Soviet bloc, where he was widely regarded as a hero. Hus\u00e1k was also said to have feared that direct persecution of Dub\u010dek might stir more instability than it would promote. Some thought that Hus\u00e1k's reluctance to trials and executions was because of his own experiences as a prisoner, though he thought his own imprisonment was wrong, he had no problem with imprisoning state enemies on general principle or personal feeling. Others suggest that it was the hard-liners themselves who wanted Dub\u010dek out of the country to isolate him from the public and to prevent him becoming a martyr, as trials had never helped the communist regime either within the country or internationally. Alan Levy, a journalist who witnessed the Prague Spring, explained Hus\u00e1k's reluctance with a comparison. Hungary was able to relax its repressive grip within less than 5 years after the Soviet invasion, but Czechoslovakia and its former leaders remained in a state of limbo rather than hell that would eventually last for decades. This he explained as because unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia had no real revolt to liquidate. Instead, he and the Soviets had to invent a counter-revolution, not prosecute it.\nHowever, in June of that same year, Dub\u010dek was dismissed from his ambassadorial post and recalled from Turkey after being suspended from the party pending an investigation by hard-liners. This was read as a signal that Hus\u00e1k had lost a behind-the-scenes power struggle against the hard-line faction led by \u0160trougal, Indra, and Balik. They had taken control of the Presidium by a margin of 7 to 4, voting to prepare a series of trials against reformers on charges of espionage, sedition, and slander of the republic. At the time, some suggested that Dub\u010dek's and his reformer allies' fates may have been spared by the chance drunk-driving crash that saved Hus\u00e1k from removal himself. The resulting investigation uncovered a conspiracy by ultra-conservatives to remove Hus\u00e1k who were themselves removed. Others said that this threat was part of an attempt to force Dub\u010dek to defect to the west, using his wife and children as hostages in Ankara. The only debate within ruling circles was how best to isolate Dub\u010dek from the public by some form of character assassination. They wanted him reassigned to a position as a senior officer in the Pension Insurance Research Institute to entrap him in a scandal after having failed to pressure Dub\u010dek to leave under a cloud as a defector, which would discredit him as a loyal party member.\nDub\u010dek found himself a permanent free-range prisoner, along with many others purged from the party and blacklisted from work. The purge of the party resulted in a general decline in membership from 1.6 million at the time that Dub\u010dek rose to power to 880,000 by the end of 1970. More purges would follow as loyalists replaced the able careerists. Those who otherwise cooperated to advance their careers. Even among those who remained members by the end of 1970, many either refused their cards or had not paid their dues. The reduction in numbers was accompanied by a qualitative change in the party, where the party that Dub\u010dek headed as leader of the post-Stalinist generation of idealists was gone. The majority of members were over 60 years old, and ideology had virtually disappeared, even among conservatives. Dub\u010dek and his communist reformers had proven so popular that the only way to root them out of the political fabric of the nation was to eradicate communist ideology. To do so required to virtually remove an entire generation from the party. Even Czechoslovak universities ceased to teach Marxism for lack of 'reliable' instructors. Any kind of political belief, in rapid succession, would be grounds for suspicion, leaving a disaffected population.\nFor Dub\u010dek and many others, this did not mean a return to private life but a different kind of political life, where in Dub\u010dek's case, his career in high politics would be deferred at home while he served as an inspirational symbol of Eurocommunist ideals abroad. Meanwhile, he struggled to personally survive repressions at home. Outwardly, he shifted to menial work that many educated reformers were forced to take. Turning down a post at a Slovak social security agency that could be used to implicate him in the misappropriation of funds, he instead requested to work as a forester. This was refused, but he was eventually given a clerical job with the state forestry agency in Bratislava. He was still investigated at work, but wrong-doing could never be found.\nExile in Bratislava.\nAfter his expulsion from the party, Dub\u010dek became a \"nonperson\" whose very mention was banned. In 1988 he told Voice of America that, \"what he had been through could not be described as 'life' in the normal sense of the word, but rather a matter of survival.\"\nWhile the first news reports during the normalization period, 1970\u201374, show a man who actively avoided attention and was shifting uncertainly between insecure employment, telling a West German photographer: \"Please, sir. Please, sir, if you like to help me come not to me.\" School girls giggled, saying all they were told at school was that he had done something bad. Other reports saw him as a man living securely but anonymously with his wife and children in a comfortable villa in a nice neighborhood in Bratislava. This seems to have been the official fable, as no evidence suggests this being a wholly accurate picture. When in 1975, authorities turned to prosecute his wife, Anna, she presented evidence of the insecure position of the entire family and personal friends denied proper medical care, her sons denied apartments, the armed guards posted at their home that made them fear its seizure, and her own nervous condition and health problems from constant surveillance and persecution. An entire politics arose around the false portrayal of the stability, security, and privilege of the Dub\u010deks' \"private\" life, in part to make plausible that Dub\u010dek was at liberty to be heavily involved in counter-revolutionary activities. Dub\u010dek was described as variously a spy-master, or when proven not to be or when misrepresented by either the regime or others, as a self-absorbed and simple-minded marionette of powerful external forces living a self-indulgent private life insulated from political participation and understanding. Complaints, such as that Dub\u010dek's sons were given high marks and admitted to university were described by one writer as, \"self-righteous vengefulness of the Soviet sycophants\" within the regime.\nDub\u010dek would say he first broke his silence by publishing letters he smuggled out of the country after he was denied the right to bury his mother in daylight in 1974, for fear it would provoke an anti-government demonstration. Dub\u010dek's public letters to other parties and to the National Assembly were part of a larger international 'campaign' by purged members gradually being joined by many high-profile figures outside Czechoslovakia and other domestic activists. This campaign was spurred by international publication of the \"memoirs\" of Josef Smrkovsk\u00fd, as well as the sometimes described 'hysterical' reaction of Hus\u00e1k to Dub\u010dek's both real and invented transgressions and writings. This ultimately gave Dub\u010dek a greater voice through anti-regime allies and provoked Dub\u010dek further in self-preservation. When in September 1975, as Hus\u00e1k intensified repressions following his consolidation of leadership positions, Dub\u010dek reacted to interrogation by refusing to deny the information being leaked or protesting the false use of his name, counter-threatening to act \"decisively\" if \"repressive measures\" were taken against him.\nThe former leader of the Prague Spring in fact had much in common with Eurocommunist tendencies. There were common challenges in the countries of the east and west caught between the superpowers, but seeking to both heal the division of Europe and gain autonomy from the influence of great power politics. Eurocommunism sought to unify the European labor movement and participate fully in parliamentary and internal democracy, decentralize, and steer an independent course. Not only did this bring them into direct conflict with the Soviet Union during the crackdown against the Solidarity trade union, but they had been in open disagreement with Moscow over the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1968, the clash was less public but just as clear. In a restricted meeting of the Italian Communist Party, Enrico Berlinguer told members to prepare their base for a clash with the Soviet leadership over the invasion.\nDub\u010dek had a long history of contact with not only the Italian Communist Party but with its newspaper \"l'Unit\u00e0\" and its journalists. A highly favorable article about him in \"l'Unit\u00e0\", on 29 June 1970, reporting his expulsion from the party, portrayed him as a social democratic communist seeking to change the ruling style of the party. He struck a chord with Italian audiences and remained a popular symbol of shared ideals. Under constant surveillance and separated from his domestic contacts, it was in many ways easier for him to make contact with western communist media and parties than with his own party and people. He saw this use of intermediaries as the natural course of action, stating in a letter to the Italian Communist Party:\n\"Since the matter of the political path in the Communist Party has become international, it cannot remain internal at this time. After the expulsion of almost 600,000 communists from the party and their civil and social disenfranchisement to our laws and the Constitution of Czechoslovakia, the crisis in the party deepened even more. A gradual starting point can only come with the help of other communist parties of socialist countries and other communist parties, especially European ones...Helping other communist parties cannot be understood as interfering in the internal affairs of another communist party, because it has long since become an international matter.\"\nDub\u010dek's relationship with Italian communists would lead to his first direct public interview, which prodded the University of Bologna into offering him an honorary doctorate as a man who could bridge the differences between the east and west. His trip to Italy in 1988, and the public recognition he gained from both the timing and prestige of an award he shared with Nelson Mandela, marked his return to high politics. This was at a time when perestroika was finally breaking through to the Soviet bloc nations outside the Soviet Union. This led directly to his partial rehabilitation as well as a return to public life. Immediately after receiving the award, Dub\u010dek was congratulated by Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd Jr., son of Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, who pointed to his importance as, \"not only a symbol of the Prague Spring, but also a symbol of inevitable changes in Czechoslovakia and a real political alternative.\"\nIn 1989, he was awarded the annual Sakharov Prize in its second year of existence.\nVelvet Revolution.\nIn 1989, before the anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion, the Slovak members of the Movement for Civil Freedoms () decided to commemorate the event by laying flowers as the locations of those in Slovakia who had been killed. Five of the organizers signed the letter announcing it. They were promptly arrested and came to be known as the \"Bratislava Five\".\nOn 14 November 1989, the final day of the trial of the 'Bratislava Five', a crowd gathered in front of the Bratislava Justice Palace. As Miroslav Kus\u00fd recollects, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn 17 November, Dub\u010dek attended the students' march at Albertov, in the Prague 2 municipal district. Fearing he would give a speech, the StB arrested Dub\u010dek, releasing him the next morning. This was said to mark the last arrest of an opposition leader. Martin B\u00fatora, one of the founders of Public Against Violence (VPN) recounted Dub\u010dek's appearance at Slovak National Uprising Square on 23 November as, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn 19 November, the Civic Forum, headed by Charter 77 member V\u00e1clav Havel, was established to oppose the communist government. Several hundred thousand individuals demonstrated against the communist government in Prague on 20\u201328 November 1989.\nThe night after his appearance at Slovak National Uprising Square, on 24 November, Dub\u010dek appeared with Havel on a balcony overlooking Wenceslas Square, where he was greeted with tremendous applause from the throngs of protesters below and embraced as a symbol of democratic freedom. Several onlookers even chanted, \"Dub\u010dek na hrad!\" (\"Dub\u010dek to the Castle\"\u2014i.e., Dub\u010dek for President). The crowd was divided by his calling this new revolution a chance to continue the work he had started 20 years earlier and prune out what was wrong with communism. By this time, most of the protesters wanted nothing to do with communism of any sort. Later that night, Dub\u010dek was on stage with Havel at the Laterna Magika theatre, the headquarters of Civic Forum, when the entire leadership of the Communist Party resigned. This resignation in effect ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia.\nWhile the show of a united front was necessary for the revolution of 1989, it would later prove a political embarrassment for some who vied for power against later regime opponents. They dismissed Dub\u010dek as a symbol of the past rather than the future. This reflected a division between the youth movements (sometimes called the Jacobins) that wanted nothing to do with the past and the older generation that was seen by them as too lenient and accommodating. Many of these arguments are obscured by politics.\nThe political rivalry between Hus\u00e1k and Dub\u010dek, which also was said to have features of personal animosity stemming from Hus\u00e1k's conviction that Dub\u010dek was personally to blame for the Warsaw Pact invasion, continued to have repercussions even after the fall of the regime in November 1989. By appointing the Slovak Mari\u00e1n \u010calfa as prime minister of the federal government the day before his resignation from the office of president of the republic, which took place on 10 December 1989, some charge that Hus\u00e1k deliberately pre-empted Dub\u010dek by indirectly enabling the election of V\u00e1clav Havel for the office of Czechoslovak president. Dub\u010dek's popularity throughout Czechoslovakia was high, giving him a very good chance of winning direct election for president. However, he lacked support from the prominent figures in the November revolution. They supported Charter 77 member Havel and a new generation of leaders.\nWhen Dub\u010dek himself was asked to explain this division, he said that the younger generation were unable to distinguish between his generation of reformist communists and the generation of communists who came before. He saw the consequence of this, post-Velvet Revolution, as creating a weakened democratic front against the narrow-minded and dogmatic. Dub\u010dek said this was not the first nor the last time in history when, \"any revolution reaches a certain stage, it starts devouring its own children.\" According to a member of Charter 77, , the younger generation had not forgotten that it was Dub\u010dek who signed the 'baton law' and his fellow reformers who assisted in pacification of the country. She explains that a culture of trust had been lost. It was, \"politically and economically impossible to continue where we had left off in 1968; the times had changed, and so had the people\".\nWhile Havel became president, on 28 December 1989, Dub\u010dek was elected chairman of the Federal Assembly, holding this position until the parliamentary elections in June 1992. True to his past dedication to Eurocommunism, prior to this on 16 December, he welcomed the delegation of the Italian Socialist Party headed by its chairman Bettino Craxi in Prague. He also met , as a journalist and an old friend. Antonetti interviewed Dub\u010dek for the newspaper \"l'Unit\u00e0\" on the eve of the presidential election. In the interview Dub\u010dek said, \"This time with the European left, I am thinking of the next spring.\" But he emphasized that \"I will remain outside the Communist Party, even if it is renewed\". Throughout 1990\u201392, Dub\u010dek continued \"intensive contacts\" with Italian communists and socialists, including visits to Italy where he was awarded honorary citizenship in many Italian cities.\nIn 1990, Dub\u010dek gave the commencement address to the College of Arts and Sciences at the American University School of International Service in the United States. He called Czechoslovakia's fight against the Soviet invasion a \"moral victory\". Gorbachev would have agreed, when he said, \"We thought that we had strangled the Prague Spring while in reality we had strangled ourselves.\"\nIn 1992, after long serving as an independent, he became leader of the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia and represented that party in the Federal Assembly. At that time, Dub\u010dek ambiguously supported the federal union between Czechs and Slovaks against the ultimately successful push towards an independent Slovak state. However, once it was clear that an independent Slovak Republic had become inevitable, at the same time historically as the breakup of Yugoslavia and dissolution of the Soviet Union, many assumed Dub\u010dek would become its first president.\nIts work completed, the Charter 77 Movement disbanded on 3 November 1992, four days before Dub\u010dek died of injuries from a car crash. The Federal Assembly voted for the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 25 November 1992. Czechoslovakia was formally dissolved on 31 December 1992; With that, Slovakia became an independent republic.\nDeath.\nDub\u010dek died on 7 November 1992, as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash that took place on 1 September on the Czech D1 motorway, near Humpolec, 20 days short of his 71st birthday. He was buried in Sl\u00e1vi\u010die \u00fadolie cemetery in Bratislava, Slovakia. His death remained an open question to some, with allegations of involvement by either then\u2013Prime Minister of Slovakia Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar or the KGB. An investigation was reopened when some members of his Social Democratic Party demanded it. A second investigation ruled that the death was due to aquaplaning at excessive speed in rainy weather. The driver was reportedly given a 12-month sentence for speeding. However, his son, Pavol Dub\u010dek, said afterward he remained skeptical, saying there were still many \"unclear things\" about his father's death that he does not understand. In an interview, he said he still remained skeptical in 2019, as he would remain for the rest of his life.\nAlexander Dub\u010dek's wife, Anna, died in 1990. They were survived by three sons: Pavol, who became a surgeon and traumatologist; Peter, who became an economist; and Milan. Alexander and Anna's first son was still-born.\nLegacy and cultural representations.\nWithout Dub\u010dek, Czechoslovak reforms may have taken a more technocratic form that didn't include revival of Slovak culture and the opening of the arts to more fluid and interdisciplinary forms that were exported by joint ventures and the diaspora of artists after the Soviet crackdown. Politically, the Prague Spring may have been more contained to Czechoslovakia. Many Soviet reformers, such as Andrei Sakharov, would have lacked the concrete inspiration that came from the reforms Dub\u010dek guided, particularly the revolt against stagnation. \"The invasion of Prague started the true dissident movement in Russia. An abyss opened up between them and the system, which was a catastrophic harbinger of change. Without Prague, there would have been no perestroika.\"\nDub\u010dek's style of leadership, and the ultimate frustration of his program by Soviet intervention, also had a deep impact on the development and orientation of communist and socialist parties and thinkers in the West.\nDub\u010dek also left a legacy of might-have-beens and what-ifs. Historians and the public continue to speculate what may have happened had he not died in a car crash, or had his time in leadership of the Prague Spring not been interrupted by Soviet intervention. One obituary speculates that had he become the Slovak president, his influence over the new country would have charted a more immediately inclusive course toward Europe.\nDub\u010dek has been remembered in artistic representations across many cultures and time periods.\nIn 1984, French singer and songwriter Alice Dona released a song called \"Le Jardinier de Bratislava\" with lyrics written by , as an apolitical song about love and longing for freedom. The song was inspired by a trip of a French television crew to visit Dub\u010dek in his villa near Slav\u00edn, Bratislava. They were denied the access by the \u0160tB secret police. The sole footage collected of Dub\u010dek was of him attending to his garden.\nIn 1990, the film \"Invasion\", a dramatisation of the Soviet invasion, was edited by producers to include translated commentary by Dub\u010dek responding to their interview about the events it portrays.\nThe film \"Dub\u010dek\", released in 2018, is the first film based on the life of Alexander Dub\u010dek. It is a Slovak historical film whose main plot revolves around events related to the Warsaw Pact invasion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
