L. Zamenhof. It is the most widely celebrated day in Esperanto culture. On this day, Esperantists hold information sessions and cultural gatherings to promote literature in Esperanto.\nThe history of celebrating Esperanto on Zamenhof's birthday can be traced back to 17 December 1878, when at a birthday party for his 19th birthday he presented to his friends his \"Lingwe uniwersala\", the first version of his international language. By 1887, this language had evolved into what is now recognized as Esperanto when he published the \"Unua Libro\". 15 December previously used to be also known as Esperanto Day, but that is now celebrated on 26 July, the day \"Unua Libro\" was published. As of 1927 onwards, 15 December is celebrated within the Esperanto movement as \"Esperanto Book Day\" as it is customary to purchase a new book on Esperanto on that occasion.\nZamenhof's 150th birth anniversary.\n15 December 2009 marked 150 years since Zamenhof's birth, and there were several events to celebrate. On this date, the authorities in his home town of Bia\u0142ystok, Poland, opened The Ludwik Zamenhof Centre, and a symposium honoring Zamenhof was held in New York City, featuring talks by Arika Okrent and Humphrey Tonkin among other professors.\nAlso on this date, the search engine Google, in 33 national language versions (but not the international English one), bore a special version of their logo (a Doodle) emblazoned with the Esperanto flag in honor of the occasion, which generated, between the 30 biggest Wikipedia languages, 1,750,000 page views on the articles \"L.

{"id": "34533", "revid": "50193783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34533", "title": "Zoroastrianism", "text": "Iranian religion founded by Zoroaster\nZoroastrianism, also called Mazdayasna or Behdin, is an Iranian religion centred on the Avesta and the teachings of Zarathushtra Spitama, who is more commonly referred to by the Greek translation, Zoroaster ( ). Among the world's oldest organized faiths, its adherents exalt an uncreated, benevolent, and all-wise deity known as Ahura Mazda (), who is hailed as the supreme being of the universe. Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu (), who is personified as a destructive spirit and the adversary of all things that are good. As such, the Zoroastrian religion combines a dualistic cosmology of good and evil with an eschatological outlook predicting the ultimate triumph of Ahura Mazda over evil. Opinions vary among scholars as to whether Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, or a combination of all three. Zoroastrianism shaped Iranian culture and history, while scholars differ on whether it significantly influenced ancient Western philosophy and the Abrahamic religions, or gradually reconciled with other religions and traditions, such as Christianity and Islam.\nOriginating from Zoroaster's reforms of the ancient Iranian religion, Zoroastrianism began during the Avestan period (possibly as early as the 2nd millennium\u00a0BCE), but was first recorded in the mid-6th century BCE. For the following millennium, it was the official religion of successive Iranian polities, beginning with the Achaemenid Empire, which formalized and institutionalized many of its tenets and rituals, and ending with the Sasanian Empire, which revitalized the faith and standardized its teachings. In the 7th century CE, the rise of Islam and the ensuing Muslim conquest of Iran marked the beginning of the decline of Zoroastrianism. The persecution of Zoroastrians by the early Muslims in the nascent Rashidun Caliphate prompted much of the community to migrate to the Indian subcontinent, where they were granted asylum and became the progenitors of today's Parsis. Once numbering in the millions, the world's total Zoroastrian population is estimated to comprise between 110,000 and 120,000 people, with most of them residing either in India (50,000\u201360,000), in Iran (15,000\u201325,000), or in North America (22,000). The religion is thought to be declining due to restrictions on conversion, strict endogamy, and low birth rates.\nThe central beliefs and practices of Zoroastrianism are contained in the Avesta, a compendium of sacred texts assembled over several centuries. Its oldest and most central component are the Gathas, purported to be the direct teachings of Zoroaster and his account of conversations with Ahura Mazda. These writings are part of a major section of the \"Avesta\" called the Yasna, which forms the core of Zoroastrian liturgy. Zoroaster's religious philosophy divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian paganism into emanations of the natural world\u2014the \"ahura\" and the \"daeva\"; the former class consisting of divinities to be revered and the latter class consisting of divinities to be rejected and condemned. Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator and sustaining force of the universe, working in \"g\u0113t\u012bg\" (the visible material realm) and \"m\u0113n\u014dg\" (the invisible spiritual and mental realm) through the Amesha Spenta, a class of seven divine entities that represent various aspects of the universe and the highest moral good. Emanating from Ahura Mazda is Spenta Mainyu (the Holy or Bountiful Spirit), the source of life and goodness, which is opposed by Angra Mainyu (the Destructive or Opposing Spirit), who is born from \"Aka Manah\" (evil thought). Angra Mainyu was further developed by Middle Persian literature into Ahriman (), Ahura Mazda's direct adversary.\nZoroastrian doctrine holds that, within this cosmic dichotomy, human beings have the choice between \"Asha\" (truth, cosmic order), the principle of righteousness or \"rightness\" that is promoted and embodied by Ahura Mazda, and \"Druj\" (falsehood, deceit), the essential nature of Angra Mainyu that expresses itself as greed, wrath, and envy. Thus, the central moral precepts of the religion are good thoughts (\"hwnata\"), good words (\"hakhta\"), and good deeds (\"hvarshta\"), which are recited in many prayers and ceremonies. Many of the practices and beliefs of ancient Iranian religion can still be seen in Zoroastrianism, such as reverence for nature and its elements, such as water (\"aban\"). Fire (\"atar\") is held by Zoroastrians to be particularly sacred as a symbol of Ahura Mazda himself\",\" serving as a focal point of many ceremonies and rituals, and serving as the basis for Zoroastrian places of worship, which are known as fire temples.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Zoroaster\" () is a Greek rendering of the Avestan name \"Zarathustra\". He is known as \"Zartosht\" and \"Zardosht\" in Persian and \"Zaratosht\" in Gujarati. The Zoroastrian name of the religion is \"Mazdayasna\", which combines \"Mazda-\" with the Avestan word \"yasna\", meaning \"worship, devotion\". In English, an adherent of the faith is commonly called a Zoroastrian or a Zarathustrian. An older expression still used today is \"Behdin\", meaning \"of the good religion\", deriving from \"beh\" &lt; Middle Persian \"weh\" 'good' + \"din\" &lt; Middle Persian \"d\u0113n\" &lt; Avestan \"da\u0113n\u0101\"\". In the Zoroastrian liturgy, this term is used as a title for a lay individual who has been formally inducted into the religion in a \"Navjote\" ceremony, in contrast to the priestly titles of \"osta\", \"osti\", \"ervad\" (hirbod), \"mobed\" and \"dastur\".\nThe first surviving reference to Zoroaster in English scholarship is attributed to Thomas Browne (1605\u20131682), who briefly refers to Zoroaster in his 1643 \"Religio Medici\". The term \"Mazdaism\" () is an alternative form in English used as well for the faith, taking \"Mazda-\" from the name Ahura Mazda and adding the suffix \"-ism\" to suggest a belief system.\nTheology.\nThe theological category of Zoroastrianism is hard to define. The reasons are the difficulties in assigning precise dates to the principal texts and the fact that many contain much older material. Furthermore, Zoroastrianism shaped only slowly over time and was not complete even by the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia. Polytheistic, monotheistic, and dualistic strands can be identified in the wider Zoroastrian tradition, with dualism being the dominant tendency. The major difference to Manichaeism lies in the insistence of good in the creation account.\nSome scholars believe Zoroastrianism started as an Indo-Iranian polytheistic religion: according to Yujin Nagasawa, \"like the rest of the Zoroastrian texts, the Old Avesta does not teach monotheism\". By contrast, Md. Sayem characterizes Zoroastrianism as being one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world.\nZoroastrians treat Ahura Mazda as the supreme god, but believe in lesser divinities known as yazatas (\"beings worthy of worship\"), who share some similarities with the angels in Abrahamic religions. These yazatas include Anahita, Sraosha, Mithra, Rashnu, and Tishtrya. Historian Richard Foltz has put forth evidence that Iranians of the pre-Islamic era worshipped all these figures; especially the gods Mithra and Anahita.\nProds Oktor Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8 states Zoroastrianism is henotheistic, and \"a dualistic and polytheistic religion, but with one supreme god, who is the father of the ordered cosmos\". Brian Arthur Brown states that this is unclear, because historic texts present a conflicting picture, ranging from Zoroastrianism's belief in \"one god, two gods, or a best god henotheism\". Economist Mario Ferrero suggests that Zoroastrianism transitioned from polytheism to monotheism due to political and economic pressures.\nIn the 19th century, through contact with Western academics and missionaries, Zoroastrianism experienced a massive theological change that still affects it today. The Rev. John Wilson led various missionary campaigns in India against the Parsi community, disparaging the Parsis for their \"dualism\" and \"polytheism\" and as having unnecessary rituals while declaring the Avesta to not be \"divinely inspired\". This caused mass dismay in the relatively uneducated Parsi community, which blamed its priests and led to some conversions towards Christianity.\nThe arrival of the German orientalist and philologist Martin Haug led to a rallied defense of the faith through Haug's reinterpretation of the Avesta through Christianized and European orientalist lens. Haug postulated that Zoroastrianism was solely monotheistic with all other divinities reduced to the status of angels while Ahura Mazda became both omnipotent and the source of evil as well as good. Haug's thinking was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug's theory, and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine (though being re-evaluated in modern Zoroastrianism and academia). It has been argued by Almut Hintze that this designation of monotheism is not wholly perfect and that Zoroastrianism instead has its \"own form of monotheism\" which combines elements of dualism and polytheism. Farhang Mehr asserts that Zoroastrianism is principally monotheistic with some dualistic elements.\nLenorant and Chevallier assert that Zoroastrianism's concept of divinity covers both being and mind as immanent entities, describing Zoroastrianism as having a belief in an immanent self-creating universe with consciousness as its special attribute, thereby putting Zoroastrianism in the pantheistic fold sharing its origin with Indian Hinduism.\nNature of the divine.\nZoroastrianism contains multiple classes of divine beings, who are typically organised into tiers and spheres of influence.\nAhuras.\nThe Ahura are a class of divine beings \"inherited by Zoroastrianism from the prehistoric Indo-Iranian religion. In the \"Rig Veda\", \"asura\" denotes the \"older gods\", such as the \"Father Asura\", Varuna, and Mitra, who originally ruled over the primeval undifferentiated Chaos.\"\nAhura Mazda.\nAhura Mazda, also known as Oromasdes, Ohrmazd, Ormazd, Ormusd, Hoormazd, Harzoo, Hormazd, Hormaz and Hurmz, is the creator deity and the supreme god in Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda stands for the dual deity \"Mitr\u0101\u02ca-V\u00e1ru\u1e47\u0101\" of the Hindu holy book known as the Rigveda.\nAccording to scholars, Ahura Mazda is an uncreated, omniscient, omnipotent and benevolent God who has created the spiritual and material existences out of infinite light, and maintains the cosmic law of Asha. He is the first and most invoked spirit in Yasna, and is unrivaled, has no equals and presides over all creation. In Avesta, Ahura Mazda is the only true God, and the representation of goodness, light, and truth. He is in conflict with the evil spirit Angra Mainyu, the representation of evil, darkness, and deceit. Angru Mainyu's goal is to tempt humans away from Ahura Mazda. Notably, Angra Mainyu is not a creation of Ahura Mazda but an independent entity. The belief in Ahura Mazda, the \"Lord of Wisdom\" who is considered an all-encompassing Deity and the only existing one, is the foundation of Zoroastrianism.\nAhura Mithra.\nMitra, also called Mithra, was originally an Indo-Iranian god of \"covenant, agreement, treaty, alliance, promise.\" Mitra is considered a being worthy of worship and is \"characterized by riches\".\nYazata.\nThe Yazata (Avestan: \ud802\udf2b\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf30\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf19\ud802\udf00) are divine beings worshiped by song and sacrifice in Zoroastrianism, in accordance with the Avesta. The word 'Yazata' is derived from 'Yazdan', the Old Persian word for 'god', and literally means \"divinity worthy of worship or veneration\". As a concept, it also contains a wide range of other meanings; though generally signifying (or used as an epithet of) a divinity.\nThe origins of Yazata are varied, with many also being featured as gods in Hinduism, or other Iranian religions. In modern Zoroastrianism, the Yazata are considered holy emanations of the creator, always devoted to him and obey the will of Ahura Mazda. While subject to repression by the Islamic Caliphate, the Yazata were often framed as \"angels\" to counter accusation of polytheism (\"shirk\"). According to the Avesta The Yazata assist Ahura Mazda in his battle against the evil spirit, and are hypostases of moral or physical aspects of creation. The yazatas collectively are \"the good powers under Ahura Mazda\", who is \"the greatest of the yazatas\".\nAmesha Spentas.\nYazatas are further divided into Amesha Spentas, their \"ham-kar\" or \"Collaborators\" who are Lower Ranking divinities, and also certain healing plants, primordial creatures, the fravashis of the dead, and certain prayers that are themselves considered holy.\nThe Amesha Spentas and their \"ham-kar\" or \"collaborator\" Yazatas are as follows:\nPrincipal beliefs.\nTenets of faith.\nIn Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything that can and cannot be seen, the eternal and uncreated, the all-good and source of Asha. In the Gathas, the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, Zoroaster acknowledged the highest devotion to Ahura Mazda, with worship and adoration also given to Ahura Mazda's manifestations (Amesha Spenta) and the other ahuras (Yazata) that support Ahura Mazda.\n\"Daena\" (\"din\" in modern Persian and meaning \"that which is seen\") is representative of the sum of one's spiritual conscience and attributes, which through one's choice Asha is either strengthened or weakened in the Daena. Traditionally, the (similar to the Hindu sacred utterance \"mantra\") prayer formulas, are believed to be of immense power and the vehicles of Asha and creation used to maintain good and fight evil. \"Daena\" should not be confused with the fundamental principle of \"Asha\", believed to be the cosmic order which governs and permeates all existence, and the concept of which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, \"asha\" was the course of everything observable\u2014the motion of the planets and astral bodies; the progression of the seasons; and the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset, and was strengthened through truth-telling and following the Threefold Path.\nAll physical creation (\"getig\") was thus determined to run according to a master plan\u2014inherent to Ahura Mazda\u2014and violations of the order (\"druj\") were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda. This concept of \"asha\" versus the \"druj\" should not be confused with Western and especially Christian notions of good versus evil, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the \"asha\" versus \"druj\" concept is more systemic and less personal, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or \"uncreation\", evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply \"the lie\" (that opposes truth and goodness). Moreover, in the role as the one uncreated creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of \"druj\", which is \"nothing\", anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated and developed as the antithesis of existence through choice.\nIn this schema of \"asha\" versus \"druj\", mortal beings (both humans and animals) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict, and it is their spiritual duty to defend Asha, which is under constant assault and would decay in strength without counter\"action\". Throughout the Gathas, Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions within society and accordingly extreme asceticism is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism but moderate forms are allowed within.\n\"Humata\", \"Huxta\", \"Huvarshta\" (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds), the Threefold Path of Asha, is considered the core maxim of Zoroastrianism especially by modern practitioners. In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds for its own sake, not for the search of reward. Those who do evil are said to be attacked and confused by the druj and are responsible for aligning themselves back to Asha by following this path. There is also a heavy emphasis on spreading happiness, mostly through charity, and respecting the spiritual equality and duty of both men and women.\nCentral to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of \"druj\". Similarly, predestination is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching and the absolute free will of all conscious beings is core, with even divine beings having the ability to choose. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives.\nIn Zoroastrian tradition, life is a temporary state in which a mortal is expected to participate actively in the continuing battle between Asha and Druj. Prior to its incarnation at the birth of the child, the \"urvan\" (soul) of an individual is still united with its \"fravashi\" (personal/higher spirit), which has existed since Ahura Mazda created the universe. Prior to the splitting off of the \"urvan\", the fravashi participates in the maintenance of creation led by Ahura Mazda. During the life of a given individual, the fravashi acts as a source of inspiration to perform good actions and as a spiritual protector. The fravashis of ancestors cultural, spiritual, and heroic, associated with illustrious bloodlines, are venerated and can be called upon to aid the living.\nThe religion states that active and ethical participation in life through good deeds formed from good thoughts and good words is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay. This active participation is a central element in Zoroaster's concept of free will, and Zoroastrianism as such rejects extreme forms of asceticism and monasticism but historically has allowed for moderate expressions of these concepts. On the fourth day after death, the urvan is reunited with its fravashi, whereupon the experiences of life in the material world are collected for use in the continuing battle for good in the spiritual world. For the most part, Zoroastrianism does not have a notion of reincarnation; albeit Followers of Ilm-e-Kshnoom in India, among other currently non-traditional opinions, believe in reincarnation and practice vegetarianism.\nZoroastrianism's emphasis on the protection and veneration of nature and its elements has led some to proclaim it as the \"world's first proponent of ecology.\" The Avesta and other texts call for the protection of water, earth, fire, and air making it, in effect, an ecological religion: \"It is not surprising that Mazdaism... is called the first ecological religion. The reverence for Yazatas (divine spirits) emphasizes the preservation of nature\" (Avesta: Yasnas 1.19, 3.4, 16.9; Yashts 6.3\u20134, 10.13). However, this particular assertion is limited to natural forces held as emanations of asha by the fact that early Zoroastrians had a duty to exterminate \"evil\" species, a dictate no longer followed in modern Zoroastrianism. Although there have been various theological statements supporting vegetarianism in Zoroastrianism's history and those who believe that Zoroaster was vegetarian.\nZoroastrianism is not entirely uniform in theological and philosophical thought, especially with historical and modern influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values, and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it. The ultimate purpose in the life of a practicing Zoroastrian is to become an \"ashavan\" (a master of Asha) and to bring happiness into the world, which contributes to the cosmic battle against evil. The core teachings of Zoroastrianism include:\nCosmology.\nCosmogony.\nAccording to the Zoroastrian creation myth, there is one universal, transcendent, all-good, and uncreated supreme creator deity Ahura Mazda, or the \"Wise Lord\" (\"Ahura\" meaning \"Lord\" and \"Mazda\" meaning \"Wisdom\" in Avestan). Zoroaster keeps the two attributes separate as two different concepts in most of the Gathas yet sometimes combines them into one form. Zoroaster also proclaims that Ahura Mazda is omniscient but not omnipotent. Ahura Mazda existed in light and goodness above, while Angra Mainyu, (also referred to in later texts as \"Ahriman\"), the destructive spirit/mentality,\nexisted in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. In the Gathas, Ahura Mazda is noted as working through emanations known as the Amesha Spenta and with the help of \"other ahuras\". These divine beings called \"Amesha Spentas\", support him and are representative and guardians of different aspects of creation and the ideal personality. Ahura Mazda is immanent in humankind and interacts with creation through these bounteous/holy divinities. In addition to these, He is assisted by a league of countless divinities called Yazatas, meaning \"worthy of worship.\" Each Yazata is generally a hypostasis of a moral or physical aspect of creation. Asha is the main spiritual force which comes from Ahura Mazda. It is the cosmic order and is the antithesis of chaos, which is evident as \"druj\", falsehood and disorder, that comes from Angra Mainyu. The resulting cosmic conflict involves all of creation, mental/spiritual and material, including humanity at its core, which has an active role to play in the conflict. The main representative of Asha in this conflict is Spenta Mainyu, the creative spirit/mentality. Ahura Mazda then created the material and visible world itself in order to ensnare evil. He created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (\"menog\") and 3,000 years later, the physical (\"getig\"). Ahura Mazda then created Gayomard, the archetypical perfect man, and Gavaevodata, the primordial bovine.\nWhile Ahura Mazda created the universe and humankind, Angra Mainyu, whose very nature is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil \"daevas\", and noxious creatures (\"khrafstar\") such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting Gayomard and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bovine emitted seeds, which were protected by Mah, the Moon. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the first human couple. Humans thus struggle in a two-fold universe of the material and spiritual trapped and in long combat with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and daily illuminated world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night. According to Zoroastrian cosmology, in articulating the Ahuna Vairya formula, Ahura Mazda made the ultimate triumph of good against Angra Mainyu evident. Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail over the evil Angra Mainyu, at which point reality will undergo a cosmic renovation called Frashokereti and limited time will end. In the final renovation, all of creation\u2014even the souls of the dead that were initially banished to or chose to descend into \"darkness\"\u2014will be reunited with Ahura Mazda in the Kshatra Vairya (meaning \"best dominion\"), being resurrected to immortality.\nCosmography.\nZoroastrian cosmography, which refers to the description of the structure of the cosmos in Zoroastrian literature and theology, involves a primary division of the cosmos into heaven and earth. The heaven is composed of three parts: the lower-most part, which is where the fixed stars may be found; the middle part, where the domain of the moon is located, and the upper part, which is the domain of the sun and unreachable by Ahirman. Further above the highest level of the heaven/sky includes regions described as the Endless Lights, as well as the Thrones of Amahraspand\u0101n and Ohrmazd. Although this is the basic framework which occurs in Avestan texts, later Zoroastrian literature would elaborate on this picture by further subdividing the lowest part of heaven to achieve a total of six or seven layers. The Earth itself was described as possessing three primary mountains: Mount Hukairiia, whose peak was the focal point of the revolution of the star Sadw\u0113s; Mount Harait\u012b, whose peak was the focal point of the revolution of the sun and the moon, and the greatest of them all, the Har\u0101 B\u0259r\u0259z whose peak was located at the center of the Earth and which was the first in a chain of 2,244 mountains which, together, encircled the Earth. Although the planets are not described in early Zoroastrian sources, they entered Zoroastrian thought in the Middle Persian period: they were demonized and took on the names \"An\u0101h\u012bd\" (Pahlavi for Venus), \"T\u012br\" (Mercury), \"Wahr\u0101m\" (Mars), \"Ohrmazd\" (Jupiter), and \"K\u0113w\u0101n\" (Saturn).\nEschatology.\nIndividual judgment at death is at the Chinvat Bridge (\"bridge of judgement\" or \"bridge of choice\"), which each human must cross, facing a spiritual judgment, though modern belief is split as to whether it is representative of a mental decision during life to choose between good and evil or an afterworld location. Humans' actions under their free will through choice determine the outcome. According to tradition, the soul is judged by the Yazatas Mithra, Sraosha, and Rashnu, where depending on the verdict one is either greeted at the bridge by a beautiful, sweet-smelling maiden or by an ugly, foul-smelling old hag representing their Daena affected by their actions in life. The maiden leads the dead safely across the bridge, which widens and becomes pleasant for the righteous, towards the House of Song. The hag leads the dead down a bridge that narrows to a razor's edge and is full of stench until the departed falls off into the abyss towards the House of Lies. Those with a balance of good and evil go to Hamistagan, a purgatorial realm mentioned in the 9th century work \"Dadestan-i Denig\".\nThe House of Lies is considered temporary and reformative; punishments fit the crimes, and souls do not rest in eternal damnation. Hell contains foul smells and evil food, a smothering darkness, and souls are packed tightly together although they believe they are in total isolation.\nIn ancient Zoroastrian eschatology, a 3,000-year struggle between good and evil will be fought, punctuated by evil's final assault. During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken, and humankind will lose its reverence for religion, family, and elders. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu's most fearsome miscreant, Azi Dahaka, will break free and terrorize the world.\nAccording to legend, the final savior of the world, known as the Saoshyant, will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. The Saoshyant will raise the dead\u2014including those in all afterworlds\u2014for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn but through which the impure will be completely purified. The forces of good will ultimately triumph over evil, rendering it forever impotent but not destroyed. The Saoshyant and Ahura Mazda will offer a bull as a final sacrifice for all time and all humans will become immortal. Mountains will again flatten and valleys will rise; the House of Song will descend to the moon, and the earth will rise to meet them both. Humanity will require two judgments because there are as many aspects to our being: spiritual (\"menog\") and physical (\"getig\").\nPractices and rituals.\nThroughout Zoroastrian history, shrines and temples have been the focus of worship and pilgrimage for adherents of the religion. Early Zoroastrians were recorded as worshiping in the 5th century BCE on mounds and hills where fires were lit below the open skies. In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of Mithra, Aredvi Sura Anahita, Verethragna and Tishtrya, alongside other traditional Yazata who all have hymns within the Avesta and also local deities and culture-heroes. Today, enclosed and covered fire temples tend to be the focus of community worship where fires of varying grades are maintained by the clergy assigned to the temples.\nThe incorporation of cultural and local rituals is quite common and traditions have been passed down in historically Zoroastrian communities such as herbal healing practices, wedding ceremonies, and the like. Traditionally, Zoroastrian rituals have also included shamanic elements involving mystical methods such as spirit travel to the invisible realm and involving the consumption of fortified wine, Haoma, mang, and other ritual aids.\nAccording to former South Asian studies professor Bettina Robotika, purification ceremonies associated with water (\"aban\") and fire (\"atar\") are considered the basis of Zoroastrian ritual life. Some Zoroastrian communities practice ritual exposure, mainly in regions of the Indian subcontinent where the practice is legal and there are healthy populations of scavenger birds. A corpse is considered a host for decay or \"druj\", and scripture enjoins that it be disposed in a manner that does not pollute the good creation. Structures called Towers of Silence are commonly identified with this practice.\nThe central ritual of Zoroastrianism is the Yasna, which is a recitation of the eponymous book of the Avesta and sacrificial ritual ceremony involving Haoma. Extensions to the Yasna ritual are possible through use of the Visperad and Vendidad, but such an extended ritual is rare in modern Zoroastrianism. The Yasna itself descended from Indo-Iranian sacrificial ceremonies and animal sacrifice of varying degrees are mentioned in the Avesta and are still practiced in Zoroastrianism albeit through reduced forms such as the sacrifice of fat before meals. High rituals such as the Yasna are considered to be the purview of the Mobads with a corpus of individual and communal rituals and prayers included in the Khordeh Avesta.\nA Zoroastrian is welcomed into the faith through the Navjote/Sedreh Pushi ceremony, which is traditionally conducted during the later childhood or pre-teen years of the aspirant, though there is no defined age limit for the ritual. After the ceremony, Zoroastrians are encouraged to wear their \"sedreh\" (ritual shirt) and \"kushti\" (ritual girdle) daily as a spiritual reminder and for mystical protection, though reformist Zoroastrians tend to only wear them during festivals, ceremonies, and prayers.\nHistorically, Zoroastrians are encouraged to pray the five daily G\u0101hs and to maintain and celebrate the various holy festivals of the Zoroastrian calendar, which can differ from community to community. Zoroastrian prayers, called , are conducted usually with hands outstretched in imitation of Zoroaster's prayer style described in the Gathas and are of a reflectionary and supplicant nature believed to be endowed with the ability to banish evil. Devout Zoroastrians are known to cover their heads during prayer, either with traditional topi, scarves, other headwear, or even just their hands. However, full coverage and veiling which is traditional in Islamic practice is not a part of Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrian women in Iran wear their head coverings displaying hair and their faces to defy mandates by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nScripture.\n\"Avesta\".\nThe \"Avesta\" is a collection of the central religious texts of Zoroastrianism written in the old Iranian dialect of Avestan. The history of the Avesta is speculated upon in many Pahlavi texts with varying degrees of authority, with the current version of the Avesta dating at oldest from the times of the Sasanian Empire. The Avesta was \"composed at different times, providing a series of snapshots of the religion that allow historians to see how it changed over time\". According to Middle Persian tradition, Ahura Mazda created the 21 Nasks of the original Avesta which Zoroaster brought to Vishtaspa. Here, two copies were created, one which was put in the house of archives and the other put in the Imperial treasury. During Alexander's conquest of Persia, the Avesta (written on 1,200 ox-hides) was burned, and the scientific sections that the Greeks could use were dispersed among themselves. However, there is no strong historical evidence for this and they remain contested despite affirmations from the Zoroastrian tradition, whether it be the \"Denkart\", \"Tansar-n\u0101ma\", \"Ard\u0101y Wir\u0101z N\u0101mag\", \"Bundahsin\", \"Zand-i Wahman yasn\" or the transmitted oral tradition.\nAs tradition continues, under the reign of King Valax (identified with a Vologases of the Arsacid dynasty), an attempt was made to restore what was considered the Avesta. During the Sassanid Empire, Ardeshir ordered Tansar, his high priest, to finish the work that King Valax had started. Shapur I sent priests to locate the scientific text portions of the Avesta that were in the possession of the Greeks. Under Shapur II, Arderbad Mahrespandand revised the canon to ensure its orthodox character, while under Khosrow I, the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi.\nThe compilation of the Avesta can be authoritatively traced, however, to the Sasanian Empire, of which only fraction survive today if the Middle Persian literature is correct. The later manuscripts all date from after the fall of the Sasanian Empire, the latest being from 1288, 590 years after the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The texts that remain today are the Gathas, Yasna, Visperad and the Vendidad, of which the latter's inclusion is disputed within the faith. Along with these texts is the individual, communal, and ceremonial prayer book called the Khordeh Avesta, which contains the Yashts and other important hymns, prayers, and rituals. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called \"Avestan fragments\" in that they are written in Avestan, incomplete, and generally of unknown provenance.\nMiddle Persian (Pahlavi).\nMiddle Persian and Pahlavi works created in the 9th and 10th century contain many religious Zoroastrian books, as most of the writers and copyists were part of the Zoroastrian clergy. The most significant and important books of this era include the Denkard, Bundahishn, Menog-i Khrad, Selections of Zadspram, Jamasp Namag, Epistles of Manucher, Rivayats, Dadestan-i-Denig, and Arda Viraf Namag. All Middle Persian texts written on Zoroastrianism during this time period are considered secondary works on the religion, and not scripture.\nHistory.\nZoroaster.\nZoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster in ancient Iran. The precise date of the founding of the religion is uncertain and estimates vary wildly from 2000 BCE to \"200 years before Alexander\". Zoroaster was born \u2013 in either Northeast Iran or Southwest Afghanistan \u2013 into a culture with a polytheistic religion, which featured excessive animal sacrifice and the excessive ritual use of intoxicants. His life was influenced profoundly by the attempts of his people to find peace and stability in the face of constant threats of raiding and conflict. Zoroaster's birth and early life are little documented but speculated upon heavily in later texts. What is known is recorded in the Gathas, forming the core of the Avesta, which contain hymns thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. Born into the Spitama clan, he refers to himself as a poet-priest and prophet. He had a wife, three sons, and three daughters, the numbers of which are gathered from various texts.\nZoroaster rejected many of the gods of the Bronze Age Iranians and their oppressive class structure, in which the Kavis and Karapans (princes and priests) controlled the ordinary people. He also opposed cruel animal sacrifices and the excessive use of the possibly hallucinogenic Haoma plant (conjectured to have been a species of ephedra or \"Peganum harmala\"), but did not condemn either practice outright, providing moderation was observed.\nLegendary accounts.\nAccording to later Zoroastrian tradition, when Zoroaster was 30 years old, he went into the Daiti river to draw water for a Haoma ceremony; when he emerged, he received a vision of Vohu Manah. After this, Vohu Manah took him to the other six Amesha Spentas, where he received the completion of his vision. This vision radically transformed his view of the world, and he tried to teach this view to others. Zoroaster believed in one supreme creator deity and acknowledged this creator's emanations (Amesha Spenta) and other divinities which he called Ahuras (Yazata). Some of the deities of the old religion, the \"Daevas\" (etymologically similar to the Sanskrit \"Devas\"), appeared to delight in war and strife and were condemned as evil workers of Angra Mainyu by Zoroaster.\nZoroaster's ideas were not taken up quickly; he originally only had one convert: his cousin Maidhyoimanha.\nCypress of Kashmar.\nThe Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise and to have stood in today's Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of King Vishtaspa to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian Zakariya al-Qazwini King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his \"\u02bfAj\u0101'ib al-makhl\u016bq\u0101t wa ghar\u0101'ib al-mawj\u016bd\u0101t\", he further describes how the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH (861 CE) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very great sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkish soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.\nFire Temple of Kashmar.\nKashmar Fire Temple was the first Zoroastrian fire temple built by Vishtaspa at the request of Zoroaster in Kashmar. In a part of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the story of finding Zarathustra and accepting Vishtaspa's religion is regulated that after accepting Zoroastrian religion, Vishtaspa sends priests all over the universe And Azar enters the fire temples (domes) and the first of them is Adur Burzen-Mihr who founded in Kashmar and planted a cypress tree in front of the fire temple and made it a symbol of accepting the Bahi religion And he sent priests all over the world, and commanded all the famous men and women to come to that place of worship.\nAccording to the Paikuli inscription, during the Sasanian Empire, Kashmar was part of Greater Khorasan, and the Sasanians worked hard to revive the ancient religion. It still remains a few kilometers above the ancient city of Kashmar in the castle complex of Atashgah.\nEarly history.\nThe roots of Zoroastrianism are thought to lie in a common prehistoric Indo-Iranian religious system dating back to the early 2nd millennium BCE. The prophet Zoroaster himself, though traditionally dated to the 6th century BCE, is thought by many modern historians to have been a reformer of the polytheistic Iranian religion who lived much earlier during the second half of the second millennium BCE. Zoroastrian tradition names Airyanem Vaejah as the home of Zarathustra and the birthplace of the religion. No consensus exists as to the localization of Airyanem Vaejah, but the region of Khwarezm has been considered by modern scholars as a candidate. Zoroastrianism as a religion was not firmly established until centuries later during the Young Avestan period. At this time, the Zoroastrian community was concentrated in the eastern portion of Greater Iran. Although no consensus exists on the chronology of the Avestan period, the lack of any discernable Persian and Median influence in the Avesta makes a time frame in the first half of the first millennium BCE likely.\nClassical antiquity.\nZoroastrianism enters recorded history in the mid-5th century BCE. Herodotus' \"The Histories\" (completed c.\u2009440\u00a0BCE) includes a description of Greater Iranian society with what may be recognizably Zoroastrian features, including exposure of the dead.\n\"The Histories\" is a primary source of information on the early period of the Achaemenid era (648\u2013330\u00a0BCE), in particular with respect to the role of the Magi. According to Herodotus, the Magi were the sixth tribe of the Medes (until the unification of the Persian empire under Cyrus the Great, all Iranians were referred to as \"Mede\" or \"Mada\" by the peoples of the Ancient World) and wielded considerable influence at the courts of the Median emperors.\nFollowing the unification of the Median and Persian empires in 550 BCE, Cyrus the Great and later his son Cambyses II curtailed the powers of the Magi after they had attempted to sow dissent following their loss of influence. In 522 BCE, the Magi revolted and set up a rival claimant to the throne. The usurper, pretending to be Cyrus' younger son Smerdis, took power shortly thereafter. Owing to the despotic rule of Cambyses and his long absence in Egypt, \"the whole people, Persians, Medes and all the other nations\" acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years.\nDarius I and later Achaemenid emperors acknowledged their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions, as attested to several times in the Behistun inscription and appear to have continued the model of coexistence with other religions. Whether Darius was a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster has not been conclusively established as there is no indication of note that worship of Ahura Mazda was exclusively a Zoroastrian practice.\nAccording to later Zoroastrian legend (\"Denkard\" and the \"Book of Arda Viraf\"), many sacred texts were lost when Alexander the Great's troops invaded Persepolis and subsequently destroyed the royal library there. Diodorus Siculus's \"Bibliotheca historica\", which was completed c.\u200960\u00a0BCE, appears to substantiate this Zoroastrian legend. According to one archaeological examination, the ruins of the palace of Xerxes I bear traces of having been burned. Whether a vast collection of (semi-)religious texts \"written on parchment in gold ink\", as suggested by the \"Denkard\", actually existed remains a matter of speculation.\nAlexander's conquests largely displaced Zoroastrianism with Hellenistic beliefs, though the religion continued to be practiced many centuries following the demise of the Achaemenids in mainland Persia and the core regions of the former Achaemenid Empire, most notably Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus. In the Cappadocian kingdom, whose territory was formerly an Achaemenid possession, Persian colonists, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice the faith [Zoroastrianism] of their forefathers; and there Strabo, observing in the first century BCE, records (XV.3.15) that these \"fire kindlers\" possessed many \"holy places of the Persian Gods\", as well as fire temples. Strabo further states that these were \"noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning.\" It was not until the end of the Parthian Empire (247 BCE\u00a0\u2013 224 CE) that Zoroastrianism would receive renewed interest.\nLate antiquity.\nAs late as the Parthian period, a form of Zoroastrianism was without a doubt the dominant religion in the Armenian lands. The Sassanids aggressively promoted the Zurvanite form of Zoroastrianism, often building fire temples in captured territories to promote the religion. During the period of their centuries-long suzerainty over the Caucasus, the Sassanids made attempts to promote Zoroastrianism there with considerable successes.\nDue to its ties to the Christian Roman Empire, Persia's archrival since Parthian times, the Sassanids were suspicious of Roman Christianity, and after the reign of Constantine the Great, sometimes persecuted it. In 451 CE, the Sassanid authority clashed with their Armenian subjects in the Battle of Avarayr, making them officially break with the Roman Church. But the Sassanids tolerated or even sometimes favored the Christianity of the Church of the East. The acceptance of Christianity in Georgia (Caucasian Iberia) saw the Zoroastrian religion there slowly but surely decline, but as late the 5th century CE, it was still widely practised as something like a second established religion.\nDecline in the Middle Ages.\nOver the course of 22 years during the 7th century, most of the Sasanian Empire was conquered by the emerging Muslim caliphate. Although the administration of the state was rapidly Islamicized and subsumed under the Umayyad Caliphate, in the beginning \"there was little serious pressure\" exerted on newly subjected people to adopt Islam. Because of their sheer numbers, the conquered Zoroastrians had to be treated as \"dhimmis\" (despite doubts of the validity of this identification that persisted down the centuries), which made them eligible for protection. Islamic jurists took the stance that only Muslims could be perfectly moral, but \"unbelievers might as well be left to their iniquities, so long as these did not vex their overlords.\" In the main, once the conquest was over and \"local terms were agreed on\", the Arab governors protected the local populations in exchange for tribute.\nThe Arabs adopted the Sasanian tax-system, both the land-tax levied on landowners and the poll-tax levied on individuals, called \"jizya\", a tax levied on non-Muslims (i.e., the \"dhimmis\"). In time, this poll-tax came to be used as a means to humble the non-Muslims, and a number of laws and restrictions evolved to emphasize their inferior status. Under the early orthodox caliphs, as long as the non-Muslims paid their taxes and adhered to the \"dhimmi\" laws, administrators were enjoined to leave non-Muslims \"in their religion and their land\".\nUnder Abbasid rule, Muslim Iranians (who by then were in the majority) in many instances showed severe disregard for and mistreated local Zoroastrians. For example, in the 9th century, a deeply venerated cypress tree in Khorasan (which Parthian-era legend supposed had been planted by Zoroaster himself) was felled for the construction of a palace in Baghdad, away. In the 10th century, on the day that a Tower of Silence had been completed at much trouble and expense, a Muslim official contrived to get up onto it, and to call the \"adhan\" (the Muslim call to prayer) from its walls. This was turned into a pretext to annex the building.\nUltimately, Muslim scholars like Al-Biruni found few records left of the belief of for instance the Khawarizmians because figures like Qutayba ibn Muslim \"extinguished and ruined in every possible way all those who knew how to write and read the Khawarizmi writing, who knew the history of the country and who studied their sciences.\" As a result, \"these things are involved in so much obscurity that it is impossible to obtain an accurate knowledge of the history of the country since the time of Islam...\"\nConversion.\nThough subject to a new leadership and harassment, the Zoroastrians were able to continue their former ways, although there was a slow but steady social and economic pressure to convert, with the nobility and city-dwellers being the first to do so, while Islam was accepted more slowly among the peasantry and landed gentry. \"Power and worldly-advantage\" now lay with followers of Islam, and although the \"official policy was one of aloof contempt, there were individual Muslims eager to proselytize and ready to use all sorts of means to do so.\"\nIn time, a tradition evolved by which Islam was made to appear as a partly Iranian religion. One example of this was a legend that Husayn, son of the fourth caliph Ali and grandson of Islam's prophet Muhammad, had married a captive Sassanid princess named Shahrbanu. This \"wholly fictitious figure\" was said to have borne Husayn a son, the historical fourth Shi'a imam, who insisted that the caliphate rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the Umayyads had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the Arab nationalism of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar Mary Boyce, \"it was no longer the Zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty to the past.\" The \"damning indictment\" that becoming Muslim was un-Iranian only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts.\nWith Iranian support, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and in the subsequent caliphate government\u2014that nominally lasted until 1258\u2014Muslim Iranians received marked favor in the new government, both in Iran and at the capital in Baghdad. This mitigated the antagonism between Arabs and Iranians but sharpened the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Abbasids zealously persecuted heretics, and although this was directed mainly at Muslim sectarians, it also created a harsher climate for non-Muslims.\nSurvival.\nDespite economic and social incentives to convert, Zoroastrianism remained strong in some regions, particularly in those furthest away from the Caliphate capital at Baghdad. In Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan), resistance to Islam required the 9th-century Arab commander Qutaiba to convert his province four times. The first three times the citizens reverted to their old religion. Finally, the governor made their religion \"difficult for them in every way\", turned the local fire temple into a mosque, and encouraged the local population to attend Friday prayers by paying each attendee two dirhams. The cities where Arab governors resided were particularly vulnerable to such pressures, and in these cases the Zoroastrians were left with no choice but to either conform or migrate to regions that had a more amicable administration.\nThe 9th century came to define the great number of Zoroastrian texts that were composed or re-written during the 8th to 10th centuries (excluding copying and lesser amendments, which continued for some time thereafter). All of these works are in the Middle Persian dialect of that period (free of Arabic words) and written in the difficult Pahlavi script (hence the adoption of the term \"Pahlavi\" as the name of the variant of the language, and of the genre, of those Zoroastrian books). If read aloud, these books would still have been intelligible to the laity. Many of these texts are responses to the tribulations of the time, and all of them include exhortations to stand fast in their religious beliefs.\nIn Khorasan in northeastern Iran, a 10th-century Iranian nobleman brought together four Zoroastrian priests to transcribe a Sassanid-era Middle Persian work titled \"Book of the Lord\" (\"Khwaday Namag\") from Pahlavi script into Arabic script. This transcription, which remained in Middle Persian prose (an Arabic version, by al-Muqaffa, also exists), was completed in 957 and subsequently became the basis for Firdausi's \"Book of Kings\". It became enormously popular among both Zoroastrians and Muslims, and also served to propagate the Sassanid justification for overthrowing the Arsacids.\nAmong migrations were those to cities in (or on the margins of) the great salt deserts, in particular to Yazd and Kerman, which remain centers of Iranian Zoroastrianism to this day. Yazd became the seat of the Iranian high priests during Mongol Ilkhanate rule, when the \"best hope for survival [for a non-Muslim] was to be inconspicuous.\" Crucial to the present-day survival of Zoroastrianism was a migration from the northeastern Iranian town of \"Sanjan in south-western Khorasan\", to Gujarat, in western India. The descendants of that group are today known as the \"Parsis\"\u2014\"as the Gujaratis, from long tradition, called anyone from Iran\"\u2014who today represent the larger of the two groups of Zoroastrians in India.\nThe struggle between Zoroastrianism and Islam declined in the 10th and 11th centuries. Local Iranian dynasties, \"all vigorously Muslim,\" had emerged as largely independent vassals of the Caliphs. In the 16th century, in one of the early letters between Iranian Zoroastrians and their co-religionists in India, the priests of Yazd lamented that \"no period [in human history], not even that of Alexander, had been more grievous or troublesome for the faithful than 'this millennium of the demon of Wrath'.\"\nModern.\nZoroastrianism has survived into the modern period, particularly in India, where the Parsis are thought to have been present since about the 9th century.\nToday Zoroastrianism can be divided in two main schools of thought: reformists and traditionalists. Traditionalists are mostly Parsis and accept, beside the Gathas and Avesta, also the Middle Persian literature and like the reformists mostly developed in their modern form from 19th century developments. They generally do not allow conversion to the faith and, as such, for someone to be a Zoroastrian they must be born of Zoroastrian parents. Some traditionalists recognize the children of mixed marriages as Zoroastrians, though usually only if the father is a born Zoroastrian. Not all Zoroastrians identify with either school. Notable examples gaining traction include Neo-Zoroastrians/Revivalists, which are usually reinterpretations of Zoroastrianism appealing towards Western concerns, and centering the idea of Zoroastrianism as a living religion. These advocate the revival and maintenance of old rituals and prayers while supporting ethical and social progressive reforms. Both of these latter schools tend to center the Gathas without outright rejecting other texts except the Vendidad.\nFrom the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society. They played an instrumental role in the economic development of the region over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the Tata, Godrej, Wadia families, and others.\nFor a variety of social and political factors, the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent, namely the Parsis and Iranis, have not engaged in conversion since at least the 18th century. Zoroastrian high priests have historically opined there is no reason to not allow conversion, which is also supported by the Revayats and other scripture, though later priests have condemned these judgements. Within Iran, many of the beleaguered Zoroastrians have been also historically opposed or not practically concerned with the matter of conversion. Currently though, The Council of Tehran Mobeds (the highest ecclesiastical authority within Iran) endorses conversion but conversion from Islam to Zoroastrianism is illegal under the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nThough the Armenians share a rich history affiliated with Zoroastrianism (that eventually declined with the advent of Christianity), reports indicate that there were Zoroastrians in Armenia until the 1920s.\nAt the request of the government of Tajikistan, UNESCO declared 2003 a year to celebrate the \"3,000th anniversary of Zoroastrian culture\", with special events throughout the world. In 2011, the Tehran Mobeds Anjuman announced that for the first time in the history of modern Iran and of the modern Zoroastrian communities worldwide, women had been ordained in Iran and North America as mobedyars, meaning women assistant mobeds (Zoroastrian clergy). The women hold official certificates and can perform the lower-rung religious functions and can initiate people into the religion.\nThe current Zoroastrian population is said be around 100,000 to 200,000 and reportedly declining. However, further studies are needed to confirm this, as numbers have also been rising in some areas, such as Iran.\nDemographics.\nZoroastrian communities internationally tend to comprise mostly two main groups of people: Indian Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians. According to a study in 2012 by the Federation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated to be between 111,691 and 121,962. The number is imprecise because of diverging counts in Iran.\nIran, Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Central Asia.\nIran's figures of Zoroastrians have ranged widely; the last census (1974) before the revolution of 1979 revealed 21,400 Zoroastrians. Some 10,000 adherents remain in the Central Asian regions that were once considered the traditional stronghold of Zoroastrianism, i.e., Bactria (see also Balkh), which is in Northern Afghanistan; Sogdiana; Margiana; and other areas close to Zoroaster's homeland. In Iran, emigration, out-marriage and low birth rates are likewise leading to a decline in the Zoroastrian population. Zoroastrian groups in Iran say their number is approximately 60,000. According to the Iranian census data from 2011 the number of Zoroastrians in Iran was 25,271.\nCommunities exist in Tehran, as well as in Yazd, Kerman and Kermanshah, where many still speak an Iranian language distinct from the usual Persian. They call their language Dari, not to be confused with the Dari spoken in Afghanistan. Their language is also called \"Gavri\" or \"Behdini\", literally \"of the Good Religion\". Sometimes their language is named for the cities in which it is spoken, such as \"Yazdi\" or \"Kermani\". Iranian Zoroastrians were historically called \"Gabr\"s.\nThe number of Kurdish Zoroastrians, along with those of non-ethnic converts, has been estimated differently. The Zoroastrian Representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has reported that as many as 100,000 people in Iraqi Kurdistan have converted to Zoroastrianism recently, with some community leaders speculating that even more Zoroastrians in the region are practicing their faith secretly. However, this has not been confirmed by independent sources. While, 2024 estimates showed a smaller figure of nearly 5,000 living in the region, primarily in Sulaymaniya Governorate of Iraq.\nThe surge in Kurdish Muslims converting to Zoroastrianism is largely attributed to disillusionment with Islam after experiencing violence and oppression perpetrated by ISIS in the area.\nSouth Asia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIndia is considered to be home to a large Zoroastrian population \u2013 the descendants of migrants from Iran and today known as the Parsis. In India's 2001 census, the Parsi population numbered at 69,601, representing about 0.006% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai. By 2008, the birth-to-death ratio was 1:5; 200 births per year to 1,000 deaths. India's 2011 census recorded 57,264 Parsi Zoroastrians.\nThe Zoroastrian population in Pakistan was estimated to number 1,675 people in 2012, mostly living in Sindh (especially Karachi) followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) of Pakistan reported that there were 3,650 Parsi voters during the elections in Pakistan in 2013 and 4,235 in 2018. According to the 2023 Pakistani census, there were 2,348 Parsis across the nation, with 1,656 (70.5%) being located in the Karachi Division.\nWestern world.\nNorth America is thought to be home to 18,000\u201325,000 Zoroastrians of both South Asian and Iranian backgrounds. As of 2012, the population of Zoroastrians in US was 15,000, making it the third-largest Zoroastrian population in the world after those of India and Iran. According to the 2021 Canadian census, the Zoroastrian Canadian population stood at 7,285, of which 3,630 were Parsis (of South Asian descent) and a further 2,390 of West Asian origin. A further 3,500 live in Australia (mainly in Sydney). Stewart, Hinze &amp; Williams write that 3,000 Kurds have converted to Zoroastrianism in Sweden. According to the 2021 UK census, there were 4,105 Zoroastrians in England and Wales, of which 4,043 were in England. The majority (51%) of these (2,050) were in London, most notably the boroughs of Barnet, Harrow and Westminster. The remaining 49% of English Zoroastrians were scattered relatively evenly throughout the country, with the second and third largest concentrations being Birmingham (72) and Manchester (47). In 2020, Historic England published \"A Survey of Zoroastrianism Buildings in England\" with the aim of providing information about buildings that Zoroastrians use in England so that HE can work with communities to enhance and protect those buildings now and in the future. The scoping survey identified four buildings in England.\nRelation to other religions and cultures.\nIndo-Iranian origins.\nThe religion of Zoroastrianism is closest to historical Vedic religion to varying degrees. Some historians believe that Zoroastrianism, along with similar philosophical revolutions in South Asia were interconnected strings of reformation of a common Indo-Aryan thread. Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced to prehistoric Indo-Iranian culture and beliefs, that is, before the migrations that separated the Indo-Aryans and Iranic peoples. Thus, Zoroastrianism shares elements with the historical Vedic religion that also originated in that era. Some examples include cognates between the Avestan word \"Ahura\" (\"Ahura Mazda\") and the Vedic Sanskrit word \"Asura\" ('demon', 'evil demigod'); as well as \"daeva\" (\"demon\") and \"deva\" (\"god\") and they both descend from a common Proto-Indo-Iranian religion.\nZoroastrianism inherited ideas from other belief systems and, like other \"practiced\" religions, contains syncretism. Specifically, Zoroastrianism in Sogdia, the Kushan Empire, Armenia, China, and other places incorporates local and foreign practices and deities.\nConversely, Zoroastrian influenced Hungarian, Slavic, Ossetian, Turkic and Mongol mythologies, all of which bear extensive light-dark dualisms and possible sun god theonyms related to Hvare-khshaeta.\nAbrahamic religions.\nZoroastrianism is sometimes credited with being the first monotheistic religion in history, antedating that of the Israelites and leaving a lasting and profound imprint on Second Temple Judaism and, through it, on later monotheistic religions such as early Christianity and Islam.\nThere are clear commonalities and similarities between Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Christianity, such as: monotheism, dualism (i.e., a robust notion of a Devil\u2014but with a positive appraisal of material creation), symbolism of the divine, heaven(s) and hell(s), angels and demons, eschatology and final judgment, a messianic figure and the idea of a savior, a holy spirit, concern with ritual purity, an idealization of wisdom and righteousness, and other doctrines, symbols, practices, and religious features.\nAccording to Mary Boyce, \"Zoroaster was thus the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgement, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general last judgement, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body. These doctrines were to become familiar articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowing by Judaism, Christianity and Islam; yet it is in Zoroastrianism itself that they have their fullest logical coherence. Since Zoroaster insisted both on the goodness of material creation, and hence of the physical body, and on the unwavering impartiality of divine justice.\"\nThe interactions between Judaism and Zoroastrianism resulted in transfer of religious ideas between the two religions and as a result, it is believed that Jews under Achaemenid rule were influenced by Zoroastrian angelology, demonology, eschatology, as well as Zoroastrian ideas about compensatory justice in life and after death. It is also postulated that the Jewish high monotheistic concept of God developed during and after the period of the Babylonian captivity, when the Jews had a prolonged exposure to sophisticated Zoroastrian beliefs.\nIn addition, Zoroastrian concepts seeded dualistic ideas in Jewish eschatology, such as the belief in a savior, the final battle between good and evil, the triumph of good and the resurrection of the dead. These ideas later passed on to Christianity via Zoroastrian-inspired texts of the Old Testament.\nAccording to some sources, such as \"The Jewish Encyclopedia\" (1906), there exist many similarities between Zoroastrianism and Judaism. This has led some to propose that key Zoroastrian concepts influenced Judaism. However, other scholars disagree, finding that the general social influence of Zoroastrianism was much more limited, and that no link can be found in Jewish or Christian texts.\nProponents of a link cite similarities between the two: such as dualism (good and evil, divine twins Ahura Mazda \"God\" and Angra Mainyu \"Satan\"), image of the deity, eschatology, resurrection and final judgment, messianism, revelation of Zoroaster on a mountain with Moses on Mount Sinai, three sons of Fereydun with three sons of Noah, heaven and hell, angelology and demonology, cosmology of six days or periods of creation, and free will, among others. Other scholars diminish or reject such influences, noting that \"Zoroastrianism has a unique theistic doctrine which combines dualism, polytheism and pantheism\", rather than being a monotheistic religion. Others say \"there is little concrete evidence about the precise origin and development of\" Zoroastrianism, and that \"Zoroastrianism does not compare with the Jewish belief in the sovereignty of God over the whole of creation.\"\nOthers, such as Lester L. Grabbe, have said \"there is general agreement that Persian religion and tradition had its influence on Judaism over the centuries\" and the \"question is where this influence was and which of the developments in Judaism can be ascribed to the Iranian side as opposed to the effect of the Greek or other cultures\". There exist distinctions but also similarities between Zoroastrian and Jewish law regarding marriage and procreation. While Mary Boyce claims, besides Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrian influence also extended to Northern Buddhism.\nIslam.\nZoroastrians are considered to be a \"People of the Book\" by Muslims.\nManichaeism.\nZoroastrianism is often compared with Manichaeism. Nominally an Iranian religion, Manichaeism was heavily inspired by Zoroastrianism because of Mani's Iranian origin, and it was also rooted in prior Middle-Eastern Gnostic beliefs.\nManichaeism adopted many of the Yazatas for its own pantheon Gherardo Gnoli, in \"The Encyclopaedia of Religion\", says that \"we can assert that Manichaeism has its roots in the Iranian religious tradition and that its relationship to Mazdaism, or Zoroastrianism, is more or less like that of Christianity to Judaism\".\nThe two religions have substantial differences.\nPresent-day Iran.\nMany aspects of Zoroastrianism are present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of Greater Iran, not least because Zoroastrianism was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent for a thousand years. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the Iranian language-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs, but also because Ferdowsi incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the Avesta in his epic \"Sh\u0101hn\u0101me\", which is pivotal to Iranian identity. One notable example is the incorporation of the Yazata Sraosha as an angel venerated within Shia Islam in Iran.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34535", "revid": "50633699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34535", "title": "Zeno's paradoxes", "text": "Set of philosophical problems\nZeno's paradoxes are a series of philosophical arguments presented by the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea (c. 490\u2013430 BC), primarily known through the works of Plato, Aristotle, and later commentators like Simplicius of Cilicia. Zeno devised these paradoxes to support his teacher Parmenides's philosophy of monism, which posits that despite people's sensory experiences, reality is singular and unchanging. The paradoxes famously challenge the notions of plurality (the existence of many things), motion, space, and time by suggesting they lead to logical contradictions.\nZeno's work, primarily known from second-hand accounts since his original texts are lost, comprises forty \"paradoxes of plurality,\" which argue against the coherence of believing in multiple existences, and several arguments against motion and change. Of these, only a few are definitively known today, including the renowned \"Achilles Paradox\", which illustrates the problematic concept of infinite divisibility in space and time. In this paradox, Zeno argues that a swift runner like Achilles cannot overtake a slower moving tortoise with a head start, because the distance between them can be infinitely subdivided, implying Achilles would require an infinite number of steps to catch the tortoise.\nThese paradoxes have stirred extensive philosophical and mathematical discussion throughout history, particularly regarding the nature of infinity and the continuity of space and time. Initially, Aristotle's interpretation, suggesting a potential rather than actual infinity, was widely accepted. However, modern solutions leveraging the mathematical framework of calculus have provided a different perspective, highlighting Zeno's significant early insight into the complexities of infinity and continuous motion. In the realm of metaphysics, evidence indicates that the \"skeptical method\" which Zeno adopted to analyze his paradoxes, also influenced the manner in which Immanuel Kant attempted to resolve the paradoxes which were identified within his own antinomies. Zeno's paradoxes remain a pivotal reference point in the philosophical and mathematical exploration of reality, motion, and the infinite, influencing both ancient thought and modern scientific understanding.\nHistory.\nThe origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear, but they are generally thought to have been developed to support Parmenides' doctrine of monism, that all of reality is one, and that \"all change is impossible\", that is, that nothing ever changes in location or in any other respect. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, citing Favorinus, says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. But in a later passage, La\u00ebrtius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees. Modern academics attribute the paradox to Zeno. \nMany of these paradoxes argue that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, motion is nothing but an illusion. In Plato's \"Parmenides\" (128a\u2013d), Zeno is characterized as taking on the project of creating these paradoxes because other philosophers claimed paradoxes arise when considering Parmenides' view. Zeno's arguments may then be early examples of a method of proof called \"reductio ad absurdum\", also known as proof by contradiction. Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes \"is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one.\" Plato has Socrates claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point. They are also credited as a source of the dialectic method used by Socrates.\nParadoxes.\nSome of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in Aristotle's \"Physics\" and Simplicius's commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a response to some of them. Popular literature often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno is often said to have argued that the sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite\u2013with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite. However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying \"it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time\". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the \"sum\", but rather with \"finishing\" a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a \"last event\"?\nParadoxes of motion.\nThree of the strongest and most famous\u2014that of Achilles and the tortoise, the Dichotomy argument, and that of an arrow in flight\u2014are presented in detail below.\nDichotomy paradox.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That which is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way stage before it arrives at the goal.\u2014\u200a\nSuppose Atalanta wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before she can get there, she must get halfway there. Before she can get halfway there, she must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, she must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.\nThe resulting sequence can be represented as:\nformula_1\nThis description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility.\nThis sequence also presents a second problem in that it contains no first distance to run, for any possible (finite) first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. Hence, the trip cannot even begin. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can be neither completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an illusion.\nThis argument is called the \"Dichotomy\" because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. An example with the original sense can be found in an asymptote. It is also known as the Race Course paradox.\nAchilles and the tortoise.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a race, the quickest runner can never over\u00adtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead.\u2014\u200a\nIn the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, Achilles is in a footrace with a tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. Suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed, one faster than the other. After some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say 2 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise. As Aristotle noted, this argument is similar to the Dichotomy. It lacks, however, the apparent conclusion of motionlessness.\nArrow paradox.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest at that instant of time, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless at that instant of time and at the next instant of time but if both instants of time are taken as the same instant or continuous instant of time then it is in motion.\u2014\u200a\nIn the arrow paradox, Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that at any one (durationless) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.\nIt cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring. If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.\nWhereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time\u2014and not into segments, but into points.\nOther paradoxes.\nAristotle gives three other paradoxes.\nParadox of place.\nFrom Aristotle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on \"ad infinitum\".\nParadox of the grain of millet.\nDescription of the paradox from the \"Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The argument is that a single grain of millet makes no sound upon falling, but a thousand grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something, an absurd conclusion.\nAristotle's response:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Zeno's reasoning is false when he argues that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise than potentially.\nDescription from Nick Huggett:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is a Parmenidean argument that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to be that even inaudible sounds can add to an audible sound.\nThe moving rows (or stadium).\nFrom Aristotle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This...involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.\nAn expanded account of Zeno's arguments, as presented by Aristotle, is given in Simplicius's commentary \"On Aristotle's Physics\".\nAccording to Angie Hobbs of The University of Sheffield, this paradox is intended to be considered together with the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, problematizing the concept of discrete space &amp; time where the other problematizes the concept of infinitely divisible space &amp; time.\nProposed solutions.\nIn classical antiquity.\nAccording to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions. To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Throughout history several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.\nAristotle remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.\nAristotle also distinguished \"things infinite in respect of divisibility\" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension (\"with respect to their extremities\").\nAristotle's objection to the arrow paradox was that \"Time is not composed of indivisible nows any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.\" Thomas Aquinas, commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote \"Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time.\"\nIn modern mathematics.\nSome mathematicians and historians, such as Carl Benjamin Boyer, hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern calculus provides a mathematical solution. Infinite processes remained theoretically troublesome in mathematics until the late 19th century. With the definition of limit, Karl Weierstrass and Augustin-Louis Cauchy developed a rigorous formulation of the logic and calculus involved. These works resolved the mathematics involving infinite processes.\nSome philosophers, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see Thomson's lamp) remain relevant metaphysical problems. While mathematics can calculate where and when the moving Achilles will overtake the Tortoise of Zeno's paradox, philosophers such as Kevin Brown and Francis Moorcroft hold that mathematics does not address the central point in Zeno's argument, and that solving the mathematical issues does not solve every issue the paradoxes raise. Brown concludes \"Given the history of 'final resolutions', from Aristotle onwards, it's probably foolhardy to think we've reached the end. It may be that Zeno's arguments on motion, because of their simplicity and universality, will always serve as a kind of 'Rorschach image' onto which people can project their most fundamental phenomenological concerns (if they have any).\"\nHenri Bergson.\nAn alternative conclusion, proposed by Henri Bergson in his 1896 book \"Matter and Memory\", is that, while the path is divisible, the motion is not. \nPeter Lynds.\nIn 2003, Peter Lynds argued that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are resolved by the conclusion that instants in time and instantaneous magnitudes do not physically exist. Lynds argues that an object in relative motion cannot have an instantaneous or determined relative position (for if it did, it could not be in motion), and so cannot have its motion fractionally dissected as if it does, as is assumed by the paradoxes. Nick Huggett argues that Zeno is assuming the conclusion when he says that objects that occupy the same space as they do at rest must be at rest.\nBertrand Russell.\nBased on the work of Georg Cantor, Bertrand Russell offered a solution to the paradoxes, what is known as the \"at-at theory of motion\". It agrees that there can be no motion \"during\" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times. In this view motion is just change in position over time.\nHermann Weyl.\nAnother proposed solution is to question one of the assumptions Zeno used in his paradoxes (particularly the Dichotomy), which is that between any two different points in space (or time), there is always another point. Without this assumption there are only a finite number of distances between two points, hence there is no infinite sequence of movements, and the paradox is resolved. According to Hermann Weyl, the assumption that space is made of finite and discrete units is subject to a further problem, given by the \"tile argument\" or \"distance function problem\". According to this, the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to the sum of the length of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. Jean Paul Van Bendegem has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.\nApplications.\nQuantum Zeno effect.\nIn 1977, physicists E. C. George Sudarshan and B. Misra discovered that the dynamical evolution (motion) of a quantum system can be hindered (or even inhibited) through observation of the system. This effect is usually called the quantum Zeno effect as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno's arrow paradox. This effect was first theorized in 1958.\nZeno behaviour.\nIn the field of verification and design of timed and hybrid systems, the system behaviour is called \"Zeno\" if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time. Some formal verification techniques exclude these behaviours from analysis, if they are not equivalent to non-Zeno behaviour. In systems design these behaviours will also often be excluded from system models, since they cannot be implemented with a digital controller.\nSimilar paradoxes.\nSchool of Names.\nRoughly contemporaneously during the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BCE), ancient Chinese philosophers from the School of Names, a school of thought similarly concerned with logic and dialectics, developed paradoxes similar to those of Zeno. The works of the School of Names have largely been lost, with the exception of portions of the \"Gongsun Longzi\". The second of the Ten Theses of Hui Shi suggests knowledge of infinitesimals:\"That which has no thickness cannot be piled up; yet it is a thousand li in dimension.\" Among the many puzzles of his recorded in the \"Zhuangzi\" is one very similar to Zeno's Dichotomy: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\"If from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a The Mohist canon appears to propose a solution to this paradox by arguing that in moving across a measured length, the distance is not covered in successive fractions of the length, but in one stage. Due to the lack of surviving works from the School of Names, most of the other paradoxes listed are difficult to interpret.\nIn popular culture.\n\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\", written in 1895 by Lewis Carroll, describes a paradoxical infinite regress argument in the realm of pure logic. It uses Achilles and the Tortoise as characters in a clear reference to Zeno's paradox of Achilles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge", "text": "Cable-stayed bridge in Boston, Massachusetts\nThe Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge (; also known as \"The Zakim\") is a cable-stayed bridge completed in 2003 across the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts. It replaces the Charlestown High Bridge, an older truss bridge constructed in the 1950s.\nThe bridge and connecting tunnel were built as part of the Big Dig, the largest highway construction project in the United States. The bridge's unique styling quickly became an icon for Boston, often featured in the backdrop of national news channels, to establish location, and included on tourist souvenirs. The bridge is commonly referred to as the \"Zakim Bridge\" or \"Bunker Hill Bridge\" by residents of nearby Charlestown.\nThe Leverett Circle Connector Bridge was constructed in conjunction with the Zakim Bridge, allowing some traffic to bypass it.\nDesign.\nThe bridge concept was designed by Swiss civil engineer Christian Menn in collaboration with bridge designer Miguel Rosales and its design was engineered by American civil engineer Ruchu Hsu with Parsons Brinckerhoff (now WSP USA). Wallace Floyd Associates, sub-consultants to Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, was the lead architect/urban designer and facilitated community participation during the design process.\nThe bridge is a cable-stayed bridge in a harp configuration with cradles carrying each strand through their pylon. The main portion of the Zakim Bridge carries four lanes each way (northbound and southbound) of Interstate 93 (concurrent with U.S. Route 1) between the Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill Jr. Tunnel and the elevated highway to the north. Two additional lanes are cantilevered outside the cables, which carry northbound traffic from the Sumner Tunnel and North End on-ramp. These lanes merge with the main highway north of the bridge. I-93 heads toward New Hampshire as the \"Northern Expressway\", and US 1 splits from the Interstate and travels northeast toward Massachusetts' North Shore communities, crossing the Mystic River via the Tobin Bridge.\nThe 1975-built MBTA Orange Line's Haymarket North Extension tunnel lies beneath the bridge.\nDedication.\nThe bridge's full name commemorates Boston area leader and civil rights activist Leonard P. Zakim, who championed \"building bridges between peoples\", and the Battle of Bunker Hill.\nThe bridge was dedicated on October 4, 2002, in a ceremony held on the new span. The dedication speakers included members of Zakim's family, government officials, and a performance of the song \"Thunder Road\" by Bruce Springsteen.\nIntroducing the song, Springsteen said about Zakim, \"... I knew him a little bit during the last year of his life, he was one of those people whose, intensity, inner spirit you could feel even when he was very ill, ... we honor his memory obviously not with this beautiful bridge, very lovely, but by continuing on in his fight for social justice.\"\nLandscape design and public art.\nPlacement of footings for the Zakim Bridge required environmental permits to relocate areas of open water surface, changing the contour of the Charles River shoreline. The process of landscape design and environmental mitigation under the bridge deck and around the bridge supports allowed for the creation of a new and accessible public landscape designed by Carol R. Johnson Associates. This under bridge landscape contains a series of perforated stainless steel lighting-based public artworks, entitled, \"Five Beacons for the Lost Half Mile.\"\nPedestrians and cyclists are able to travel from Charlestown toward Cambridge over the adjacent North Bank Bridge to North Point Park. This bridge is a link in the Charles River Bike Path and a segment of the Mass Central Rail Trail and the East Coast Greenway.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34537", "revid": "4967956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34537", "title": "ZZ Top", "text": "American rock band\nZZ Top is an American rock band formed in Houston, Texas, in 1969. For 51 years, it consisted of vocalist-guitarist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard, and bassist-vocalist Dusty Hill until his death in 2021. ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. They are known for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats, and long beards.\nZZ Top formed after Gibbons' band, Moving Sidewalks, disbanded in 1969. Within a year, they signed with London Records and released \"ZZ Top's First Album\" in 1971. Albums \"Tres Hombres\" (1973) and \"Fandango!\" (1975), and singles \"La Grange\" and \"Tush\", gained extensive radio airplay and have become staple tracks of classic rock radio. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top had become renowned in North America for their live act, including the Worldwide Texas Tour (1976\u201377), which was a critical and commercial success. ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album \"El Loco\" (1981), they began to experiment with synthesizers and drum machines. They established a more mainstream sound and rose to international stardom with \"Eliminator\" (1983) and \"Afterburner\" (1985), which integrated influences from new wave, punk, and dance-rock. The popularity of the albums' music videos, including for \"Gimme All Your Lovin'\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\", and \"Legs\", gave them mass exposure on MTV and made them prominent in 1980s pop culture. The Afterburner tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing of 1986.\nAfter the release of their 10th album, \"Recycler\" (1990), and its accompanying tour, the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums \"Antenna\" (1994), \"Rhythmeen\" (1996), \"XXX\" (1999), and \"Mescalero\" (2003). They released \"La Futura\" (2012) and \"Goin' 50\" (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. In 2018 the band won the Guinness world record for the longest-running active group with no lineup changes. On July 28 2021, ZZ Top announced that Hill had died at his home in Houston at the age of 72. In line with Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime guitar tech, Elwood Francis.\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million records. They have won three MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2004, the members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Gibbons the 32nd-greatest guitarist of all time. The band members have supported campaigns and charities including Childline, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the Delta Blues Museum.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nBilly Gibbons had formed the band Moving Sidewalks in Houston in 1966 with Dan Mitchell on drums, Tom Moore on keyboards, and Don Summers on bass. The group earned Gibbons local recognition, with their single \"99th Floor\" becoming a local hit. After opening for various popular groups such as the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, and the 13th Floor Elevators, Moving Sidewalks eventually released the album \"Flash\" (1969). By this point, both Moore and Summers had been drafted into the United States Army to fight in the Vietnam War, and Gibbons and Mitchell subsequently recruited bassist-keyboardist Lanier Greig, thus forming the first iteration of ZZ Top. The name of the band was Gibbons' idea; the band had a small apartment covered with concert posters, and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed B.B. King and Z. Z. Hill, and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is at the top\" which gave him the idea of naming the band \"ZZ Top\".\nEarly years (1969\u20131972).\nZZ Top was managed by Bill Ham, a Waxahachie, Texas, native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick\", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm\". Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Shortly after the recording of \"Salt Lick\", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of Stevie Ray Vaughan's, and Mitchell was replaced by Frank Beard of American Blues.\nDue to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from London Records, the American affiliate of the British Decca Records label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and Dusty Hill, Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement in late 1969. At this moment, all three members of the band were 20 years old. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at a Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont, Texas, on February 10, 1970. The show was booked by KLVI radio personality Al Caldwell, who was also instrumental in broadcasting the band's first recordings.\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, \"ZZ Top's First Album\" (1971) was released. It featured \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released \"Rio Grande Mud\" (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"Francine\".\nFirst decade of success and signature sound (1973\u20131982).\nZZ Top released \"Tres Hombres\" in 1973, which reached the number eight on the \"Billboard \"200\"\" albums chart by early 1974. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first top-10 record, making them stars in the process\". The album included the boogie-driven \"La Grange\" (written about the Chicken Ranch, a notorious brothel in La Grange, Texas, that also inspired the musical \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\"). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. During this tour, ZZ Top recorded the live tracks that would fill one side of their 1975 album, \"Fandango!\", which also contained one side of new studio songs. The album charted highly and its single \"Tush\" peaked at number 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nZZ Top began the Worldwide Texas Tour in May 1976 to support \"Fandango!\", and the tour continued through 1977 with 98 shows over 18 months. \"Tejas\", recorded during a break in the tour and released in November 1976, was the final ZZ Top album under their contract with London Records. It was not as successful or as positively received as their previous two efforts, but reached number 17 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The singles from \"Tejas\", \"It's Only Love\" and \"Arrested for Driving While Blind\", both failed to crack the top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nIn 1978, after almost seven years of touring and a string of successful albums, ZZ Top went on hiatus while Beard dealt with addiction problems. Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to Jamaica, and Hill went to Mexico. Hill also spent three months working at DFW Airport, saying he wanted to \"feel normal\" and \"ground himself\" after years spent performing. In 1979, ZZ Top returned to record a new album. Gibbons and Hill were now sporting chest-length beards. ZZ Top signed with Warner Bros. Records and released the album \"Deg\u00fcello\" in late 1979.\nWhile \"Deg\u00fcello\" went platinum, it only reached number 24 on the \"Billboard\" chart. The album produced two popular singles: \"I Thank You\", a cover of the David Porter/Isaac Hayes composition originally recorded by Sam &amp; Dave, and the band original \"Cheap Sunglasses\". The band remained a popular concert attraction and toured in support of \"Deg\u00fcello\". In April 1980, ZZ Top made their first appearances in Europe, performing for the German music television show \"Rockpalast\" (later included on the 2009 DVD \"\") and the BBC show \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\". The band shared the BBC's studio with English electronic group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), whom Gibbons felt \"were great\". Inspired by OMD, ZZ Top introduced a jerky dancing style to their live show and began to experiment with synthesizers, which featured prominently on the October 1981 album \"El Loco\". The album peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" chart, and featured the singles \"Tube Snake Boogie\", \"Pearl Necklace\", and \"Leila\". Their albums from this period showed a more modern sound.\n\"Eliminator\" (1983).\nGibbons pushed ZZ Top in a more modern direction for \"Eliminator\", released in March 1983. It featured two top-40 singles (\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\" and \"Legs\"), and two additional Top Rock hits (\"Got Me Under Pressure\" and \"Sharp Dressed Man\"), with the extended dance mix of \"Legs\" peaking at number 13 on the Club Play Singles chart. The album became a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies and reaching number 9 in the U.S. \"Billboard\" pop charts. It is the only ZZ Top album to be certified diamond.\nSeveral music videos from the album were in regular rotation on MTV, attracting many new fans. The band won their first MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Group Video for \"Legs\", and Best Direction for \"Sharp Dressed Man\". The music videos were included in their \"Greatest Hits\" video, which was later released on DVD and quickly went multiplatinum.\n\"Eliminator\" retained Gibbons's signature guitar style, while adding elements of new wave music; the electronic band Depeche Mode was cited as an influence. To compose the songs, Gibbons worked closely with live-in engineer Linden Hudson at the band's rehearsal studio in Texas, setting a faster tempo with drum machines and synthesizers. The main recording sessions were again supervised in Memphis by Terry Manning, who collaborated with Gibbons to replace many of the contributions from Hill and Beard. Jimi Jamison joined Manning to provide backing vocals with Billy Gibbons even referring to him as the fourth member of the band. Jamison also provided backing vocals in the following albums \"Afterburner\" and \"Recycler\".\nStage manager David Blayney described how Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album without receiving credit. The band recorded Hudson's song \"Thug\" without permission, finally paying him $600,000 in 1986 after he proved in court he held the copyright. The band had previously used other people's work without credit; for instance, in 1972 ZZ Top claimed sole writing credit for the hit song \"Francine\" from the album \"Rio Grande Mud\", cutting out two co-writers, Steve Perron and Kenny Cordray. Hudson's extensive contributions to the song \"Groovy Little Hippie Pad\" went uncredited in 1981 for the album \"El Loco\".\n\"Afterburner\" and \"Recycler\" (1985\u20131991).\nDespite selling fewer copies than \"Eliminator\", \"Afterburner\" (1985) became ZZ Top's highest-charting album (number four on the U.S. \"Billboard\" chart), with sales of five million copies. All of the singles from \"Afterburner\" were top-40 hits, with \"Sleeping Bag\" and \"Stages\" topping the Mainstream Rock chart. The music video for \"Velcro Fly\", their final top-40 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, was choreographed by future pop singer Paula Abdul. In 1987, ZZ Top released \"The Six Pack\", a collection of their first five albums plus \"El Loco\". The albums were remixed with new drum and guitar effects for a more \"contemporary\" sound similar to \"Eliminator\".\n\"Recycler\", released in 1990, was ZZ Top's final studio album with Warner Records and the last of a distinct sonic trilogy in their catalogue, marking a return towards a simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce than their previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that \"Eliminator\" and \"Afterburner\" had built up, and while \"Recycler\" did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of those albums. However, the single \"My Head's in Mississippi\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Album Rock Tracks chart that year.\nReturn to guitar-driven sound (1992\u20132003).\nIn 1992, Warner released \"ZZ Top's Greatest Hits\", along with a new Rolling Stones-style cut, \"Gun Love\", and an Elvis-inflected video, \"Viva Las Vegas\". In 1993, ZZ Top inducted a major influence, Cream, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nIn 1994, the band signed a $35 million deal with RCA Records, releasing the million-selling \"Antenna\". Subsequent RCA albums, \"Rhythmeen\" (1996) and 1999's \"XXX\" (the second album to feature live tracks) sold well, but did not reach the levels enjoyed previously. In 2003, ZZ Top released a final RCA album, \"Mescalero\", an album thick with harsh Gibbons guitar and featuring a hidden track\u2014a cover version of \"As Time Goes By.\" RCA impresario Clive Davis wanted to do a collaboration record (in the mode of Carlos Santana's successful \"Supernatural\") for this album. In an interview in \"Goldmine\", Davis stated that artists Pink, Dave Matthews, and Wilco were among the artists slated for the project. ZZ Top performed \"Tush\" and \"Legs\" as part of the Super Bowl XXXI halftime show in 1997.\nA comprehensive four-CD collection of recordings from the London and Warner Bros. years, \"Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ\", was released in 2003. It featured the band's first single (A- and B-side) and several rare B-side tracks, as well as a radio promotion from 1979, a live track, and several extended dance-mix versions of their biggest MTV hits. Three tracks from Billy Gibbons' pre-ZZ band, the Moving Sidewalks, were also included.\nCritical acclaim and retrospective releases (2004\u20132011).\nIn 2004, ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones gave the induction speech. ZZ Top gave a brief performance, playing \"La Grange\" and \"Tush\".\nIn 2006, \"Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango!\" received releases of expanded and remastered versions, which used the original mixes free from echo and drum machines, and included additional bonus live tracks.\nThe \"Eliminator Collector's Edition\" CD/DVD, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the band's iconic RIAA Diamond Certified album, was released September 10, 2008. The release includes seven bonus tracks and a bonus DVD, including four television performances from \"The Tube\" in November 1983.\nThe band performed at the 2009 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo on the final night on March 22, 2009. In July, the band appeared on VH1's \"Storytellers\", in celebration of their four decades as recording artists.\n\"La Futura\" (2012\u20132020).\nZZ Top released \"La Futura\", produced by Rick Rubin, on September 11, 2012. The first single, \"I Gotsta Get Paid\", debuted in an advertising campaign for Jeremiah Weed Whiskey and appears on the soundtrack of the film \"Battleship\". The song itself is an interpretation of \"25 Lighters\" by Texan hip hop DJ DMD and rappers Lil' Keke and Fat Pat. The first four songs from \"La Futura\" debuted on June 5, 2012, on an EP called \"Texicali\". DJ Screw was a major influence on the album as well, particularly because Gibbons and Screw both worked with engineer G. L. Moon during the late 1990s.\nOn March 3, 2015, ZZ Top began a North American tour in Red Bank, New Jersey, at the Count Basie Theatre. After rescheduled dates and additions, the tour ended in Highland Park, Illinois, at the Ravinia Festival on August 27, with the opening act Blackberry Smoke. Jeff Beck joined ZZ Top for seven concerts.\nOn September 9, 2016, ZZ Top released \"Tonite at Midnight: Live Greatest Hits from Around the World\". In 2017, they began the 2017 Tonnage Tour, but canceled the last few dates due to Hill's declining health. In 2018, ZZ Top won the Guinness world record for the longest-running active group with no lineup changes. In October, they announced a six-day Las Vegas run of shows to be held at the Venetian, starting from April 20, 2019. Gibbons told \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" in April 2020 that ZZ Top had been preparing another album. On June 21, 2020, Gibbons stated interest in having Beck appear.\nHill's death and upcoming album (2021\u2013present).\nIn July 2021, Hill was forced to leave a tour after a hip injury. ZZ Top performed without him at the Village Commons in New Lenox, Illinois, with Hill's guitar tech Elwood Francis on bass. Five days later, on July 28, ZZ Top announced that Hill had died at his home in Houston at the age of 72. His wife later reported that he had suffered from chronic bursitis. At Hill's request, ZZ Top continued with Francis on bass. In August 2021, Gibbons confirmed that Hill had recorded bass and vocals for the band's upcoming sixteenth studio album prior to his death.\nOn July 22, 2022, ZZ Top released \"Raw\", the soundtrack for the band's 2019 documentary \"That Little Ol' Band from Texas\", via Shelter Records/BMG. It was one of their final live albums with Hill. On July 21, 2023, ZZ Top began a tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Sharp Dressed Simple Man Tour, in West Palm Beach, which concluded on September 17 in Camden. A second leg of the tour began in March 2024 in Savannah, Georgia, and was due to end on September 22 in Ridgefield, Washington. On March 2, 2024, in Key West, ZZ Top embarked on the Elevation tour due to continue through November 24, 2024, in Lubbock.&lt;ref name=\"https://www.zztop.com/tour\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2025, Beard temporarily left the tour due to illness, and was replaced by ZZ Top's longtime drum technician, John Douglas.\nOther appearances.\nZZ Top appeared in a cameo in \"Back to the Future Part III\" as an Old West band, playing an acoustic version of their song \"Doubleback\" with a large fiddle band.\nZZ Top played Super Bowl XXXI in 1997, along with the Blues Brothers and James Brown. They also performed at the 2008 Orange Bowl game in Miami, as well as the Auto Club 500 NASCAR event at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California. On June 23, 2008, the band celebrated the release of their first live concert DVD titled \"Live from Texas\" with the world premiere, a special appearance, and charity auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in Houston. The DVD was officially released on June 24, 2008. The featured performance was culled from a concert filmed at the Nokia Theater in Grand Prairie, Texas, on November 1, 2007.\nOn January 22, 2010, Billy Gibbons, Will Ferrell, and Beck joined a band playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" on Conan O'Brien's last \"Tonight Show\" appearance. O'Brien joined in on guitar. In June 2011, various media sources reported that the new song \"Flyin' High\" would debut in space. Astronaut and friend of ZZ Top Michael Fossum was given the released single to listen to on his trip to the International Space Station. On June 4, 2014, ZZ Top opened the CMT Awards ceremony, performing \"La Grange\" with Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line.\nMusical style.\n\"The Guardian\" described ZZ Top as \"part traditional, part contrary, and part of the deep seam of Texas weirdness that stretched from the 13th Floor Elevators through to the Butthole Surfers\". \"Texas Monthly\" described their music as \"loud, macho, greasy, and distorted\", with \"unrepentant misogynistic references\". In the early 1980s, ZZ Top embraced synthesizers and drum machines, drawing inspiration from British electronic acts such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Depeche Mode (while deriving their dance moves from the former). Hill and Gibbons worked as a kind of double act, looking similar and employing simple stage choreography that Hill described as \"low-energy, high-impact\". ZZ Top's music has been classified as blues rock, hard rock, boogie rock, Southern rock, blues, and Texas blues.\nDrug use.\nBeard struggled with addiction in the 1970s, claiming to have spent \"every bit\" of his money earned from ZZ Top's tours on drugs. Beard explains that he had different reasons for taking different drugs, saying \"the pills thing came about just from the workload. And the heroin thing came about because I just liked it. I mean, you ever done heroin? It's great. It's a fucking vacation for the mind, and I liked it. I liked it a lot.\" Beard entered rehabilitation in the 1980s and was sober as of 2020.\nHill would \"[occasionally] partake\" in marijuana until one occasion in a hotel in Amsterdam, when Hill was smoking marijuana with guitar tech Elwood Francis and Francis noticed that a metal bar was embedded into the window frame of the hotel room. Francis, seeing an opportunity for a prank, jumped out the window and (unbeknownst to Hill) grabbed onto the metal bar, making it appear that he had committed suicide. Hill apparently never smoked marijuana again after the incident.\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nFormer members\nFormer touring musicians\nTimeline\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmography.\nIn addition to recording and performing concerts, ZZ Top has also been involved with films and television. In the eighth episode \"Sweet Dreams\" in the third season of the American television medical drama \"St. Elsewhere\", Luther Hawkins's (Eric Laneuville) dream sequence was a parody of the music video \"Legs\" with the group while taking a brief nap in a janitor's closet; In 1990, the group appeared as the \"Band At the Party\" in the film \"Back to the Future Part III\" and played the \"Three Men in a Tub\" in the movie \"Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme\". ZZ Top made further appearances, including the \"Gumby with a Pokey\" episode of \"Two and a Half Men\" in 2010 and the \"Hank Gets Dusted\" episode of \"King of the Hill\" in 2007. The band also guest hosted an episode of \"WWE Raw\". Billy Gibbons had a recurring role as the father of Angela Montenegro in the television show \"Bones\"; though the character is never named, it is strongly implied that Gibbons is playing himself. Their song \"Sharp Dressed Man\" was one of the theme songs used for the television show \"Duck Dynasty\", and on the series finale of the show they appeared with Si Robertson as a vocalist to perform the song on stage during Robertson's retirement party. Black Dahlia Films, led by Jamie Burton Chamberlin, of Seattle and Los Angeles, has contributed documentaries and back line screen work (the footage on back screens during live shows) and has become an integral part of the band's film-making.\nIn November 2020, it was announced that the 2019 Netflix documentary \"That Little Ol' Band from Texas\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Music Film with the award ceremony scheduled for March 2021.\nAwards and achievements.\nZZ Top's music videos won multiple VMA awards during the 1980s, topping the categories of Best Group Video, Best Direction, and Best Art Direction for \"Legs\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\" and \"Rough Boy\", respectively. Among high honors for ZZ Top have been induction into Hollywood's RockWalk in 1994, the Texas House of Representatives naming them \"Official Heroes for the State of Texas\", a declaration of \"ZZ Top Day\" in Texas by then-governor Ann Richards on May 4, 1991, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. They were also given commemorative rings by actor Billy Bob Thornton from the VH1 Rock Honors in 2007.\nZZ Top has also achieved several chart and album sales feats, including six number-one singles on the Mainstream Rock chart. From the RIAA, ZZ Top has earned four gold, three platinum and two multiple-platinum album certifications, and one diamond album.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Under zero-based numbering, the initial element is sometimes termed the \"zeroth\" element, rather than the \"first\" element; \"zeroth\" is a coined word for the ordinal number zero. In some cases, an object or value that does not (originally) belong to a given sequence, but which could be naturally placed before its initial element, may be termed the zeroth element. There is no wide agreement regarding the correctness of using zero as an ordinal (nor regarding the use of the term \"zeroth\"), as it creates ambiguity for all subsequent elements of the sequence when lacking context.\nNumbering sequences starting at 0 is quite common in mathematics notation, in particular in combinatorics, though programming languages for mathematics usually index from\u00a01. In computer science, array indices usually start at 0 in modern programming languages, so computer programmers might use \"zeroth\" in situations where others might use \"first\", and so forth. In some mathematical contexts, zero-based numbering can be used without confusion, when ordinal forms have well established meaning with an obvious candidate to come before \"first\"; for instance, a \"zeroth derivative\" of a function is the function itself, obtained by differentiating zero times. Such usage corresponds to naming an element not properly belonging to the sequence but preceding it: the zeroth derivative is not really a derivative at all. However, just as the \"first derivative\" precedes the \"second derivative\", so also does the \"zeroth derivative\" (or the original function itself) precede the \"first derivative\".\nComputer programming.\nOrigin.\nMartin Richards, creator of the BCPL language (a precursor of C), designed arrays initiating at 0 as the natural position to start accessing the array contents in the language, since the value of a pointer \"p\" used as an address accesses the position \"p\" + 0 in memory. BCPL was first compiled for the IBM\u00a07094; the language introduced no run-time indirection lookups, so the indirection optimization provided by these arrays was done at compile time. The optimization was nevertheless important.\nIn 1982 Edsger W. Dijkstra in his pertinent note \"Why numbering should start at zero\" argued that arrays subscripts should start at zero as that's the most natural number. Discussing possible designs of array ranges by enclosing them in a chained inequality, combining sharp and standard inequalities to four possibilities, demonstrating that to his conviction zero-based arrays are best represented by non-overlapping index ranges, which start at zero, alluding to open, half-open and closed intervals as with the real numbers. Dijkstra's criteria for preferring this convention are in detail that it represents empty sequences in a more natural way (\"a\" \u2264 \"i\" &lt; \"a\" ?) than closed \"intervals\" (\"a\" \u2264 \"i\" \u2264 (\"a\" \u2212 1) ?), and that with half-open \"intervals\" of naturals, the length of a sub-sequence equals the upper minus the lower bound (\"a\" \u2264 \"i\" &lt; \"b\" gives (\"b\" \u2212 \"a\") possible values for \"i\", with \"a\", \"b\", \"i\" all integers).\nUsage in programming languages.\nThis usage follows from design choices embedded in many influential programming languages, including C, Java, and Lisp. In these three, sequence types (C arrays, Java arrays and lists, and Lisp lists and vectors) are indexed beginning with the zero subscript. Particularly in C, where arrays are closely tied to pointer arithmetic, this makes for a simpler implementation: the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero.\nReferencing memory by an address and an offset is represented directly in computer hardware on virtually all computer architectures, so this design detail in C makes compilation easier, at the cost of some human factors. In this context using \"zeroth\" as an ordinal is not strictly correct, but a widespread habit in this profession. Some programming languages, such as Fortran or COBOL, have array subscripts starting with one, because they were meant as high-level programming languages, and as such they had to have a correspondence to the usual ordinal numbers which predate the invention of the zero by a long time. And some programming languages, e.g., Ada, ALGOL 60, PL/I, allow an arbitrary lower bound for each index.\nPascal allows the range of an array to be of any ordinal type (including enumerated types) and Ada allows any discrete subtype. APL allows setting the index origin to 0 or 1 during runtime programmatically. Some recent languages, such as Lua and Visual Basic, have adopted the same convention for the same reason.\nZero is the lowest unsigned integer value, one of the most fundamental types in programming and hardware design. In computer science, zero is thus often used as the base case for many kinds of numerical recursion. Proofs and other sorts of mathematical reasoning in computer science often begin with zero. For these reasons, in computer science it is not unusual to number from zero rather than one.\nIf an array is used to represent a cycle, it is convenient to obtain the index with a modulo function, which can result in zero.\nNumerical properties.\nWith zero-based numbering, a range can be expressed as the half-open interval, [0, \"n\"), as opposed to the closed interval, [1, \"n\"]. Empty ranges, which often occur in algorithms, are tricky to express with a closed interval without resorting to obtuse conventions like [1, 0]. Because of this property, zero-based indexing potentially reduces off-by-one and fencepost errors. On the other hand, the repeat count n is calculated in advance, making the use of counting from 0 to \"n\" \u2212 1 (inclusive) less intuitive. Some authors prefer one-based indexing, as it corresponds more closely to how entities are indexed in other contexts.\nAnother property of this convention is in the use of modular arithmetic as implemented in modern computers. Usually, the modulo function maps any integer modulo N to one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., \"N\" \u2212 1, where \"N\" \u2265 1. Because of this, many formulas in algorithms (such as that for calculating hash table indices) can be elegantly expressed in code using the modulo operation when array indices start at zero.\nPointer operations can also be expressed more elegantly on a zero-based index due to the underlying address/offset logic mentioned above. To illustrate, suppose a is the memory address of the first element of an array, and i is the index of the desired element. To compute the address of the desired element, if the index numbers count from 1, the desired address is computed by this expression:\n formula_1\nwhere s is the size of each element. In contrast, if the index numbers count from 0, the expression becomes\n formula_2\nThis simpler expression is more efficient to compute at run time.\nHowever, a language wishing to index arrays from 1 could adopt the convention that every array address is represented by \"a\"\u2032 = \"a\" \u2013 \"s\"; that is, rather than using the address of the first array element, such a language would use the address of a fictitious element located immediately before the first actual element. The indexing expression for a 1-based index would then be\n formula_3\nHence, the efficiency benefit at run time of zero-based indexing is not inherent, but is an artifact of the decision to represent an array with the address of its first element rather than the address of the fictitious zeroth element. However, the address of that fictitious element could very well be the address of some other item in memory not related to the array.\nSuperficially, the fictitious element doesn't scale well to multidimensional arrays. Indexing multidimensional arrays from zero makes a naive (contiguous) conversion to a linear address space (systematically varying one index after the other) look simpler than when indexing from one. For instance, when mapping the three-dimensional array A[\"P\"][\"N\"][\"M\"] to a linear array L[\"M\u22c5N\u22c5P\"], both with M \u22c5 N \u22c5 P elements, the index r in the linear array to access a specific element with L[\"r\"] \n A[\"z\"][\"y\"][\"x\"] in zero-based indexing, i.e. [0 \u2264 \"x\" &lt; \"P\"], [0 \u2264 \"y\" &lt; \"N\"], [0 \u2264 \"z\" &lt; \"M\"], and [0 \u2264 \"r\" &lt; \"M \u22c5 N \u22c5 P\"], is calculated by \nformula_4\nOrganizing all arrays with 1-based indices ([1 \u2264 \"x\u2032\" \u2264 \"P\"], [1 \u2264 \"y\u2032\" \u2264 \"N\"], [1 \u2264 \"z\u2032\" \u2264 \"M\"], [1 \u2264 \"r\u2032\" \u2264 \"M \u22c5 N \u22c5 P\"]), and assuming an analogous arrangement of the elements, gives \nformula_5\nto access the same element, which arguably looks more complicated. Of course, \"r\"\u2032 \n \"r\" + 1, since [\"z\" \n \"z\"\u2032 \u2013 1], [\"y\" \n \"y\"\u2032 \u2013 1], and [\"x\" \n \"x\"\u2032 \u2013 1]. A simple and everyday-life example is positional notation, which the invention of the zero made possible. In positional notation, tens, hundreds, thousands and all other digits start with zero, only units start at one.\nThis situation can lead to some confusion in terminology. In a zero-based indexing scheme, the first element is \"element number zero\"; likewise, the twelfth element is \"element number eleven\". Therefore, an analogy from the ordinal numbers to the quantity of objects numbered appears; the highest index of n objects will be \"n\" \u2212 1, and it refers to the nth element. For this reason, the first element is sometimes referred to as the zeroth element, in an attempt to avoid confusion.\nScience.\nIn mathematics, many sequences of numbers or of polynomials are indexed by nonnegative integers, for example, the Bernoulli numbers and the Bell numbers.\nIn both mechanics and statistics, the zeroth moment is defined, representing total mass in the case of physical density, or total probability, i.e. one, for a probability distribution.\nThe \"zeroth law of thermodynamics\" was formulated after the first, second, and third laws, but considered more fundamental, thus its name.\nIn biology, an organism is said to have zero-order intentionality if it shows \"no intention of anything at all\". This would include a situation where the organism's genetically predetermined phenotype results in a fitness benefit to itself, because it did not \"intend\" to express its genes. In the similar sense, a computer may be considered from this perspective a zero-order intentional entity, as it does not \"intend\" to express the code of the programs it runs.\nIn biological or medical experiments, the first day of an experiment is often numbered as day 0.\nPatient zero (or index case) is the initial patient in the population sample of an epidemiological investigation.\nOther fields.\nThe year zero does not exist in the widely used Gregorian calendar or in its predecessor, the Julian calendar. Under those systems, the year 1\u00a0BC is followed by AD\u00a01. However, there is a year zero in astronomical year numbering (where it coincides with the Julian year 1\u00a0BC) and in ISO\u00a08601:2004 (where it coincides with the Gregorian year 1\u00a0BC), as well as in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars.\nIn many countries, the ground floor in buildings is considered as floor number\u00a00 rather than as the \"1st\u00a0floor\", the naming convention usually found in the United States of America. This makes a consistent set with underground floors marked with negative numbers.\nWhile the ordinal of 0 mostly finds use in communities directly connected to mathematics, physics, and computer science, there are also instances in classical music. The composer Anton Bruckner regarded his early \"Symphony in D minor\" to be unworthy of including in the canon of his works, and he wrote (\"doesn't count\") on the score and a circle with a crossbar, intending it to mean \"invalid\". But posthumously, this work came to be known as \"Symphony No.\u00a00 in D minor\", even though it was actually written after \"Symphony No.\u00a01 in C minor\". There is an even earlier \"Symphony in F minor\" of Bruckner's, which is sometimes called \"No.\u00a000\". The Russian composer Alfred Schnittke also wrote a Symphony No.\u00a00.\nIn some universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, \"week\u00a00\" or occasionally \"noughth week\" refers to the week before the first week of lectures in a term. In Australia, some universities refer to this as \"O\u00a0week\", which serves as a pun on \"orientation week\". As a parallel, the introductory weeks at university educations in Sweden are generally called (zeroing).\nThe United States Air Force starts basic training each Wednesday, and the first week (of eight) is considered to begin with the following Sunday. The four days before that Sunday are often referred to as \"zero week\".\n24-hour clocks and the international standard ISO\u00a08601 use 0 to denote the first (zeroth) hour of the day, consistent with using the 0 to denote the first (zeroth) minute of the hour and the first (zeroth) second of the minute. Also, the 12-hour clocks used in Japan use 0 to denote the hour immediately after midnight and noon in contrast to 12 used elsewhere, in order to avoid confusion whether 12\u00a0a.m. and 12\u00a0p.m. represent noon or midnight.\nRobert Crumb's drawings for the first issue of \"Zap Comix\" were stolen, so he drew a whole new issue, which was published as issue\u00a01. Later he re-inked his photocopies of the stolen artwork and published it as issue\u00a00.\nThe Brussels ring road in Belgium is numbered R0. It was built after the ring road around Antwerp, but Brussels (being the capital city) was deemed deserving of a more basic number. Similarly the (unfinished) orbital motorway around Budapest in Hungary is called M0.\nZero is sometimes used in street addresses, especially in schemes where even numbers are one side of the street and odd numbers on the other. A case in point is Christ Church on Harvard Square, whose address is 0\u00a0Garden Street.\nFormerly in Formula One, when a defending world champion did not compete in the following season, the number\u00a01 was not assigned to any driver, but one driver of the world champion team would carry the number\u00a00, and the other, number\u00a02. This did happen both in 1993 and 1994 with Damon Hill carrying the number 0 in both seasons, as defending champion Nigel Mansell quit after 1992, and defending champion Alain Prost quit after 1993.

{"id": "34542", "revid": "589223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34542", "title": "Zhang Heng", "text": "Chinese scientist and statesman (78\u2013139)\nZhang Heng (; AD 78\u2013139), courtesy name Pingzi, formerly romanized Chang Heng, was a Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman who lived during the Eastern Han dynasty. Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, seismologist, hydraulic engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, ethnographer, artist, poet, philosopher, politician, and literary scholar.\nZhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure, preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian. His political rivalry with the palace eunuchs during the reign of Emperor Shun (r.\u00a0125\u2013144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of Hejian Kingdom in present-day Hebei. Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138. He died there a year later, in 139.\nZhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first water-powered armillary sphere to assist astronomical observation; improved the inflow water clock by adding another tank; and invented the world's first seismoscope, which discerned the cardinal direction of an earthquake away. He improved previous Chinese calculations for pi. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in his extensive star catalog, Zhang also posited theories about the Moon and its relationship to the Sun: specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the hidden nature of the other, and the nature of solar and lunar eclipses. His \"fu\" (rhapsody) and \"shi\" poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman Ptolemy (AD\u00a086\u2013161).\nLife.\nEarly life.\nBorn in the town of Xi'e in Nanyang Commandery (north of the modern Nanyang City in Henan), Zhang Heng came from a distinguished but not affluent family. His grandfather Zhang Kan () had been governor of a commandery and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the Han by Emperor Guangwu (r.\u00a025\u201357), following the death of the usurping Wang Mang of the Xin (AD\u00a09\u201323). When he was ten, Zhang's father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother.\nAn accomplished writer in his youth, Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. While traveling to Luoyang, Zhang passed by a hot spring near Mount Li and dedicated one of his earliest \"fu\" poems to it. This work, entitled \"\"Fu\" on the Hot Springs\" (\"W\u0113nqu\u00e1n f\u00f9\" \u6eab\u6cc9\u8ce6), describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs, which later became famous as the \"Huaqing Hot Springs\", a favorite retreat of imperial concubine Yang Guifei during the Tang dynasty. After studying for some years at Luoyang's Taixue, he was well-versed in the classics and friends with several notable persons, including the mathematician and calligrapher Cui Yuan (78\u2013143), the official and philosophical commentator Ma Rong (79\u2013166), and the philosopher Wang Fu (78\u2013163). Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices, including a position as one of the Imperial Secretaries, yet he acted modestly and declined.\nAt age 23, Zhang returned home with the title \"Officer of Merit in Nanyang\", serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor Bao De (in office from 103 to 111). As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor, he gained experience in writing official documents. As Officer of Merit in the commandery, he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office. He spent much of his time composing rhapsodies on the capital cities. When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance, Zhang continued his literary work at home in Xi'e. Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of 30 and began publishing his works on astronomy and mathematics.\nOfficial career.\nIn 112, Zhang was summoned to the court of Emperor An (r.\u00a0106\u2013125), who had heard of his expertise in mathematics. When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage\u2014a symbol of his official status\u2014to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the Imperial Secretariat. He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115 to 120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126 to 132. As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of Nine Ministers ranked just below the Three Excellencies. In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the Censorate, both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 characters and all major writing styles. Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving memorials to the throne (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.\nWhen the government official Dan Song proposed the Chinese calendar should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain apocryphal teachings, Zhang opposed the idea. He considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors. Others shared Zhang's opinion and the calendar was not altered, yet Zhang's proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected. The officials Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu, members of a committee to compile the dynastic history (), sought permission from the court to consult Zhang Heng. However, Zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of the Gengshi Emperor's (r.\u00a023\u201325) role in the restoration of the Han dynasty as lesser than Emperor Guangwu's. Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu were Zhang's only historian allies at court, and after their deaths Zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian.\nDespite this setback in his official career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125\u2013144) ascended to the throne. His intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600\u00a0bushels, or \"shi\", of grain (mostly commuted to coin cash or bolts of silk). To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100\u00a0bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000\u00a0bushels during the Han. The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.\nIn 132, Zhang introduced an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant earthquake. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400\u00a0km (248\u00a0mi) to 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.\nA year after Zhang presented his seismoscope to the court, officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven. The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's memorial discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title \"Filial and Incorrupt\" at age forty. The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen. Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant, a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun. With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000\u00a0bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.\nAs Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court eunuchs represented a threat to the imperial court. Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs, and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence. The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang, who responded with a \"fu\" rhapsody called \"\"Fu\" on Pondering the Mystery\", which vents his frustration. Rafe de Crespigny states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to Qu Yuan's (340\u2013278\u00a0BC) poem \"Li Sao\" and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.\nLiterature and poetry.\nWhile working for the central court, Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion. Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the \"Records of the Grand Historian\" by Sima Qian (145\u201390\u00a0BC) and the \"Book of Han\" by Ban Gu (AD\u00a032\u201392) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him. His account was preserved and recorded in the 5th-century text of the \"Book of Later Han\" by Fan Ye (398\u2013445). His rhapsodies and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts, Chinese philosophy, and histories. He also compiled a commentary on the \"Taixuan\" (, \"Great Mystery\") by the Daoist author Yang Xiong (53\u00a0BC\u2013AD\u00a018).\nXiao Tong (501\u2013531), a crown prince of the Liang dynasty (502\u2013557), immortalized several of Zhang's works in his literary anthology \"Selections of Refined Literature\". Zhang's \"fu\" rhapsodies include \"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\" (\"X\u012b j\u012bng f\u00f9\" ), \"Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody\" (\"D\u014dng j\u012bng f\u00f9\" ), \"Southern Capital Rhapsody\" (\"N\u00e1n d\u016b f\u00f9\" ), \"Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery\" (\"S\u012b xu\u00e1n f\u00f9\" ), and \"Return to the Field\". The latter fuses Daoist ideas with Confucianism and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry, according to Liu Wu-chi. A set of four short lyric poems entitled \"Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows\" (\"S\u00ec ch\u00f3u sh\u012b\" ), is also included with Zhang's preface. This set constitutes some of the earliest heptasyllabic \"shi\" Chinese poetry written. While still in Luoyang, Zhang became inspired to write his \"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\" and \"Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody\", which were based on the \"Rhapsody on the Two Capitals\" by the historian Ban Gu. Zhang's work was similar to Ban's, although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous Eastern Han regime while Zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the Western Han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity. These two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes. Zhang's \"Southern Capital Rhapsody\" commemorated his home city of Nanyang, home of the restorer of the Han dynasty, Guangwu.\nIn Zhang Heng's poem \"Four Sorrows\", he laments that he is unable to woo a beautiful woman due to the impediment of mountains, snows and rivers. Scholars Rafe de Crespigny and David R. Knechtges claim that Zhang wrote this as an innuendo hinting at his inability to keep in contact with the emperor, hindered by unworthy rivals and petty men. This poem is one of the first in China to have seven words per line. His \"Four Sorrows\" reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nIn another poem of his called \"Stabilizing the Passions\" (\"D\u00ecng q\u00edng f\u00f9\" \u5b9a\u60c5\u8ce6)\u2014preserved in a Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) encyclopedia, but referred to earlier by Tao Qian (365\u2013427) in praise of Zhang's lyrical minimalism\u2014Zhang displays his admiration for an attractive and exemplary woman. This simpler type of \"fu\" poem influenced later works by the prominent official and scholar Cai Yong (132\u2013192). Zhang wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nZhang's long lyrical poems also revealed a great amount of information on urban layout and basic geography. His rhapsody \"Sir Based-On-Nothing\" provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of Chang'an, the Western Han capital. Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger. Along with Sima Xiangru (179\u2013117\u00a0BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally come from: northern or southern China. Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of along Chang'an's Kunming Lake. The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization. In his poem \"Xijing fu\", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of Buddhism, introduced via the Silk Road, as well as the legend of the birth of Buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception. In his \"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\" (), Zhang described court entertainments such as \"juedi\" (), a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks.\nWith his \"Responding to Criticism\" (\"Ying jian\" ), a work modeled on Yang Xiong's \"Justification Against Ridicule\", Zhang was an early writer and proponent of the Chinese literary genre \"shelun\", or hypothetical discourse. Authors of this genre created a written dialogue between themselves and an imaginary person (or a real person of their entourage or association); the latter poses questions to the author on how to lead a successful life. He also used it as a means to criticize himself for failing to obtain high office, but coming to the conclusion that the true gentleman displays virtue instead of greed for power. In this work, Dominik Declercq asserts that the person urging Zhang to advance his career in a time of government corruption most likely represented the eunuchs or Empress Liang's (116\u2013150) powerful relatives in the Liang clan. Declercq states that these two groups would have been \"anxious to know whether this famous scholar could be lured over to their side\", but Zhang flatly rejected such an alignment by declaring in this politically charged piece of literature that his gentlemanly quest for virtue trumped any desire of his for power.\nZhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls. This was seen as a general criticism of the Eastern Han emperors and their imperial favorites, guised in the criticism of earlier Western Han emperors. Besides criticizing the Western Han emperors for lavish decadence, Zhang also pointed out that their behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the Chinese cyclical beliefs in yin and yang. In a poem criticizing the previous Western Han dynasty, Zhang wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nAchievements in science and technology.\nMathematics.\nFor centuries the Chinese approximated pi as 3; Liu Xin (d. CE\u00a023) made the first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3.154, but there is no record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure. In his work around 130, Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth, proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232, thus calculating pi as 3.1724. In Zhang's day, the ratio 4:3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 42:32. In formula, with D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=formula_1D3; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate, noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio. Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional formula_2D3, hence V=formula_1D3 + formula_2D3 = formula_5D3. With the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is \u221a8:\u221a5. From this formula, Zhang calculated pi as the square root of 10 (or approximately 3.162). In the 3rd\u00a0century, Liu Hui made the calculation more accurate with his \u03c0 algorithm, which allowed him to obtain the value 3.14159. Later, Zu Chongzhi (429\u2013500) approximated pi as formula_6 or 3.141592, the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient Chinese would achieve.\nAstronomy.\nIn his publication of AD\u00a0120 called \"The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe\" (\u9748\u61b2, \"Ling Xian\", lit. \"Sublime Model\"), Zhang Heng theorized that the universe was like an egg \"as round as a crossbow pellet\" with the stars on the shell and the Earth as the central yolk. This universe theory is congruent with the geocentric model as opposed to the heliocentric model. Although the ancient Warring States (403\u2013221 BC) Chinese astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De had compiled China's first star catalogue in the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC, Zhang nonetheless catalogued 2,500 stars which he placed in a \"brightly shining\" category (the Chinese estimated the total to be 14,000), and he recognized 124\u00a0constellations. In comparison, this star catalogue featured many more stars than the 850 documented by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c.\u2009190\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009120\u00a0BC) in his catalogue, and more than Ptolemy (AD\u00a083\u2013161), who catalogued over 1,000. Zhang supported the \"radiating influence\" theory to explain solar and lunar eclipses, a theory which was opposed by Wang Chong (AD\u00a027\u201397). In the \"Ling Xian\", Zhang wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The Sun is like fire and the Moon like water. The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the Moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the Sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark.\nThe planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the Moon owing to the obstruction of the Earth itself\u2014this is called \"\u00e0nx\u016b\", a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) then there is a solar eclipse.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nZhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state. Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies. The music theorist and mathematician Jing Fang (78\u201337\u00a0BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses:\nThe Moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.\nThe theory posited by Zhang and Jing was supported by later pre-modern scientists such as Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095), who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun and Moon were spherical. The theory of the celestial sphere surrounding a flat, square Earth was later criticized by the Jin-dynasty scholar-official Yu Xi (fl. 307\u2013345). He suggested that the Earth could be round like the heavens, a spherical Earth theory fully accepted by mathematician Li Ye (1192\u20131279) but not by mainstream Chinese science until European influence in the 17th century.\nExtra tank for inflow clepsydra.\nThe outflow clepsydra was a timekeeping device used in China as long ago as the Shang dynasty (c.\u00a01600\u2013c.\u00a01050\u00a0BC), and certainly by the Zhou dynasty (1122\u2013256\u00a0BC). The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China since the beginning of the Han dynasty in 202\u00a0BC and had replaced the outflow type. The Han Chinese noted the problem with the falling pressure head in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled. Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right. Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours. Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank, so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year. Zhang mentioned a \"jade dragon's neck\", which in later times meant a siphon. He wrote of the floats and indicator-rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Bronze vessels are made and placed one above the other at different levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening in the form of a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day.\nOn the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWater-powered armillary sphere.\nZhang Heng is the first person known to have applied hydraulic motive power (i.e. by employing a waterwheel and clepsydra) to rotate an armillary sphere, an astronomical instrument representing the celestial sphere. The Greek astronomer Eratosthenes (276\u2013194\u00a0BC) invented the first armillary sphere in 255\u00a0BC. The Chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52\u00a0BC, with the astronomer Geng Shouchang's (\u803f\u58fd\u660c) addition of a permanently fixed equatorial ring. In AD 84 the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring, and finally Zhang Heng added the horizon and meridian rings. This invention is described and attributed to Zhang in quotations by Hsu Chen and Li Shan, referencing his book \"Lou Shui Chuan Hun Thien I Chieh\" (Apparatus for Rotating an Armillary Sphere by Clepsydra Water). It was likely not an actual book by Zhang, but a chapter from his \"Hun I\" or \"Hun I Thu Chu\", written in 117 AD. His water-powered armillary influenced the design of later Chinese water clocks and led to the discovery of the escapement mechanism by the 8th\u00a0century. The historian Joseph Needham (1900\u20131995) states:\nWhat were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725\u00a0) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.\nZhang did not initiate the Chinese tradition of hydraulic engineering, which began during the mid Zhou dynasty (c.\u00a06th\u00a0century\u00a0BC), through the work of engineers such as Sunshu Ao and Ximen Bao. Zhang's contemporary, Du Shi, (d.\u00a0AD\u00a038) was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the bellows of a blast furnace to make pig iron, and the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Zhang provided a valuable description of his water-powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125, stating:\nThe equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.\nZhang Heng's water-powered armillary sphere had profound effects on Chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations. His model and its complex use of gears greatly influenced the water-powered instruments of later astronomers such as Yi Xing (683\u2013727), Zhang Sixun (fl.\u00a010th\u00a0century), Su Song (1020\u20131101), Guo Shoujing (1231\u20131316), and many others. Water-powered armillary spheres in the tradition of Zhang Heng's were used in the eras of the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013280) and Jin dynasty (266\u2013420), yet the design for it was temporarily out of use between 317 and 418, due to invasions of northern Xiongnu nomads. Zhang Heng's old instruments were recovered in 418, when Emperor Wu of Liu Song (r.\u00a0420\u2013422) captured the ancient capital of Chang'an. Although still intact, the graduation marks and the representations of the stars, Moon, Sun, and planets were quite worn down by time and rust. In 436, the emperor ordered Qian Luozhi, the Secretary of the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar, to recreate Zhang's device, which he managed to do successfully. Qian's water-powered celestial globe was still in use at the time of the Liang dynasty (502\u2013557), and successive models of water-powered armillary spheres were designed in subsequent dynasties.\nZhang's seismoscope.\nFrom the earliest times, the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\" of 91\u00a0BC that in 780\u00a0BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the \"Yijing\", in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.\u00a0500\u2013428\u00a0BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460\u2013370\u00a0BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.\u00a0585\u2013c.\u00a0525\u00a0BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384\u2013322\u00a0BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (\"pneuma\") caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.\nDuring the Han dynasty, many learned scholars\u2014including Zhang Heng\u2014believed in the \"oracles of the winds\". These oracles of the occult observed the direction, force, and timing of the winds, to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on Earth. These ideas influenced Zhang Heng's views on the cause of earthquakes.\nIn 132, Zhang Heng presented to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first seismoscope. A seismoscope records the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it does not retain a time record of those motions. It was named \"earthquake weathervane\" ( ), and it was able to roughly determine the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from. According to the \"Book of Later Han\" (compiled by Fan Ye in the 5th\u00a0century), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a swinging pendulum inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away. This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this type of natural disaster. The \"Book of Later Han\" records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern Gansu Province), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.\nTo indicate the direction of a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.\nLater Chinese of subsequent periods were able to reinvent Zhang's seismoscope. They included the 6th-century mathematician and surveyor Xindu Fang of the Northern Qi dynasty (550\u2013577) and the astronomer and mathematician Lin Xiaogong of the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618). Like Zhang, Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong were given imperial patronage for their services in craftsmanship of devices for the court. By the time of the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368), it was acknowledged that all devices previously made were preserved, except for that of the seismoscope. This was discussed by the scholar Zhou Mi around 1290, who remarked that the books of Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong detailing their seismological devices were no longer to be found. Horwitz, Kreitner, and Needham speculate if Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) era seismographs found their way to contemporary Japan; according to Needham, \"instruments of apparently traditional type there in which a pendulum carries pins projecting in many directions and able to pierce a surrounding paper cylinder, have been described.\"\nHong-sen Yan states that modern replicas of Zhang's device have failed to reach the level of accuracy and sensitivity described in Chinese historical records. Wang Zhenduo presented two different models of the seismoscope based on the ancient descriptions of Zhang's device. In his 1936 reconstruction, the central pillar (\"du zhu\") of the device was a suspended pendulum acting as a movement sensor, while the central pillar of his second model in 1963 was an inverted pendulum. According to Needham, while working in the Seismological Observatory of Tokyo University in 1939, Akitsune Imamura and Hagiwara made a reconstruction of Zhang's device. While it was John Milne and Wang Zhenduo who argued early on that Zhang's \"central pillar\" was a suspended pendulum, Imamura was the first to propose an inverted model. He argued that transverse shock would have rendered Wang's immobilization mechanism ineffective, as it would not have prevented further motion that could knock other balls out of their position. On June 13, 2005, modern Chinese seismologists announced that they had successfully created a replica of the instrument.\nAnthony J. Barbieri-Low, a professor of early Chinese history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, names Zhang Heng as one of several high-ranking Eastern-Han officials who engaged in crafts that were traditionally reserved for artisans (\"gong\" \u5de5), such as mechanical engineering. Barbieri-Low speculates that Zhang only designed his seismoscope, but did not actually craft the device himself. He asserts that this would most likely have been the job of artisans commissioned by Zhang. He writes: \"Zhang Heng was an official of moderately high rank and could not be seen sweating in the foundries with the \"gong\" artisans and the government slaves. Most likely, he worked collaboratively with the professional casters and mold makers in the imperial workshops.\"\nCartography.\nThe Wei (220\u2013265) and Jin dynasty (266\u2013420) cartographer and official Pei Xiu (224\u2013271) was the first in China to describe in full the geometric grid reference for maps that allowed for precise measurements using a graduated scale, as well as topographical elevation. However, map-making in China had existed since at least the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC with the Qin state maps found in Gansu in 1986. Pinpointed accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the Qin and Han dynasty, respectively, as evidenced by their existing maps, while the use of a rectangular grid had been known in China since the Han as well. Historian Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of Zhang Heng's work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng. Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography. Needham points out that the title of his book \"Flying Bird Calendar\" may have been a mistake, and that the book is more accurately entitled \"Bird's Eye Map\". Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang's narrative \"Guitian fu\" contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of Confucius of the Zhou dynasty, which Reiter suggests places maps (\"tu\") on a same level of importance with documents (\"shu\"). It is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by Zhang Heng in 116 AD, called a \"Dixingtu\" (\u5730\u5f62\u5716).\nOdometer and south-pointing chariot.\nZhang Heng is often credited to be one of the first inventors of the odometer in the East, an achievement also attributed to Vitruvius (c.\u00a080\u201315\u00a0BC) and Heron of Alexandria (fl.\u00a0AD\u00a010\u201370) in the West. Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd\u00a0century, the Chinese had termed the device the \"jili guche\" (, \"li-recording drum carriage\". (In modern times, 1 li is 500m/1640\u00a0ft, but in the Han period, it was closer to 400m.)\nAncient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han dynasty China that centered on the \"huang men\"\u2014court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal \"drum-chariot\". There is speculation that at some time during the 1st\u00a0century\u00a0BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels. This might have actually been the design of Luoxia Hong (c.\u00a0110\u00a0BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.\nThe south-pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng. It was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot. Differential gears driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The \"Song Shu\" (c.\u00a0AD 500\u00a0) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, Ma Jun (200\u2013265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.\nLegacy.\nScience and technology.\nZhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing. Su Song directly named Zhang's water-powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th-century clock tower. The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar-official Chen Hongmou (1696\u20131771) followed in the tradition of Zhang's book \"Spiritual Constitution of the Universe\". The seismologist John Milne, who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and James A. Ewing at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to seismology. The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to \"make three wheels rotate as if they were one.\" More than one scholar has described Zhang as a polymath. However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories. Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83\u2013161) of Roman Egypt, Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state:\nBased on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.\nHere we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.\nPoetic literature.\nZhang's poetry was widely read during his life and after his death. In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above, the Eastern Wu official Xue Zong (d. 237) wrote commentary on Zhang's poems \"Dongjing fu\" and \"Xijing fu\". The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its \"curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity\", in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet. Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong \"avoided inflated language, aiming chiefly at simplicity\", and adding that their \"compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet, serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature\".\nPosthumous honors.\nZhang was given great honors in life and in death. The philosopher and poet Fu Xuan (217\u2013278) of the Wei and Jin dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the Ministry of Works. Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd-century mechanical engineer Ma Jun, Fu Xuan wrote, \"Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works, and their ingenuity did not benefit the world. When (authorities) employ personnel with no regard to special talent, and having heard of genius neglect even to test it\u2014is this not hateful and disastrous?\"\nIn honor of Zhang's achievements in science and technology, his friend Cui Ziyu (Cui Yuan) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele, which has been preserved in the \"Guwen yuan\". Cui stated, \"[Zhang Heng's] mathematical computations exhausted (the riddles of) the heavens and the earth. His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change. The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods.\" The minor official Xiahou Zhan (243\u2013291) of the Wei dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng's tomb. It read: \"Ever since gentlemen have composed literary texts, none has been as skillful as the Master [Zhang Heng] in choosing his words well\u00a0... if only the dead could rise, oh I could then turn to him for a teacher!\"\nSeveral things have been named after Zhang in modern times, including the lunar crater Chang Heng, the asteroid 1802 Zhang Heng, and the mineral zhanghengite. In 2018, China launched a research satellite called China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES) which is also named Zhangheng-1 (ZH-1).\nReferences.\nCitation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There was a revolution in social norms, including religion, morality, law and order, clothing, music, drugs, dress, sexuality, formalities, civil rights, precepts of military duty, and schooling. Some people denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess, flamboyance, the decay of social order, and the fall or relaxation of social taboos. A wide range of music emerged, from popular music inspired by and including the Beatles (in the United States known as the British Invasion) to the folk music revival, including the poetic lyrics of Bob Dylan. In the United States the Sixties were also called the \"cultural decade\" while in the United Kingdom (especially London) it was called the Swinging Sixties.\nThe United States had four presidents that served during the decade: Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. Eisenhower was near the end of his term and left office in January 1961, and Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Kennedy had wanted Keynesian and staunch anti-communist social reforms. These were passed under Johnson including civil rights for African Americans and health care for the elderly and the poor. Despite his large-scale Great Society programs, Johnson was increasingly disliked by the New Left at home and abroad. For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called new social movements.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro, the United States attempted to depose the new leader by training Cuban exiles and invading the island of Cuba. This led to Cuba to ally itself to the Soviet Union, a hostile enemy to the United States, resulting in an international crisis when Cuba hosted Soviet ballistic missiles similar to Turkey hosting American missiles, which brought the possibility of causing World War III. However, after negotiations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R, both agreed to withdraw their weapons averting potential nuclear warfare.\nAfter U.S. president Kennedy's assassination, direct tensions between the superpower countries of the United States and the Soviet Union developed into a contest with proxy wars, insurgency funding, puppet governments and other overall influence mainly in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This \"Cold War\" dominated the world's geopolitics during the decade. Construction of the Berlin Wall by East Germany began in 1961. Africa was in a period of radical political change as 42 countries gained independence from their European colonial rulers, including 22 countries became independent from the French colonial empire, 12 from the British Empire, 5 from Portugal and 3 from Belgium. The heavy-handed American role in the Vietnam War lead to an anti-Vietnam War movement with outraged student protestors around the globe culminating in the protests of 1968.\nChina saw the end of Mao's Great Leap Forward in 1962 that led to many Chinese to die from the deadliest famine in human history and the start of the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. Its stated goal was to preserve Chinese communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, leading to the arrests of many Chinese politicians, the killings of millions of civilians and ethnic minorities, and the destruction of many historical and cultural buildings, artifacts and materials all of which would last until the death of Mao Zedong.\nBy the end of the 1950s, post-war reconstructed Europe began an economic boom. World War II had closed up social classes with remnants of the old feudal gentry disappearing. A developing upper-working-class (a newly redefined middle-class) in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator and motor vehicles. The Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade; overall, the worldwide economy prospered in the 1960s with expansion of the middle class and the increase of new domestic technology.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Labour Party gained power in 1964 with Harold Wilson as prime minister through most of the decade. In France, the protests of 1968 led to President Charles de Gaulle temporarily fleeing the country. Italy formed its first left-of-center government in March 1962 with Aldo Moro becoming prime minister in 1963. Soviet leaders during the decade were Nikita Khrushchev until 1964 and Leonid Brezhnev.\nDuring the 1960s, the world population increased from 3.0 to 3.7\u00a0billion people. There were approximately 1.15\u00a0billion births and 500 million deaths.\nPolitics and wars.\nCoups.\nProminent coups d'\u00e9tat of the decade included:\nEconomics.\nThe United States.\nDuring the 1960s the United States was in the postwar economic boom. The 1960s are remembered as a time period of rapid workforce growth (roughly 33% between February 1961 and December 1969), tax cuts, low unemployment, rapid GDP growth, gains in productivity and generally low inflation. After the Recession of 1960\u20131961 the United States experienced sustained rapid economic growth which began in February 1961 and ended with the Recession of 1969\u20131970. It lasted a total of 106 months, which made it the longest recorded economic expansion in the history of the United States until the 1990s United States boom.\nOn January 20, 1961, John F. Kennedy became the president of the United States. In his campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to \"get America moving again.\" His goal was economic growth of 4\u20136% per year and unemployment below 4%.To do this, he proposed a wide range of policies which embraced Keynesian economics (which he is the first president to do so). Among these policies included a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment, Income tax cuts and an increase in the federal minimum wage.\nIn contrast however, the government routinely produced fiscal deficits (as a result of the tax cuts and increased expenditure embarked under Kennedy), with only one surplus during this time period (as opposed to the 1950s which produced 3). Furthermore, by 1966 inflation began to climb, which is a general trend that continued into the 1970s. By the end of the decade under Nixon, the combined inflation and unemployment rate known as the misery index (economics) had exploded to nearly 10% with inflation at 6.2% and unemployment at 3.5% and by 1975 the misery index was almost 20%. By the end of the decade, median family income had risen from $8,540 in 1963 to $10,770 by 1969.\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nDisasters.\nNatural:\nNon-natural:\nSocial and political movements.\nCounterculture and social revolution.\nIn the second half of the decade, young people began to revolt against the conservative norms of the old time, as well as remove themselves from mainstream liberalism, in particular the high level of materialism which was so common during the era. This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as hippies. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the sexual revolution, questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The Underground Press, a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including LSD and marijuana) and psychedelic music.\nAnti-war movement.\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the Vietnam War, including the National Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam's 1967 march to the United Nations and its March on the Pentagon, the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests at which the slogan \"The whole world is watching\" became famous, and continuing in the massive Moratorium protests in 1969 as well as the movement of resistance to conscription (\"the Draft\") for the war.\nThe antiwar movement was initially based on the older 1950s Peace movement, heavily influenced by the American Communist Party, but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"sit-in\". Other terms heard in the United States included \"the Draft\", \"draft dodger\", \"conscientious objector\", and \"Vietnam vet\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\nCivil rights movement.\n \nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African Americans in the United States organized a movement to end legalized racial discrimination and obtain voting rights. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, economic and political self-sufficiency, and anti-imperialism.\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of civil resistance. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of civil disobedience and nonviolent protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott (1955\u20131956) in Alabama, sit-ins such as the influential Greensboro sit-ins (1960) in North Carolina, marches such as the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama, and other nonviolent activities.\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that restored and protected voting rights, the Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\nHispanic and Chicano movement.\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the Mexican-Americans, are among other Hispanics in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations were in the Southwestern United States, such as California with over 1 million \"Chicanos\" in Los Angeles alone, and Texas where Jim Crow laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\nSocially, the Chicano Movement addressed what it perceived to be negative ethnic stereotypes of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official bilingualism in federal and state governments.\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens, was formed in 1929 and remains active today.\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the American G.I. Forum, which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 \"Mendez v. Westminster\" U.S. Supreme Court ruling which declared that segregating children of \"Mexican and Latin descent\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 \"Hernandez v. Texas\" ruling which declared that Mexican Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nThe most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), was founded in 1968. Although modeled after the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\nMeanwhile, Puerto Ricans in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality and socioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states. The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Hispanic-American culture experienced a resurgence as ethnic music, food, and traditions became increasingly popular and were incorporated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations, and newspapers expanded across the United States, particularly in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns, East Coast cities such as New York City, and in Miami, Florida, which saw significant growth in its Cuban American community.\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture. A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\nSecond-wave feminism.\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning \"de jure\" inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and \"de facto\" inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a Presidential Commission on the Status of Women found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title IX, etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with Betty Friedan's book, \"The Feminine Mystique\", the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the National Organization for Women. In 1968, \"Women's Liberation\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the civil rights movement when New York Radical Women, led by Robin Morgan, protested the annual Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The movement continued throughout the next decades. Gloria Steinem was a key feminist.\nGay rights movement.\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement. These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that \"gay men and women are no different from those who are straight\" and deserve full equality. This philosophy would be dominant again after AIDS, but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging gay pride.\nThe symbolic birth of the gay rights movement would not come until the decade had almost come to a close. Gays were not allowed by law to congregate. Gay establishments such as the Stonewall Inn in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people. On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets. This uprising called the Stonewall riots began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\nNew Left.\nThe rapid rise of a \"New Left\" applied the class perspective of Marxism to postwar America but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the Communist Party, and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of C. Wright Mills, the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based Trotskyist, Maoist and anarchist groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to militancy.\nCrime.\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidence of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s. Large riots broke out in many cities like Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, Oakland, California and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like George Wallace and Richard Nixon campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\nScience and technology.\nScience.\nSpace exploration.\nThe Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into outer space during the Vostok 1 mission on 12 April 1961, and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\nIn June 1963, Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space during the Vostok 6 mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the Solar System (Venus), Venera 3, and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, Luna 9. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched Luna 10, which became the first space probe to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September 1968, Zond 5 flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\nThe deaths of astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee in the Apollo 1 fire on 27 January 1967, put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the Apollo 8 crew (Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, William Anders) being the first crewed mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\nOn 20 July 1969, the first humans landed on the Moon. The Apollo 11 mission, launched on 16 July 1969, carried mission Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Aldrin and Armstrong flew the Lunar Module \"Eagle\" to the lunar surface. Apollo 11 fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer Sergey Korolyov in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon. Shortly after the American Apollo 1 disaster, tragedy struck the Soviet program when cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed when the parachutes on his Soyuz 1 flight failed.\nA succession of uncrewed American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, Venus, and Mars during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\nTechnology.\nAutomobiles and Motorcycles.\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with muscle cars sold by most makes. The compact Ford Mustang, launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"Big Three\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of Studebaker in 1966 left American Motors Corporation as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included compact and mid-sized cars in addition to full-sized ones.\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the Renault 16, many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The Mini, released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the Toyota Corolla, Datsun 510, and the first popular Japanese sports car, the Datsun 240Z, were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\nMopeds and Scooters gains popularity in these decade, with Honda Super Cub in United States, Japan and Europe, Mitsubishi Silver Pigeon in Japan and Vespa, Kreidler Florett, Zundapp and Sachs mopeds in Western Europe.\nPopular culture.\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the Summer of Love in San Francisco in 1967, and the Woodstock Festival in upstate New York in 1969. Psychedelic drugs, especially LSD, were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by Timothy Leary with his slogan \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". Psychedelic influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see 27 Club). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\nMusic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"The 60s were a leap in human consciousness. Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Che Guevara, Mother Teresa, they led a revolution of conscience. The Beatles, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix created revolution and evolution themes. The music was like Dal\u00ed, with many colors and revolutionary ways. The youth of today must go there to find themselves.\"\n \u2013 Carlos Santana\nThe rock 'n' roll movement of the 1950s quickly came to an end in 1959 with the Day the Music Died (as explained in the song \"American Pie\"), the scandal of Jerry Lee Lewis' marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, and the induction of Elvis Presley into the United States Army. As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by girl groups, surf music, novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and Motown music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the American folk music revival which introduced Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, The Kingston Trio, Harry Belafonte, Odetta, Phil Ochs, and many other singer-songwriters to the public.\nGirl groups and female singers, such as the Shirelles, Betty Everett, Little Eva, the Dixie Cups, the Ronettes, Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were African-American, but white girl groups and singers, such as Lesley Gore, the Angels, and the Shangri-Las also emerged during this period.\nAround the same time, record producer Phil Spector began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the Wall of Sound. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\nAlso during the early 1960s, surf rock emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. The Beach Boys quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\nThe car song also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 1960s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with car culture. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo Jan and Dean. Such notable songs include \"Little Deuce Coupe\", \"409\", and \"Shut Down\", all by the Beach Boys; Jan and Dean's \"Little Old Lady from Pasadena\" and \"Drag City\", Ronny and the Daytonas' \"Little GTO\", and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the teen tragedy song, which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in traffic accidents. Such songs included Mark Dinning's \"Teen Angel\", Ray Peterson's \"Tell Laura I Love Her\", Jan and Dean's \"Dead Man's Curve\", the Shangri-Las' \"Leader of the Pack\", and perhaps the subgenre's most popular, \"Last Kiss\" by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers.\nIn the early 1960s, Britain became a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour and cult singer Dusty Springfield released her first solo single. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father Chuck Berry emerged from a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager Brian Epstein encouraged the group to wear suits. Beatlemania abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album \"Rubber Soul\" which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Kinks who would become legends in their own right.\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist Jimi Hendrix emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album-oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\nJazz music and pop standards during the first half of the 1960s was largely a continuation of 1950s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as John Coltrane and Nat King Cole precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late 1960s largely spelled the end of jazz and standards as mainstream forms of music, after they had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\nCountry music gained popularity on the West Coast, due in large part to the Bakersfield sound, led by Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in previous decades), with such acts as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, and Tammy Wynette.\nLate 1960s also was the beginning of disco music, which became more popular in 1970s.\nFilm.\nThe highest-grossing film of the decade was 20th Century Fox's \"The Sound of Music\" (1965).\nSome of Hollywood's most notable blockbuster films of the 1960s include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe counterculture movement had a significant effect on cinema. Movies began to break social taboos such as sex and violence causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the New Hollywood era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. Dennis Hopper's \"Easy Rider\" (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as Roger Vadim's\" Barbarella\" (1968), as the counterculture progressed.\nIn Europe, art cinema gained wider distribution and saw movements like la Nouvelle Vague (The French New Wave), which featured French filmmakers such as Roger Vadim, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Alain Resnais, and Jean-Luc Godard; the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary movement took place in Canada, France and the United States; Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, Chilean filmmaker Alexandro Jodorowsky and Polish filmmakers Roman Polanski and Wojciech Jerzy Has produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of Italian filmmaking with Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: \"La Dolce Vita\", \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;8+1\u20442\"; \"La Notte\"; \"L'Eclisse\", \"The Red Desert\"; \"Blowup\"; \"Fellini Satyricon\"; \"Accattone\"; \"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\"; \"Theorem\"; \"Winter Light\"; \"The Silence\"; \"Persona\"; \"Shame\"; \"A Passion\"; \"Au hasard Balthazar\"; \"Mouchette\"; \"Last Year at Marienbad\"; \"Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9\"; \"Titicut Follies\"; \"High School\"; \"Salesman\"; \"La jet\u00e9e\"; \"Warrendale;\" \"Knife in the Water\"; \"Repulsion\"; \"The Saragossa Manuscript\"; \"El Topo\"; \"A Hard Day's Night\"; and the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \"Dont Look Back\".\nIn Japan, \"\" a film version of the story of the forty-seven \"r\u014dnin\" directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, was released in 1962; the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning Japanese director Akira Kurosawa produced \"Yojimbo\" (1961) and \"Sanjuro\" (1962), which both starred Toshiro Mifune as a mysterious samurai swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The \"Spaghetti Western\" genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in Sergio Leone's \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) starring Clint Eastwood and Walter Hill's \"Last Man Standing\" (1996). \"Yojimbo\" was also the origin of the \"Man with No Name\" trend which included Sergio Leone's \"For a Few Dollars More\", and \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", starring Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, and Jason Robards. \"The Magnificent Seven\" a 1960 American western film directed by John Sturges was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film, \"Seven Samurai\". Another popular figure in this genre was John Wayne, with films from the 60s such as \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962), \"El Dorado\" (1966), \"True Grit\" (1969) and others.\nThe decade also marked the start of the \"James Bond\" film series, starting with \"Dr. No\" with Sean Connery as James Bond, and has continued with latest installments and actors portraying 007 to this very day.\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of lightweight and affordable cameras, the underground avant-garde film movement thrived. The movement's notable figures include Canada's Michael Snow and Americans Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith. Notable films in this genre include \"Dog Star Man\", \"Scorpio Rising\", \"Wavelength\", \"Chelsea Girls\", \"Blow Job\", \"Vinyl\", and \"Flaming Creatures\".\nWalt Disney, the founder of The Walt Disney Company, died on 15 December 1966 from a major tumor in his left lung. Alongside \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\", \"The Sword in the Stone\" and \"The Jungle Book\" (some of his most important blockbusters), animated feature films of the decade that are of notable status include \"Gay Purr-ee\", \"Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!\", \"The Man Called Flintstone\", \"Mad Monster Party?\", \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\".\nTelevision.\nThe most prominent TV series of the 1960s include \"Doctor Who\", \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"Coronation Street\", ', \"Peyton Place\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"The Outer Limits\", \"The Andy Williams Show\", \"The Dean Martin Show\", \"The Wonderful World of Disney\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Bonanza\", \"Batman\", \"McHale's Navy\", \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\", \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", \"The Fugitive\", \"The Tonight Show\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Gilligan's Island\", ', \"The Flintstones\", \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", \"Thunderbirds\", \"Lassie\", \"The Danny Thomas Show\", \"The Lucy Show\", \"My Three Sons\", \"The Red Skelton Show\", \"Bewitched\", and \"I Dream of Jeannie\". \"The Flintstones\" was a popular show, receiving 40 million views an episode with an average of 3\u00a0million views a day. \"Doctor Who\" is the longest-running science-fiction show of all time according to the \"Guinness World Records\". Some programming (such as \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\") became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls, making fun of world leaders and questioning U.S. involvement in (as well as escalation of) the Vietnam War. The 1966 FIFA World Cup final was the most-watched television event in the United Kingdom watched by 32.3 million people, seeing England win 4\u20132 against Germany.\nFashion.\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\nLiterature.\nMarvel Comics dominated the comic book industry in this decade, introducing the world to characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and the Avengers to name a few.\nSports.\nThe first ever Super bowl had happened in 1967 in Los Angeles, California\nOlympics.\nThere were six Olympic Games held during the decade. These were:\nAssociation football.\nThere were two FIFA World Cups during the decade:\nThe 1960 Copa de Campeones de Am\u00e9rica was the first season of the Copa CONMEBOL Libertadores, CONMEBOL's premier club tournament.\nBaseball.\nThe first wave of Major League Baseball expansion in 1961 included the formation of the Los Angeles Angels, the move to Minnesota to become the Minnesota Twins by the former Washington Senators and the formation of a new franchise called the Washington Senators. Major League Baseball sanctioned both the Houston Colt .45s and the New York Mets as new National League franchises in 1962.\nIn 1969, the American League expanded when the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots, were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the League Championship Series) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres. By 1969, the New York Mets won the World Series in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\nBasketball.\nThe NBA tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the Boston Celtics, who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as Bob Cousy, Bill Russell and John Havlicek. Other notable NBA players included Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Oscar Robertson.\nAt the NCAA level, the UCLA Bruins also proved dominant. Coached by John Wooden, they were helped by Lew Alcindor and by Bill Walton to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\nDisc sports (Frisbee).\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the counterculture. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a Frisbee. Starting with promotional efforts from Wham-O and Irwin Toy (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using Frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, disc ultimate and disc golf became this sports first events. Two sports, the team sport of disc ultimate and disc golf are very popular worldwide and are now being played semiprofessionally. The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide. Major League Ultimate (MLU) and the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) are the first semi-professional ultimate leagues.\nRacing.\nIn motorsports, the Can-Am and Trans-Am series were both established in 1966. The Ford GT40 won outright in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Graham Hill edged out Jackie Stewart and Denny Hulme for the World Championship in Formula One.\nPeople.\nActivists.\nSome activist leaders of the 1960s period include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nScientists and engineers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors and entertainers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmmakers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians and singers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWriters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports figures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\nTimelines.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\n1960 \u2022 1961 \u2022 1962 \u2022 1963 \u2022 1964 \u2022 1965 \u2022 1966 \u2022 1967 \u2022 1968 \u2022 1969 \u2022 Timeline of 1960s counterculture\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the Gregorian calendar, these distinctions fall to the year 2001, because the 1st century was retroactively said to start with the year AD 1. Since the Gregorian calendar does not have year zero, its first millennium spanned from years 1 to 1000 inclusively and its second millennium from years 1001 to 2000. (For further information, see century and millennium.)\nThe year 2000 is sometimes abbreviated as \"Y2K\" (the \"Y\" stands for \"year\", and the \"K\" stands for \"kilo\" which means \"thousand\"). The year 2000 was the subject of Y2K concerns, which were fears that computers would not shift from 1999 to 2000 correctly. However, by the end of 1999, many companies had already converted to new, or upgraded existing, software. Some even obtained \"Y2K certification\". As a result of massive effort, relatively few problems occurred.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The United States led a multi-national coalition in an invasion of Afghanistan after the Taliban government was unable to extradite Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden within 24 hours. Other international conflicts in 2001 were the standoff between India and Pakistan as well as the Second Intifada between Israel and Palestine. Internal conflicts began in Macedonia, in the Central African Republic, and in Guinea. Political challenges or violent conflicts caused changes in leadership in Argentina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines.\n2001 was the second hottest year on record at the time, which was amplified by the end of a years-long La Ni\u00f1a phase. The Atlantic and Pacific tropical storm seasons were both more active than usual. The deadly Bhuj Earthquake took place in Gujarat on January 26, while the strongest earthquake in 36 years took place in Peru on June 23. A potential health crisis occurred when a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease spread among British livestock, bringing about the deaths of millions of animals. Four hominid species were described or proposed, and several major archaeological finds took place, including a set of terracotta citizens near the Terracotta Army. The pygmy three-toed sloth was also first described in 2001. The year had the fewest successful orbital spaceflights since 1963, with eight crewed missions. Successes in space exploration included the landing of \"NEAR Shoemaker\" on an asteroid and the arrival of \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" on Mars.\nPolitics and religion in the final months of 2001 focused intently on the Muslim world and Islamic terrorism after the September 11 attacks. The Catholic Church was active in 2001, as Pope John Paul II went on several goodwill trips to meet with non-Catholic religious groups and investigations of sexual abuse cases among the church's priests began. Former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was arrested and became the first head of state to be charged with crimes against humanity by an international body. The 27th G8 summit took place in Genoa and was met by 200,000 protestors, where one was killed. 2001 took place during a minor recession among developed and developing nations, with only middle income nations avoiding an economic downturn. The recession saw economic crises take place in Argentina and in Turkey. American energy company Enron and the European airlines Sabena and Swissair all ended operations in 2001. In popular culture, the \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" film franchises were launched, the iPod and iTunes were invented for music, and three major sixth-generation video game systems became available. The Mac OS X and Windows XP were launched, as was the Wikipedia project. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPopulation.\nThe world population on January 1, 2001, was estimated to be 6.190\u00a0billion people and increased to 6.272\u00a0billion people by January 1, 2002. An estimated 133.9\u00a0million births and 52.1\u00a0million deaths took place in 2001. The average global life expectancy was 66.8 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2000. There were approximately 12\u00a0million global refugees in 2001. 500,000 were settled over the course of the year, but about the same number of people were displaced in other locations, causing the number of refugees to remain largely unchanged. The largest sources of refugees were from Afghanistan and Macedonia. The number of internally displaced persons decreased from 21.8\u00a0million to 19.8\u00a0million in 2001, with the most affected areas being Afghanistan, Colombia, and Liberia.\nConflicts.\nThere were 34 conflicts that resulted in at least 25 fatalities in 2001. Ten resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Afghan Civil War, the invasion of Afghanistan, the Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, the Burundian Civil War, the Colombian conflict, the Second Chechen War in Russia, the Rwandan insurgency during the Second Congo War, Eelam War III in Sri Lanka, and the Second Sudanese Civil War. The majority of conflicts took place in Africa and Asia: 14 occurred in Africa and 13 occurred in Asia. Four new armed conflicts emerged in 2001: the insurgency in Macedonia, the attempted coup in the Central African Republic, the United States invasion of Afghanistan, and the entry of Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front into the RFDG Insurgency in Guinea. The Sierra Leone Civil War was the only conflict that ended in 2001.21\nInternal conflicts.\n DRC President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila (left) was assassinated on January 16. Burundi President Pierre Buyoya (top) and CAR President Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 both faced coup attempts.The Second Congo War continued with the assassination of President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila on January 16.29 The 1999 ceasefire was mostly respected by the government and the various rebel groups, and United Nations ceasefire monitors established a presence throughout the year.30 The Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, and the Burundian Civil War all saw continued fighting between governments and rebels in Africa. The latter began the peace process through a provisional government on November 1.27 The Second Sudanese Civil War between the ruling National Islamic Front and various other groups escalated in 2001.37 This included a sub-conflict, the War of the Peters, which continued into 2001 until a ceasefire was negotiated in August.\nTwo failed coup attempts took place in 2001: a group of junior officers sought to overthrow President Pierre Buyoya in Burundi while he was out of the country on April 18,218 and Andr\u00e9 Kolingba, a former president of the Central African Republic, led a military coup against his successor Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 on May 28, causing several days of violence.249\nSeveral conflicts continued in Indonesia, though the insurgency in Aceh between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement was the only one to see widespread violence in 2001, as the war significantly escalated after the end of a ceasefire and breakdown of peace talks. The New People's Army rebellion saw two ceasefires between the Philippine government and the New People's Army, separated by a brief surge of heavy fighting after the assassination of a member of parliament. A ceasefire was also established with the nation's other insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.49 In Myanmar, the Karen conflict continued, and the insurgency of the Shan State resumed hostilities after a temporary peace in 1999. The Tamil Tigers declared a ceasefire and requested peace talks during the Eelam War III in Sri Lanka,50 but hostilities resumed on April 25, and the Tamil Tigers launched several suicide attacks in July, including the Bandaranaike Airport attack.51 The Nepalese Civil War also saw increased hostilities in 2001.\nThe only major conflict in Europe was the Second Chechen War between the Russian government and the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian forces controlled the republic's population centers, but Chechen forces continued to use guerrilla warfare.53 Macedonia saw a smaller scale conflict between the Macedonian government and the National Liberation Army (NLA), which sought reform for the status of Albanian people in Macedonia. The deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces to Macedonia was authorized on August 21. Yugoslavia similarly saw an insurgency by Albanian rebels, but the conflict did not escalate.53 The only major conflict in South America was the Colombian conflict between the Colombian government and various far-left and far-right groups.58 The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia expanded into Ecuador in 2001 and carried out attacks on Ecuadorian citizens.60\nInternational conflicts.\nThe 2001\u20132002 India\u2013Pakistan standoff was the only conflict between two national governments in 2001. The territorial dispute over the region of Kashmir consisted primarily of small scale attacks by militant groups until two attacks on Indian legislature buildings: one in October and one in December. The latter provoked a major escalation of troop deployments with preparations for a major war.46\nThe Second Intifada continued from the previous year between Israel and Palestine.55 The conflict escalated into an undeclared war in which Palestinian militants targeted Israeli civilians with weapons and suicide bombers with the Israeli military responding with fighter jets and missile strikes against Palestinians.279 Every ceasefire ended within a day of its establishment.56\nSeptember 11 attacks and invasion of Afghanistan.\nThe September 11 attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda when 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes and crashed two of them into the World Trade Center, one into the Pentagon, and one near Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania. 2,977 people were killed; the attacks and the subsequent global war on terror are widely recognized as events that defined 2001.18 This was internationally recognized as an armed attack against the United States under the UN charter, and NATO invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty for the first time in its history.491\nThe Afghan Civil War between the \"de jure\" Northern Alliance government and the \"de facto\" Taliban government continued from previous years.39 When the Taliban refused to extradite Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the United States led a multi-national coalition in an invasion of Afghanistan on 7 October.41 The American-led coalition and the Northern Alliance captured Afghan cities until the Taliban surrendered to the Northern Alliance in Kandahar on December 6.42 The American-led coalition attacked the Al-Qaeda headquarters in Tora Bora in December, but Al-Qaeda's leadership had gone into hiding. An interim government of Afghanistan led by\u00a0Hamid Karzai was formed on December 22.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nNew buildings constructed or opened in 2001 include the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria,163 the Sendai Mediatheque in Sendai, the DG Bank building in Berlin, and Aurora Place in Sydney.164 Museums that opened in 2001 include the Jewish Museum Berlin designed by Daniel Libeskind, the National Museum of Australia designed by Howard Raggatt in Canberra, the Changi Chapel and Museum in Singapore, the Neue Galerie New York, and the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg.233\nProminent renovations made in 2001 include the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court in the British Museum163 and the entrance wing of the Milwaukee Art Museum.164 Preservation efforts were also completed on the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and it reopened to the public on December 15 after 12 years of reconstruction. Damaged and destroyed buildings included the World Trade Center buildings which were destroyed in the September 11 attacks,527 and the Biblioteca Gallardo in El Salvador, which was destroyed in an earthquake.232\nArt.\nThe 49th Venice Biennale shifted from traditional paintings and sculptures, giving an increased focus to film and architectural sculpture.525167 \"Avant-garde\" works of art sold well, with the highest earning being Gerhard Richter's painting of candles, which sold for US$5.4 million.525 A decline in the fashion industry was exacerbated by the September 11 attacks; styles with military or otherwise violent iconography were phased out.\nImprovements in inkjet printing made high resolution photography more practical. Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto exhibited his photographs of wax statues of historical figures to provoke questions about the nature of artistic depiction.171 Several iconic works of photojournalism were produced during the September 11 attacks, including \"The Falling Man\" and \"Raising the Flag at Ground Zero\". Fritz Koenig's \"Sphere\" was the only artwork to be recovered from the site, and the sculpture continued to be displayed in its damaged form as a memorial.\nThe most popular exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City was artwork depicting Jacqueline Kennedy's time as first lady of the United States, followed an exhibition of works by Johannes Vermeer and the Delft School. Both exhibitions were seen by over 500,000 visitors.525 New art galleries and museums opened in Tokyo, Vienna and New York.\nMedia.\nThe highest-grossing films in 2001 were \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"\", \"Shrek\" and \"Monsters, Inc.\" The highest-grossing non-English-language film was Studio Ghibli's \"Spirited Away\" (Japanese), the 15th highest-grossing film of the year. The inaugural entries in the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" film franchises brought fantasy into mainstream culture, popularizing young adult novels and catering to fandom communities.\nIn music, 3.2\u00a0billion units were sold with a value of US$33.7\u00a0billion. DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD rose to prominence, with approximately 600 titles available in these formats. Portable music grew in popularity after Apple released the iTunes media library on January 9 and the first iPod music player device on October 23. The music sharing program Napster ended its services after it was accused of facilitating music piracy, but it was replaced by other programs such as FastTrack.177 Worldwide, the best-selling albums were \"Hybrid Theory\" (2000) by Linkin Park, \"No Angel\" (1999) by Dido, and \"Survivor\" (2001) by Destiny's Child. The best-selling non-English album was \"Cieli di Toscana\" (transl.\u2009\"Tuscan Skies\"; 2001) by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, which topped the charts in the Netherlands and Sweden and was the 23rd best-selling album globally.\nThree major video game systems were released in 2001: the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo and the Xbox by Microsoft. Meanwhile, Sega ended its involvement in the market after the failure of the Dreamcast.181 The year 2001 is considered important in the video game industry, partly because of the release of many games recognized as classics. Many video games released in 2001 defined or redefined their respective genres, including hack and slash game \"Devil May Cry\", first-person shooter game \"\", and open world action-adventure game \"Grand Theft Auto III\", which is regarded as an industry-defining work.\nSports.\nMany sports events were postponed in the final months of 2001 after the September 11 attacks, particularly in the United States. Other sports were postponed in the United Kingdom and Ireland because of foot-and-mouth disease. Throughout the year, Salt Lake City, Utah, prepared for the 2002 Winter Olympics, while Beijing was announced as the host of the 2008 Summer Olympics.316\nQualifications for the 2002 FIFA World Cup were the main football events in 2001.534 The world record for largest victory in an international football match was set by Australia in a 0\u201322 victory against Tonga on April 9. Australia set this record again with a 31\u20130 victory against American Samoa on April 11. The unbalanced nature of these matches prompted changes to the FIFA qualification process. In Europe, the UEFA Women's Cup began its first season, establishing a continent-wide women's competition for association football clubs under UEFA.\nAmerican tennis players Jennifer Capriati and Venus Williams shared the four Grand Slam tournaments,316 whilst France won the Davis Cup for the 9th time. NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, described as the greatest driver in the sport's history, died in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500 on February 18.316 In April, golf player Tiger Woods became the only player to achieve a \"Tiger Slam\" after winning the 2001 Masters Tournament, in which he consecutively won all four championship golf titles outside of a single calendar year. The \"Thunder in Africa\" boxing match ended in a major upset after Hasim Rahman defeated champion Lennox Lewis on April 22. Lewis would go on to win a rematch on November 11.536 In cricket, Australia's record-setting streak of sixteen Test victories in a row was broken by India.537\nEconomy.\nA minor economic decline took place among many developed economies in 2001. It was amplified by the dot-com crash, in which dot-com companies went out of business every day for much of the year due to an overvaluation of the tech industry. Further economic disruption occurred in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. These factors gave the first major demonstration of globalization causing mutual downturn across nations rather than the more typical mutual growth.7 Global growth in 2001 was the lowest in a decade, though middle income countries such as those in Eastern Europe were able to sustain growth despite the global downturn.30 Unemployment and deflation became concerns across developed nations.3 The year also marked a decline in international trade by about 1.5%, which contrasted with the 11% increase in 2000. This was the first negative change in international trade since 1982. IT industries and the dot-com crash are attributed for the decline in trade.\nEconomic crises took place in Argentina and in Turkey.16 The recession in Argentina negatively affected the economy throughout Latin America,37 and the years-long economic crisis reached its peak in December, causing widespread social unrest and the resignation of the President of Argentina.16 America Online (AOL), a U.S.\u00a0online service provider, was at the apex of its popularity and purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner. The deal was announced on January 10, in the largest merger in history at that time. AOL would rapidly shrink thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband, and the deal would fall apart before the end of the decade, which would be regarded as one of the world's greatest business failures.\nMajor businesses that ended operations in 2001 included the American energy company Enron and the national airlines of Belgium and Switzerland (Sabena and Swissair, respectively).189 The Enron scandal took place in October 2001 when, Enron was found to be committing fraud, bringing about the criminal conviction of several executives and causing the company to undergo the largest bankruptcy at that point in U.S. history. E-commerce declined in 2001, with the exception of eBay, which saw significant growth.178\nEnvironment and weather.\n2001 was the second hottest year on record at the time, exceeded only by 1998. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Third Assessment Report on July 12.213 It warned that climate change in the 21st century could cause decreases in crop yields and an increase in temperature-related ailments and deaths. Droughts occurred in Australia, Central America, Kenya, and the Middle East, the latter continuing from years prior. Hungary, Russia and Southeast Asia experienced significant rains, causing flooding. North Asia underwent a severe winter. La Ni\u00f1a, which had been ongoing since 1998, ended in the east Atlantic by April 2001.186\nThe Kyoto Protocol was weakened in March when President George W. Bush determined that the United States would relinquish its commitments to the agreement, but an effort to maintain the agreement in Europe was led by Germany. There was an environmental scare in Europe during an investigation into depleted uranium from the Kosovo War, but it was shown to pose no threat.485 The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which restricted several organic pollutants, was signed on May 22 and 23.491\nThere were four earthquakes in 2001 that caused significant casualties. El Salvador was struck by two of them: a 7.6-magnitude earthquake on January 13 and a 6.6-magnitude earthquake on February 13, which resulted in the deaths of at least 944 and 315 people respectively. The Bhuj earthquake, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Gujarat, India, on January 26 killed between 13,805 and 20,023 people, and destroyed nearly 340,000 buildings. An 8.4-magnitude earthquake, then the strongest that had occurred globally since 1965, killed at least 77 people in Peru on June 23. A 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck China with an epicenter near Kokoxili, close to the border between Qinghai and Xinjiang, on November 14, but it occurred in a sparsely populated mountainous region and there were no casualties. Sicily saw the eruption of Mount Etna, beginning on July 17 and continuing into the next month.185\nThe 2001 Atlantic hurricane season was slightly more active than normal, including 15 tropical storms and hurricanes. The deadliest storms were Tropical Storm Allison in June, Hurricane Iris in October, and Hurricane Michelle in November. All three of these storms had their names retired by the World Meteorological Organization. Tropical Storm Allison was the deadliest tropical storm to hit the United States without reaching hurricane strength. The 2001 Pacific typhoon season was slightly larger than average, including 28 tropical storms, 20 typhoons, and 11 intense typhoons. The most powerful storms were Typhoon Podul in October and Typhoon Faxai in December.\nHealth.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) began a five-year program to reduce road injury fatalities following a warning of the problem's severity by the Red Cross the previous year. The WHO's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health released a report in 2001 detailing how spending by developed nations could protect health in developing nations. New drugs developed in 2001 include imatinib to treat cancer, and nateglinide to treat diabetes.224 2001 saw the first self-contained artificial heart implanted in a patient.25\nOutbreaks of cholera occurred in Chad, India, Pakistan, Tanzania, South Africa, and throughout Western Africa; outbreaks of yellow fever took place in Brazil, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Peru; and outbreaks of meningococcal disease occurred in the African meningitis belt as well as Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia. Other major disease outbreaks included Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever in Kosovo and Pakistan, measles in India and South Korea, Legionnaires' disease in Spain and Norway, dengue fever in Venezuela, and plague in Zambia.223 Spain's outbreak of Legionnaires' disease was the largest ever recorded, with 449 confirmed cases and more than 800 suspected ones. An ebola outbreak continued from 2000 in Uganda until the final case was diagnosed on January 16. Another outbreak occurred in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo in October, which continued until July 2002. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurred among livestock in the United Kingdom in 2001, resulting in millions of farm animals being slaughtered to prevent spread.\nApproximately 400,000 people in New York City were exposed to air pollution by carcinogens and other harmful particles such as asbestos and metals as a result of the September 11 attacks, and many would go on to suffer chronic illness as a result of exposure. A series of anthrax attacks against American government and media figures in October further spurred precautions against bioterrorism.222\nPolitics and law.\nFreedom House recognized 63% of national governments as electoral democracies by the end of 2001, with the Gambia and Mauritania being recognized as democracies following peaceful transfers of power. Peru also saw a significant expansion of civil rights after emerging from the authoritarian rule of Alberto Fujimori. Argentina, Liberia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Zimbabwe underwent significant democratic backsliding in 2001, with Liberia and Zimbabwe recognized as authoritarian governments by the end of the year. 64.65% of the world's population lived in countries that generally respected human rights, while 35.35% lived in countries that denied political rights and civil liberties.\nIslamic terrorism became the predominant global political concern amidst the September 11 attacks and the war on terror. Islamic extremism was identified as a major threat to democracy and human rights, both in the Muslim world through the implementation of Islamism and in the rest of the world through terrorism. Racial discrimination, the ability to prosecute human rights violators, the number of refugees, and the problems of economic disadvantage were among the global human rights concerns that were given the most attention in 2001.312\nDomestic politics.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan was the \"de jure\" government of Afghanistan in 2001, but for several years it had operated as a government in exile while the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan held \"de facto\" control over most of the country. The Islamic State of Afghanistan was restored to power following the invasion of Afghanistan with the appointment of president Hamid Karzai on December 22.43\nJoseph Kabila became president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo following the assassination of his father, President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila.77 President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia was removed from office after thousands of protesters stormed the parliament building, and he was replaced by Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of former president Sukarno.77 The Second EDSA Revolution took place in the Philippines in January when President Joseph Estrada resigned amid an impeachment, and he was succeeded by Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.77 The Argentine great depression escalated with rioting in December, prompting President Fernando de la R\u00faa to resign on December 20 and the fall of the interim government soon after.16\nKosovo and East Timor both held elections for the first time in 2001 as they sought independence.18 Other changes in leadership included the inauguration of George W. Bush as President of the United States, the election of Alejandro Toledo as President of Peru,16 the selection of Junichiro Koizumi as Prime Minister of Japan,19 and the election of Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister of Israel. Other leaders saw reconfirmation, including the reelection of Mohammad Khatami as President of Iran and the victory of the United Kingdom's Labour Party led by Tony Blair in the 2001 election.77\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, the United States passed the controversial Patriot Act that granted the U.S. government significant surveillance powers. Ghana underwent its first peaceful transfer of power since 1979 when John Kufuor was sworn in as President of Ghana on January 7. The Netherlands became the first modern country to legalize same-sex marriage on April 1. The royal family of Nepal was killed on June 1 by Crown Prince Dipendra, who became king upon his father's death. Dipendra fell into a coma after shooting himself, and he died days later. He in turn was succeeded by his uncle Gyanendra. The Constitution of the Comoros was amended on December 24, creating a federal government with a rotating presidency and granting increased autonomy to the three island administrations.\nInternational politics.\nTwo major regional organizations were announced in 2001. The African Union was established on May 26 as a pan-African forum to promote unity between African countries, including cooperation in economic and security issues, and would replace the Organisation of African Unity in 2002. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation was announced on June 15 to facilitate political and economic cooperation between Asian countries. Three countries joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001: Lithuania on May 31, Moldova on July 26, and China on December 11. The WTO began the Doha Development Round in November to negotiate lower trade barriers between countries and integrate developing nations into the global economy.18\nThe World Conference against Racism 2001 began on August 31, in Durban, South Africa, under\u00a0the auspices of the United Nations. Israel and the United States withdrew from the conference on September 3 over objections to a draft resolution document equating Zionism with racism and singling out the Jewish state for war crimes. The Aarhus Convention took effect on October 30, establishing the right to environmental information and environmental justice for European and Central Asian countries. The 27th G8 summit was marred by anti-globalization protests in Genoa, Italy. Massive demonstrations, drawing an estimated 200,000 people, were held against the meeting. One demonstrator, Carlo Giuliani, was killed by a policeman, and several others were injured.76 The September 11 attacks demonstrated a need for international law to address terrorism and other non-state actors, and a push by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in November saw progress in multiple international treaties.491 The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the first international treaty to address cybercrime, was signed on November 23.\nDiplomatic disputes in 2001 included a diplomatic incident when an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter plane collided over the South China Sea, and a dispute between Japan and North Korea when the North Korean leader's son, Kim Jong-nam, attempted to sneak into Tokyo Disneyland.76 Achievement tests and stricter penalties against delinquent students became controversial educational practices in several countries.206\nLaw.\nBelgium set precedent when the government prosecuted crimes of the Rwandan genocide, invoking a 1993 law that gave Belgian courts jurisdiction over Geneva Conventions violations that take place anywhere in the world.226 In another first for international law, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia determined that wartime sexual violence was a war crime.374 President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of Yugoslavia (1997\u20132000) was arrested on April 1 for his role in the Srebrenica massacre and other crimes against humanity committed during the Bosnian War. He was the first head of state to see trial for war crimes in this manner.230 The tribunal also prosecuted general Radislav Krsti\u0107, bringing its first conviction for genocide.18\nThe International Court of Justice heard two new cases in 2001: Liechtenstein challenged Germany's claim that Lichtenstein property had been seized from Germany during World War II, and Nicaragua brought a challenge against Colombia regarding maritime borders. It delivered judgement in a 1991 case of a territorial dispute between Bahrain and Qatar, and it ruled in a German challenge against the United States that the court's own provisional orders are binding.492\nReligion.\nThe religiously motivated September 11 attacks came to dominate global discourse about religion in 2001.300 Following the attacks, both religious tolerance and religious intolerance came to the fore, with an increase in Islamophobia, particularly in the United States and Europe. The imposition of religious law became a major subject of debate, particularly in Afghanistan, where the perpetrators of the attacks were protected by the fundamentalist Taliban, as well as Nigeria, where conflict between Christians and Muslims escalated amid the implementation of Islamic law.300 Prior to the attacks, the Taliban had incited a different religious controversy by destroying the Buddhas of Bamiyan despite the international community's pleas.76 Another religious conflict took place in Khartoum, Sudan, when Christians were forcibly expelled from the Anglican cathedral during Easter services.470\nPope John Paul II made trips throughout 2001 to preach for good relations with other religions: he became the first pope to visit a mosque in Syria to build relations with Muslims, and he visited Greece to build relations with Orthodox Christians. Relations between Catholicism and Judaism were strained following a dispute over the release of Holocaust records held by the Vatican. The Pope named 37 cardinals on January 21, bringing the total number to 128.469 The Catholic Church also began investigations of sexual abuse cases among its priests in 2001, with 3,000 cases being considered over the following decade. The subject of women's ordination was also a subject of debate within the Catholic Church.470\nThe duodecennial Hindu pilgrimage and festival Kumbh Mela was held for 42 days in January and February 2001.308 A tent city was created within Allahabad to support the festival.471 The Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Oman was completed in May. At the time, its chandelier was the largest in the world. Jediism became a social phenomenon in 2001 after a movement to self-report as Jedi caused it to become the fourth largest religion in the United Kingdom and the second largest religion in New Zealand.\nScience.\nSeveral anthropological and archaeological developments were made in 2001, including the extraction of mtDNA from prehistoric skeletons158 and the discovery of an arrowhead lodged in the shoulder of \u00d6tzi, a 5,300-year-old mummy, after a CT scan was performed on him.128 Newly described hominids included \"Sahelanthropus\" and \"Ardipithecus\", while two additional hominids, \"Kenyanthropus\" and \"Orrorin\", were proposed. January saw the extraction of DNA from a 60,000-year-old skeleton, the oldest human DNA to be studied to that point.480 In October, the discovery of a prehistoric \"Sarcosuchus\" skeleton was announced after digging began the previous year.125 Archaeological discoveries include rock art in Andros, 40,000-year-old tools in Mamontovaya Kurya, terracotta citizens in a pit adjacent to the Terracotta Army, a walled city at Dholavira, and a 2,900-year-old sweat lodge in Cuello.\nTwo different groups, the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics, published the first maps of the human genome on February 15 and 16, respectively. Human cloning was a controversial subject in 2001, and opponents called for bans on human cloning internationally.215 Other developments in genetics included a completed sequencing of the \"oryza sativa\" genome and an experiment saw the successful creation of tomatoes genetically modified to survive in saltwater.237 The pygmy three-toed sloth was among the animals first described in 2001. Birds discovered include the Mishana tyrannulet, the Chapada flycatcher, the Vanuatu petrel, and the chestnut-eared laughingthrush.215 The \"Ruizia parviflora\" tree was rediscovered on Mauritius when it was thought extinct since 1863.238 Conversely, the 1993 discovery of \"pseudonovibos spiralis\" was determined in February 2001 to be unfounded.\nThe discovery of the Lost City Hydrothermal Field on the Atlantis Massif was formally announced in 2001.183 The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation was confirmed in 2001, while the 1999 discovery of element 118 was retracted.263 The University of the Arctic was founded in 2001 as a joint project between several northern countries.210\nTechnology and transportation.\nThe computer industry saw major decline during the recession in 2001.175 Apple Computer Inc. released the Mac OS X operating system for Mac computers on March 24,176 and it discontinued the Power Mac G4 Cube.176 3G wireless technology first became available on October 1 when it was adopted by Japanese telecommunications company NTT Docomo with its Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access service.182 Microsoft released the Windows XP operating system to retail on October 25.175 The most powerful supercomputer as of 2001 was designed by IBM for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States. Several malware scares took place in 2001, including the Code Red, Nimda, and Sircam worms.180\nThere were only 57 successful orbital spaceflights in 2001, the fewest since 1963. Eight of these launches were crewed missions. Two failed spaceflights also took place. The \"NEAR Shoemaker\" made the first successful landing of a spacecraft on an asteroid on February 12, and the \"Destiny\" module was connected to the International Space Station the same month. The Russian \"Mir\" space station was deorbited and destroyed on March 23, landing in the Pacific Ocean. The \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" orbiter was launched on April 7 and arrived at Mars on October 24. American entrepreneur Dennis Tito became the first space tourist on April 28 aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-32. 28978 Ixion was discovered on May 22. The \"Genesis\" probe was launched on August 8 to collect solar wind samples. \"Deep Space 1\" carried out a flyby of Comet Borrelly on September 22, and \"Galileo\" carried out a flyby of Io on October 15. An atmosphere was discovered on an exoplanet for the first time on November 27.\nAir travel in the United States and worldwide was heavily affected by the September 11 attacks. Commercial flights in the United States were grounded for three days, and air travel then became subject to significantly increased security measures. Incheon International Airport opened in Incheon on March 22, and the TGV Mediterranee railway opened in France.166 The K-141 \"Kursk\" nuclear submarine was lifted from the Barents Sea after the Kursk submarine disaster of the previous year. The Segway, a self-balancing personal transporter invented by Dean Kamen, was unveiled on December 3 after months of public speculation and media hype, on the ABC News morning program \"Good Morning America\". The reveal that it was a self-balancing transporter was seen as a disappointment.477\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34555", "revid": "46930796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34555", "title": "1970s", "text": "Decade of the Gregorian calendar (1970\u20131979)\nDecade\nThe 1970s (pronounced \"nineteen-seventies\"; commonly shortened to the \"Seventies\" or the \"'70s\") was the decade that began on January 1, 1970, and ended on December 31, 1979.\nIn the 21st century, historians have increasingly portrayed the 1970s as a \"pivot of change\" in world history, focusing especially on the economic upheavals that followed the end of the postwar economic boom. On a global scale, it was characterized by frequent coups, domestic conflicts and civil wars, and various political upheavals and armed conflicts which arose from or were related to decolonization, and the global struggle between NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Many regions had periods of high-intensity conflict, notably Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.\nIn the Western world, social progressive values that began in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and economic liberty of women, continued to grow. In the United Kingdom, the 1979 election resulted in the victory of its Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, the first female British prime minister. Industrialized countries experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first instance of stagflation which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic theory with neoliberal economic theory, with the first neoliberal government coming to power with the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat.\nThe 1970s was also an era of great technological and scientific advances; since the appearance of the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004 in 1971, the decade was characterised by a profound transformation of computing units \u2013 by then rudimentary, spacious machines \u2013 into the realm of portability and home accessibility. There were also great advances in fields such as physics, which saw the consolidation of quantum field theory at the end of the decade, mainly thanks to the confirmation of the existence of quarks and the detection of the first gauge bosons in addition to the photon, the Z boson and the gluon, part of what was christened in 1975 as the Standard Model.\nIn Asia, the People's Republic of China's international relations changed significantly following its recognition by the United Nations, the death of Mao Zedong and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors. Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC embargo, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period, overtaking the economy of West Germany to become the second-largest in the world. The United States withdrew its military forces from the Vietnam War. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, which led to the Soviet\u2013Afghan War.\nThe 1970s saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, starting the Yom Kippur War, but in the late 1970s, the situation was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the Egyptian\u2013Israeli Peace Treaty. Political tensions in Iran exploded with the Iranian Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty and established an Islamic republic under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini.\nAfrica saw further decolonization in the decade, with Angola and Mozambique gaining their independence in 1975 from the Portuguese Empire after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal. Furthermore, Spain withdrew its claim over Spanish Sahara in 1976, marking the formal end of the Spanish Empire. The continent was, however, plagued by endemic military coups, with the long-reigning Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie being removed, civil wars and famine.\nThe economies of much of the developing world continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s because of the Green Revolution. However, their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis, although it boomed afterwards.\nThe 1970s saw the world population increase from 3.7 to 4.4\u00a0billion, with approximately 1.23\u00a0billion births and 475 million deaths occurring during the decade.\nPolitics and wars.\nWars.\nThe most notable wars and/or other conflicts of the decade include:\nInternational conflicts.\nThe most notable International conflicts of the decade include:\nCoups.\nThe most prominent coups d'\u00e9tat of the decade include:\nTerrorist attacks.\nThe most notable terrorist attacks of the decade include:\nProminent political events.\nWorldwide\nAmericas\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nWorldwide trends.\nSuperpower tensions had cooled by the 1970s, with the bellicose US\u2013Soviet confrontations of the 1950s\u201360s giving way to the policy of d\u00e9tente, which promoted the idea that the world's problems could be resolved at the negotiating table. D\u00e9tente was partially a reaction against the policies of the previous 25 years, which had brought the world dangerously close to nuclear war on several occasions, and because the US was in a weakened position following the failure of the Vietnam War. As part of d\u00e9tente, the US also restored ties with the People's Republic of China, partially as a counterweight against Soviet expansionism.\nThe US\u2013Soviet geopolitical rivalry nonetheless continued through the decade, although in a more indirect faction as the two superpowers jockeyed relentlessly for control of smaller countries. American and Soviet intelligence agencies gave funding, training, and material support to insurgent groups, governments, and armies across the globe, each seeking to gain a geopolitical advantage and install friendly governments. Coups, civil wars, and terrorism went on across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also in Europe where a spate of Soviet-backed Marxist terrorist groups were active throughout the decade. Over half the world's population in the 1970s lived under a repressive dictatorship. In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundamentalism, as the Shi'a theocracy of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy and godless communism.\nPeople were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian society in cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical social structure.\nThe Green Revolution of the late 1960s brought about self-sufficiency in food in many developing economies. At the same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life. This consequently saw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social communities amid increasing information blockade across social class.\nAnother common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for women in industrialized societies. More women could enter the workforce. However, the gender role of men remained as that of a breadwinner. The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of women entering the non-agrarian economic workforce. The Iranian revolution also affected global attitudes toward and among those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.\nThe global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global zeitgeist revealed the interdependence of economies since World War II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nEconomy.\nThe 1970s were perhaps the worst decade of most industrialized countries' economic performance since the Great Depression. Although there was no severe economic depression as witnessed in the 1930s, economic growth rates were considerably lower than previous decades. As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from the prosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973. The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 added to the existing ailments and conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade. U.S. manufacturing industries began to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus (as of 2009[ [update]]) in 1975. In contrast, Japan and West Germany experienced economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leading manufacturers. In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-largest economy. Japan would rank as the world's second-largest economy until 1994 when the European Economic Area (18 countries under a single market) came into effect.\nIn the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approximately 2.5%. From 1970 to 1979, however, the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979. This period is also known for stagflation, a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased. It led to double-digit interest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year). The prime rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, the highest in history. A rising cost of housing was reflected in the average price of a new home in the U.S. The average price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980. By the time of 1980, when U.S. president Jimmy Carter was running for re-election against Ronald Reagan, the misery index (the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%. The economic problems of the 1970s would result in a sluggish cynicism replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust of government and technology. Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election.\nThere was also the 1973\u201374 stock market crash.\nGreat Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries proved unable to compete with Japanese and German wares. Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almost paralyze the country's infrastructure. Following the Winter of Discontent, Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.\nIn Eastern Europe, Soviet-style command economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes were persistently dogged by setbacks. The oil shock increased East European, particularly Soviet, exports, but a growing inability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the COMECON block, and a growing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.\nOn the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especially by the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), resulted in rapid economic transformation and industrialization. Their abundance of cheap labor, combined with educational and other policy reforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970s and beyond.\nOil crisis.\nEconomically, the 1970s were marked by the energy crisis which peaked in 1973 and 1979 (see 1973 oil crisis and 1979 oil crisis). After the first oil shock in 1973, gasoline was rationed in many countries. Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil; the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves. Many European countries introduced car-free days and weekends. In the United States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were only allowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbered days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline on even-numbered days. The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was not sustainable without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progress that had existed since the 19th century. As a result, ecological awareness rose substantially, which had a major effect on the economy.\nScience and technology.\nScience.\nThe 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of the integrated circuit, and the laser. Stephen Hawking developed his theories of black holes and the boundary-condition of the universe at this period with his theory called Hawking radiation. The biological sciences greatly advanced, with molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade. Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and Stephen Jay Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium revolutionized evolutionary thought.\nSpace exploration.\nAs the 1960s ended, the United States had made two successful crewed lunar landings. Many Americans lost interest afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President John F. Kennedy's goal of landing on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions of dollars spent on the space program should be put to other uses. The Moon landings continued through 1972, but the near loss of the Apollo\u00a013 mission in April 1970 served to further anti-NASA feelings. Plans for missions up to Apollo 20 were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and Saturn hardware was used for the Skylab space station program in 1973\u20131974, and for the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of the ambitious projects NASA had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it would devote most of the decade to the development of the Space Shuttle. ASTP was the last crewed American space flight for the next five years. The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia. NASA had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to save it.\nMeanwhile, the Soviets, having failed in their attempt at crewed lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By then, however, they had already begun Salyut, the world's first space station program, which began in 1971. This would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the Soyuz\u00a011 crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the Soyuz 18a crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missions as long as six months being conducted by the end of the decade.\nIn terms of uncrewed missions, a variety of lunar and planetary probes were launched by the US and Soviet programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet Lunokhod program, a series of robotic lunar missions which included the first uncrewed sample return from another world, and the American Voyagers, which took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to visit all of them except Pluto by the end of the 1980s.\nChina entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first satellite, but technological backwardness and limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a satellite for the first time in 1972. The European Space Agency was founded during the decade as well.\nSocial science.\nSocial science intersected with hard science in the works in natural language processing by Terry Winograd (1973) and the establishment of the first cognitive sciences department in the world at MIT in 1979. The fields of generative linguistics and cognitive psychology went through a renewed vigor with symbolic modeling of semantic knowledge while the final devastation of the long-standing tradition of behaviorism came about through the severe criticism of B.\u00a0F. Skinner's work in 1971 by the cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky.\nTechnology.\nConcorde makes the world's first commercial passenger-carrying supersonic flight.\nElectronics and communications.\nThe birth of modern computing was in the 1970s, which saw the development of:\nThe 1970s were also the start of:\nRail.\nBritish Rail introduced high-speed trains on InterCity services. The trains consisted of British Rail Class 43 diesel-electric locomotives at either end with British Rail Mark 3 carriages. The trains were built in the United Kingdom by British Rail Engineering Limited. The high speed trains ran at speeding up journeys between towns and cities and is still known as the \"InterCity 125\".\nAmtrak was formed in the United States in 1971, assuming responsibility for inter-city passenger operations throughout the country. In 1976, Conrail was formed to take over the assets of six bankrupt freight railroads in the northeastern US.\nAutomobiles.\nThe 1970s was an era of fuel price increases, rising insurance rates, safety concerns, and emissions controls. The 1973 oil crisis caused a move towards smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars, but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built subcompact models entered the market. American-made cars such as the \"quirky\" AMC Gremlin, the jelly bean shaped AMC Pacer, and Pontiac Firebird's powerful Trans Am \"sum up\" the decade. Muscle cars and convertible models faded from favor during the early-1970s. It was believed that the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado would be the last American-built convertible; ending the open body style that once dominated the auto industry.\nCars in the U.S. from the early 1970s are noted more for their power than their styling, but they even lost their power by \"Malaise era\" of the late-1970s. Styling on American cars became progressively more boxy and rectilinear during the 1970s, with coupes being the most popular body style. Wood paneling and shag carpets dominated the interiors. Many automobiles began to lose their character and looked the same across brands and automakers, as well as featuring \"luxury\" enhancements such as vinyl roofs and opera windows. Only a few had \"real personalities\" such as the AMC Gremlin, which was America's first modern subcompact, and the AMC Pacer. \"These two cars embody a sense of artful desperation that made them stand out from the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst of the seventies.\"\nAutomobiles in the U.S. reached the largest sizes they would ever attain, but by 1977, General Motors managed to downsize its full-size models to more manageable dimensions. Ford followed suit two years later, with Chrysler offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by various factors. By 1979, the company was near bankruptcy, and under its new president Lee Iacocca (who had been fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. American Motors beat out the U.S. Big Three to subcompact sized model (the Gremlin) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a partnership with the French automaker Renault in 1979.\nEuropean car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the need for performance with high fuel efficiency\u2014designs such as the Volkswagen Golf and Passat, BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford Germany, also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company. The designs of Giorgetto Giugiaro became dominant, along with those of Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical failure of the British car industry\u2014a combination of militant strikes and poor quality control effectively halted development at British Leyland, owner of all other British car companies during the 1970s.\nThe Japanese automobile industry flourished during the 1970s, compared to other major auto markets. Japanese vehicles became internationally renowned for their affordability, reliability, and fuel-efficiency, which was very important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized robotic manufacturing techniques and lean manufacturing, contributing to high-efficiency and low production costs. The Honda Civic was introduced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-efficiency. By 1975 Toyota overtook Volkswagen as the top-selling imported automobile brand in the U.S., with over a million cars sold per year by this point. Other popular compact cars included the Toyota Corolla and the Datsun Sunny, in addition to other cars from those companies and others such as Subaru, Mitsubishi, and Mazda.\nSociety.\nRole of women in society.\nThe role of women in society was profoundly altered with growing feminism across the world and with the presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state outside monarchies and heads of government in a number of countries across the world during the 1970s, many being the first women to hold such positions. Non-monarch women heads of state and heads of government in this period included Isabel Per\u00f3n as the first woman president in Argentina and the first woman non-monarch head of state in the Western hemisphere in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, Elisabeth Domitien becomes the first woman prime minister of the Central African Republic, Indira Gandhi continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977 (and taking office again in 1980), Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Prime minister of Sri Lanka (Former Ceylon) and first female head of government in the world, re-elected in 1970, Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel and acting chairman Soong Ching-ling of the People's Republic of China continuing their leadership from the sixties, Lidia Gueiler Tejada becoming the interim president of Bolivia beginning from 1979 to 1980, Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo becoming the first woman prime minister of Portugal in 1979, and Margaret Thatcher becoming the first woman prime minister of the United Kingdom in 1979. Both Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher would remain important political figures in the following decade in the 1980s.\nPope Paul VI recognized the popularity of Catholic feminists, but ultimately held to tradition when it came to leaving bishops, priests, and deacons a male-only position.\nSocial movements.\nAnti-war protests.\nThe opposition to the War in Vietnam that began in the 1960s grew exponentially during the early 1970s. One of the best-known anti-war demonstrations was the Kent State shootings. In 1970, university students were protesting the war and the draft. Riots ensued during the weekend and the National Guard was called in to maintain the peace. However, by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting. Four students were killed and nine were injured. This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country and became a staple of anti-Vietnam demonstrations.\nEnvironmentalism.\nThe 1970s started a mainstream affirmation of the environmental issues early activists from the 1960s, such as Rachel Carson and Murray Bookchin, had warned of. The Apollo 11 mission, which had occurred at the end of the previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first Earth Day, in which over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools participated.\nSexual revolution.\nThe 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasingly accepted in the Western world. The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor. Western Europe was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United States, as nudity in film and on TV had been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countries during this time began allowing women to go topless in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in the 1980s to 1990s.\nThe market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomer population, and the 1972 movie \"Behind the Green Door\", an X-rated feature, became one of the top-grossing films of the year. \"Playboy Magazine\" appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themed magazines such as \"Penthouse Magazine\" and \"Hustler Magazine\".\nBy the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of the AIDS epidemic helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution. Adult movie theaters, which had exploded in numbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of urban decay in the US, declined as pornographic movies would largely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.\nCrime and urban decay.\nCrime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to a complex of social, economic, and demographic factors. By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a serious cause of concern, New York City being particularly affected. In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capital punishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later. \nFeminism.\nThe Second-Wave Feminist Movement in the United States, which had begun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role within society. The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (which legalized female suffrage) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equality and other protests.\n1971 saw Erin Pizzey establish the world's first domestic violence shelter in Chiswick, London and Pizzey and her colleagues opened further facilities throughout the next few years. This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse in other countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in Amsterdam in 1974.\nWith the anthology \"Sisterhood is Powerful\" and other works, such as \"Sexual Politics\", being published at the start of the decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before. In addition, the Supreme Court's 1973 decision of \"Roe v. Wade\", which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movement into the national political spotlight.\nGloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Betty Ford, Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, Robin Morgan, Kate Millett and Elizabeth Holtzman, among many others, led the movement for women's equality.\nEven musically, the women's movement had its shining moment. Australian-American singer Helen Reddy, recorded the song \"I Am Woman\", which became an anthem for the women's liberation movement. \"I Am Woman\" reached No.\u00a01 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.\nAnother movement to arise was the 1970s Goddess movement, which took place to combat patriarchal ideas of religion.\nMost efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws, were successful. Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gained unheard of success in business, politics, education, science, the law, and even the home. Although most aims of the movement were successful, however, there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratify ERA in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs). Also, the wage gap failed to close, but it did become smaller.\nThe second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982 with the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C.. American women created a brief, but powerful, third-wave in the early 1990s which addressed sexual harassment (inspired by the Anita Hill\u2013Clarence Thomas Senate Judiciary Committee hearings of 1991). The results of the movement included a new awareness of such issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, particularly the United States Senate.\nCivil rights.\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselves more by their differences than by their universalities. The Black Nationalist movement grew out of frustrations with the \"non-violent\" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists. With the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, many Black people were compelled to reject ideas of negotiation and instead embrace isolation. The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for Civil Rights in the 1970s. The seventies were seen as the \"woman's turn\", though many feminists incorporated civil rights ideals into their movement. A feminist who had inherited the leadership position of the civil rights movement from her husband, Coretta Scott King, as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helping and encouraging the Woman's Liberation movement, and other movements as well. At the National Women's Conference in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality in the movement's goals. Similarly, the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of political figures such as Harvey Milk to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including Freddie Mercury and Andy Warhol, also came out during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.\nYouth suffrage.\nThe Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the voting age for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years. The primary impetus for this change was the fact that young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War before they were old enough to vote.\nPopular culture.\nMusic.\nDuring the early 1970s, popular music continued to be dominated by musicians who had achieved fame during the 1950s and the 1960s such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty, Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, and Eric Clapton. In addition, many newcomer rock groups such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin appeared. The Beatles disbanded in 1970, but each member of the band immediately released a highly successful solo album, and Paul McCartney especially would remain extremely popular throughout the decade. Singer-songwriters such as Elton John, James Taylor and Jackson Browne also came into vogue during the early 1970s.\nThe 1970s saw the rapid commercialization of rock music, and by mid-decade there were a spate of bands derisively dubbed \"corporate rock\" due to the notion that they had been created by record labels to produce simplistic, radio-friendly songs that offered clich\u00e9s rather than meaningful lyrics. Such bands included The Doobie Brothers, Bread, Styx, Kansas, and REO Speedwagon.\nFunk, an offshoot of soul music with a greater emphasis on beats, and influences from rhythm and blues, jazz, and psychedelic rock, was also very popular. The mid-1970s also saw the rise of disco music, which dominated during the last half of the decade with bands like the Bee Gees, Chic, ABBA, Village People, Boney M, Donna Summer, KC and the Sunshine Band, and others. In response to this, rock music became increasingly hard-edged, with early metal artists like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple. Minimalism also emerged, led by composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich and Michael Nyman. This was a break from the intellectual serial music in the tradition of Schoenberg, which lasted from the early 1900s to the 1960s.\nThe 1970s also saw artists from Motown records become popular across the globe. Artists like the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye dominated the record charts across the world and had a significant influence on pop culture, including breaking down racial barriers.\nClassical and experimental music influenced both art rock and progressive rock genres with bands such as Pink Floyd, Yes, Todd Rundgren's Utopia, Supertramp, Rush, Genesis, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues and Soft Machine. Hard rock and Heavy metal also emerged among British bands Led Zeppelin, Queen, The Who, Black Sabbath, UFO, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and Judas Priest.\nAustralian band AC/DC also found its hard-rock origins in the early 1970s and its breakthrough in 1979's \"Highway to Hell\", while popular American rock bands included Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynyrd and shock rockers Alice Cooper, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, and Kiss, and guitar-oriented Ted Nugent and Van Halen. In Europe, there was a surge of popularity in the early decade for glam rock.\nAfter a successful return to live performing in the late 60s with his TV special, Elvis Presley regained his popularity through Vegas performance engagements and concert tours throughout the United States until his death in 1977, which helped him acquire a new generation of fans. His 1973 televised concert, \"Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite\", aired in over 40 countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the United States, making it one of the most popular concert events of the decade.\nThe second half of the decade saw the rise of punk rock, when a spate of fresh, young rock groups playing stripped-down hard rock came to prominence at a time when most of the artists associated with the 1960s to early 1970s were in creative decline. Punk bands included The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Ramones, Talking Heads, and more.\nThe highest-selling album of the decade was Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973), along with Eagles' \"Hotel California\" (1976) and Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours\" (1977). \"Dark Side of the Moon\" remained on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart for 741 weeks. Electronic instrumental progressive rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can, and Faust to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy krautrock, along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent synthrock. The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art music musicians such as Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Tomita, who with Brian Eno were a significant influence of the development of new-age music. Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra helped to pioneer synthpop, with their self-titled album (in 1978) setting a template with less minimalism and with a strong emphasis on melody, and drawing from a wider range of influences than had been employed by Kraftwerk. YMO also introduced the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 sequencer and TR-808 rhythm machine to popular music.\nIn the first half of the 1970s, many jazz musicians from the Miles Davis school achieved cross-over success through jazz-rock fusion with bands like Weather Report, Return to Forever, The Headhunters and The Mahavishnu Orchestra who also influenced this genre and many others. In Germany, Manfred Eicher started the ECM label, which quickly made a name for \"chamber jazz\". Towards the end of the decade, Jamaican reggae music, already popular in the Caribbean and Africa since the early 1970s, became very popular in the U.S. and in Europe, mostly because of reggae superstar and legend Bob Marley. The mid-1970s saw the reemergence of acoustic jazz with the return of artists like Dexter Gordon to the US music scene, who, along with a number of other artists, such as trumpet innovators like Don Ellis and Woody Shaw, who were among the last of the decade's traditionally oriented acoustic jazz musicians to be signed to major record labels, to receive critical and widespread commercial recognition and multiple Grammy nominations.\nThe late 1970s also saw the beginning of hip hop music with disc jockeys like DJ Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa taking loops from funk and soul records and playing them repeatedly at block parties and dance clubs. At the end of the 1970s, popular songs like \"Rapper's Delight\" by Sugarhill Gang gave hip hop a wider audience. Hip hop was also influenced by the song \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\" by Gil Scott-Heron.\nCountry music also continued to increase in popularity in the 1970s. Between 1977 and 1979, it became more mainstream, particularly with the outlaw movement, led by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. The 70s also saw the rise of a country music subgenre, southern rock, led by the Allman Brothers Band. Other artists; such as Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn, Don Williams, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Ronnie Milsap, Crystal Gayle, and Barbara Mandrell; all scored hits throughout the 70s which reached both country and pop charts. The genre also saw its golden age of vocal duos and groups in this decade; with Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn, George Jones and Tammy Wynette, Jim Ed Brown and Helen Cornelius, the Bellamy Brothers, the Oak Ridge Boys, the Statler Brothers, Dave &amp; Sugar, and The Kendalls. The genre also became more involved in Hollywood toward the end of the decade, with country-themed action films such as \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and \"Every Which Way But Loose\", a trend that continued into the early 80s with \"Urban Cowboy\" and \"Bronco Billy\".\nA major event in music in the early 1970s was the deaths of popular rock stars Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison, all at the age of 27. Two of popular music's most successful artists from other eras died within eight weeks of each other in 1977. Elvis Presley, the best-selling singer of all time, died on August 16, 1977. Presley's funeral was held at Graceland, on Thursday, August 18, 1977. Bing Crosby, who sold about 50 million records, died on October 14, 1977. His single, White Christmas, remains the best-selling single of all time, confirmed by the Guinness Records.\nIn addition to the deaths in the 1970s, breakups of bands and duos; such as the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Everly Brothers, and others; occurred over the course of the decade.\nStatistically, Led Zeppelin and Elton John were the most successful musical acts of the 1970s, both having sold more than 300 million records since 1969.\nDuring the 1970s, Japan had the second largest music market in the world. included , , new music, and . Musical artists and bands included Momoe Yamaguchi, Saori Minami, the Candies, Pink Lady, Hiromi Go, Hideki Saijo, Yuming, Saki Kubota, Judy Ongg and Sachiko Kobayashi.\nArgentine rock became the most popular musical genre in Argentina among youngsters, and became famous throughout Latin America. Legendary Argentine rockstar Charly Garc\u00eda formed his first band, Sui Generis (Folk Rock), which released Argentine rock staples such as and . In 1978, Charly Garc\u00eda formed the first Latin American supergroup Ser\u00fa Gir\u00e1n (Progressive Rock), which released some of the greatest rock anthems in Latin America, such as \"\" and \".\"\nLuis Alberto Spinetta achieved national acclaim with Almendra, perhaps the first successful progressive rock band in Latin America, their greatest hit was \".\" Later in 1973, Pescado Rabioso (Spinetta's second band) launched \"Artaud,\" for many the magnus opus of Argentine rock.\nOther relevant Argentine musicians and bands of the 1970s are Vox Dei, Pappo, Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota.\nFilm.\nOscar winners of the decade were \"Patton\" (1970), \"The French Connection\" (1971), \"The Godfather\" (1972), \"The Sting\" (1973), \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975), \"Rocky\" (1976), \"Annie Hall\" (1977), \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978), and \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979).\nThe top ten highest-grossing films of the decade are (in order from highest to lowest grossing): \"Star Wars\", \"Jaws\", \"Grease\", \"The Exorcist\", \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", \"Superman\", \"The Godfather\", \"Saturday Night Fever\", \"Rocky\", and \"Jaws 2\". Two of these movies came out on the same day: June 16, 1978.\nIn 1970s European cinema, the failure of the Prague Spring brought about nostalgic motion pictures such as Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3's \"Szerelmesfilm\" (1970). German New Wave and Rainer Fassbinder's existential movies characterized film-making in Germany. The movies of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like \"Cries and Whispers\" (1973).\n\"Airport\" was released in 1970, spawning the air disaster film genre. Throughout the decade, the film spawned three sequels: \"Airport 1975, Airport '77, and The Concorde... Airport '79\". The genre also inspired a spoof film (\"Airplane!\") along with its two sequels in the early 1980s. A slew of other air disaster films followed suit throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, primarily in made-for-TV movies.\nCar chase movies also became a popular film genre of the 1970s with such films as \"Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry\" in 1974, and perhaps the genre's most popular film \"Smokey and the Bandit\" in 1977.\nAsian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and struggles. In the Bollywood cinema of India, this was epitomized by the movies of Bollywood superhero Amitabh Bachchan. Another Asian touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was Hong Kong martial arts film which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts around the world. Martial arts film reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, Bruce Lee.\nDuring the 1970s, Hollywood continued the New Hollywood movement of the late-1960s with young filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, as well as films like \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Godfather\", \"Star Wars\", \"Taxi Driver\", \"Jaws\", and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Top-grossing \"Jaws\" (1975) ushered in the blockbuster era of filmmaking, though it was eclipsed two years later by the science-fiction film \"Star Wars\" (1977), which would later go on to become one of the most successful film franchises in history, spawning two sequels in the original trilogy in the next decade. \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) single-handedly touched off disco mania in the U.S. \"The Godfather\" (1972) was also one of the decade's greatest successes and its first follow-up, \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974) was also successful for a sequel.\n\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" flopped in its 1975 debut, only to reappear as a more-popular midnight show later in the decade. Still in limited release decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.\n\"The Exorcist\" (1973) was a box office success for the horror genre, inspiring many other so-called \"devil (Satan)\" films like \"The Omen\" and both of their own sequels. The release of the movie followed a general mood of paranoia on satanic themes in the United States; also the counterculture of the 1970s saw an increasing interest in occultism.\n\"All That Jazz\" (1979) gained high critical praise, winning four Oscars and several other awards. It was an inductee of the 2001 National Film Registry list.\nThe Golden Age of Porn continued its reign throughout the 1970s, with one of its most popular films of the decade being \"Debbie Does Dallas\" in 1978.\nTelevision.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, colour channels were now available; three stations had begun broadcasting in colour between 1967 and 1969. However, many viewers continued to watch black-and-white television sets for most of the decade, which meant for example that televised snooker (in which the colour of balls is important) did not reach the heights of its popularity until the 1980s.\nNotable dramas included \"Play for Today\" and \"Pennies from Heaven\". In police dramas, there was a move towards increasing realism; popular shows included \"Dixon of Dock Green\", \"Z-Cars\", \"Softly, Softly\", and \"The Sweeney\".\nThe science fiction show \"Doctor Who\" reached its peak.\n1970s British television featured a mix of traditional more modern comedies and sitcoms. \"Fawlty Towers\", \"Morecambe and Wise\", \"The Benny Hill Show\", \"Are You Being Served?\" and \"Dad's Army\" had their origins in the variety show and radio comedy of the first half of the century. Many popular British situation comedies (sit-coms) were gentle, unchallenging comedies of middle-class life; typical examples were \"Terry and June\" and \"Sykes\". However, the middle-class settings of \"The Good Life\" and \"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\" contrasted with their anti-establishment theme of people rejecting traditional social norms. A harsher side of society was shown by comedy series like \"Porridge\" and \"Rising Damp\", while sitcoms such as \"Mind Your Language\", \"Love Thy Neighbour\" and \"Till Death Us Do Part\" reflected social unease brought about by post-war immigration. Spike Milligan's \"Q\" and the still-popular \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" both used surreal comedy, originating from the 1950s \"The Goon Show\".\nDuring the 1970s, the original animated television series \"Roobarb\" and \"Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk\".\nThe television information retrieval service Teletext was initially introduced when the BBC Ceefax system went live on 23 September 1974.\nIn the late 1970s, BBC2's unveiled a new identity, a twin-striped \"2\", which was the first electronically generated symbol and scrolled on and off the screen.\nUnited States.\nAs the 1970s began, the Big Three TV networks were rapidly re-engineering their lineups, noting that existing programs were not attracting the youth audience. Most existing programs still operated on paradigms established in the 1950s, and some shows had literally been on the air since the dawn of TV broadcasting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Shows that had low ratings or insufficient youth appeal were cancelled as networks scrambled to attract the large baby boomer audience.\nTo reflect the new social trends, television changed dramatically with more urban and edgy settings, and replaced the popular rural/country wholesome look of the 1950s and 1960s, seen as outmoded and unable to connect with young, educated urban audiences. This particular trend was known as the rural purge. Television was transformed by what became termed as \"social consciousness\" programming, such as \"All in the Family\" and \"Soap\", which broke down television barriers. Many advertising trends of the 1970s also reflected this growing social consciousness trend, such as with Coca-Cola's \"Give the World a Coke\" and Mcdonalds' \"You Deserve a Break\" campaigns.\nThe women's movement ushered in a slew of programming featuring strong, independent females as central characters. Most notable was \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", which spawned the successful spin-offs \"Rhoda\" and \"Phyllis\", and also resulted in Mary Tyler Moore becoming the first female to head a television production company of her own, MTM Enterprises, which churned out groundbreaking programming in the late 1970s throughout the 1990s. Women were also established portraying action characters in programs like \"Police Woman\", \"Wonder Woman\", \"The Bionic Woman\", and others.\nMinority-centric television programming also featured prominently during the 1970s. Shows featuring African-Americans as main characters, such as \"Sanford and Son\", \"Maude\", \"The Jeffersons\", \"Good Times\", \"Roots\" and \"What's Happening!!\" broke down barriers and became very popular. In addition, \"Soul Train\", the brainchild of Don Cornelius, premiered in 1971 as the African-American counterpart to \"American Bandstand\", giving a forum for soul, funk, jazz, R&amp;B, disco, and future rap and hip hop artists to gain exposure to American audiences, consumers, music lovers, enthusiasts, and those keen on learning new dance moves.\nThe television western, which had been very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, all but died out during the 1970s, with \"Bonanza\", \"The Virginian\", and \"Gunsmoke\" ending their runs. Replacing westerns were police and detective shows, a trend that would last through the 1980s.\nTelevision still had its medical shows of the 1970s, however, \"Emergency!\" was the first popular medical drama ever to feature both the paramedic program as well as the hospital emergency department, which also encouraged future people in the United States to develop their own paramedic program or hospital emergency department, and acted as an inspiration for many individuals. \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" and \"Medical Center\" were other long-running medical dramas popular during the 1970s.\n1950s nostalgia and pop culture became a theme in prime-time sitcoms with the Garry Marshall-produced \"Happy Days\" and its two spin-offs \"Laverne &amp; Shirley\" and \"Mork &amp; Mindy\".\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, jiggle television\u2014programs oriented toward sexual gratification and farce comedy and situations\u2014became popular. Such programs included \"Charlie's Angels\", \"The Love Boat\", and perhaps the genre's most popular, \"Three's Company\".\nSoap operas expanded their audiences beyond housewives with the rise of \"All My Children\", \"As the World Turns\", \"Somerset\", and \"The Young and the Restless\"; with many extending their episodes from 30 minutes to an hour. The soap \"Another World\" began a 16-month experiment in March 1979 by screening 90-minute episodes, the only serial to do so.\nGame shows such as \"Match Game\", \"The Hollywood Squares\", \"Family Feud\", and many others, saw their golden ages on daytime television. The height of \"Match Game\"'s popularity occurred between 1973 and 1977, before it was overtaken by \"Family Feud\" in 1978. Television's current longest-running game show, \"The Price Is Right\", began its run hosted by Bob Barker in 1972.\nAnother influential genre was the television newscast, which built on its initial widespread success in the 1960s.\nThe science fiction phenomenon of the late 1970s that began with \"Star Wars\" went to television with shows such as \"Battlestar Galactica\".\nVariety shows, a staple of TV programming since the beginning, were also re-engineered to appeal to young viewers. Old standbys such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The Red Skelton Show\" were canceled and replaced by hipper programming like \"Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour\" and \"Donny &amp; Marie\". \"The Carol Burnett Show\" also ended its historic 11-year run in 1978. In the end, rising production costs largely did in variety shows. The exception was \"Saturday Night Live\" (then known as \"NBC's Saturday Night\"), which was created by Lorne Michaels and premiered in 1975, with an original cast of Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, and Chevy Chase. The country music variety show \"Hee Haw\", which premiered in 1969, was the only series to survive the \"rural purge\" and continued throughout the 70s, 80s, and into the 1990s before ending its run, although the series went into syndication after its first three seasons.\n\"The Dukes of Hazzard\" began its six-year run in 1979. The series was inspired by the car-chase film genre, particularly the 1975 film \"Moonrunners\", on which the series was based, with similar characters and scenes; and both were directed by Gy Waldron and voice-over narrated by country music artist Waylon Jennings.\nPay television.\nAs cable television became more affordable and accessible by U.S. consumers, the race to bring the silver screen to the small screen commenced with the launch of pay television services showing premium content.\nHBO launched on November 8, 1972, becoming the nation's first pay-television channel. On September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television network to continuously deliver signals via satellite when it showed the Thrilla in Manila boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.\nStar Channel launched its service offerings nationally in 1973 through the delivery of movies on videotapes for cable providers to broadcast. This proved problematic since the videotapes were often riddled with technical difficulties. Star Channel eventually was linked up to satellite in January 1978. Shortly after, Warner Communications acquired the channel and relaunched it on December 1, 1979, in its current form as The Movie Channel.\nMedia giant Viacom launched their premium service, Showtime, nationally on July 1, 1976, after a brief, wildly successful test launch on their cable system in Dublin, California.\nAustralia.\nIn 1974, Australian TV tested color transmissions (full-time color came in 1975). Popular shows during the decade include, \"Young Talent Time\", \"Number 96\", \"The Aunty Jack Show\", \"Class of '74\", \"The Sullivans\", \"The Don Lane Show\", \"Cop Shop\", \"The Naked Vicar Show\", \"The Paul Hogan Show\" and \"Countdown\".\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa saw nationwide television service for the first time on January 5, 1976, although limited-view, locally available television began on May 5, 1975.\nJapan.\nThe original anime television series \"Vicky the Viking\", \"Heidi\", \"Maya the Bee\" and \"Doraemon\" in both 1974, 1975 and 1979, respectively.\nSports.\nThe 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany saw swimmer Mark Spitz set seven World Records and won a record seven gold medals. The 1976 Summer Olympics were held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Brazil won the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, West Germany won the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany, and Argentina won the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. The 1970 FIFA World Cup was the first world cup to be televised in color.\nOn April 9, 1975, Asia's first professional basketball league, the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) had its first game at the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines.\nUnited States.\nThe Oakland Athletics three-peated at the World Series in 1972\u20131974.\nThe Cincinnati Reds go to the World Series in 1970, 1972, 1975, and 1976, led by the Big Red Machine winning two out of four.\nThe New York Yankees won the World Series in 1977 and 1978 after losing in 1976.\nThe Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers dominated the decade in the NFL. Steelers were led by Terry Bradshaw and Chuck Noll, and the Cowboys were led by Roger Staubach and Tom Landry, while the Miami Dolphins became the only team in NFL history to go \"all the way,\" winning the Super Bowl with an undefeated record\u2014a feat that remains unmatched to this day.\nIn the 1970s we saw a lot of sports venues that were built during this decade which includes Arrowhead Stadium, Three Rivers Stadium, Texas Stadium, Veterans Stadium, Riverfront Stadium, and Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975, a team best remembered as \"The Broad Street Bullies\".\nDisc sports (Frisbee).\nAs numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the counterculture. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a frisbee. What started with a few players like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and Ken Westerfield experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a frisbee, later would become known as playing freestyle. Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts from Wham-O and Irwin Toy (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, disc ultimate and disc golf became this sports first events.\nLiterature.\nFiction in the early 1970s brought a return to old-fashioned storytelling, especially with Erich Segal's \"Love Story\". The seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as Saul Bellow and Peter De Vries, who both released poorly received novels at the start of the decade. Racism remained a key literary subject. John Updike emerged as a major literary figure. Reflections on the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of Joyce Carol Oates and Wright Morris. With the rising cost of hard-cover books and the increasing readership of genre fiction, the paperback became a popular medium. Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic. Irreverence and satire, typified in Kurt Vonnegut's \"Breakfast of Champions\", were common literary elements. The horror genre also emerged, and by the late 1970s Stephen King had become one of the most popular genre novelists. The postmodern author Thomas Pynchon published his most famous work, \"Gravity's Rainbow\", in 1973.\nIn non-fiction, several books related to Nixon and the Watergate scandal topped the best-selling lists. 1977 brought many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of Virginia Woolf, Agatha Christie, and J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien.\nThe fake memoir \"Go Ask Alice\" was released in 1971. Upon its initial release the book was marketed as a real diary of a teenage girl who overdosed in the 1960s. However, it was later revealed that the book was actually written by Beatrice Sparks.\nJorge Luis Borges published \"\" in 1970 and \"The Book Of Sand\" in 1975.\nJulio Cort\u00e1zar published Octaedro in 1974.\nErnesto S\u00e1bato published \"Abadd\u00f3n The Exterminator,\" his last novel, in 1974.\nArchitecture.\nArchitecture in the 1970s began as a continuation of styles created by such architects as Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Early in the decade, several architects competed to build the tallest building in the world. Of these buildings, the most notable are the John Hancock Center and Sears Tower in Chicago, both designed by Bruce Graham and Fazlur Khan, and the World Trade Center towers in New York by American architect Minoru Yamasaki. The decade also brought experimentation in geometric design, pop-art, postmodernism, and early deconstructivism.\nDesign trends in the 1970s were marked by a backlash against the bright colors and futurism of the 1950s and 1960s and a rise in popularity of dark, earthy tones with extensive use of brown, green, purple, and orange. Wood decor and paneling was integral to 1970s interior design as well, replacing the obsession of the 1950s and 1960s with chrome and aluminum. Darker colors not only reflected the back-to-nature mindset of the decade, but the sluggish world economy with its lowered optimism and expectations for the future.\nIn 1974, Louis Kahn's last and arguably most famous building, the National Assembly Building of Dhaka, Bangladesh, was completed. The building's use of open spaces and groundbreaking geometry brought rare attention to the small South Asian country. Hugh Stubbins's Citicorp Center revolutionized the incorporation of solar panels in office buildings. The seventies brought further experimentation in glass and steel construction and geometric design. Chinese architect I. M. Pei's John Hancock Tower in Boston, Massachusetts, is an example, although like many buildings of the time, the experimentation was flawed and glass panes fell from the fa\u00e7ade. In 1976, the completed CN\u00a0Tower in Toronto became the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, an honor it held until 2007. The fact that no taller tower had been built between the construction of the CN Tower and the Burj Khalifa shows how innovative the architecture and engineering of the structure truly were.\nModern architecture was increasingly criticized as the decade went on from the point of view of postmodern architects, such as Philip Johnson, Charles Moore, and Michael Graves, who advocated a return to pre-modern styles of architecture and the incorporation of pop elements as a means of communicating with a broader public. Other architects, such as Peter Eisenman of the New York Five, advocated the pursuit of form for the sake of form and drew on semiotics theory for support.\n\"High Tech\" architecture moved forward as Buckminster Fuller continued his experiments in geodesic domes, while the Georges Pompidou Center, designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, which opened in 1977, was a prominent example. As the decade drew to a close, Frank Gehry broke out in a new direction with his own house in Santa Monica, a highly complex structure, half excavated out of an existing bungalow and half cheaply built construction using materials such as chicken wire fencing.\nTerracotta Army figures, dating from 210 BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor (Chinese: \u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u9675; pinyin: Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0hu\u00e1ng Ling). In 1978, electrical workers in Mexico City found the remains of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in the middle of the city.\nFashion.\nClothing styles during the 1970s were influenced by outfits seen in popular music groups and in Hollywood films. In clothing, prints, especially from India and other parts of the world, were fashionable.\nMuch of the 1970s fashion styles were influenced by the hippie movement. As well as the hippie look, the 70s also gave way to glam rock styles, started off by David Bowie who was named the King of Glam Rock. Glam was a genderbent and outlandish style.\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1970s include:\nPeople.\nScientists and engineers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors / Entertainers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmmakers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWriters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports figures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\nTimeline.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\n1970 \u2022 1971 \u2022 1972 \u2022 1973 \u2022 1974 \u2022 1975 \u2022 1976 \u2022 1977 \u2022 1978 \u2022 1979\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34556", "revid": "42114038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34556", "title": "1990s", "text": "Decade of the Gregorian calendar (1990\u20131999)\nDecade\nThe 1990s (often referred and shortened to as \"the '90s\" or \"the Nineties\") was the decade that began on 1 January 1990, and ended on 31 December 1999. Known as the \"post-Cold War decade\", the 1990s were culturally imagined as the period from the Revolutions of 1989 until the September 11 attacks in 2001. The dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of Russia's status as a superpower, the end of a multipolar world, and the rise of anti-Western sentiment. China was still recovering from a politically and economically turbulent period. This allowed the US to emerge as the world's sole superpower, creating relative peace and prosperity for many western countries. During this decade, the world population grew from 5.3 to 6.1 billion.\nThe decade saw greater attention to multiculturalism and advance of alternative media. Public education about safe sex curbed HIV in developed countries. Generation X bonded over musical tastes. Humor in television and film was marked by ironic self-references mixed with popular culture references. Alternative music movements like grunge, reggaeton, Eurodance, K-pop, and hip-hop, became popular, aided by the rise in satellite and cable television, and the internet. New music genres such as drum and bass, post-rock, happy hardcore, \"denpa\", and trance emerged. Video game popularity exploded due to the development of CD-ROM supported 3D computer graphics on platforms such as Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PCs.\nThe 1990s saw advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, evolution of the Pentium microprocessor, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990, by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with the goal to sequence the entire human genome. Building the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator, commenced in 1998, and Nasdaq became the first US stock market to trade online. Environmentalism is divided between left-wing green politics, primary industry-sponsored environmentalist front organizations, and a more business-oriented approach to the regulation of carbon footprint of businesses. More businesses started using information technology.\nThere was a realignment and consolidation of economic and political power, such as the continued mass-mobilization of capital markets through neoliberalism, globalization, and end of the Cold War. Network cultures were enhanced by the proliferation of new media such as the internet, and a new ability to self-publish web pages and make connections on professional, political and hobby topics. The digital divide was immediate, with access limited to those who could afford it and knew how to operate a computer. The internet provided anonymity for individuals skeptical of the government. Traditional mass media continued to perform strongly. However, mainstream internet users were optimistic about its benefits, particularly the future of e-commerce. Web portals, a curated bookmark homepage, were as popular as searching via web crawlers. The dot-com bubble of 1997\u20132000 brought wealth to some entrepreneurs before its crash of the early-2000s.\nMany countries were economically prosperous and spreading globalization. High-income countries experienced steady growth during the Great Moderation (1980s\u20142000s). Using a mobile phone in a public place was typical conspicuous consumption. In contrast, the GDP of former Soviet Union states declined as a result of neoliberal restructuring. International trade increased with the establishment of the European Union (EU) in 1993, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, and World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The Asia-Pacific economies of the Four Asian Tigers, ASEAN, Australia and Japan were hampered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis and early 1990s recession.\nMajor wars that began include the First and Second Congo Wars, the Rwandan Civil War and genocide, the Somali Civil War, and Sierra Leone Civil War in Africa; the Yugoslav Wars in Southeast Europe; the First and Second Chechen Wars, in the former Soviet Union; and the Gulf War in the Middle East. The Afghanistan conflict (1978\u2013present) and Colombian conflict continued. The Oslo Accords seemed to herald an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but this was in vain. However, in Northern Ireland, The Troubles came to a standstill in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement, ending 30 years of violence.\nPolitics and wars.\nDeaths.\nProminent deaths of siting leaders including:\nProminent deaths of former leaders including:\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nDisasters.\nNatural disasters.\nThe 1990s saw a trend in frequent and more devastating natural disasters, breaking many previous records. Although the 1990s was designated by the United Nations as an International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction as part of its program to prevent losses due to disasters, disasters would go on to cause a record-breaking US$608 billion worth of damage\u2014more than the past four decades combined.\nEconomics.\nMany countries, institutions, companies, and organizations were prosperous during the 1990s. High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade during the Great Moderation. However, in the former Soviet Union, GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed, and some capital flight occurred.\nNorth America\nAsia\nEurope\nSouth America\nScience and technology.\nTechnology.\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology. Between 1990 and 1997, household PC ownership in the US rose from 15% to 35%. Cell phones of the early-1990s and earlier ones were very large, lacked extra features, and were used by only a few percent of the population of even the advanced nations. Only a few million people used online services in 1990, and the World Wide Web, which would have a significant impact on technology for many decades, had only just been invented. The first web browser went online in 1993. By 2001, more than 50% of some Western countries had Internet access, and more than 25% had cell phone access.\nElectronics and communications.\nInternet.\nThe 90s were a vital period for the development of the Internet. Several inventions and applications were launched to create the web as it's known today. Tim Berners-Lee, an English computer scientist, released the World Wide Web to the general public on April 30, 1993. The same year, , one of the first widely available web browsers, was launched as the first browser to display images in line with text and not in a separate window. In 1990, Archie, the world's first search engine, was released. In the early days of its development, Archie served as an index of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites, which was a method for moving files between a client and a server network. This early search tool was superseded by more advanced engines like Yahoo! in 1995 and Google in 1998.\nFollowing the launch of the early Internet and fiber optic capabilities to the public, a significant shift occurred. Consumers, recognizing the potential of the Internet, began to demand more network capacity. This surge in demand spurred developers to seek solutions to reduce the time and cost of laying new fiber, in order to meet the growing needs of the public.\nIn 1992, David Huber, an optical networking engineer, joined forces with entrepreneur Kevin Kimberlin. Together, they laid the foundation for a new era in telecommunications with the birth of Ciena Corporation. The company would harness the technology physicist Gordon Gould, inventor of the laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation), had pioneered with co-founder William Culver of Optelecom, an early creator of fiber optic cable and optical amplifiers. Ciena's former Pat Nettles, and a team of engineers attempted to transmit information on waves of light with a form of a laser. The team began working on a dual-stage optical amplifier that enabled dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM), which allowed large amounts of data to be transmitted across the nation. The firm filed a patent on a dual-stage amplifier on November 13, 1995. A year later, in 1996, Ciena made history by deploying the world's first dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) system on the Sprint fiber network. These developments eventually formed the backbone of every global communications network, and the foundation of the Internet.\nProminent websites launched during the decade include IMDb (1993), eBay (1995), Amazon (1994), GeoCities (1994), Netscape (1994), Yahoo! (1995), AltaVista (1995), AIM (1997), ICQ (1996), Hotmail (1996), Google (1998), Napster (1999). The pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing internet service Napster, which launched in Fall 1999, was the first peer-to-peer software to become massively popular. While at the time it was possible to share files in other ways via the Internet (such as IRC and USENET), Napster was the first software to focus exclusively on sharing MP3 files for music.\nRail transportation.\nThe opening of the Channel Tunnel between France and the United Kingdom saw the commencement by the three national railway companies of Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, respectively SNCB/NMBS, SNCF and British Rail of the joint Eurostar service.\nOn 14 November 1994 Eurostar services began between Waterloo International station in London, Gare du Nord in Paris and Brussels South in Brussels.\nIn 1995 Eurostar was achieving an average end-to-end speed of between London and Paris.\nOn 8 January 1996 Eurostar launched services from a second railway station in the UK when Ashford International was opened. Journey times between London and Brussels were reduced by the opening of the High Speed 1 line on 14 December 1997.\nAutomobiles.\nThe 1990s began with a recession that dampened car sales. General Motors suffered huge losses because of an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new Saturn division fared well, Oldsmobile fell sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\nChrysler ran into financial troubles as it entered the 1990s. Like GM, the Chrysler too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling minivans) that were largely based on the aging K-car platform. In 1992, chairman Lee Iacocca retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new LH platform and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized Dodge Ram in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, Daimler-Benz (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire Plymouth, which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. Ford continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the second and third generations of the Ford Taurus being named the best-selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the Toyota Camry starting in 1997, which became the best-selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, with the first model being sold in 1991. Ford's Explorer became the best-selling SUV on the market, outselling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee.\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The Honda Accord vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands Lexus and Infiniti began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991 and outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the decade's second half. Many manufacturers that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Fabrication during the 1990s became gradually rounder and ovoid, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as airbags and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\nSociety.\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the Great Recession of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\nEnvironment.\nAt the beginning of the decade, sustainable development and environmental protection became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the Brundtland Report by the United Nations paved the way to establish an environmental governance. In 1992, the Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries committed to protect the environment, signing a Convention on Biological Diversity.\nThe prevention of the destruction of the tropical rainforests of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s and has continued and accelerated in its prominence.\nThe Chernobyl disaster had significant impact on public opinion at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century. Well into the 1990s, several environmental NGOs helped improve environmental awareness among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was Greenpeace, which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drew attention to the large deforestation of the Amazon rainforest during the period.\nGlobal warming as an aspect of climate change also became a major concern, and the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\nThe 1989 EPA total ban on asbestos was overturned in 1991.\nIn 1996, (Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, file BCV 00300) alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium and the case was settled for (US) $333 million, a new record for a direct-action lawsuit.\nBaby boomers.\nMarketing campaigns aimed at young adults in wealthy English-Speaking Countries were informed by unscientific theories about selling to so-called Generation X and Baby boomers. Few people embraced the labels Generation X and Baby Boomer as self-descriptors. Films with characters depicting the Generation X stereotype included \"Slacker\" (1990), \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" (1995) and \"Austin Powers\".\nSlavery and human trafficking.\nSee: History of slavery, Global Slavery Index, Slavery in contemporary Africa, Slavery in Asia, Debt bondage in India, Child labour in Pakistan, Sex trafficking in China, Nike sweatshops\nPakistan's government passed laws to end caste based slavery:\n- 1992 Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act. \n- 1995 Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Rules.\nAdditional significant events.\nEurope\nNorth America\nSouth America\nAsia\nPopular culture.\nFilm.\nLive-action films\nDogme 95 became an important European artistic motion picture movement by the decade's end. Also in 1998, \"Titanic\" by director James Cameron (released in late 1997) became the highest-grossing film of all time, grossing over $1.8 billion worldwide. It would hold this record for over a decade until 2010 when James Cameron's \"Avatar\" (released in December 2009), took the title.\nCrime films were also extremely popular during the 1990s and garnered several awards throughout the decade, such as \"Goodfellas\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"L.A. Confidential\", \"Heat\", \"Boyz n the Hood\", \"Se7en\", \"Thelma &amp; Louise\", \"Fargo\", \"A Simple Plan\", and many others.\nLive-action films featuring computer-animated characters became popular, with films such as \"Casper\", \"101 Dalmatians\", \"Men in Black\" and \"Stuart Little\" proving financially successful. Live-action/traditional cel animated film featuring traditional characters like \"Space Jam\",(1996) \"Evil Toons\", \"Cool World\", and \"The Pagemaster\" were prevalent as well.\nIn Argentina, a new artistic movement appeared in the filmmaking scene, called \",\" which would be greatly influential in Latin American cinema.\nAnimated films\nIn 1994, former Disney employee Jeffrey Katzenberg founded DreamWorks SKG, which would produce its first two animated films: \"The Prince of Egypt\" and \"Antz\" which were both aimed more at adults than children and were both critically and commercially successful. \"Toy Story\", the first full-length CGI movie, made by Pixar, was released in 1995 and revolutionized animated films. In 1998, with the release of DreamWorks's \"Antz\" and Pixar's \"A Bug's Life\", the rivalry between DreamWorks and Pixar began between the studios due to the similarities between both films.\nMeanwhile, films by Pixar's parent company, Disney became popular once more when the studio returned to making family-oriented animated musical films. Disney Animation was navigating the \"Disney Renaissance\", through both animated theatrical films and animated television series on the Disney Channel (owned by Walt Disney Television). The \"Disney Renaissance\" began with \"The Little Mermaid\" in 1989 and ended with \"Tarzan\" in 1999. Films of this era include \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aladdin\", \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" \"The Lion King, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules,\" and \"Mulan\".\nJapanese anime films remained popular throughout the 1990s with the release of Studio Ghibli films such as \"Only Yesterday\", \"Porco Rosso\", \"Pom Poko\", \"Whisper of the Heart\", \"Princess Mononoke\" (which became the highest-grossing anime film at the time) and \"My Neighbors the Yamadas\". Other significant anime films which gained cult status include \"Roujin Z\", ', ', \"Ninja Scroll\", ', \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Memories\", \"The End of Evangelion\", \"Perfect Blue\", and '.\nOther significant animated films have also gained cult status, such as \"The Iron Giant\", ', \"A Goofy Movie\", \"Cats Don't Dance\", \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story\", ', \" Quest for Camelot,\" \"Anastasia\", and \"Kirikou and the Sorceress\". \nOther successful films\nCritically acclaimed and financially successful films that came out in this decade included \"Jurassic Park\" (which was the highest grossing film at the time, before beaten by \"Titanic\" that same decade), \"Forrest Gump\", \"The Mask\", \"The Matrix\", \"Trainspotting\", \"Braveheart\", \"Home Alone\", \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", \"Babe\", ', \"The Silence of the Lambs\", the \"Before\" trilogy (starting in 1995 with \"Before Sunrise\"), \"Philadelphia\", \"Ghost\", \"The Sixth Sense\", \"Scream\", \"Misery\", \"Wayne's World\", ', \"Men in Black\", \"Independence Day\", \"Groundhog Day\", \"Clerks\", \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Schindler's List\", \"Edward Scissorhands\", \"Leaving Las Vegas\", \"The Addams Family\", \"Clueless\", \"The Big Lebowski\", \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", \"Jerry Maguire\", \"\", \"The Green Mile\", and \"The Shawshank Redemption\".\nIn India, Shah Rukh Khan got rise in his stardom by \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\", \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\", and \"Dil To Pagal Hai\".\nHighest-grossing.\nThe 25 highest-grossing films of the decade are:\nMusic.\nMusic artists and genres\nMusic marketing became more segmented in the 1990s, as MTV gradually shifted away from music videos and radio splintered into narrower formats aimed at various niches. However, the 1990s are perhaps best known for grunge, gangsta rap, R&amp;B, teen pop; Eurodance, electronic dance music, the renewed popularity of punk rock from the band Green Day and their 1994 album \"Dookie\" (which would also help create a new genre pop punk), and for the entrance of alternative rock into the mainstream. U2 was one of the most popular 1990s bands; their groundbreaking Zoo TV and PopMart tours were the top-selling tours of 1992 and 1997, respectively. Glam metal died out in the music mainstream by 1991. Grunge became popular in the early 1990s due to the success of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\", Pearl Jam's \"Ten\", Alice in Chains' \"Dirt\", Soundgarden's \"Badmotorfinger\" and Stone Temple Pilots' \"Core\". Pop punk also becomes popular with such artists as Green Day, Blink-182, Weezer, Social Distortion, the Offspring, Bad Religion, NOFX and Rancid. Other successful alternative acts included Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., Nickelback, Creed, Radiohead, Gin Blossoms, Soul Asylum, Goo Goo Dolls, Third Eye Blind, Faith No More, the Smashing Pumpkins, Live, Everclear, Bush, Screaming Trees and Ween.\nRappers Salt-n-Pepa continued to have hit songs until 1994. Dr. Dre's 1992 album \"The Chronic\" provided a template for modern gangsta rap, and gave rise to other emerging artists of the genre, including Snoop Dogg. Due to the success of Death Row Records and Tupac Shakur, West Coast gangsta rap commercially dominated hip hop during the early-to-mid 1990s, along with Bad Boy Records and the Notorious B.I.G. on the East Coast. Hip hop became the best-selling music genre by the mid-1990s.\n1994 became a breakthrough year for punk rock in California, with the success of bands like Bad Religion, Social Distortion, Blink-182, Green Day, the Offspring, Rancid and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade. The 1990s also became the most important decade for ska punk/reggae rock, with the success of many bands like Smash Mouth, Buck-O-Nine, Goldfinger, Less Than Jake, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Murphy's Law, No Doubt, Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, Sublime and Sugar Ray.\nThe rave movement that emerged in the late 1980s continued to grow in popularity. This movement spawned genres such as Intelligent dance music and Drum and bass. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and breakbeat. Popular artists included Moby, Fatboy Slim, Bj\u00f6rk, Aphex Twin, Orbital, the Orb, the Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx, Todd Terry, 808 State, Primal Scream, the Shamen, the KLF and the Prodigy.\nThe rise of industrial music, somewhat a fusion of synthpop and heavy metal, rose to worldwide popularity with bands like Godflesh, Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, Ministry and Marilyn Manson. Groove metal was born through the efforts of Pantera, whose seventh studio album \"Far Beyond Driven\" (1994) was notable for going number one on \"Billboard\" 200. Another heavy metal subgenre called nu metal, which mixed metal with hip hop influences, became popular with bands like Korn, Slipknot and Limp Bizkit selling millions of albums worldwide. Metallica's 1991 eponymous album \"Metallica\" is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era, while extreme metal acts such as Death, Mayhem, Darkthrone, Emperor, Cannibal Corpse and others experienced popularity throughout the decade.\nCountry music.\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to Billy Ray Cyrus, Shania Twain and Garth Brooks. The latter enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade. The RIAA has certified his recordings at a combined (128\u00d7 platinum), denoting roughly 113 million United States shipments.\nOther artists that experienced success during this time included Clint Black, Sammy Kershaw, Aaron Tippin, Travis Tritt, Suzy Bogguss, Alan Jackson, Lorrie Morgan and the newly formed duo of Brooks &amp; Dunn. George Strait, whose career began in the 1980s, also continued to have widespread success in this decade and beyond. Female artists such as Reba McEntire, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Deana Carter, LeAnn Rimes and Mary Chapin Carpenter all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. Rimes, a teenager at the time, spawned a \"teen movement\" in country music; with fellow teen artists Lila McCann, Jessica Andrews, Billy Gillman, and others following suit; a phenomenon that hasn't been duplicated since Tanya Tucker and Marie Osmond in the early 1970s. The Dixie Chicks became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album \"Wide Open Spaces\" went on to become certified 12\u00d7 platinum, while their 1999 album \"Fly\" went on to become 10\u00d7 platinum.\nR&amp;B and related.\nContemporary quiet storm and R&amp;B continued to be quite popular among adult audiences originating from African-American communities, which began during the 1980s. Popular African-American contemporary R&amp;B artists included Mariah Carey, D'Angelo, Lauryn Hill, Whitney Houston, Brandy, En Vogue, TLC, Destiny's Child, Toni Braxton, Boyz II Men, Dru Hill, Vanessa Williams and Janet Jackson.\nAlso, British R&amp;B artists Sade (active since 1982), Des'Ree and Mark Morrison became quite popular during this decade.\nMusic from around the world.\nIn the United Kingdom, the alternative rock Britpop genre emerged as part of the more general Cool Britannia culture, with Pulp (already founded in 1978), Blur (active since 1988), Ocean Colour Scene (since 1989), Suede (existing since 1989 with hiatus), the Verve (1990\u20131993), Oasis (formed in 1991), Elastica (1992\u20132001), Ash (since 1992), Supergrass (1993\u20132022 with hiatus) and Kula Shaker (since 1995) serving as popular examples of this emergence.\nThe impact of boy band pop sensation Take That, founded in 1990, lead to the formation of other boy bands in the UK and Ireland, such as East 17 in 1991 and the Irish boy band Boyzone in 1993. Female pop icons Spice Girls took the world by storm since 1994, becoming the most commercially successful British group since the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. Their global success brought about a widespread scene of teen pop acts around the world such as All Saints, Backstreet Boys (both formed in 1993) as well as American acts as Hanson (from 1992), NSYNC (1995\u20132002, reunited 2003), Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera who came to prominence into the new millennium.\nMany musicians from Canada, such as Celine Dion, Maestro Fresh Wes, Snow, Barenaked Ladies, Shania Twain, Len, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette became known worldwide.\nArgentine rock music continues to be commercially successful and culturally relevant throughout the 1990s. Soda Stereo, the most famous rock band of Latin America reached new heights with their album \"Canci\u00f3n Animal\" in 1990, which contained great anthems of Argentine Rock, such as \"De M\u00fasica Ligera\", \"T\u00e9 para tres\" and \"Entre Can\u00edbales\". Many bands of the Underground scene become mainstream, such as hard rock band, La Renga, post-punk band Los Redondos and alternative rock band Babas\u00f3nicos. Also Charly Garc\u00eda and Fito P\u00e1ez would continue their successful solo careers, the latter with one of hist most famous albums, \"Circo Beat\", and his classic song, .\nIn 1991, Australian children's music group The Wiggles.\nIn Japan, the J-pop genre emerged as part of the more general Heisei Power cultural movement, with B'z, Mr. Children, Southern All Stars, Yumi Matsutoya, Dreams Come True, Glay, Zard, Hikaru Utada, Namie Amuro, SMAP, Chage and Aska, L'Arc-en-Ciel, Masaharu Fukuyama, Globe, Tube, Kome Kome Club, Maki Ohguro, Tatsuro Yamashita, TRF, Speed, Wands, and Field of View became more popular for Japanese youth audiences during the Lost Decades.\nThe Tibetan Freedom Concert, organized by Beastie Boys and the Milarepa Fund, brought 120,000 people together in the interest of increased human rights and autonomy for Tibet from China.\nControversies.\nControversy surrounded the Prodigy with the release of the track \"Smack My Bitch Up\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the song's lyrics, which are themselves sampled from Ultramagnetic MCs' \"Give the Drummer Some\". The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video, the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\nDeaths of artists.\n1991 also saw the death of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury from AIDS-related pneumonia. Next to this Kurt Cobain, Selena, Eazy-E, Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. were the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively. Richey Edwards of Manic Street Preachers was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving Steve Lamacq backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards' disappearance in 1995 was highly publicized. He is still missing but was presumed dead in 2008.\nTelevision.\nComedies and sitcoms\nTV shows, mostly sitcoms, were popular with American audiences. Series such as \"Roseanne\", \"Coach\", \"Empty Nest\", \"Mr. Belvedere\", \"227\", \"Cheers\", \"The Cosby Show\", \"Growing Pains\", \"Night Court\", \"The Hogan Family\", \"Murphy Brown\", \"Full House\", \"The Wonder Years,\" \"A Different World\", \"Amen\", \"ALF\", \"Perfect Strangers\", \"Married... with Children,\" \"Family Matters\", \"Charles in Charge\", \"Saved by the Bell\", \"My Two Dads\", \"Major Dad\", \"Newhart\", \"Dear John\", \"Designing Women\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"Who's the Boss?\", \"Head of the Class\", and \"Seinfeld\", which premiered in the eighties, and \"Frasier\", a spin-off of the 1980s hit \"Cheers\" were viewed throughout the 1990s.\nThese sitcoms, along with \"Friends\", \"That '70s Show\", \"Ellen\", \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", \"Nurses\", \"Living Single\", \"Step by Step\", \"NewsRadio\", \"Blossom\", \"The King of Queens\", \"Fired Up\", \"Jesse\", \"Parker Lewis Can't Lose\", \"For Your Love\", \"The Steve Harvey Show\", \"The Larry Sanders Show\", \"Sex and the City\", \"Arliss\", \"Dream On\", \"Grace Under Fire\", \"Mad About You\", \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\", \"The Naked Truth\", \"The Jeff Foxworthy Show\", \"The Jamie Foxx Show\", \"Smart Guy\", \"The Wayans Bros.\", \"Malcolm &amp; Eddie\", \"Clueless\", \"Moesha\", \"The Parent 'Hood\", \"Unhappily Ever After\", \"Roc\", \"Martin\", \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\", \"In Living Color\", \"Sister, Sister\", \"Boy Meets World\", \"Ned and Stacey\", \"Becker\", \"Veronica's Closet\", \"Two Guys and a Girl\", \"The Drew Carey Show\", \"Wings\", \"The John Larroquette Show\", \"Caroline in the City\", \"Sports Night\", \"Home Improvement\", \"Will &amp; Grace\", \"Evening Shade\", \"Cosby\", \"Spin City\", \"The Nanny\", \"3rd Rock from the Sun\", \"Suddenly Susan\", \"Cybill\", \"Just Shoot Me!\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", and \"Dharma &amp; Greg\", as well as British sitcoms like \"Mr. Bean\", \"Father Ted\", \"Absolutely Fabulous\", \"I'm Alan Partridge\", and \"One Foot in the Grave\", from the 90s turned TV in new directions and defined the humor of the decade.\nFurthermore, \"Saturday Night Live\" experienced a new era of success during the 1990s, launching the careers of popular comedians and actors such as Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Molly Shannon, Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Norm Macdonald, David Spade, Cheri Oteri and others. \nDrama shows\n1993 saw the debut of the medical\u2013mystery drama, \"Diagnosis Murder\", a comeback vehicle for Dick Van Dyke, who guest-starred on an episode of its parent series, \"Jake and the Fatman\", where the show got off to a rocky start and became one of television's long-running mysteries, that lasted until its cancellation in 2001. It was one of a number of shows that made CBS popular with a distinctly older audience than its competitors, with a lineup consisting mainly of murder mysteries, westerns and religious dramas, such as \"Walker, Texas Ranger\", \"Touched by an Angel\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\".\nMedical dramas started to return to television in the 1990s after the end of \"St. Elsewhere\" in 1988. In 1994, \"ER\", which originally starred Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and George Clooney, was instantly a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning similar series to compete against it, such as the more soap opera-esque \"Grey's Anatomy\" (2005\u2013present), and the short lived \"Medicine Ball\" (1995). It was one of the many successful shows during that period (as well as sitcoms such as \"Seinfeld\" and \"Friends\") which made NBC the most-watched channel in the United States. This show launched the career of George Clooney. That same year, \"Chicago Hope\", that starred H\u00e9ctor Elizondo, Mandy Patinkin and Adam Arkin, was also a popular series for CBS, lasting between 1994 and 2000.\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned to the spotlight after soap operas died down. After the successful debuts of \"Law &amp; Order\", \"NYPD Blue,\" \"\", Fox debuted \"New York Undercover, \"which starred Malik Yoba and Micheal DeLorenzo, is notable for featuring two people of color in the main roles. \"Nash Bridges,\" a comeback vehicle for Don Johnson, lasting six seasons (1996\u20132001), dealt with escapist entertainment instead of tackling social issues.\"\"\n\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000. It established the teen soap genre, paving the way for \"Dawson's Creek\", \"Felicity\", \"Party of Five\", and other shows airing later in the decade, and into the 2000s. The show was then remade and renamed simply \"90210\" and premiered in 2008. \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", and its spin-off \"Melrose Place\" also became a popular TV show throughout the 1990s. \"Baywatch\" became the most-watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\"Sex and the City\"'s portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows in the 2000s, such as \"Queer as Folk\" and \"The L Word\".\nOther television shows and genres\nFantasy and science fiction shows were popular on television, with NBC airing \"SeaQuest DSV\" beginning in 1993, which made Jonathan Brandis a popular teen idol, but was cancelled after three seasons. The 1990s saw a multitude of \"Star Trek\" content: in 1993, following the success of ', Paramount released the follow-up shows ' (1993\u20131999) and \"\" (1995\u20132001). \"Touched By an Angel\", broadcast by CBS in 1994, was intended as the comeback vehicle of Della Reese, and also launched the career of Roma Downey. It wasn't an immediate success and was cancelled, but was revived the following year due to a fan letter-writing campaign, and ran for eight more seasons. At the end of the decade, the fantasy drama series Charmed gained a cult following and helped popularize the WB.\nIn 1993, one of the last westerns to air on television was \"Walker, Texas Ranger\", a crime drama starring Chuck Norris as the title character. Running for nine seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects and was one of few shows to feature an actor performing karate stunts at that time.\nReality television was not an entirely new concept (\"An American Family\" aired on PBS in 1973) but proliferated for Generation X audiences with titles such as \"Judge Judy\", \"Eco-Challenge,\" and \"Cops\".\nThe 1990s saw the debut of live-action children's programs such as the educational \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" and \"Blue's Clues\" as well as the superhero show \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", the latter becoming a pop culture phenomenon along with a line of action figures and other toys by Japanese toy manufacturer Bandai. This can also be said for the British pre-school series \"Teletubbies\", which was a massive hit loved by very young children. It also saw long time running shows such as \"Barney &amp; Friends\" and the continuation of \"Sesame Street\", both of which would continue in the following decades and so.\nDuring the mid-1990s, two of the biggest professional wrestling companies: \"World Championship Wrestling\" and \"World Wrestling Federation\" were in a ratings battle that was called the Monday Night War (1995\u20132001). Each company fought to draw more viewers to their respective Monday night wrestling show. The \"War\" ended in 2001 when \"WWE\" bought \"WCW\". In November 2001, there was a Winner Takes All match with both companies in a Pay-Per-View called \"Survivor Series\". WWF won the match, putting an end to WCW.\nThe late 1990s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the quiz show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", hosted originally by Chris Tarrant on ITV in the United Kingdom and Regis Philbin on ABC in the United States, as well as other first-run game shows aired in prime time on the newly launched Game Show Network.\nMany Argentine TV shows and soap operas were greatly successful abroad, such as \"Mu\u00f1eca Brava\", which would become immensely successful in Russia, and would be exported to over 80 countries, and translated to over 50 languages. Similarly, \"Chiquititas\" was broadcast in 36 countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia.\nAnimated shows\nThe animated sitcom, \"The Simpsons\", premiered on Fox in December 1989 and became a domestic and international success in the 1990s. The show has since aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. In addition, it has spawned the adult-oriented animated sitcom genre, inspiring more adult-oriented animated shows such as \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" (1993\u20131997), \"Daria\" (1997\u20132001), along with \"South Park\" and \"Family Guy\", the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2020s.\nCartoons produced in the 1990s are sometimes referred to as the \"Renaissance Age of Animation\" for cartoons in general, particularly for American animated children's programs. Disney Channel, Nickelodeon (owned by Viacom, now Paramount Global) and Cartoon Network (owned by Warner Bros. Discovery) would dominate the animated television industry. These three channels are considered the \"Big Three\", of children's entertainment, even today, but especially during the 1990s.\nOther channels such as Warner Bros. Animation would create shows like \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", \"Animaniacs\" and its spin-off series \"Pinky and the Brain\", and the start of the DC Animated Universe with shows such as ', and ', as well as syndicated shows like \"Phantom 2040\". Nickelodeon's first three animated series known as Nicktoons (\"Doug\", \"Rugrats\", \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\") all premiered on the same day in 1991 along with shows such as \"Rocko's Modern Life\", \"Hey Arnold!\", \"CatDog\", \"The Wild Thornberrys\", and in 1999 saw the debut of Nickelodeon's well known animated comedy series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". Cartoon Network would create shows like \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\", \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\", \"Johnny Bravo,\" and \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\". Disney Channel would make shows like \"Recess\", \"Pepper Ann\", \"Darkwing Duck\", \"TaleSpin\", and \"Gargoyles\". The 1990s also saw animated shows such as \"Oggy and the Cockroaches\", \"Bobby's World\", \"Arthur\" and \"Simsala Grimm\", achieve popularity, alongside British stop-motion animated film series \"Wallace &amp; Gromit\", which has spawned over four short films and two feature-length films.\nJapanese anime was popular in the 1980s and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US. It featured well-produced, well-written, visual, and story content that came to showcase animation's potential for emotional and intellectual depth and integrity on par with live action media to its viewers. Anime expanded to older and adult audiences in the medium of animation. Anime shows such as \"Sailor Moon\", \"Digimon\", \"Pok\u00e9mon\", \"Tenchi Muyo!\", \"Berserk\", \"Trigun\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"Gundam Wing\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", \"Ranma \u00bd\", \"Yu Yu Hakusho\", \"Slayers\", \"Rurouni Kenshin\", \"Initial D\", \"Gunsmith Cats\", \"Slam Dunk\", ', \"Outlaw Star\", to anime movies such as \"Akira\", \"Vampire Hunter D\", ', \"My Neighbor Totoro\", \"Princess Mononoke\", \"Castle in the Sky\", \"The Castle of Cagliostro\", and imports by various distributors such as Viz, AnimEigo, Central Park Media, A.D. Vision, Pioneer Entertainment, Media Blasters, Manga Entertainment, and Celebrity, helped begin the mid to late 1990s and turn of the millennium introductory anime craze in the US, and the Cartoon Network anime programming block Toonami in 1997.\nFashion and body modification.\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1990s include:\nVideo games.\nVideo game consoles\nVideo game consoles released in this decade include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Neo Geo, Atari Jaguar, 3DO, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast. Portable video game consoles include the Game Gear, Atari Lynx and Game Boy Color. \"Super Mario World\" was the decade's best-selling home console video game, while \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" was the decade's best-selling portable video game; \"Super Mario 64\" was the decade's best-selling fifth-generation video game, while \"Street Fighter II\" was the decade's highest-grossing arcade video game.\nThe console wars, primarily between Sega (Mega Drive, marketed as the Sega Genesis in North America, introduced in 1988) and Nintendo (Super NES, introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of Sony with the PlayStation in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to cartridges). By the end of the decade, Sega's hold on the market becomes tenuous after the end of the Saturn in 1999 and the Dreamcast in 2002.\nArcade games rapidly decreased in popularity, mainly due to the dominance of handheld and home consoles.\nVideo games\nMario as Nintendo's mascot finds a rival in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog with the release of \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" would go on to become one of the most successful video game franchises of the decade and of all time.\nNotable video games of the 1990s include: \"Super Metroid\", \"Metal Gear Solid\", \"Super Mario World\", \"Doom\", \"Donkey Kong Country\", \"Donkey Kong 64\", \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Blue\" Versions, Super Smash Bros, \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow Version\", \"GoldenEye 007\", \"Super Mario 64\", \"\", \"Gran Turismo\", \"Mario Kart 64\", \"Half-Life\", \"Super Mario Kart\", \"Radiant Silvergun\", \"Rayman\", \"Gunstar Heroes\", \"Banjo-Kazooie\", \"Soulcalibur\", \"Star Fox\" series, \"Tomb Raider\" series, \"Final Fantasy\", \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, \"Story of Seasons\" series, \"Tony Hawk's\" series, \"Crash Bandicoot\" series, \"Metal Slug\" series, \"Resident Evil\" series, \"Street Fighter II\", \"Spyro the Dragon\" series, \"Commander Keen\" series, \"Test Drive\" series, \"Dance Dance Revolution\" series, \"Monkey Island\" series, \"Dune\" series, \"Mortal Kombat\" series, \"Warcraft\" series, \"Duke Nukem 3D\", \"Tekken\" series, \"EarthBound\", \"Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game\", and \"StarCraft\".\nSony's PlayStation becomes the top-selling video game console and changes the standard media storage type from cartridges to compact discs (CDs) in home consoles. \"Crash Bandicoot\" is released on 9 September 1996, becoming one of the most successful platforming series for the Sony PlayStation. \"Spyro The Dragon\", released on 9 September 1998, also became a successful platforming series. \"Tomb Raider\"'s Lara Croft became a video game sex symbol, becoming one of the most recognizable figures in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon\" enters the world scene with the release of the original \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Green\" for Game Boy in Japan in 1996, later changed to \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Blue\" for worldwide release in 1998. It soon becomes popular in the United States and Canada, creating the term \"Pok\u00e9mania\", and is adapted into a popular anime series and trading card game, among other media forms.\n\"Resident Evil\" is released in 1996 and \"Resident Evil 2\". Both games became the most highly acclaimed survival-horror series on the PlayStation at the time it was released. It is credited with defining the survival horror genre and with returning zombies to popular culture, leading to a renewed interest in zombie films by the 2000s.\nVideo game genres\n3D graphics become the standard by the decade's end. Although FPS games had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres began to copy this trend by the end of the decade. The most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are \"GoldenEye 007\" and \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six\".\nThe violent nature of fighting games like Capcom's \"Street Fighter II\", Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\", and Midway's \"Mortal Kombat\" prompted the video game industry to accept a game rating system. Hundreds of knockoffs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. \"Doom\" (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the FPS genre. \"Half-Life\" (1998) builds upon this, using gameplay without levels and an immersive first-person perspective. Half-Life became one of the most popular FPS games in history.\nThe real-time strategy (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of \"Dune II\". ' (1994) popularizing the genre, and \"Command &amp; Conquer\" and ' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. \"StarCraft\" in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games today, especially in South Korea. \"Homeworld\" in 1999 becomes the first successful 3D RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the turn-based strategy (TBS) genre, popularized with \"Civilization\" in 1991. \"Final Fantasy\" was introduced (in North America) in 1990 for the NES and remains among the most popular video game franchises, with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. \"Final Fantasy VII\", released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\nMassively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) see their entrance with \"Ultima Online\" in 1997. However, they do not gain widespread popularity until \"EverQuest\" and \"Asheron's Call\" in 1999. MMORPGs become among the most popular video game genres until the 2010s.\nThe best-selling games of the 1990s are listed below (note that some sources disagree on particular years):\nPeople.\nScientists and engineers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors and directors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAthletes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians.\nThe 1990s saw the rise of diverse musical trends, identifiable through the decade's top-selling pop songs and the continued prominence of established genres such as gangsta rap, grunge, industrial rock, and deep house. Alternative hip hop gained visibility at the start of the decade, while the public's interest in independent music surged as a counter to commercial radio payola. \nSome of the notable artists and bands of the 1990s include AC/DC, Ace of Base, Alanis Morissette, Alice in Chains, Backstreet Boys,Madonna, Beck, Blur, Britney Spears, Celine Dion, Daft Punk, Depeche Mode, Destiny's Child, Eminem, Foo Fighters, Green Day,Goo Goo Dolls, Johnny Hallyday, Lauryn Hill, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nirvana, Oasis, Pearl Jam, Sound Garden, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Spice Girls, Texas, The Smashing Pumpkins, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., U2, Nas, and Wu-Tang Clan.

{"id": "34557", "revid": "46930796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34557", "title": "1980s", "text": "Decade of the Gregorian calendar (1980\u20131989)\nDecade\nThe 1980s (pronounced \"nineteen-eighties\", shortened to \"the '80s\" or \"the Eighties\") was the decade that began on January 1, 1980, and ended on December 31, 1989.\nThe decade saw a dominance of conservatism and free market economics, socioeconomic changes due to advances in technology and a worldwide move away from planned economies and towards laissez-faire capitalism in comparison to the 1970s. As economic deconstruction increased in the developed world, multiple multinational corporations associated with the manufacturing industry relocated into Thailand, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. Japan and West Germany saw large economic growth during this decade. The AIDS epidemic became recognized in the 1980s and has since killed an estimated 40.4 million people (as of 2022[ [update]]). The global warming theory began to spread within the scientific and political community in the 1980s.\nThe United Kingdom and the United States moved closer to supply-side economic policies, beginning a trend towards global instability of international trade that would pick up more steam in the following decade as the fall of the USSR made right-wing economic policy more powerful.\nThe final decade of the Cold War opened with the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely without any interruption. Superpower tensions escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped the policy of d\u00e9tente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, but the second half of the decade saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse of Soviet communism.\nDeveloping countries across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Ethiopia witnessed widespread famine in the mid-1980s during the corrupt rule of Mengistu Haile Mariam, resulting in the country having to depend on foreign aid to provide food to its population and worldwide efforts to address and raise money to help Ethiopians, such as the Live Aid concert in 1985.\nMajor civil discontent and violence occurred, including the Angolan Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War, the Moro conflict, the Salvadoran Civil War, the Ugandan Bush War, the insurgency in Laos, the Iran\u2013Iraq War, the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, the 1982 Lebanon War, the Falklands War, the Second Sudanese Civil War, the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, and the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. Islamism became a powerful political force in the 1980s and many jihadist organizations, including Al Qaeda, were formed.\nBy 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc, and the desire for democracy in socialist states, combined with economic recession, resulted in Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika, which reduced Communist Party power, legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of capitalism such as joint ventures with companies from capitalist countries. After tension for most of the decade, by 1988 relations between the communist and capitalist blocs had improved significantly and the Soviet Union was increasingly unwilling to defend its governments in satellite states.\n1989 brought the overthrow and attempted overthrow of a number of communist-led governments, such as in Hungary, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China, the Czechoslovak \"Velvet Revolution\", Erich Honecker's East German regime, Poland's Soviet-backed government, and the violent overthrow of the Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu regime in Romania. Destruction of the 155-km Berlin Wall, at the end of the decade, signaled a seismic geopolitical shift. The Cold War ended in the early 1990s with the successful Reunification of Germany and the USSR's demise after the August Coup of 1991.\nThe 1980s was an era of tremendous population growth around the world, surpassing the 1970s and 1990s, and arguably being the largest in human history. During the 1980s, the world population grew from 4.4 to 5.3 billion people. There were approximately 1.33 billion births and 480 million deaths. Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually. The 1980s saw the advent of the ongoing practice of sex-selective abortion in China and India as ultrasound technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls.\nThe 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology. After years of animal experimentation since 1985, the first genetic modification of 10 adult human beings took place in May 1989, a gene tagging experiment which led to the first true gene therapy implementation in September 1990. The first \"designer babies\", a pair of female twins, were created in a laboratory in late 1989 and born in July 1990 after being sex-selected via the controversial assisted reproductive technology procedure preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Gestational surrogacy was first performed in 1985 with the first birth in 1986, making it possible for a woman to become a biological mother without experiencing pregnancy for the first time in history.\nThe global internet took shape in academia by the second half of the 1980s, as well as many other computer networks of both academic and commercial use such as USENET, Fidonet, and the bulletin board system. By 1989, the Internet and the networks linked to it were a global system with extensive transoceanic satellite links and nodes in most developed countries. Based on earlier work, from 1980 onwards Tim Berners-Lee formalized the concept of the World Wide Web by 1989. Television viewing became commonplace in the Third World, with the number of TV sets in China and India increasing by 15 and 10 times respectively.\nThe Atari Video Computer System console became widespread in the first part of the decade, often simply called \"Atari\". The 1980 Atari VCS port of \"Space Invaders\" was its first killer app. The video game crash of 1983 ended the system's popularity and decimated the industry until the Nintendo Entertainment System re-established the console market in North America. The hand-held Game Boy launched in 1989. \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Tetris\" were the decade's best selling games. \"Pac-Man\" was the highest grossing arcade game. Home computers became commonplace. The 1981 IBM PC led to a large market for IBM PC compatibles. The 1984 release of the Macintosh popularized the WIMP style of interaction.\nPolitics and wars.\nWars.\nThe most prominent armed conflicts of the decade include:\nInternational wars.\nThe most notable wars of the decade include:\nCivil wars and guerrilla wars.\nThe most notable internal conflicts of the decade include:\nTerrorist attacks.\nThe most notable terrorist attacks of the decade include:\nCoups.\nThe most prominent coups d'\u00e9tat of the decade include:\nPolitics.\nAsia.\nAfrica\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nScience and technology.\nMedicine and biology.\nThe 1980s had many fundamental advances in medicine and biology. The first surrogate pregnancy of an unrelated child took place on 13 April 1986, in Michigan. The first genetically modified crops, tobacco (\"Nicotiana\") plants were grown in China in 1988.\nGene therapy techniques became established by the end of the 1980s, allowing gene tagging and gene therapy to become a possibility, both of which were first performed in human beings in May 1989 and September 1990, respectively.\nElectronics and computers.\nArcade and video games had been growing in popularity since the late 1970s, and by 1982 were a major industry. In the United States, a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers, caused a tremendous crash in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by Nintendo, whose Famicom console and mascot Mario had been enjoying considerable success in Japan, which did not have an equivalent crash, since 1983. Renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), it would claim 90% of the American video game market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive popularity. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to arcades, and became one of the most popular video games of all time. Also in 1980, Game &amp; Watch was created; it was not one of the best known game systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. \"Donkey Kong\", released in 1981, was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for Nintendo. \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Duck Hunt\", \"Dragon Quest\", \"The Legend of Zelda\", and the \"Mega Man\" series would become major hits for the console.\nThe personal computer experienced explosive growth in the 1980s, transitioning from a hobbyist's toy to a full-fledged consumer product. The IBM PC, launched in 1981, became the dominant computer for professional users. Commodore created the most popular home computers of both 8-bit and 16-bit generations. MSX standard was the dominant computer platform in Japan and in most parts of Asia. Apple Computer superseded its Apple II and Lisa models by introducing the first Macintosh computer in 1984. It was the first commercially successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI) and mouse, which started to become general features in computers after the middle of the decade. Electronics and computers were also at the forefront of the advertising industry, with many commercials like \"1984\" from Apple achieving acclaim and pop-culture relevance.\nWalkman and boomboxes, invented during the late 1970s, became very popular as they were introduced to various countries in the early 1980s, and had a profound impact on the music industry and youth culture. Consumer VCRs and video rental stores became commonplace as VHS won out over the competing Betamax standard. In addition, in the early 1980s various companies began selling compact, modestly priced synthesizers to the public. This, along with the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition.\nHigh definition television (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the 1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s.\nIn 1981, Hayes Microcomputer Products started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the way for the modern modems that exist today, mainly because it was the first modem to transform what had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem contributed to the rise in popularity of BBS systems in the 1980s and early 1990s, which were the main way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the Internet and the World Wide Web finally became popular in the mid-1990s.\nThe 1980s witnessed a rapid expansion in the communications industry. Almost a decade after Martin Cooper, then an employee of Motorola, made the first mobile phone call in 1973, Millicom Inc., a telecommunications agency, and E.F. Johnson &amp; Co., \u00a0introduced the first portable cellular phone commercially available for use on a cellular network, the \"Lunch Box\" in 1981. Two years later, Motorola launched the DynaTAC 8000X or the \"Brick,\" the first commercially available handheld mobile phone weighing 3 pounds (1.4\u00a0kg). While revolutionary, these early products were bulky and challenging to handle. This led to fierce competition in the market, with companies vying to produce a lighter, more portable phone, setting the stage for the future of mobile technology.\nThe race for a slimmer version of the portable cell phone was underway, and technology entrepreneur Jan Stenbeck was determined to lead the charge. Stenbeck founded the tech start-up Technophone with a singular goal in mind: to create a lightweight, pocket-sized mobile phone. In 1986, under the guidance of Technophones chief executive officer, Nils Martensson, the company unveiled the first pocket-sized mobile phone, the Excell PCT105.\nSpace exploration.\nAmerican interplanetary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known. After making a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980\u20131981. \"Voyager 2\" reached Uranus in 1986 (just a few days before the \"Challenger\" disaster), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited the Solar System.\nNo American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and the Viking probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operations by 1982. The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but they failed.\nThe arrival of Halley's Comet in 1986 was met by a series of Soviet, Japanese and European Space Agency (ESA) probes, namely Halley Armada.\nAfter a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronauts resumed with the launch of the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" in April 1981. The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, with three more orbiters entering service in 1983\u20131985. But that all came to an end with the tragic loss of the \"Challenger\" (STS-51-L) on 28 January 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, including Christa McAuliffe, who was to have been the first teacher in space. In full view of the world, a faulty O-ring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause it to explode, destroying the shuttle in the process. Extensive efforts were made to improve NASA's increasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer. Flights resumed with the launch of \"Discovery\" in September 1988.\nThe Soviet program with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks. The Salyut 6 space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by Salyut 7 in 1982. Then came \"Mir\" in 1986, which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Soviet space stations that had begun in 1971. One of the Soviet Union's last \"superprojects\" was the \"Buran\" space shuttle; it was only used once, in 1988.\nAutomobiles.\nThe American auto industry began in the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality control, rising import competition, and a severe economic downturn. Chrysler and American Motors (AMC) were near bankruptcy, and Ford was little better off. Only General Motors (GM) continued with business as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales in the United States hit a new record. However, the Japanese were now a major presence, and would begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai became the first Korean auto maker to enter the American market. In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built Yugo was brought to the US, but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes. It was sold up to 1991, when economic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.\nAs the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design. In 1983, Ford design teams began to incorporate aerodynamic styling to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird was one of the first cars to receive these design changes.

Other anime series from the 1980s include \"Wowser\", \"Ulysses 31\", \"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\", \"Dominion\", \"Voltron\", \"Super Dimension Fortress Macross\", \"Fist of the North Star\", \"Gundam\" and \"Star Blazers\".\nVideo gaming.\nPopular video games include \"Pac-Man\", \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Final Fantasy\", \"Castlevania\", \"Metroid\", \"Mega Man\", \"Donkey Kong\", \"Frogger\", and \"Tetris\".\n\"Pac-Man\" was the first game to achieve widespread popularity in mainstream culture and the first game character to be popular in his own right.\nHandheld electronic LCD games was introduced into the youth market segment. The primary gaming computers of the 1980s emerged in 1982: the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.\nNintendo finally decided in 1985 to release its Famicom (released in 1983 in Japan) in the United States under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\" and it suddenly became a success. The NES dominated the American and Japanese market until the rise of the next generation of consoles in the early 1990s, causing some to call this time the \"Nintendo era\". Sega released its 16-bit console, Mega Drive/Genesis, in 1988 in Japan and in North America in 1989.\nIn 1989, Nintendo released the Game Boy, a monochrome handheld console.\nFashion.\nThe beginning of the decade saw the continuation of the clothing styles of the late 1970s and evolved into heavy metal fashion by the end. However, fashion became more extravagant during the 1980s. The 1980s included teased and colourfully dyed hair, ripped jeans, neon clothing and many colours and different designs which at first were not accepted.\nSignificant hairstyle trends of the 1980s include the perm, the mullet, the Jheri curl, the hi-top fade, big hair and the Seiko-chan cut.\nSignificant clothing trends of the 1980s include shoulder pads, jean jackets, leather pants, leather aviator jackets, jumpsuits, Members Only jackets, skin-tight acid-washed jeans, Izod Lacoste and \"preppy\" polo shirts, leggings and leg warmers (popularized in the film \"Flashdance\"), off-the-shoulder shirts, and cut sweatshirts (popularized in the same film).\nMiniskirts returned to mainstream fashion in the mid-1980s after a ten-year absence, mostly made of denim material. From that point on, miniskirts and minidresses have remained in mainstream fashion to this day.\nMakeup on the 1980s was aggressive, shining and colourful. Women emphasised their lips, eyebrows and cheeks with makeup. They used much blush and eyeliner.\nAdditional trends of the 1980s include athletic headbands, Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses (popularized in the film \"Top Gun\"), Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses (popularized in the films \"Risky Business\" and \"The Blues Brothers\" and the TV series \"Miami Vice\") and Swatch watches. Girls and women also wore jelly shoes, large crucifix necklaces, and brassieres all inspired by Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" music video.\nThe New Romantic movement was a British style in fashion and music influenced by futurist disco.\nToys.\nThe Rubik's Cube became a popular fad throughout the decade. Toys include .\nCultural start and end of the decade.\nSome sources claim the existence of a \"long 1980s\". Dates given include, for example, mid 1970s to early 1990s, 1976 to 1993 or 1994, and 1979 to 1990 or 1991 or after 2000.\nThe Chicago Sun-Times declared the 1977 \"Star Wars\" as the first movie of the eighties. A shift in television happened in the late 1970s as well: of the top shows considered to be \"shows of the 1980s\", more began 1978\u20131979 than began 1980\u20131981. 1977 also saw the introduction of ROM cartridge-based video game consoles, with the Atari Video Computer System, the Fairchild Channel F, and the Bally Astrocade, as well as seeing the introduction of the first mass-produced home computers, with the Apple II, the TRS-80, and the Commodore PET.\nSome consider the 1980s to have ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, or with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Reagan's last day in office 20 January 1989, marked the \"end of an era\". Music saw a change, with the premier of \"Yo! MTV Raps\" on 6 August 1988. On the religious front, 1988 also saw the \"unraveling of the decade's conservative dominance\" with the release of \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and the three televangelist scandals of Jim Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart, and Oral Roberts. The years 1988\u20131993 were a cultural bridge between the politically conservative 1980s and the Internet boom of the 1990s, which was kicked off by the release of Mosaic in 1993.\nLegacy.\nThere is 1980s nostalgia in Germany, Japan, the UK, the US and elsewhere.\nSee also.\nTimeline.\nThe following articles contain timelines for each year of the decade:\n1980 \u2022 1981 \u2022 1982 \u2022 1983 \u2022 1984 \u2022 1985 \u2022 1986 \u2022 1987 \u2022 1988 \u2022 1989\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the 10th and last century in the 2nd millennium and was marked by new models of scientific understanding, unprecedented scopes of warfare, new modes of communication that would operate at nearly instant speeds, and new forms of art and entertainment. Population growth was also unprecedented, as the century started with around 1.6 billion people, and ended with around 6.2 billion.\nThe 20th century was dominated by significant geopolitical events that reshaped the political and social structure of the globe: World War I, the Spanish flu pandemic, World War II and the Cold War. Unprecedented advances in science and technology defined the century, including the advent of nuclear weapons and nuclear power, space exploration, the shift from analog to digital computing and the continuing advancement of transportation, including powered flight and the automobile. The Earth's sixth mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction, continued, and human conservation efforts increased. \nMajor themes of the century included decolonization, nationalism, globalization and new forms of intergovernmental organizations. Democracy spread, and women were given the right to vote in many countries in the world. Cultural homogenization began through developments in emerging transportation and information and communications technology, with popular music and other influences of Western culture, international corporations, and what is arguably a truly global economy by the end of the 20th century. Poverty was reduced and the century saw rising standards of living, world population growth, awareness of environmental degradation and ecological extinction. Automobiles, airplanes, and home appliances became common, and video and audio recording saw mass adoption. These developments were made possible by the exploitation of fossil fuel resources, which offered energy in an easily portable form, but also caused concern about pollution and long-term impact on the environment. Humans started to explore space, taking their first footsteps on the Moon. Great advances in electricity generation and telecommunications allowed for near-instantaneous worldwide communication, ultimately leading to the Internet. Meanwhile, advances in medical technology resulted in the near-eradication and eradication of many infectious diseases, as well as opening the avenue of biological genetic engineering. Scientific discoveries, such as the theory of relativity and quantum physics, profoundly changed the foundational models of physical science, forcing scientists to realize that the universe is more complex than previously believed, and dashing the hopes (or fears) at the end of the 19th century that the last few details of scientific knowledge were about to be filled in.\nSummary.\nAt the beginning of the period, the British Empire is the world's most powerful nation, having acted as the world's policeman for the past century.\nTechnological advancements during World War I changed the way war is fought, as new inventions such as tanks, chemical weapons, and aircraft modified tactics and strategy. After more than four years of trench warfare in Western Europe, and up to 17 million dead, the powers that had formed the Triple Entente (France, Britain, and Russia, later replaced by the United States and joined by Italy and Romania) emerged victorious over the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria). In addition to annexing many of the colonial possessions of the vanquished states, the Triple Entente exacted punitive restitution payments from them, plunging Germany in particular into economic depression. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were dismantled at the war's conclusion. The Russian Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime of Nicholas II and the onset of the Russian Civil War. The victorious Bolsheviks then established the Soviet Union, the world's first communist state.\nFascism, a movement which grew out of post-war angst and which accelerated during the Great Depression of the 1930s, gained momentum in Italy, Germany, and Spain in the 1920s and 1930s, culminating in World War II, sparked by Nazi Germany's aggressive expansion at the expense of its neighbors. Meanwhile, Japan had rapidly transformed itself into a technologically advanced industrial power and, along with Germany and Italy, formed the Axis powers. Japan's military expansionism in East Asia and the Pacific Ocean brought it into conflict with the United States, culminating in a surprise attack which drew the US into World War II.\nAfter some years of dramatic military success, Germany is defeated in 1945, having been invaded by the Soviet Union and Poland from the East and by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and France from the West. After the victory of the Allies in Europe, the war in Asia ended with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan by the US, the first nation to develop nuclear weapons and the only one to use them in warfare. In total, World War II left some 60 million people dead.\nFollowing World War II, the United Nations, successor to the League of Nations, is established as an international forum in which the world's nations could discuss issues diplomatically. It enacted resolutions on such topics as the conduct of warfare, environmental protection, international sovereignty, and human rights. Peacekeeping forces consisting of troops provided by various countries, with various United Nations and other aid agencies, helped to relieve famine, disease, and poverty, and to suppress some local armed conflicts. Europe slowly united, economically and, in some ways, politically, to form the European Union, which consisted of 15 European countries by the end of the 20th century.\nAfter the war, Germany is occupied and divided between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe became Soviet puppet states under communist rule. Western Europe is rebuilt with the aid of the American Marshall Plan, resulting in a major post-war economic boom, and many of the affected nations became close allies of the United States.\nWith the Axis defeated and Britain and France rebuilding, the United States and the Soviet Union were left standing as the world's only superpowers. Allies during the war, they soon became hostile to one another as their competing ideologies of communism and democratic capitalism proliferated in Europe, which became divided by the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. They formed competing military alliances (NATO and the Warsaw Pact) which engaged in a decades-long standoff known as the Cold War. The period is marked by a new arms race as the USSR became the second nation to develop nuclear weapons, which were produced by both sides in sufficient numbers to end most human life on the planet had a large-scale nuclear exchange ever occurred. Mutually assured destruction is credited by many historians as having prevented such an exchange, each side being unable to strike first at the other without ensuring an equally devastating retaliatory strike. Unable to engage one another directly, the conflict played out in a series of proxy wars around the world\u2014particularly in China, Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, and Afghanistan\u2014as the USSR sought to export communism while the US attempted to contain it. The technological competition between the two sides led to substantial investment in research and development which produced innovations that reached far beyond the battlefield, such as space exploration and the Internet.\nIn the latter half of the century, most of the European-colonized world in Africa and Asia gained independence in a process of decolonization. Meanwhile, globalization opened the door for several nations to exert a strong influence over many world affairs. The US's global military presence spread American culture around the world with the advent of the Hollywood motion picture industry and Broadway, jazz, rock music, and pop music, fast food and hippy counterculture, hip-hop, house music, and disco, as well as street style, all of which came to be identified with the concepts of popular culture and youth culture. After the Soviet Union collapsed under internal pressure in 1991, most of the communist governments it had supported around the world were dismantled\u2014with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, and Laos\u2014followed by difficult transitions into market economies.\nNature of innovation and change.\nDue to continuing industrialization and expanding trade, many significant changes of the century were, directly or indirectly, economic and technological in nature. Inventions such as the light bulb, the automobile, mechanical computers, and the telephone in the late 19th century, followed by supertankers; airliners; motorways; radio communication and broadcasting; television; digital computers; air conditioning; antibiotics; nuclear power; frozen food; microcomputers; the Internet and the World Wide Web; and mobile telephones affected people's quality of life across the developed world. The quantity of goods consumed by the average person expanded massively. Scientific research, engineering professionalization and technological development\u2014much of it motivated by the Cold War arms race\u2014drove changes in everyday life.\nSocial change.\nStarting from the century, strong discrimination based on race and sex is significant in most societies. Although the Atlantic slave trade had ended in the 19th century, movements for equality for non-white people in the white-dominated societies of North America, Europe, and South Africa continued. By the end of the 20th century, in many parts of the world, women had the same legal rights as men, and racism had come to be seen as unacceptable, a sentiment often backed up by legislation. When the Republic of India is constituted, the disadvantaged classes of the caste system in India became entitled to affirmative action benefits in education, employment and government.\nAttitudes toward pre-marital sex changed rapidly in many societies during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Attitudes towards homosexuality also began to change in the later part of the century.\nTrauma brought on by events like World War I and World War II, with their military death tolls alone at bare minimum being 29,697,963, and the Spanish Flu, whose death count alone exceeded that, helped make society in many countries more egalitarian and less neglectful of the poor.\nEarth at the end of the 20th century.\nEconomic growth and technological progress had radically altered daily lives. Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history. The people of the Indian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the 20th century, had attained an indigenous independence for the first time in centuries. China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, is finally open to the world, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order. With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left in new nation states.\nThe world is undergoing its second major period of globalization; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I. Since the US is in a dominant position, a major part of the process is Americanization. The influence of China and India is also rising, as the world's largest populations were rapidly integrating with the world economy.\nTerrorism, dictatorship, and the spread of nuclear weapons were pressing global issues. The world is still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts.\nDisease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world. New viruses such as the West Nile virus continued to spread. Malaria and other diseases affected large populations. Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The virus is becoming an epidemic in southern Africa.\nBased on research done by climate scientists, the majority of the scientific community consider that in the long term environmental problems pose a serious threat. One argument is that of global warming occurring due to human-caused emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels. This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign the Kyoto treaty, which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.\nWorld population increased from about 1.6\u00a0billion people in 1901 to 6.1\u00a0billion at the century's end.\nWars and politics.\nThe number of people killed during the century by government actions is in the hundreds of millions. This includes deaths caused by wars, genocide, politicide and mass murders. The deaths from acts of war during the two world wars alone have been estimated at between 50 and 80 million. Political scientist Rudolph Rummel estimated 262,000,000 deaths caused by democide, which excludes those killed in war battles, civilians unintentionally killed in war and killings of rioting mobs. According to Charles Tilly, \"Altogether, about 100 million people died as a direct result of action by organized military units backed by one government or another over the course of the century. Most likely a comparable number of civilians died of war-induced disease and other indirect effects.\" It is estimated that approximately 70 million Europeans died through war, violence and famine between 1914 and 1945.\nCulture and entertainment.\nMusic.\nThe invention of music recording technologies such as the phonograph record, and dissemination technologies such as radio broadcasting, massively expanded the audience for music. Prior to the 20th century, music is generally only experienced in live performances. Many new genres of music were established during the 20th century.\nFilm, television and theatre.\nFilm as an artistic medium is created in the 20th century. The first modern movie theatre is established in Pittsburgh in 1905. Hollywood developed as the center of American film production. While the first films were in black and white, technicolor is developed in the 1920s to allow for color films. Sound films were developed, with the first full-length feature film, \"The Jazz Singer\", released in 1927. The Academy Awards were established in 1929. Animation is also developed in the 1920s, with the first full-length cel animated feature film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", released in 1937. Computer-generated imagery is developed in the 1980s, with the first full-length CGI-animated film \"Toy Story\" released in 1995.\nVideo games.\nVideo games\u2014due to the great technological steps forward in computing since the second post-war period\u2014are one of the new forms of entertainment that emerged in the 20th century alongside films.\nScience.\nMathematics.\nMultiple new fields of mathematics were developed in the 20th century. In the first part of the 20th century, measure theory, functional analysis, and topology were established, and significant developments were made in fields such as abstract algebra and probability. The development of set theory and formal logic led to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.\nLater in the 20th century, the development of computers led to the establishment of a theory of computation. Computationally-intense results include the study of fractals and a proof of the four color theorem in 1976.\nEngineering and technology.\nOne of the prominent traits of the 20th century is the dramatic growth of technology. Organized research and practice of science led to advancement in the fields of communication, electronics, engineering, travel, medicine, and war.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34562", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34562", "title": "Death rates in the 20th century", "text": "Death rates in the 20th century is the ratio of deaths compared to the population around the world throughout the 20th century. When giving these ratios, they are most commonly expressed by number of deaths per 1,000 people per year. Many factors contribute to death rates such as cause of death, increasing the death rate, an ageing population, which could increase and decrease the death rates by birth rates, and improvements in public health, decreasing the death rate.\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, as of July\u00a02012[ [update]], the global crude death rate is 7.99 deaths/1,000 population. The crude death rate represents the total number of deaths per year per thousand people. Comparatively, the crude death rate in the year 1900 was 17.2 deaths/1,000 population and 9.6 deaths/1,000 population in 1950 in the United States.\nHighest crude death rates worldwide.\nThe World Fact Book \nCause of death.\nThroughout the 20th century in the developed world, the leading causes of death transitioned from infectious diseases such as influenza, to degenerative diseases such as cancer or diabetes. In 1900, the leading cause of death in the United States was influenza with 202.2 deaths per 100,000 people followed by tuberculosis with 194.4, which is a curable illness today. In the middle of 20th century America, the leading cause of death was heart disease with 355.5 deaths per 100,000 followed by cancer at 139.8 deaths per 100,000. Although death rates dropped significantly in the latter part of the 20th century, the leading killers are still constant. The United States saw 192.9 people per 100,000 die from heart disease in 2010 followed by cancer with 185.9 people per 100,000.\nAn estimated 70 to 120 million people died from famine in the 20th century, of whom over half died in China. Malnutrition and hunger was also a leading cause of the global infant mortality and child mortality.\nThe world population in the 20th century experienced a large amount of death due to two major world wars. World War II was responsible for the most war related deaths in the 1900s with a death toll between 40,000,000 and 85,000,000 deaths. Other predominate wars in the 1900s include World War I with up to 22,000,000 deaths, the Russian Civil War with up to 9,000,000 deaths, the Afghan Civil War with up to 2,000,000 deaths, and the Mexican Revolution with up to 2,000,000 deaths. Several other major wars took place in the 20th century, such as the Iran\u2013Iraq War, the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, the second Sudanese Civil War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\nIt is estimated that traffic collisions caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century.\nAgeing population.\nA natural population increase occurs when birth rates are higher than death rates. Recently and most notably, the years immediately after World War II saw an explosion in fertility rates called the Baby Boom because the returning soldiers and displaced people started new families. Death rates were significantly lower during the baby boom and thus populations increased substantially. Today these baby boomers are approaching old age and driving up the average age of the overall population. The World Bank predicts a dramatic decrease in population size from the increase in death rates over the next decade.\nFertility rates and consequently live birth rates declined over the century, while age-adjusted death rates fell more dramatically. Children in 1999 were 10 times less likely to die than children in 1900.\nFor adults 24\u201365, death rates have been halved. The death rate for Americans aged 65 to 74 fell from nearly 7% per year to fewer than 2% per year.\nImprovements in public health.\nDuring the 20th century, an enormous improvement in public health led to an overall decrease in death rates. Infant mortality rates and maternal mortality rates have dramatically decreased. In the early 1900s, 6\u20139 women died in pregnancy-related complications for every 1,000 births, while 100 infants died before they were 1 year old. In 1999, at the end of the century, the infant mortality rate in the United States declined more than 90% to 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births. Similarly, maternal mortality rates declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported deaths per 1,000 live births.\nThere are a variety of causes for this steep decline in death rates in the 20th century:\nDespite these tremendous decreases in infant mortality and maternal mortality, the 20th century experienced significant disparities between minority death rates compared to death rates for white mothers. In the 1900s, black women were twice as likely to die while giving birth compared to white women. Towards the end of the 20th century, black women are three times as likely to die while giving birth. This disparity is often cited as a lack in stronger Health care in the United States.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The architectural perspective, and the modern fields which are known today as banking and accounting were founded in Italy.\nThe Hundred Years' War ended with a decisive French victory over the English in the Battle of Castillon. Financial troubles in England following the conflict resulted in the Wars of the Roses, a series of dynastic wars for the throne of England. The conflicts ended with the defeat of Richard III by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth Field, establishing the Tudor dynasty in the later part of the century.\nConstantinople, known as the capital of the world and the capital of the Byzantine Empire, fell to the emerging Muslim Ottoman Turks, marking the end of the tremendously influential Byzantine Empire and, for some historians, the end of the Middle Ages. This led to the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy, while Johannes Gutenberg's invention of a mechanical movable type began the printing press. These two events played key roles in the development of the Renaissance. The Roman papacy was split in two parts in Europe for decades (the so-called Western Schism), until the Council of Constance. The division of the Catholic Church and the unrest associated with the Hussite movement would become factors in the rise of the Protestant Reformation in the following century.\nIslamic Spain became dissolved through the Christian Reconquista, followed by the forced conversions and the Muslim rebellion, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule and returning southern Spain to Christian rulers.\nThe spices, wines and precious metals of the Bengal Sultanate had attracted European traders to trade with Bengal, but the trade was subsequently lower, due to the rise of the Ottoman Empire, which introduced new taxes and tariffs against European traders. This had led to explorers like Christopher Columbus finding a route to reach India, which eventually reached the Americas. Explorers like Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese traveller, also found a route to reach to India from the African coast.\nIn Asia, the Timurid Empire collapsed and the Afghan Pashtun Lodi dynasty took control of the Delhi Sultanate. Under the rule of the Yongle Emperor, who built the Forbidden City and commanded Zheng He to explore the world overseas, the Ming dynasty's territory reached its pinnacle.\nIn Africa, the spread of Islam led to the destruction of the Christian kingdoms of Nubia, by the end of the century, leaving only Alodia (which was to collapse in 1504). The formerly vast Mali Empire teetered on the brink of collapse, under pressure from the rising Songhai Empire.\nIn the Americas, both the Aztec Empire and the Inca Empire reached the peak of their influence, but the voyages of Christopher Columbus and other European voyages of discovery in the Americas, beginning the European colonization of the Americas, changed the course of modern history.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Habsburg Spanish Empire, Portuguese Empire, Ottoman Empire, Safavid Persia, Mughal India and Ming China were the most powerful and hegemonic states. \nThe Renaissance in Italy and Europe saw the emergence of important artists, authors and scientists, and led to the foundation of important subjects which include accounting and political science. Copernicus proposed the heliocentric universe, which was met with strong resistance, and Tycho Brahe refuted the theory of celestial spheres through observational measurement of the 1572 appearance of a Milky Way supernova. These events directly challenged the long-held notion of an immutable universe supported by Ptolemy and Aristotle, and led to major revolutions in astronomy and science. Galileo Galilei became a champion of the new sciences, invented the first thermometer and made substantial contributions in the fields of physics and astronomy, becoming a major figure in the Scientific Revolution in Europe.\nSpain and Portugal colonized large parts of Central and South America, followed by France and England in Northern America and the Lesser Antilles. The Portuguese became the masters of trade between Brazil, the coasts of Africa, and their possessions in the Indies, whereas the Spanish came to dominate the Greater Antilles, Mexico, Peru, and opened trade across the Pacific Ocean, linking the Americas with the Indies. English and French privateers began to practice persistent theft of Spanish and Portuguese treasures. This era of colonialism established mercantilism as the leading school of economic thought, where the economic system was viewed as a zero-sum game in which any gain by one party required a loss by another. The mercantilist doctrine encouraged the many intra-European wars of the period and arguably fueled European expansion and imperialism throughout the world until the 19th century or early 20th century.\nThe Reformation in central and northern Europe gave a major blow to the authority of the papacy and the Catholic Church. In England, the British-Italian Alberico Gentili wrote the first book on public international law and divided secularism from canon law and Catholic theology. European politics became dominated by religious conflicts, with the groundwork for the epochal Thirty Years' War being laid towards the end of the century.\nIn the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire continued to expand, with the sultan taking the title of caliph, while dealing with a resurgent Persia. Iran and Iraq were caught by a major popularity of the Shia sect of Islam under the rule of the Safavid dynasty of warrior-mystics, providing grounds for a Persia independent of the majority-Sunni Muslim world.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, following the defeat of the Delhi Sultanate and Vijayanagara Empire, new powers emerged, the Sur Empire founded by Sher Shah Suri, Deccan sultanates, Rajput states, and the Mughal Empire by Emperor Babur, a direct descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan. His successors Humayun and Akbar, enlarged the empire to include most of South Asia.\nJapan suffered a severe civil war at this time, known as the Sengoku period, and emerged from it as a unified nation under Toyotomi Hideyoshi. China was ruled by the Ming dynasty, which was becoming increasingly isolationist, coming into conflict with Japan over the control of Korea as well as Japanese pirates.\nIn Africa, Christianity had begun to spread in Central Africa and Southern Africa. Until the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century, most of Africa was left uncolonized.\n \"Related article: List of 16th century inventions.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The semi-feudal territorial French nobility was weakened and subjugated to the power of an absolute monarchy through the reinvention of the Palace of Versailles from a hunting lodge to a gilded prison, in which a greatly expanded royal court could be more easily kept under surveillance. With domestic peace assured, Louis XIV caused the borders of France to be expanded. It was during this century that the English monarch became increasingly involved in conflicts with the Parliament - this would culminate in the English civil war and an end to the dominance of the English monarchy.By the end of the century, Europeans were masters of logarithms, electricity, the telescope and microscope, calculus, universal gravitation, Newton's Laws of Motion, air pressure, and calculating machines due to the work of the first scientists of the Scientific Revolution, including Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Pierre Fermat, Blaise Pascal, Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. It was also a period of development of culture in general (especially theater, music, visual arts and philosophy). Some of the greatest inventions took place in this century.\nIt was during this period that the European colonization of the Americas began in earnest, including the exploitation of the silver deposits, which resulted in bouts of inflation as wealth was drawn into Europe. Also during this period, there would be a more intense European presence in Southeast Asia and East Asia (such as the colonization of Taiwan). These foreign elements would contribute to a revolution in Ayutthaya. The Mataram Sultanate and the Aceh Sultanate would be the major powers of the region, especially during the first half of the century.\nIn the Islamic world, the gunpowder empires \u2013 the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal \u2013 grew in strength as well. The southern half of India would see the decline of the Deccan Sultanates and extinction of the Vijayanagara Empire. The Dutch would colonize Ceylon and endure hostilities with Kandy. The end of the 17th century saw the first major surrender of Ottoman territory in Europe when the Treaty of Karlowitz ceded most of Hungary to the Habsburgs in 1699.\nIn Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa shogunate at the beginning of the century, beginning the Edo period; the isolationist Sakoku policy began in the 1630s and lasted until the 19th century. In China, the collapsing Ming dynasty was challenged by a series of conquests led by the Manchu warlord Nurhaci, which were consolidated by his son Hong Taiji and finally consummated by his grandson, the Shunzhi Emperor, founder of the Qing dynasty. Qing China spent decades of this century with economic problems (results of civil wars between the Qing and former Ming dynasty loyalists), only recovering well at the end of the century.\nThe greatest military conflicts of the century were the Thirty Years' War, Dutch\u2013Portuguese War, the Great Turkish War, the Nine Years' War, Mughal\u2013Safavid Wars, and the Qing annexation of the Ming.\nInventions, discoveries, introductions.\nMajor changes in philosophy and science take place, often characterized as the Scientific Revolution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the 18th century, elements of Enlightenment thinking culminated in the Atlantic Revolutions. Revolutions began to challenge the legitimacy of monarchical and aristocratic power structures. The Industrial Revolution began mid-century, leading to radical changes in human society and the environment. The European colonization of the Americas and other parts of the world intensified and associated mass migrations of people grew in size as part of the Age of Sail. During the century, slave trading expanded across the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, while declining in Russia and China.\nWestern historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work. For example, the \"short\" 18th century may be defined as 1715\u20131789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution, with an emphasis on directly interconnected events. To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements, the \"long\" 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later. France was the sole world superpower from 1659, after it defeated Spain, until 1815, when it was defeated by Britain and its coalitions following the Napoleonic Wars.\nIn Europe, philosophers ushered in the Age of Enlightenment. This period coincided with the French Revolution of 1789, and was later compromised by the excesses of the Reign of Terror. At first, many monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals, but in the wake of the French Revolution they feared loss of power and formed broad coalitions to oppose the French Republic in the French Revolutionary Wars. Various conflicts throughout the century, including the War of the Spanish Succession and the Seven Years' War, saw Great Britain triumph over its rivals to become the preeminent power in Europe. However, Britain's attempts to exert its authority over the Thirteen Colonies became a catalyst for the American Revolution. The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state. Its semi-democratic government system was not robust enough to prevent partition by the neighboring states of Austria, Prussia, and Russia.\nIn West Asia, Nader Shah led Persia in successful military campaigns. The Ottoman Empire experienced a period of peace, taking no part in European wars from 1740 to 1768. As a result, the empire was not exposed to Europe's military improvements during the Seven Years' War. The Ottoman military consequently lagged behind and suffered several defeats against Russia in the second half of the century.\nIn South Asia, the death of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb was followed by the expansion of the Maratha Confederacy and an increasing level of European influence and control in the region. In 1739, Persian emperor Nader Shah invaded and plundered Delhi, the capital of the Mughal Empire. Later, his general Ahmad Shah Durrani scored another victory against the Marathas, the then dominant power in India, in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. By the middle of the century, the British East India Company began to conquer eastern India, and by the end of the century, the Anglo-Mysore Wars against Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, led to Company rule over the south.\nIn East Asia, the century was marked by the High Qing era, a period characterized by significant cultural and territorial expansion. This period also experienced relative peace and prosperity, allowing for societal growth, increasing literacy rates, flourishing trade, and consolidating imperial power across the vast Qing dynasty's territories. Conversely, the continual seclusion policy of the Tokugawa shogunate also brought a peaceful era called Pax Tokugawa and experienced a flourishment of the arts as well as scientific knowledge and advancements, which were introduced to Japan through the Dutch port of Nagasaki. In Southeast Asia, the Konbaung\u2013Ayutthaya Wars and the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Wars broke out while the Dutch East India Company established increasing levels of control over the Mataram Sultanate.\nIn Africa, the Ethiopian Empire underwent the Zemene Mesafint, a period when the country was ruled by a class of regional noblemen and the emperor was merely a figurehead. The Atlantic slave trade also saw the continued involvement of states such as the Oyo Empire. In Oceania, the European colonization of Australia and New Zealand began during the late half of the century. In the Americas, the United States declared its independence from Great Britain. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. In 1789, George Washington was inaugurated as the first president. Benjamin Franklin traveled to Europe where he was hailed as an inventor. Examples of his inventions include the lightning rod and bifocal glasses. T\u00fapac Amaru II led an uprising that sought to end Spanish colonial rule in Peru.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34573", "revid": "2300502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34573", "title": "1950s", "text": "Decade of the Gregorian calendar (1950\u20131959)\nDecade\nThe 1950s (pronounced nineteen-fifties; commonly abbreviated as the \"Fifties\" or the \"'50s\") (among other variants) was a decade that began on January 1, 1950, and ended on December 31, 1959.\nThroughout the decade, the world continued its recovery from World War II, aided by the post-World War II economic expansion. The period also saw great population growth with increased birth rates and the emergence of the baby boomer generation.\nDespite this recovery, the Cold War developed from its modest beginnings in the late 1940s to a heated competition between the Soviet Union and the United States by the early 1960s. The ideological clash between communism and capitalism dominated the decade, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn the United States, a wave of anti-communist sentiment known as the Second Red Scare aka McCarthyism resulted in Congressional hearings by both houses in Congress. In the Soviet Union, the death of Joseph Stalin would lead to a political campaign and reforms known as \"de-Stalinization\" initiated by Nikita Khrushchev, eventually leading to the deterioration between the relationship of the Soviet Union and China in the 1950s.\nThe beginning of the Cold War led to the beginning of the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik\u00a01 in 1957; the United States would create NASA in response in 1958. Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons (such as RDS-37 and Upshot\u2013Knothole) called the arms race, the tense geopolitical situation created a politically conservative climate.\nThe beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia also took place in this decade and accelerated in the following decade albeit would lead to several conflicts throughout the decade and so on. Wars include the First Indochina War, Malayan Emergency, Korean War, the Algerian War, the First Sudanese Civil War, the Vietnam War, the Cuban Revolution, and the Suez Crisis. Coups include the Egyptian Revolution, the Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat, the Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat, the 14 July Revolution in Iraq, and the Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat in 1958.\nTelevision became a common innovation in American homes during the 1950s culminating in the Golden Age of TV. This led many to purchase more products and upgrade whatever they currently had resulting in mass consumerism. While outside of America, it would take a few decades for TV to become commonplace in other countries.\nThe 1950s saw a turning point for polio with the successful discovery of the polio vaccine. Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries while it would gradually decline for the next few decades in developing countries reducing the number of death rates from this disease.\nDuring the 1950s, the world population increased from 2.5 to 3.0 billion, with approximately 1 billion births and 500 million deaths.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitics and wars.\nCoups.\nProminent coups d'\u00e9tat of the decade included:\nDisasters.\nNatural:\nNon-natural:\nEconomics.\nIn the 1950s, the median age of newlyweds declined to its lowest point, a level not seen since. By 1954, nearly half of American brides were teenagers, often marrying men just a few years older. These brides sought husbands who were stable providers. A strong economy and low unemployment rates supported widespread prosperity, expanding the middle class and making affordable housing accessible. This economic environment enabled young couples to marry early, granting teenage brides notable purchasing power that marketers actively targeted.\nDuring this period, a gap in educational attainment emerged, with college degrees yielding higher earning potential than high school diplomas. Given prevailing cultural norms, more men pursued higher education while their wives contributed financially by entering the workforce. Recognizing this support, some schools even awarded the \"PhT\" (Putting Husband Through) diploma to acknowledge wives who helped their husbands complete their degrees.\nCredit cards gained widespread popularity in the 1950s starting with the Diners Club Card in New York and soon after expanded to multiple countries.\nInflation was moderate during the decade of the 1950s. The first few months had a deflationary hangover from the 1940s but the first full year ended with what looked like the beginnings of massive inflation with annual inflation rates ranging from 8% to 9% a year. By 1952 inflation subsided. 1954 and 1955 flirted with deflation again but the remainder of the decade had moderate inflation ranging from 1% to 3.7%. The average annual inflation for the entire decade was only 2.04%.\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nScience and technology.\nTechnology.\nThe recently invented bipolar transistor, though initially quite feeble, had clear potential and was rapidly improved and developed at the beginning of the 1950s by companies such as GE, RCA, and Philco. The first commercial transistor production started at the Western Electric plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in October, 1951 with the point contact germanium transistor. It was not until around 1954 that transistor products began to achieve real commercial success with small portable radios.\nA breakthrough in semiconductor technology came with the invention of the MOSFET (metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs, in November 1959. It revolutionized the electronics industry, and became the fundamental building block of the Digital Revolution. The MOSFET went on to become the most widely manufactured device in history.\nTelevision, which first reached the marketplace in the 1940s, attained maturity during the 1950s and by the end of the decade, most American households owned a TV set. A rush to produce larger screens than the tiny ones found on 1940s models occurred during 1950\u201352. In 1954, RCA intro Bell Telephone Labs produced the first Solar battery. In 1954, a yard of contact paper could be purchased for only 59 cents. Polypropylene was invented in 1954. In 1955, Jonas Salk invented a polio vaccine which was given to more than seven million American students. In 1956, a solar powered wrist watch was invented.\nIn 1957, a satellite named Sputnik 1 was launched by the Soviets. The space race began four months later as the United States launched a smaller satellite.\nPopular culture.\nMusic.\nPopular music in the early 1950s was essentially a continuation of the crooner sound of the previous decade, with less emphasis on the jazz-influenced big band style and more emphasis on a conservative, operatic, symphonic style of music. Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Frankie Laine, Patti Page, Judy Garland, Johnnie Ray, Kay Starr, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Martin, Georgia Gibbs, Eddie Fisher, Teresa Brewer, Dinah Shore, Kitty Kallen, Joni James, Peggy Lee, Julie London, Toni Arden, June Valli, Doris Day, Arthur Godfrey, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Guy Mitchell, Nat King Cole, and vocal groups like the Mills Brothers, The Ink Spots, The Four Lads, The Four Aces, The Chordettes, The Fontane Sisters, The Hilltoppers and the Ames Brothers. Jo Stafford's \"You Belong To Me\" was the #1 song of 1952 on the Billboard Top 100 chart.\nThe middle of the decade saw a change in the popular music landscape as classic pop was swept off the charts by rock-and-roll. Crooners such as Eddie Fisher, Perry Como, and Patti Page, who had dominated the first half of the decade, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed by the decade's end.\nDoo-wop entered the pop charts in the 1950s. Its popularity soon spawns the parody \"Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\".\nRock-n-roll emerged in the mid-1950s with Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Gene Vincent, Fats Domino, James Brown, Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Bobby Darin, Ritchie Valens, Duane Eddy, Eddie Cochran, Brenda Lee, Bobby Vee, Connie Francis, Neil Sedaka, Pat Boone, Ricky Nelson, Tommy Steele, Billy Fury, Marty Wilde and Cliff Richard being notable exponents. In the mid-1950s, Elvis Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. Chuck Berry, with \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, focusing on teen life and introducing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. Bill Haley, Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, Johnny Horton, and Marty Robbins were Rockabilly musicians. Doo-wop was another popular genre at the time. Popular Doo Wop and Rock-n-Roll bands of the mid to late 1950s include The Platters, The Flamingos, The Dells, The Silhouettes, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, Little Anthony and The Imperials, Danny &amp; the Juniors, The Coasters, The Drifters, The Del-Vikings and Dion and the Belmonts.\nThe new music differed from previous styles in that it was primarily targeted at the teenager market, which became a distinct entity for the first time in the 1950s as growing prosperity meant that young people did not have to grow up as quickly or be expected to support a family. Rock-and-roll proved to be a difficult phenomenon for older Americans to accept and there were widespread accusations of its being a communist-orchestrated scheme to corrupt the youth, although rock and roll was extremely market-based and capitalistic.\nJazz stars in the 1950s who came into prominence in their genres called bebop, hard bop, cool jazz and the blues, at this time included Lester Young, Ben Webster, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Art Tatum, Bill Evans, Ahmad Jamal, Oscar Peterson, Gil Evans, Jerry Mulligan, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Art Blakey, Max Roach, the Miles Davis Quintet, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone, and Billie Holiday.\nThe American folk music revival became a phenomenon in the United States in the 1950s to mid-1960s with the initial success of The Weavers who popularized the genre. Their sound, and their broad repertoire of traditional folk material and topical songs inspired other groups such as the Kingston Trio, the Chad Mitchell Trio, The New Christy Minstrels, and the \"collegiate folk\" groups such as The Brothers Four, The Four Freshmen, The Four Preps, and The Highwaymen. All featured tight vocal harmonies and a repertoire at least initially rooted in folk music and topical songs.\nOn 3 February 1959, a chartered plane transporting the three American rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson goes down in foggy conditions near Clear Lake, Iowa, killing all four occupants on board, including pilot Roger Peterson. The tragedy is later termed \"The Day the Music Died\", popularized in Don McLean's 1971 song \"American Pie\". This event, combined with the conscription of Presley into the US Army, is often taken to mark the point where the era of 1950s rock-and-roll ended.\nIn late 1950s also emerged surf rock, which became more popular in early 1960s.\nTelevision.\nThe 1950s are known as the Golden Age of Television by some people. Sales of TV sets rose tremendously in the 1950s and by 1950 4.4 million families in America had a television set. Americans devoted most of their free time to watching television broadcasts. People spent so much time watching TV, that movie attendance dropped and so did the number of radio listeners. Television revolutionized the way Americans see themselves and the world around them. TV affects all aspects of American culture. \"Television affects what we wear, the music we listen to, what we eat, and the news we receive.\"\nITV was launched with Reddiffusion London(Weekdays)\nSome of the most popular shows in the 1950s included \"I Love Lucy\", \"This Is Your Life\", \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"Howdy Doody\", \"The Lone Ranger\", \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", \"Disneyland\", \"Lassie\", \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\", \"The Honeymooners\", \"The Tonight Show\", and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\".\nFilm.\nEuropean cinema experienced a renaissance in the 1950s following the deprivations of World War II. Italian director Federico Fellini won the first foreign language film Academy Award with \"La Strada\" and garnered another Academy Award with \"Nights of Cabiria\". Sidney Poitier became the first Black actor to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for the 1958 film \"The Defiant Ones\" (an award he later won in the 1960s).\nSimilarly with the mid-1950s rush of Rock and Roll and teenage rebellion, the films of Marlon Brando, James Dean and films such as \"Blackboard Jungle\", which introduced rock and roll music to the national consciousness, had a profound effect on American culture.\nIn Hollywood, the epic \"Ben-Hur\" grabbed a record 11 Academy Awards in 1959 and its success gave a new lease of life to motion picture studio MGM.\nBeginning in 1953, with \"Shane\" and \"The Robe\", widescreen motion pictures became the norm.\nThe \"Golden Era\" of 3D cinematography transpired during the 1950s.\nAnimated films in the 1950s presented by Walt Disney included \"Cinderella\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Peter Pan\", \"Lady and the Tramp\", and \"Sleeping Beauty\".\nComics.\nThe long-running comic strip \"Peanuts\" made its debut in this decade, becoming the most successful comic strip of all time, until its end in 2000, along with the death of creator Charles M. Schulz.\nOther comic book characters that debuted in this decade included Martian Manhunter, The Flash (Barry Allen), Asterix, Marmaduke, Dennis the Menace, Dennis and Gnasher, the Smurfs, and Astro Boy.\nArt movements.\nIn the early 1950s abstract expressionism and artists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning were enormously influential. However, by the late 1950s Color Field painting and Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko's paintings became more in focus to the next generation.\nPop art used the iconography of television, photography, comics, cinema and advertising. With its roots in dadaism, it started to take form towards the end of the 1950s when some European artists started to make the symbols and products of the world of advertising and propaganda the main subject of their artistic work. This return of figurative art, in opposition to the abstract expressionism that dominated the aesthetic scene since the end of World War II was dominated by Great Britain until the early 1960s when Andy Warhol, the most known artist of this movement began to show Pop Art in galleries in the United States.\nFashion.\nThe 1950s saw the birth of the teenager and with it rock n roll and youth fashion dominating the fashion industry. In the UK the Teddy boy became both style icons and anti-authoritarian figures. While in America Greasers had a similar social position. Previously teenagers dressed similarly to their parents but now a rebellious and different youth style was being developed. This was particularly noticeable in the overtly sexual nature of their dress. Men wore tight trousers, leather jackets and emphasis was on slicked, greasy hair.\nNew ideas meant new designers who had a concept of what was fashion. Fashion started gaining a voice and style when Christian Dior created \"The New Look\" collection. The 1950s was not only about spending on luxurious brands but also the idea of being comfortable was created. It was a time when resources were available and it was a new type of fashion. Designers were creating collections with different materials such as: taffeta, nylon, rayon, wool and leather that allowed different colors and patterns. People started wearing artificial fibers because it was easier to take care of and it was price effective. It was a time where shopping was part of a lifestyle.\nDifferent designers emerged or made a comeback on the 1950s because, as mentioned before, it was a time for fashion and ideas. The most important designers from the time were:\nChristian Dior: everything started in 1947 after World War II was over. Christian Dior found that there were a lot of resources in the market. He created the famous and inspirational collection named \"The New Look.\" This consisted on the idea of creating voluminous dresses that would not only represent wealth but also show power on women. This collection was the first collection to use 80 yards of fabric. He introduced the idea of the hourglass shape for women; wide shoulders, tight waistline and then voluminous full skirts. Dior was a revolutionary and he was the major influence for the next collections. He is known for always developing new ideas and designs, which led to a rapid expansion and becoming worldwide known. He had pressure to create innovative designs for each collection and Dior did manage to provide that to the consumers. He not only made the hourglass shape very famous but he also developed the H-line as well as the A and Y-Lines. Dior was a very important designer, he changed the way fashion was looked on the world but most importantly he reestablished Paris as a fashion capital.\nCristobal Balenciaga: Cristobal Balenciaga a Spanish designer who opened his first couture house in 1915. In 1936, he went to Paris in order to avoid the Spanish Civil War, there he had inspiration for his fashion collections. His designs were an inspiration for emerging designers of the time. His legacy is as important as the one from Dior, revolutionaries. He was known for creating sack dresses, heavy volumes and balloon skirts. For him everything started when he worked for Marquesa de Casa Torre who became his patron and main source of inspiration. Marquesa de Casa Torre helped Balenciaga enter the world of couture. His first suit was very dramatic. The suit consisted on cutout and cut-ins the waist over a slim skirt, something not seen before. Balenciaga was a revolutionary designer who was not afraid to cut and let loose because he had everything under control. In the 1950s and 1960s his designs were well known for attention to color and texture. He was creating different silhouettes for women, in 1955 he created the tunic, 1957 the sack dress and 1958 the Empire styles. He was known for moving from tailored designs to shapeless allowing him to show portion and balance on the bodies. Showing that his designs evolved with time and maintained his ideologies.\nCoco Chanel: Her style was well known over the world and her idea of having functional luxurious clothing influenced other designers from the era. Chanel believed that luxurious should come from being comfortable that is why her designers were so unique and different from the time period, she also achieved her looks by adding accessories such as pearl necklaces. Chanel believed that even though Dior designs were revolutionary for the time period they did not managed to represent the women of the time. She believed women had to wear something to represent their survival to another war and their active roles in society. Coming back from a closed house of fashion was not easy for Chanel and competing against younger designers. The Chanel suit was known as a status symbol for wealthy and powerful women. Chanel influenced over the years and her brand is still one of the most influential brands for fashion.\nSports.\nFIFA World Cups.\nThe 1958 World Cup is notable for marking the debut on the world stage of a then largely unknown 17-year-old Pel\u00e9.\nPeople.\nScientists and engineers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors and entertainers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmmakers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports figures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\nTimeline.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\n1950 \u2022 1951 \u2022 1952 \u2022 1953 \u2022 1954 \u2022 1955 \u2022 1956 \u2022 1957 \u2022 1958 \u2022 1959\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The United States was recovering from the American Civil War, though the Reconstruction era introduced its own legacies of bitterness and racial segregation in the country. Germany unified as a nation in 1871 and became the German Empire. Changing social conditions led workforces to cooperate in the form of labor unions in order to demand better pay and working conditions, with strikes occurring worldwide in the later part of the decade and continuing until World War I. The decade was also a period of significant technological advancement; the phonograph, telephone, and electric light bulb were all invented during the 1870s, though it would take several more decades before they became household items.\nThe last living person from this decade, Jeanne Calment, died in 1997.\nDecade\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34579", "revid": "3091149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34579", "title": "2000s", "text": "Decade of the Gregorian calendar (2000\u20132009)\nDecade\nThe 2000s (pronounced \"two-thousands\"; shortened to the '00s and also known as the aughts or the noughties) was the decade that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009.\nDuring this decade, the world population grew from 6.1 to 6.9 billion people. Approximately 1.35 billion people were born, and 550 million people died. The early part of the decade saw the long-predicted breakthrough of economic giants in Asia, like India and China, which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. These two most populous countries became an increasing economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments towards the end of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the US in 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis sparked the Great Recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.\nThe decade saw the rise of the Internet, which grew from covering 7% to 26% of the world population. This contributed to globalization, which allowed faster communication among people around the world; social networking sites arose as a new way for people to stay in touch from distant locations, as long as they had internet access. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009, when Facebook overtook it in number of American users. Email continued to be popular and began to replace \"snail mail\" as the primary way of sending messages to people. Google, YouTube, Ask.com and Wikipedia emerged to become among the top 10 most popular websites. Amazon overtook eBay as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL significantly declined in popularity throughout the decade, falling from being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite and Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN fell from second to sixth. Yahoo! maintained relatively stable popularity, remaining the most popular website for most of the decade.\nThe war on terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. In 2003, a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The Second Congo War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in 2003. Further wars that ended included the Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, the Sierra Leone Civil War, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Sri Lankan Civil War. Wars that began included the conflict in the Niger Delta, the Houthi insurgency, and the Mexican drug war.\nClimate change and global warming became common concerns in the 2000s. Prediction tools made significant progress, UN-sponsored organizations such as the IPCC gained influence, and studies such as the Stern Review influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the NASA and the NOAA. Major natural disasters included Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and earthquakes in Pakistan and China in 2005 and 2008, respectively. The deadliest natural disaster and most powerful earthquake of the 21st century occurred in 2004 when a 9.1\u20139.3 earthquake and its subsequent tsunami struck multiple nations in the Indian Ocean, killing 230,000 people.\nUsage of computer-generated imagery became more widespread in films produced during the 2000s, especially with the success of 2001's \"Shrek\" and 2003's \"Finding Nemo\", the latter becoming the best-selling DVD of all time. Anime films gained more exposure outside Japan with the release of \"Spirited Away\". 2009's \"Avatar\" became the highest-grossing film. Documentary and mockumentary films, such as \"March of the Penguins\", \"Super Size Me\", \"Borat\" and \"Surf's Up\", were popular in the 2000s. 2004's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" by Michael Moore was the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to digital cinema started. Video game consoles released in this decade included the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360; while portable video game consoles included the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. \"Wii Sports\" was the decade's best-selling console video game, while \"New Super Mario Bros.\" was the decade's best-selling portable video game. J. K. Rowling was the best-selling author thanks to the \"Harry Potter\" book series, although she did not pen the best-selling individual book, being second to \"The Da Vinci Code\". Eminem was named the music artist of the decade by \"Billboard\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName for the decade.\nOrthographically, the decade can be written as the \"2000s\" or the \"'00s\". In the English-speaking world, a name for the decade was not immediately accepted as it had been for other decades such as the 1980s and 1990s ('80s, '90s).\nThe aughts (American English) or noughties (British English) arise from the words \"aught\" and \"nought\" respectively, both meaning zero. The \"noughties\" became a common name for the decade in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand and Australia.\nAlthough use of the word \"aught\" to refer to zero is not widespread in the United States, the use of \"aughts\" to identify the decade became common there.\nOther spoken-word possibilities included \"two-thousands\", \"twenty hundreds\", \"ohs\", \"oh ohs\", \"double ohs\", \"zeros\", and \"double zeros\". The years of the decade can be referred to as '01, '02, '03, etc., pronounced oh-one, oh-two, oh-three, etc.\nPolitics and wars.\nThe war on terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. In 2003 a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. These acts included the 2004 Madrid train bombings, 7/7 London bombings in 2005, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks related to al-Qaeda. The European Union expanded its sanctions amid Iran's failure to comply with its transparency obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and United Nations resolutions.\nThe war on terror generated extreme controversy around the world, with questions regarding the justification for certain U.S. actions leading to a loss of support for the American government, both in and outside the United States. The additional armed conflict occurred in the Middle East, including between Israel and Hezbollah, then with Israel and Hamas. The most significant loss of life due to natural disasters came from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which caused a tsunami that killed around one quarter-million people and displaced well over a million others.\nTerrorist attacks.\nThe most prominent terrorist attacks committed against the civilian population during the decade include:\nWars.\nThe most prominent armed conflicts of the decade include:\nCoups.\n The most prominent coup d'\u00e9tat of the decade include:\nPolitical trends.\nAmerican party system.\nDuring the 2000s, the expectations and unspoken rules for acceptable conduct among American politicians affiliated with the Republican or Democratic Parties changed due to the decline of political bosses in the previous 4 decades and the momentous events in America that happened during the decade.\nGenerally, American presidential candidates abided by and respected the established procedures of both major parties' presidential nomination process.\nPeaceful transfers of power.\nDuring this decade, the peaceful transfer of power through elections first occurred in Mexico, Indonesia, Taiwan, Colombia, and several other countries. (See below.)\nDeaths.\nProminent deaths of sitting leaders include:\nProminent deaths of former leaders include:\nProminent political events.\nThe prominent political events of the decade include:\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nDisasters.\nNatural disasters.\nThe 2000s experienced some of the worst and most destructive natural disasters in history.\nEpidemics.\nAntibiotic resistance is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns of the 21st century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is not especially relevant to organisms which don't cause disease in humans).\nThe outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 caused a crisis in British agriculture and tourism. This epizootic saw 2,000 cases of the disease in farms across most of the British countryside. Over 6 million sheep and cattle were killed.\nBetween November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong, with 8,273 cases and 775 deaths worldwide (9.6% fatality) according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect individuals in 37 countries in early 2003.\nMethicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\": the Office for National Statistics reported 1,629 MRSA-related deaths in England and Wales during 2005, indicating a MRSA-related mortality rate half the rate of that in the United States for 2005, even though the figures from the British source were explained to be high because of \"improved levels of reporting, possibly brought about by the continued high public profile of the disease\" during the time of the 2005 United Kingdom General Election. MRSA is thought to have caused 1,652 deaths in 2006 in UK up from 51 in 1993.\nThe 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) flu pandemic was also considered a natural disaster. On October 25, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama officially declared H1N1 a national emergency. Despite President Obama's concern, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in October 2009 that an overwhelming majority of New Jerseyans (74%) were not very worried or not at all worried about contracting the H1N1 flu virus.\nA study conducted in coordination with the University of Michigan Health Service is scheduled for publication in the December 2009 \"American Journal of Roentgenology\" warning that H1N1 flu can cause pulmonary embolism, surmised as a leading cause of death in this current pandemic. The study authors suggest physician evaluation via contrast enhanced CT scans for the presence of pulmonary emboli when caring for patients diagnosed with respiratory complications from a \"severe\" case of the H1N1 flu.\nAs of May 30, 2010, as stated by the World Health Organization, more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18,138 deaths.\nEconomics.\nThe most significant evolution of the 2000s in the economic landscape was the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China, whose GDP grew from 1.21 trillion to 5.1 trillion (in 2022 USD). To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom (growing from 438.39 billion to 1.34 trillion) which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007, and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.\nThe combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008.\nThe period takes its name from Gordon Brown, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer (who later became Prime Minister), who decided to sell approximately half of the UK's gold reserves in a series of auctions. At the time, the UK's gold reserves were worth about US$6.5 billion, accounting for about half of the UK's US$13 billion foreign currency net reserves.\nEconomic growth in the world.\nBetween 1999 and 2009, according to the World Bank statistics for GDP:\nGlobalization and its discontents.\nThe removal of trade and investment barriers, the growth of domestic markets, artificially low currencies, the proliferation of education, the rapid development of high tech and information systems industries and the growth of the world economy lead to a significant growth of offshore outsourcing during the decade as many multinational corporations significantly increased subcontracting of manufacturing (and increasingly, services) across national boundaries in developing countries and particularly in China and India, due to many benefits and mainly because the two countries which are the two most populous countries in the world provide huge pools from which to find talent and as because both countries are low cost sourcing countries. As a result of this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated capital and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result, many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors (data processing, computer programming, and technical support) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected.\nWhile global trade rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the WTO in 2001), there was little progress in the multilateral trading system. International trade continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies. However, global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make much progress, as member countries of the World Trade Organization did not succeed in finding agreements to stretch the extent of free trade. The Doha Round of negotiations, launched in 2001 by the WTO to promote development, failed to be completed because of growing tensions between regional areas. Nor did the Canc\u00fan Conference in 2003 find a consensus on services trade and agricultural subsidies.\nThe comparative rise of China, India, and other developing countries also contributed to their growing clout in international forums. In 2009, it was determined that the G20, originally a forum of finance ministers and central bank governors, would replace the G8 as the main economic council.\n2007 Chinese export recalls \u2013 in 2007, a series of product recalls and import bans were imposed by the product safety institutions of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand against products manufactured in and exported from the mainland of the People's Republic of China (PRC) because of numerous alleged consumer safety issues.\nEvents in the confidence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as pet food, toys, toothpaste, lipstick, and a ban on certain types of seafood. Also included are reports on the poor crash safety of Chinese automobiles, slated to enter the American and European markets in 2008. This created adverse consequences for the confidence in the safety and quality of mainland Chinese manufactured goods in the global economy.\nThe age of turbulence.\nThe decade was marked by two financial and economic crises. In 2001, the Dot-com bubble burst, causing turmoil in financial markets and a decline in economic activity in the developed economies, in particular in the United States. However, the impact of the crisis on the activity was limited thanks to the intervention of the central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve System. Indeed, Alan Greenspan, leader of the Federal Reserve until 2006, cut the interest rates several times to avoid a severe recession, allowing an economic revival in the U.S.\nAs the Federal Reserve maintained low interest rates to favor economic growth, a housing bubble began to appear in the United States. In 2007, the rise in interest rates and the collapse of the housing market caused a wave of loan payment failures in the U.S. The subsequent subprime mortgage crisis caused the 2008 financial crisis, because the subprime mortgages had been securitized and sold to international banks and investment funds. Despite the extensive intervention of central banks, including partial and total nationalization of major European banks, the crisis of sovereign debt became particularly acute, first in Iceland, though as events of the early 2010s would show, it was not an isolated European example. Economic activity was severely affected around the world in 2008 and 2009, with disastrous consequences for carmakers.\nIn 2007, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, delivered his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor before he moved into Number 10. Addressing financiers: \"A new world order has been created\", Everyone needed to follow the city's \"great example\", \"an era that history will record as the beginning of a new Golden Age\".\nReactions of governments in all developed and developing countries against the economic slowdown were largely inspired by keynesian economics. The end of the decade was characterized by a Keynesian resurgence, while the influence and media popularity of left-wing economists Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman (Nobel Prize recipients in 2001 and 2008, respectively) did not stop growing during the decade. Several international summits were organized to find solutions against the economic crisis and to impose greater control on the financial markets. The G20 became in 2008 and 2009 a major organization, as leaders of the member countries held two major summits in Washington in November 2008 and in London in April 2009 to regulate the banking and financial sectors, and also succeeding in coordinating their economic action and in avoiding protectionist reactions.\nEnergy crisis.\nFrom the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under $25/barrel. During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by August 11, 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July 2008. Commentators attributed these price increases to many factors, including reports from the United States Department of Energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, Middle East tension, and oil price speculation.\nFor a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term effects on oil prices. These events and disasters included North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plants in 2006 and Hurricane Katrina. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008 and early 2009 and the price plunged as well. However, it surged back in May 2009, bringing it back to November 2008 levels.\nMany fast-growing economies throughout the world, especially in Asia, also were a major factor in the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which\u2014along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs, and political turmoil\u2014forced two other trends: a soar in the price of petroleum products and a push by governments and businesses to promote the development of environmentally friendly technology (known informally as \"green\" technology). However, a side-effect of the push by some industrial nations to \"go green\" and utilize biofuels was a decrease in the supply of food and a subsequent increase in the price of the same. It partially caused the 2007 food price crisis, which seriously affected the world's poorer nations with an even more severe shortage of food.\nThe rise of the euro.\nA common currency for most EU member states, the euro, was established electronically in 1999, officially tying all the currencies of each participating nation to each other. The new currency was put into circulation in 2002 and the old currencies were phased out. Only three countries of the then 15 member states decided not to join the euro (the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden). In 2004 the EU undertook a major eastward enlargement, admitting 10 new member states (eight of which were former communist states). Two more, Bulgaria and Romania, joined in 2007, establishing a union of 27 nations.\nThe euro has since become the second largest reserve currency and the second most traded currency in the world after the US$.\nAs of \u00a02009[ [update]], with more than \u20ac790\u00a0billion in circulation, the euro was the currency with the highest combined value of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world, having surpassed the US$.\nScience and technology.\nTechnology.\nComputing and Internet.\nIn the 2000s, the Internet became a mainstay, strengthening its grip on Western society while becoming increasingly available in the developing world. The share of the world population using the internet grew from 6.7% to 25.7%.\nPopular websites.\nGoogle, YouTube, Ask.com and Wikipedia emerged as popular websites, becoming the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 9th most popular websites by the end of the decade respectively. Amazon overtook eBay as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL significantly declined in popularity throughout the decade, falling from being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite and Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN fell from the second to sixth most popular site, though it quadrupled its monthly visits (going from 325 to 1.2 billion monthly visits). Yahoo! maintained relatively stable popularity, remaining the most popular website for most of the decade.\nElectronics.\nIn late 2004 and early 2005, came a significant increase in reported incidents linked to laser pointers \u2013 see Lasers and aviation safety. The wave of incidents may have been triggered in part by \"copycats\" who read press accounts of laser pointer incidents. In one case, David Banach of New Jersey was charged under federal Patriot Act anti-terrorism laws, after he allegedly shone a laser pointer at aircraft.\nChip and PIN was trialled in Northampton, England from May 2003, and as a result was rolled out nationwide in the United Kingdom in 2004 with advertisements in the press and national television touting the \"Safety in Numbers\" slogan.\nATM crime in Europe jumped to \u20ac485m (\u00a3423m) in 2008 following a 149% rise in attacks on cash machines. Gangs are turning to Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit card and personal identification number (PIN) details to nearby laptops and using increasingly sophisticated techniques to skim cards.\nPortable laptops became popular during the late 2000s.\nMore conventional smash-and-grab attacks are also on the rise, says Enisa, the European Network and Information Security Agency. It reports a 32% rise in physical robberies on ATMs, ranging from ram raids to the use of rotary saws, blowtorches and diamond drills. It blames the increase on criminal gangs from eastern Europe.\nReligion and irreligion.\nProminent events and trends during the 2000s:\nEnvironment and climate change.\nClimate change and global warming became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organisations such as the IPCC gained influence, and studies such as the Stern report influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change.\nThe global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the 2000s might have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade. The NASA and the NOAA later echoed the WMO's findings.\n Major natural disasters became more frequent and helped change public opinion. One of the deadliest heat waves in human history happened during the 2000s, mostly in Europe, with the 2003 European heat wave killing 37,451 people over the summer months. In February 2009, a series of highly destructive bushfires started in Victoria, Australia, lasting into the next month. While the fires are believed to have been caused by arson, they were widely reported as having been fueled by an excessive heatwave that was due in part to climate change. It has also been alleged that climate change was a cause of increased storms intensity, notably in the case of Hurricane Katrina.\nInternational actions.\nClimate change became a major issue for governments, populations and scientists. Debates on global warming and its causes made significant progress, as climate change denials were refuted by most scientific studies. Decisive reports such as the Stern Review and the 2007 IPCC Report almost established a climate change consensus. NGOs' actions and the commitment of political personalities (such as former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) also urged to international reactions against climate change. Documentary films \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and \"Home\" may have had a decisive impact.\nUnder the auspices of The UN Convention on Climate Change the Kyoto Protocol (aimed at combating global warming) entered into force on February 16, 2005. As of November 2009, 187 states have signed and ratified the protocol. In addition The UN Convention on Climate Change helped coordinate the efforts of the international community to fight potentially disastrous effects of human activity on the planet and launched negotiations to set an ambitious program of carbon emission reduction that began in 2007 with the Bali Road Map. However, the representatives of the then 192 member countries of the United Nations gathered in December 2009 for the Copenhagen Conference failed to reach a binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions because of divisions between regional areas.\nHowever, as environmental technologies were to make up a potential market, some countries made large investments in renewable energies, energy conservation and sustainable transport. Many governments launched national plans to promote sustainable energy. In 2003, the European Union members created an emission trading scheme, and in 2007 they assembled a climate and energy package to reduce further their carbon emission and improve their energy-efficiency. In 2009, the United States Obama administration set up the Green New Deal, a plan to create millions of jobs in sectors related to environmentalism.\nThe Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 requires local authorities in England to provide every household with a separate collection of at least two types of recyclable materials by 2010.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nCommercialization and globalization resulted in mass migration of people from rural areas to urban areas resulting in high-profile skyscrapers in Asia and Europe. In Asia skyscrapers were constructed in India, China, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan.\nPopular culture.\nFilm.\nLive-action films\nThe usage of computer-generated imagery became more widespread in films during the 2000s. Documentary and mockumentary films, such as \"March of the Penguins\", \"Borat\", and \"Super Size Me\", were popular in the 2000s. 2004's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" by Michael Moore is the highest-grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to digital cinema started. Critically acclaimed movies released in the decade including highlights such as \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and \"Lost in Translation\".\nOther films from the 2000s that gained popularity included \"300\", ', \"Napoleon Dynamite\", \"Saw\", \"Zoolander\", \"Shaun of the Dead\" (the first \"Three Flavours Cornetto\" film), \"Elf\", \"Love Actually\", \"The Room\", \"The Hangover\", and \"Billy Elliot\". It also saw Musical films becoming widely successful such as \"Moulin Rouge!\", \"8 Mile\", \"Chicago\", \"Dreamgirls\", ', and \"Mamma Mia!\".\nDecember 2009's \"Avatar\", an American science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron, made extensive use of cutting edge motion capture filming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats). It was also released in \"4D\" in select South Korean theaters.\n3D films became more and more successful throughout the 2000s, culminating in the unprecedented success of 3D presentations of \"Avatar\".\n\"\", a 2003 epic fantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won all the categories for which it was nominated. The film is tied for largest number of awards won with \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) and \"Titanic\" (1997).\n\"The Passion of the Christ\", a 2004 American film directed by Mel Gibson and starring Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ, was highly controversial and received mixed reviews; however, it was a major commercial hit, grossing in excess of $600 million worldwide during its theatrical release.\nThe superhero film genre experienced renewed and intense interest throughout the 2000s. With high ticket and DVD sales, several new superhero films were released every year. Greatest superhero films including \"X-Men\", \"Spider-Man\" and its sequel \"Spider-Man 2\", \"Batman Begins\" and its sequel \"The Dark Knight\", and \"Iron Man\" (which started the Marvel Cinematic Universe). Some media commentators attributed the increased popularity of such franchises to the social and political climate in Western society since the September 11th attacks, although others argued advances in special effects technology played a more significant role.\nAnimated films\nComputer animated films became hugely popular following the release of \"Toy Story\" in the mid-1990s, as the production of traditional 2D animated films slowly started to decline, with several either underperforming or bombing at the box office.\nPixar and DreamWorks Animation proved themselves to be the most successful, yet rivaling, studios throughout the 2000s. Pixar enjoyed the critical and commercial successes of their features \"Monsters, Inc.\", \"Finding Nemo\", \"The Incredibles\", \"Cars\", \"Ratatouille\", \"WALL-E\", and \"Up\", while DreamWorks found its big break following the success of \"Shrek\" (which won the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2002), leading to them producing and releasing other films like \"\", \"Shrek 2\", \"Madagascar\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", and \"Monsters vs. Aliens\". Disney Animation, meanwhile, saw several of its traditional 2D animated films underperforming, with the exception of films like \"The Emperor's New Groove\", \"Lilo &amp; Stitch\", and \"The Princess and the Frog\", leading to the studio beginning work on computer animated films, as they would continue to do so into the next two decades.\nOther successful films included \"Ice Age\" and its first two sequels, \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", \"The Polar Express\", \"Happy Feet\", \"The Simpsons Movie\", and \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\".\nStop motion animated films in that decade which mostly use live-action or computer animation methods included \"Chicken Run\", ', ', \"Corpse Bride\", \"Flushed Away\", \"Coraline\", \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", \"Mary and Max\", and \"A Town Called Panic\".

The Internet also allowed more artists to distribute music relatively inexpensively and independently without the previously necessary financial support of a record label. Music sales began to decline following the year 2000, a state of affairs generally attributed to unlicensed uploading and downloading of sound files to the Internet, a practice which became more widely prevalent during this time. Business relationships called 360 deals\u2014an arrangement in which a company provides support for an artist, and, in exchange, the artist pays the company a percentage of revenue earned not only from sales of recorded music, but also live performances and publishing\u2014became a popular response by record labels to the loss of music sales attributed to online copyright infringement.\nIn the 2000s, hip hop reached a commercial peak and heavily influenced various aspects of popular culture, dominating the musical landscape of the decade.

In the UK, the biggest selling artist of the decade was Robbie Williams and the biggest selling band of the decade was Westlife.\nOn August 25, 2001, Aaliyah Haughton \u2013 a recording artist, dancer, actress and model \u2013 as well as eight others onboard were killed in an airplane crash in The Bahamas after filming the music video for the single \"Rock the Boat\".

So far it is the biggest music deal in British history.\nThe 2000s gave rise to a new trend in music production with the growing use of auto-tune. The effect was first popularized in the early 2000s by Eiffel 65 with their 1998 hit song \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\", which came to global prominence in 2000. It was also used in certain tracks off critically acclaimed 2001 albums from Daft Punk (with \"Discovery\") and Radiohead (with \"Amnesiac\"). By 2008, auto-tune was part of the music mainstream with artists such as Lil Wayne, T-Pain and Kanye West utilizing it in their hit albums \"Tha Carter III\", \"Three Ringz\" and \"808s &amp; Heartbreak\" respectively. Towards the end of the decade, electronic dance music began to dominate western charts (as it would proceed to in the following decade), and in turn helped contribute to a diminishing amount of rock music in the mainstream. Hip hop music also saw a decline in the mainstream in the late 2000s because of electronic music's rising popularity.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", music styles during the 2000s changed very little from how they were in the latter half of the 1990s. The 2000s had a profound impact on the condition of music distribution. Recent advents in digital technology have fundamentally altered industry and marketing practices as well as players in unusual rapidity. According to Nielsen Soundscan, by 2009 CDs accounted for 79 percent of album sales, with 20 percent coming from digital, representing both a 10 percent drop and gain for both formats in 2 years.\nGrime is a style of music that emerged from Bow, East London, England in the early 2000s, primarily as a development of UK garage, drum &amp; bass, hip hop and dancehall. Pioneers of the style include English rappers Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Roll Deep and Skepta.\nMichael Jackson's final album, \"Invincible\", released on October 30, 2001, and costing $30m to record, was the most expensive record ever made.\nThe end of the 2000s decade also saw the dramatic rise of new pop stars such as Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga, all of whom would go on to become some of the best-selling musicians in history.\nThe general socio-political fallout of Iraq War also extended to popular music. In July 2002, the release of English musician George Michael's song \"Shoot the Dog\" proved to be controversial. It was critical of George W. Bush and Tony Blair in the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The video showed a cartoon version of Michael astride a nuclear missile in the Middle East and Tony and Cherie Blair in bed with President Bush. The Dixie Chicks are an American country music band. During a London concert ten days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines said, \"we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States [George W. Bush] is from Texas\". The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the boycotts that ensued in the U.S., where \"the band was assaulted by talk-show conservatives\", while their albums were discarded in public protest. The original music video for the title song from American pop singer Madonna's \"American Life\" album was banned as music television stations thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. She also made her widely considered \"comeback\" album with her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor which topped the charts worldwide in a record 40 countries. As of 2016 the album has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide.

They were timed to precede the G8 conference and summit held at the Gleneagles Hotel in Auchterarder, Scotland from July 6 to 8, 2005; they also coincided with the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. Run in support of the aims of the UK's Make Poverty History campaign and the Global Call for Action Against Poverty, ten simultaneous concerts were held on July 2 and one on July 6. On July 7, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to US$50\u00a0billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa. More than 1,000 musicians performed at the concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks.\nIn November 2006, the Rolling Stones' 'A Bigger Bang' tour was declared the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning $437 million.\nIn December 2009, a campaign was launched on Facebook by Jon and Tracy Morter, from South Woodham Ferrers, which generated publicity in the UK and took the 1992 Rage Against the Machine track \"Killing in the Name\" to the Christmas Number One slot in the UK Singles Chart, which had been occupied the four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the TV show The X Factor. Rage's Zack de la Rocha spoke to BBC One upon hearing the news, stating that:\n\"...We want to thank everyone that participated in this incredible, organic, grass-roots campaign. It says more about the spontaneous action taken by young people throughout the UK to topple this very sterile pop monopoly.\"\nDuring the late 2000s, a new wave of chiptune culture took place. This new culture has much more emphasis on live performances and record releases than the demoscene and tracker culture, of which the new artists are often only distantly aware. Much of 2000s hip hop was characterized as the \"bling era\", following the success of B.G.'s 1999 single Bling Bling, referring to forms of opulence and the material commodities that were popular from the early-to-mid part of the decade in hip-hop culture. However, by the end of the decade, an antecedent emotional rap subgenre gained prominence, with musical projects like Kanye West's fourth studio album \"808s &amp; Heartbreak\" (2008), Kid Cudi's debut album \"\" (2009), and Drake's career catalyzing mixtape \"So Far Gone\" (2009) garnering significant popularity and ushering in a new era of hip hop.\nReunions.\nThe original five members of the English new wave band Duran Duran reunited in the early 2000s.\nOn February 23, 2003, Simon and Garfunkel reunited to perform in public for the first time in a decade, singing \"The Sound of Silence\" as the opening act of the Grammy Awards.\nOn May 9, 2006, British five-piece vocal pop Take That returned to the recorded music scene after more than ten years of absence, signing with Polydor Records.

By 2009, one in four Americans had downloaded a podcast.\nFashion.\nFashion trends of the decade drew much inspiration from 1960s, 1970s and 1980s styles. Hair styles included the bleached and spiked hair for boys and men and long and straight hair for girls and women continued, as well as other hairstyles from the mid-late 1990s.

Both women and men highlighted their hair until the late 2000s.\nThe decade started with the futuristic Y2K fashion which was built on hype surrounding the new millennium. This dark, slinky style remained popular until 9/11 occurred and casual fashions had made a comeback once again. Low rise pants were the go-to for women in the early to mid 2000s. Baggy cargo pants were extremely popular among both sexes throughout the early and mid 2000s until about late 2007. Bell-bottoms were the dominant pant style for women until about 2006 when fitted pants began rising in popularity.

Mass brands Gap and Levi launched their own lines for skinny jeans.\nThroughout the early and mid 2000s, adults and children wore Skechers shoes. The company used celebrities to their advantage, including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Carrie Underwood, and Ashlee Simpson. By the late 2000s, flatter and more compact shoes came into style as chunky sneakers were no longer the mode.\n\"Geek chic\" refers to a minor fashion trend that arose in the mid-2000s in which young individuals adopted stereotypically \"geeky\" fashions, such as oversized black Horn-rimmed glasses, suspenders/braces, and highwater trousers. The glasses\u2014worn with non-prescription lenses or without lenses\u2014quickly became the defining aspect of the trend, with the media identifying various celebrities as \"trying geek\" or \"going geek\" for their wearing such glasses, such as David Beckham, Justin Timberlake and Myleene Klass. Meanwhile, in the sports world, many NBA players wore \"geek glasses\" during post-game interviews, drawing comparisons to Steve Urkel.\nEmo fashion became popular amongst teenagers for most of the 2000s, associated with the success of bands tied to the subculture (many of whom started at the beginning of the 2000s and rose to fame during the middle part of the decade, such as Brand New, The Used, Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Paramore, Panic! at the Disco and more). The style is commonly identified with wearing black/dark coloured skinny jeans, T-shirts bearing the name of emo music groups and long side-swept bangs, often covering one or both eyes. The Scene subculture that emerged in the mid-late 2000s drew much inspiration from Emo style.\nHip hop fashion was popular throughout the 2000s with clothing and shoe brands such as Rocawear, Phat Farm, G-Unit clothing, Billionaire Boys Club, Dipset clothing, Pelle Pelle, BAPE, Nike, Fubu, and Air Jordan.

Satellite radio receivers started selling at a much higher rate, which allowed listeners to pay a subscription fee for thousands of ad-free stations. Clear Channel Communications was the largest provider of radio entertainment in the United States with over 900 stations nationwide. Many radio stations began streaming their content over the Internet, allowing a market expansion beyond the reaches of a radio transmitter.\nDuring the 2000s, FM radio faced its toughest competition ever for in-car entertainment. iPod, satellite radio, and HD radio were all new options for commuters. CD players had a steady decline in popularity throughout the 2000s but stayed prevalent in most vehicles, while cassette tapes became virtually obsolete.\nTelevision.\nLive-action television\nAmerican television in the 2000s saw the sharp increase in popularity of reality television, with numerous competition shows such as \"American Idol\", \"Dancing with the Stars\", \"Survivor\" and \"The Apprentice\" attracting large audiences, as well as documentary or narrative style shows such as \"Big Brother\", \"The Hills\", \"The Real Housewives\" and \"Cheaters\". \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" also aired during the decade, in 2007, and would run for 14 years and 20 seasons, thrusting the Kardashian family into the global pop-culture spotlight. \"Chappelle's Show\" was one of the most popular comedy shows of the decade.

The 6th gen remained popular throughout the decade, but decreased somewhat in popularity after its 7th gen successors released technically starting in November 2005 with the release of Microsoft's Xbox 360, however, most people agree that 2006 is a 6th gen year since most games being released still released on 6th gen including the Xbox even though the 360 was already released, and the PlayStation 3 and the Wii didn't release until late 2006 which most people consider to be the true start of the 7th gen. It reached 7th Generation in the form of consoles like the Wii, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by the mid-2000s. The number-one-selling game console of the decade, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000 and remained popular up to the end of the decade, even after the PlayStation 3 was released. The PlayStation 2 was discontinued in January 2013. The Nintendo DS launched in Japan in 2004 and by 2005 was available globally. All Nintendo DS models combined have sold over 154.02 million units, thus making it the best selling handheld of all time and the second best selling video game console of all time behind the PlayStation 2.\nNeo Geo is a family of video game hardware developed by SNK.

The persistent online worlds allow the games to remain popular for years. \"World of Warcraft\", premiered in 2004, remains one of the most popular games in PC gaming and is still being developed into the 2010s.\nArcade video games had declined in popularity so much by the late 1990s, that revenues in the United States dropped to $1.33 billion in 1999, and reached a low of $866 million in 2004.

Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as \"Minecraft\" and Shadow Complex. These games, which are not developed by the industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as Microsoft's Xbox Live or Apple's App Store and usually cost much less than more major releases.

The US market has also experienced a slight resurgence, with the number of video game arcades across the nation increasing from 2,500 in 2003 to 3,500 in 2008, though this is significantly less than the 10,000 arcades in the early 1980s.

The consequences of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade, with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling spheres of influence of the Western world and the Soviet Union, leading to the beginning of the Cold War. To some degree internal and external tensions in the post-war era were managed by new institutions, including the United Nations, the welfare state, and the Bretton Woods system, facilitating the post\u2013World War II economic expansion, which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the post-war world encouraged decolonization and the emergence of new states and governments, with India, Pakistan, Israel, Vietnam, and others declaring independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new technologies (such as computers, nuclear power, and jet propulsion), often first developed in tandem with the war effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war era.\nThe world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5 billion over the course of the decade, with about 850 million births and 600 million deaths in total.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEconomics.\nThe Bretton Woods Conference was the gathering of 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations at the Mount Washington Hotel, situated in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, to regulate the international monetary and financial order after the conclusion of World War II.

Hollywood was instrumental in producing dozens of classic films during the 1940s, several of which were about the war and some are on most lists of all-time great films. European cinema survived although obviously curtailed during wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Europe. The cinema of Japan also survived. Akira Kurosawa and other directors managed to produce significant films during the 1940s.\nPolish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film Calling Mr. Smith (1943) about current Nazi crimes in occupied Europe during the war and about lies of Nazi propaganda.\nFilm Noir, a film style that incorporated crime dramas with dark images, became largely prevalent during the decade. Films such as \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"The Big Sleep\" are considered classics and helped launch the careers of legendary actors such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner. The genre has been widely copied since its initial inception.\nIn France during the war the tour de force \"Children of Paradise\" directed by Marcel Carn\u00e9 (1945), was shot in Nazi occupied Paris. Memorable films from post-war England include David Lean's \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), Carol Reed's \"Odd Man Out\" (1947) and \"The Third Man\" (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (1946), \"Black Narcissus\" (1946) and \"The Red Shoes\" (1948), Laurence Olivier's \"Hamlet\", the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949) directed by Robert Hamer. Italian neorealism of the 1940s produced poignant movies made in post-war Italy. \"Roma, citt\u00e0 aperta\" directed by Roberto Rossellini (1945), \"Sciusci\u00e0\" directed by Vittorio De Sica (1946), \"Pais\u00e0\" directed by Roberto Rossellini (1946), \"La terra trema\" directed by Luchino Visconti (1948), \"Bicycle Thieves\" directed by Vittorio De Sica (1948), and \"Bitter Rice\" directed by Giuseppe De Santis (1949), are some well-known examples.\nIn Japanese cinema, \"The 47 Ronin\" is a 1941 black and white two-part Japanese film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. \"The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail\" (1945), and the post-war \"Drunken Angel\" (1948), and \"Stray Dog\" (1949), directed by Akira Kurosawa are considered important early works leading to his first masterpieces of the 1950s. \"Drunken Angel\" (1948), marked the beginning of the successful collaboration between Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune that lasted until 1965.\nFashion.\nBecause fashion items and fabrics were rationed due to World War II, fashion became more utilitarian. Women's fashion started including suits, which were feminized with straight knee-length skirts and accessories. There were challenges imposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather, rubber, metal (for snaps, buckles, and embellishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used in any one garment. After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in the United States almost entirely, with the exception of a few trends coming from wartorn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force. The idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages controlled import items such as silk and furs. Floral prints dominated the early 1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as \"atomic prints\" or geometric patterns and shapes. In response to the war effort, patriotic nautical themes and dark greens and khakis dominating the color palettes, as trousers and wedges slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due to shortages in stockings and gasoline. The most common characteristics of this fashion were the straight skirt, pleats, front fullness, squared shoulders with v-necks or high necks, slim sleeves and the most favorited necklines were sailor, mandarin and scalloped.\nPeople.\nScientists and engineers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors / Entertainers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports.\nDuring the 1940s, sporting events were disrupted and changed by the events that engaged and shaped the entire world. The 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games were cancelled because of World War II. During World War II in the United States Heavyweight Boxing Champion Joe Louis and numerous stars and performers from American baseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war. Among the many baseball players (including well known stars) who served during World War II were Moe Berg, Joe DiMaggio, Bob Feller, Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial (in 1945), Warren Spahn, and Ted Williams. They like many others sacrificed their personal and valuable career time for the benefit and well-being of the rest of society. The Summer Olympics were resumed in 1948 in London and the Winter games were held that year in St. Moritz, Switzerland.\nIn 1947, Wataru Misaka of the New York Knicks became the first person of color to play in modern professional basketball, just months after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nBaseball.\nDuring the early 1940s World War II had an enormous impact on Major League Baseball as many players including many of the most successful stars joined the war effort. After the war many players returned to their teams, while the major event of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of Jackie Robinson to a players contract by Branch Rickey the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Signing Robinson opened the door to the integration of Major League Baseball finally putting an end to the professional discrimination that had characterized the sport since the 19th century.\nBoxing.\nDuring the mid-1930s and throughout the years leading up to the 1940s Joe Louis was an enormously popular Heavyweight boxer. In 1936, he lost an important 12 round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer Max Schmeling and he vowed to meet Schmeling once again in the ring. Louis' comeback bout against Schmeling became an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracy against Nazism and Fascism. When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmeling out in the first few seconds of the first round during their rematch at Yankee Stadium, his sensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation. Louis enlisted in the U.S. Army on January 10, 1942, in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Louis' cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first African American to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II.\nSee also.\nTimeline.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines listing the most prominent events of the decade.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34603", "revid": "18509132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34603", "title": "Electoral threshold", "text": "Vote share required for representation\nThe electoral threshold, or election threshold, is the minimum share of votes that a candidate or political party requires before they become entitled to representation or additional seats in a legislature. \nThis limit can operate in various ways; for example, in party-list proportional representation systems where an electoral threshold requires that a party must receive a specified minimum percentage of votes (e.g. 5%), either nationally or in a particular electoral district, to obtain seats in the legislature. In single transferable voting, the election threshold is called the quota, and it is possible to achieve it by receiving first-choice votes alone or by a combination of first-choice votes and votes transferred from other candidates based on lower preferences. It is also a common occurrence to see someone elected with less than the quota in STV.\nIn mixed-member-proportional (MMP) systems, the election threshold determines which parties are eligible for top-up seats in the legislative chamber. Some MMP systems still allow a party to retain the seats they won in electoral districts even when they did not meet the threshold nationally; in some of these systems, top-up seats are allocated to parties that do not achieve the electoral threshold if they have won at least one district seat or have met some other minimum qualification.\nThe effect of this electoral threshold is to deny representation to small parties or to force them into coalitions. Such restraint is intended to make the election system more stable by keeping out fringe parties. Proponents of a stiff electoral threshold say that having a few seats in a legislature can significantly boost the profile of a party and that providing representation and possibly veto power for a party that receives only 1 percent of the vote is not appropriate. However, others argue that in the absence of a ranked ballot or proportional voting system at the district level, supporters of minor parties, barred from top-up seats, are effectively disenfranchised and denied the right to be represented by someone of their choosing.\nTwo boundaries can be defined\u00a0\u2013 a threshold of representation (or threshold of inclusion) is the minimum vote share that might yield a party a seat under the most favorable circumstances for the party, while the threshold of exclusion is the maximum vote share that could be insufficient to yield a seat under the least favorable circumstances. Arend Lijphart suggested calculating the informal threshold as the mean of these. Michael Gallagher gave this value the name \"effective threshold\" and set it at 75 percent of the Droop quota. However, he warned that this was to be used at the district level and not to assume that a party with a certain share of the overall vote was sure to have representation.\nThe electoral threshold is a barrier to entry for political parties to the political competition. But some barrier to entry is seen in any system, due to the effective threshold produced by district magnitude (DM) and due to the effect of wasted votes caused by the election system being used. For instance, under first past the post election system, only one party can win the one seat in a district, and all others are not elected, whether one of them has 49 percent of the vote or the winner has just 20 percent of the vote. In very proportional election systems, each member is elected by about the same number of votes (approximately equivalent to the Hare quota if there are very few wasted votes), and anything less than that number is insufficient to receive representation. In systems where DM varies from district to district, a district with exceptionally high district magnitude, such as may be used in the largest city, may allow representation to small parties that do not have a chance for any representation at all in other districts where DM is low. Conversely, where many districts are used (and thus average DM is low), the effective threshold for a party to potentially take at least one seat is also low.\nRecommendations for electoral thresholds.\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe recommends for parliamentary elections a threshold not higher than three percent. \nFor single transferable vote, to produce representation for parties with approximately ten percent or more of the overall vote, John M. Carey and Simon Hix recommended a district magnitude (DM) of approximately six or more. Support for a party is not homogeneous across an electorate, so a party with ten percent of the vote is expected to easily achieve the electoral threshold in at least one district even if not in others. Most STV systems used today use the Droop quota, which in a six-member district is 14 percent of the votes cast in the district. Carey and Hix note that increasing the DM from one to six produces an improvement in proportionality that is much higher than any subsequent increase in DM, pointing out that the most popular parties take the largest share of votes and the largest share of seats in any PR system, leaving few to small parties under any system. Transfers of votes from other parties to a party and willingness of the party's voters to mark alternate preferences (and thus prevent their vote from being exhausted) also play a role in the amount of representation that each party takes, and is somewhat independent of the party's vote share in the first count. Due to the effect of districting, a party is not assured of taking its proportional share of seats, but with the use of districts with a DM of 6, it is expected that a party with more than ten percent of the overall vote will elect at least one member, according to Carey and Hix.\nElectoral thresholds in various countries.\nIn Poland's Sejm, Lithuania's Seimas, Germany's Bundestag, Kazakhstan's M\u00e4jilis and New Zealand's House of Representatives, the threshold is five percent (in Poland, additionally eight percent for a coalition of two or more parties submitting a joint electoral list and in Lithuania, additionally seven percent for coalition). However, in Germany and New Zealand, if a party wins a constituency seat, the threshold does not apply.\nIsrael's Knesset uses a threshold of 3.25 percent. (It was 1% before 1992, 1.5% from 1992 to 2003, and 2% from 2003 to 2014.) The Turkish parliament uses an electoral threshold of seven percent. In Poland, ethnic minority parties do not have to reach a threshold to get into the parliament, so there is often a small German minority representation in the Sejm. In Romania, a different threshold is used for ethnic minority parties than for national parties that run for the Chamber of Deputies.\nSeveral countries\u00a0\u2013 including Finland, Namibia, North Macedonia, Portugal and South Africa\u00a0\u2013 use proportional representation systems that have no legally set electoral threshold. \nAustralia.\nThe Australian Senate is elected using the single transferable vote (STV) and does not use an electoral threshold or have a predictable \"natural\" or \"hidden\" threshold. The quota ensures the election of candidates, but it is also possible to be elected with less than quota at the end of the count. At a normal election, each state returns six senators and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory each return two. (For the states, the number is doubled in a double dissolution election.) As such, the quota for election (as determined through the Droop quota) is 14.3 percent or 33.3 percent respectively. (For the states, the quota for election is halved in a double dissolution election, when twice the members are elected.) However, as STV allows votes to be transferred even across party lines, candidates who receive less than the quota for election in the first round of counting may reach the Droop quota and be certain of election, or at least have enough to be elected with less than the quota. Therefore, the sixth (or, at a double dissolution election, the 12th) Senate seat in each state is often won by a candidate of a party who received considerably less than the Droop quota in primary votes. For example, at the 2022 election, the sixth Senate seat in Victoria was won by the United Australia Party even though it won only four percent of the primary vote in that state. The successful UAP candidate, Ralph Babet, had personally accumulated a vote tally equivalent to 12 percent of the votes cast by the end, which due to seven percent being exhausted, meant he was the most popular when only he and one other candidate were still in the running.\nGermany.\nGermany's mixed-member proportional system has a threshold of five percent of party-list votes for full proportional representation in the Bundestag in federal elections. However, this is not a stringent barrier to entry: any party or independent who wins a constituency is entitled to that seat whether or not they have passed the threshold. Parties representing registered ethnic minorities have no threshold and receive proportional representation should they gain the mathematical minimum number of votes nationally to do so. The 2021 election demonstrated the exception for ethnic minority parties: the South Schleswig Voters' Association entered the Bundestag with just 0.1 percent of the vote nationally as a registered party for Danish and Frisian minorities in Schleswig-Holstein. The 5% threshold also applies to all state elections; there is none for European Parliament elections.\nGerman electoral law also includes the \"Grundmandatsklausel\" ('basic mandate clause'), which grants full proportional seating to parties winning at least three constituencies as if they had passed the electoral threshold, even if they did not. This rule is intended to benefit parties with regional appeal. This clause has come into effect in two elections: in 1994, when the Party of Democratic Socialism, which had significantly higher support in the former East Germany, won 4.4 percent of party-list votes and four constituencies, and in 2021, when its successor, Die Linke, won 4.9 percent and three constituencies. This clause was repealed by a 2023 law intended to reduce the size of the Bundestag. However, after complaints from Die Linke and the Christian Social Union, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled a threshold with no exceptions was unconstitutional. The court provisionally reintroduced the basic mandate clause for the 2025 federal election.\nNorway.\nIn Norway, the nationwide electoral threshold of four percent applies only to leveling seats. A party with sufficient local support may still win the regular district seats, even if the party fails to meet the threshold. For example, the 2021 election saw the Green Party and Christian Democratic Party each win three district seats, and Patient Focus winning one district seat despite missing the threshold.\nSlovenia.\nIn Slovenia, the threshold was set at 3 parliamentary seats during parliamentary elections in 1992 and 1996. This meant that the parties needed to win about 3.2 percent of the votes in order to pass the threshold. In 2000, the threshold was raised to 4 percent of the votes.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden, there is a nationwide threshold of four percent for the Riksdag, but if a party reaches 12 percent in any electoral constituency, it will take part in the seat allocation for that constituency. As of the 2022 election, nobody has been elected based on the 12 percent rule.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, as the majority of elections are conducted under the first-past-the-post system, legal electoral thresholds do not apply. It is possible to be elected with less than half the votes in a district. \nHowever, several states have threshold requirements for parties to obtain automatic ballot access to the next general election without having to submit voter-signed petitions. The threshold requirements have no practical bearing on the two main political parties (the Republican and Democratic parties) as they easily meet the requirements, but have come into play for the Green, Libertarian and other minor parties. The threshold rules also restrict independent candidates' access to the ballot.\nList of electoral thresholds by country.\nEurope.\nThe electoral threshold for elections to the European Parliament varies for each member state, a threshold of up to 5 percent is applied for individual electoral districts, no threshold is applied across the whole legislative body.\nLegal challenges.\nThe German Federal Constitutional Court rejected an electoral threshold for the European Parliament in 2011 and in 2014 based on the principle of one person, one vote. In the case of Turkey, in 2004 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe declared the threshold of 10 percent to be manifestly excessive and asked Turkey to lower it. On 30 January 2007 the European Court of Human Rights ruled by five votes to two and on 8 July 2008, its Grand Chamber by 13 votes to four that the former 10 percent threshold imposed in Turkey does not violate the right to free elections (Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR). It held, however, that this same threshold could violate the Convention if imposed in a different country. It was justified in the case of Turkey in order to stabilize the volatile political situation over recent decades.\nNatural threshold.\nThe number of seats in each electoral district creates a \"hidden\" natural threshold (also called an effective, or informal threshold). The number of votes that means that a party is guaranteed a seat can be calculated by the formula (formula_1) where \u03b5 is the smallest possible number of votes. That means that in a district with four seats slightly more than 20 percent of the votes will guarantee a seat. Under more favorable circumstances, the party can still win a seat with fewer votes. The most important factor in determining the natural threshold is the number of seats to be filled by the district. Other factors are the seat allocation formula (Saint-Lagu\u00eb, D'Hondt or Hare), the number of contestant political parties and the size of the assembly. Generally, smaller districts leads to a higher proportion of votes needed to win a seat and vice versa. The lower bound (the threshold of representation or the percentage of the vote that allows a party to earn a seat under the most favorable circumstances) is more difficult to calculate. In addition to the factors mentioned earlier, the number of votes cast for smaller parties are important. If more votes are cast for parties that do not win any seat, that will mean a lower percentage of votes needed to win a seat.\nIn some elections, the natural threshold may be higher than the legal threshold. In Spain, the legal threshold is three percent of valid votes\u2014which included blank ballots\u2014with most constituencies having less than 10 deputies, including Soria with only two. Another example of this effect are elections to the European Parliament. In the Cyprus EU constituency, the legal threshold is 1.8 percent, explicitly replacing the threshold for national election which is 3.6 percent. Cyprus only has 6 MEPs, raising the natural threshold. An extreme example of this was in the 2004 EU Parliament elections, where For Europe won 36,112 votes (10.80%) and EDEK won 36,075 votes (10.79%); despite both parties crossing the threshold by a high margin and a difference of only 37 votes, only \"For Europe\" returned an MEP to the European Parliament.\nOther examples include:\nIn Moldova, each independent politician needs 2% to be elected despite the fact that there are 101 seats in total (so worth 2.02 seats).\nNotable cases.\nAn extreme example occurred in Turkey following the 2002 Turkish general election, where almost none of the 550 incumbent MPs were returned. This was a seismic shift that rocked Turkish politics to its foundations. None of the political parties that had passed the threshold in 1999, passed it again: DYP received only 9.55 percent of the popular vote, MHP received 8.34 percent, GP 7.25 percent, DEHAP 6.23 percent, ANAP 5.13 percent, SP 2.48 percent and DSP 1.22 percent. The aggregate number of wasted votes was an unprecented 46.33 percent (14,545,438). As a result, Erdo\u011fan's AKP gained power, winning more than two-thirds of the seats in the Parliament with just 34.28 percent of the vote, with only one opposition party (CHP, which by itself failed to pass threshold in 1999) and 9 independents.\nOther dramatic events can be produced by the loophole often added in mixed-member proportional representation (used throughout Germany since 1949, New Zealand since 1993): there the threshold rule for party lists includes an exception for parties that won 3 (Germany) or 1 (New Zealand) single-member districts. The party list vote helps calculate the desirable number of MPs for each party. Major parties can help minor ally parties overcome the hurdle, by letting them win one or a few districts:\nThe failure of one party to reach the threshold not only deprives their candidates of office and their voters of representation; it also changes the power index in the assembly, which may have dramatic implications for coalition-building.\nCoalitions due to electoral thresholds.\nThere has been cases of attempts to circumvent thresholds:\nNumber of wasted votes.\nElectoral thresholds can sometimes seriously affect the relationship between the percentages of the popular vote achieved by each party and the distribution of seats. The proportionality between seat share and popular vote can be measured by the Gallagher index while the number of wasted votes is a measure of the total number of voters not represented by any party sitting in the legislature.\nThe failure of one party to reach the threshold not only deprives their candidates of office and their voters of representation; it also changes the power index in the assembly, which may have dramatic implications for coalition-building.\nThe number of wasted votes changes from one election to another, here shown for New Zealand. The wasted vote changes depending on voter behavior and size of effective electoral threshold, for example in 2005 New Zealand general election every party above 1 percent received seats due to the electoral threshold in New Zealand of at least one seat in first-past-the-post voting, which caused a much lower wasted vote compared to the other years.\nIn the Russian parliamentary elections in 1995, with a threshold excluding parties under 5 percent, more than 45 percent of votes went to parties that failed to reach the threshold. In 1998, the Russian Constitutional Court found the threshold legal, taking into account limits in its use.\nAfter the first implementation of the threshold in Poland in 1993 34.4 percent of the popular vote did not gain representation.\nThere had been a similar situation in Turkey, which had a 10 percent threshold, easily higher than in any other country. The justification for such a high threshold was to prevent multi-party coalitions and put a stop to the endless fragmentation of political parties seen in the 1960s and 1970s. However, coalitions ruled between 1991 and 2002, but mainstream parties continued to be fragmented and in the 2002 elections as many as 45 percent of votes were cast for parties which failed to reach the threshold and were thus unrepresented in the parliament. All parties which won seats in 1999 failed to cross the threshold, thus giving Justice and Development Party 66 percent of the seats.\nIn the Ukrainian elections of March 2006, for which there was a threshold of 3 percent (of the overall vote, i.e. including invalid votes), 22 percent of voters were effectively disenfranchised, having voted for minor candidates. In the parliamentary election held under the same system, fewer voters supported minor parties and the total percentage of disenfranchised voters fell to about 12 percent.\nIn Bulgaria, 24 percent of voters cast their ballots for parties that would not gain representation in the elections of 1991 and 2013.\nIn the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election, 28.47 percent of all valid votes did not gain representation. In the 2021 Czech legislative election 19.76 percent of voters were not represented. In the 2022 Slovenian parliamentary election 24 percent of the vote went to parties which did not reach the 4 percent threshold including several former parliamentary parties (LM\u0160, PoS, SAB, SNS and DeSUS).\nElectoral thresholds can produce a spoiler effect, similar to that in the first-past-the-post voting system, in which minor parties unable to reach the threshold take votes away from other parties with similar ideologies. Fledgling parties in these systems often find themselves in a vicious circle: if a party is perceived as having no chance of meeting the threshold, it often cannot gain popular support; and if the party cannot gain popular support, it will continue to have little or no chance of meeting the threshold. As well as acting against extremist parties, it may also adversely affect moderate parties if the political climate becomes polarized between two major parties at opposite ends of the political spectrum. In such a scenario, moderate voters may abandon their preferred party in favour of a more popular party in the hope of keeping the even less desirable alternative out of power.\nOn occasion, electoral thresholds have resulted in a party winning an outright majority of seats without winning an outright majority of votes, the sort of outcome that a proportional voting system is supposed to prevent. For instance, the Turkish AKP won a majority of seats with less than 50 percent of votes in three consecutive elections (2002, 2007 and 2011). In the 2013 Bavarian state election, the Christian Social Union failed to obtain a majority of votes, but nevertheless won an outright majority of seats due to a record number of votes for parties which failed to reach the threshold, including the Free Democratic Party (the CSU's coalition partner in the previous state parliament). In Germany in 2013 15.7 percent voted for a party that did not meet the five percent threshold.\nIn contrast, elections that use the ranked voting system can take account of each voter's complete indicated ranking preference. For example, the single transferable vote redistributes first preference votes for candidates below the threshold. This permits the continued participation in the election by those whose votes would otherwise be wasted. Minor parties can indicate to their supporters before the vote how they would wish to see their votes transferred. The single transferable vote is a proportional voting system designed to achieve proportional representation through ranked voting in \"multi-seat\" (as opposed to single seat) organizations or constituencies (voting districts). Ranked voting systems are widely used in Australia and Ireland. Other methods of introducing ordinality into an electoral system can have similar effects.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34607", "revid": "94931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34607", "title": "386BSD", "text": "Unix-like operating system\n386BSD (also known as \"Jolix\") is a Unix-like operating system that was developed by couple Lynne and William \"Bill\" Jolitz. Released as free and open source in 1992, it was the first fully operational Unix built to run on IBM PC-compatible systems based on the Intel 80386 (\"i386\") microprocessor, and the first Unix-like system on affordable home-class hardware to be freely distributed. Its innovations included role-based security, ring buffers, self-ordered configuration and modular kernel design.\nDevelopment began in 1989 while the Jolitzes were at the University of California, Berkeley's Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG), intended to be a port of BSD to 386-based personal computers. They then contributed the project to the university with some of the work ending up in BSD's Net/2, distributed in 1991. However, when the CSRG scrapped the project and ruled that his work was \"university proprietary\", Jolitz rewrote the code from scratch, based on the incomplete free code from Net/2. Jolitz also claims that 386BSD was the base of Berkeley Software Design (BSDi)'s commercial BSD/386.\n386BSD was short-lived as disagreements between Jolitz and a group of users regarding its future direction led to the users forking it into the FreeBSD project as well as the separate NetBSD, both of which continue to this day; 386BSD's version 1.0 was released in 1994, after which work on it had ceased. Eventually, Linux would take off as the most popular complete free Unix clone for PCs, partly due to the slow progress of 386BSD and the then-ongoing lawsuit surrounding BSD.\nHistory and releases.\n386BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz. William had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California, Berkeley (2.8 and 2.9BSD) and both contributed code developed at Symmetric Computer Systems during the 1980s, to Berkeley. William worked at Berkeley on porting 4.3BSD-Reno and later 4.3BSD\u00a0Net/2 to the Intel 80386 for the university. 4.3BSD Net/2 was an incomplete non-operational release, with portions withheld by the University of California as \"encumbered\" (i.e. subject to an AT&amp;T UNIX source code license). 386BSD does not contain any original Unix code.\nThe port began in 1989 and the first, incomplete traces of the port can be found in 4.3BSD\u00a0Net/2 of 1991. The port was made possible as Keith Bostic, partly influenced by Richard Stallman, had started to remove proprietary AT&amp;T out of BSD in 1988. The port was first released to the public in March 1992 (version 0.0) - based on portions of the 4.3BSD\u00a0Net/2 release coupled with additional code (see \"Missing Pieces I and II\", \"Dr. Dobb's Journal\", May\u2013June 1992) - and in a much more usable version on July 14, 1992 (version 0.1).\n386BSD proved popular, with it receiving 250,000 downloads from the FTP server it was hosted on. It was helped partly by the porting process with code being extensively documented in a 17-part series written by Lynne and William in \"Dr. Dobb's Journal\" beginning in January 1991.\nIn late 1994, a finished version 386BSD Release 1.0 was distributed by \"Dr. Dobb's Journal\" on CD-ROM only due to the immense size (600 MB) of the release (the \"386BSD Reference CD-ROM\") and was a best-selling CDROM for three years (1994\u20131997). 386BSD Release 1.0 contained a completely new kernel design and implementation, and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD.\nOn August 5, 2016, an update was pushed to the 386BSD GitHub repository by developer Ben Jolitz, named version 2.0. According to the official website, Release 2.0 \"built upon the modular framework to create self-healing components.\" However, as of March\u00a016, 2017[ [update]], almost all of the documentation remains the same as version 1.0, and a changelog was not available.\nFreeBSD and NetBSD.\nAfter the release of 386BSD 0.1, a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements, releasing them as an unofficial \"patchkit\". Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of 386BSD, the maintainers of the patchkit founded the FreeBSD project in 1993 to continue their work. Around the same time, the NetBSD project was founded by a different group of 386BSD users, with the aim of unifying 386BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi-platform system. Both projects continue to this day.\nThe FreeBSD website at the time claimed that 386BSD suffered from \"neglect\". However, the 386BSD site claimed that this is not true:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This whole \"FreeBSD roots\" is completely fictitious, and invented to cover the wholesale theft of the 386BSD user base.\nUnix and BSD lawsuit.\nDue to a lawsuit (\"UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.\"), some potentially so-called \"encumbered\" source was agreed to have been distributed within the Berkeley Software Distribution Net/2 from the University of California, and a subsequent release (1993, 4.4BSD-Lite) was made by the university to correct this issue. However, 386BSD, \"Dr. Dobb's Journal\", and the Jolitzes were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California, and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before, during, and after these lawsuits without limitation. There has never been any legal filings or claims from the university, USL, or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD. Finally, no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits.\nCopyright and use of the code.\nAll rights with respect to 386BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William and Lynne Jolitz. 386BSD public releases ended in 1997 since code is now available from the many 386BSD-derived operating systems today, along with several derivatives thereof (such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD). Portions of 386BSD may be found in other open systems such as OpenSolaris.\nRelationship with BSD/386.\n386BSD is often confused with BSD/386 which was a different project developed by BSDi, a Berkeley spinout, starting in 1991. BSD/386 used the same 386BSD code contributed to the University of California on \"4.3BSD NET/2\". Although Jolitz worked briefly for UUNET (which later spun out BSDi) in 1991, the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in 386BSD. Instead, William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing, and returned all materials when William left the company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and goals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some names are known from either the Qur\u2019an or the hadith, while others can be found in both sources, although most are found in the Qur\u2019an.\n\"All\u0101h\" is the Arabic word referring to God in Abrahamic religions, thought to be derived by contraction from \"al-\u02beil\u0101h\", which means \"the god\", (i.e., the \"only\" god) and is related to \"El\" and \"Elah\", the Hebrew and Aramaic words for God. Whether or not \"Allah\" can be considered as the personal name of God became disputed in contemporary scholarship. In Islamic usage and indoctrination, Allah was the God's most unique, proper name, and referred to as \"Laf\u1e93 al-Jal\u0101lah\" (The Word of Majesty). Those who claimed that Allah was the personal name of God also denied that this name was a derivative name. Some Muslims may use different names as much as \"Allah\", for instance Rabb, Rahman or \"God\" in English. The Quran refers to the attributes of God as \"most beautiful names\".&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They are traditionally enumerated as 99 in number to which is added as the highest Name (al-ism al-\u02bea\u02bf\u1e93am), the Supreme Name of God. The for listing the Divine Names in the literature of Qur\u02be\u0101nic commentary is 17:110 \"Call upon Allah, or call upon The Merciful; whichsoever you call upon, to Allah belong the most beautiful Names,\" and also 59:22-24, which includes a cluster of more than a dozen Divine epithets.\"\u2014\u200a These names usually denote his praise, gratitude, commendation, glorification, magnification, perfect attributes, majestic qualities, and acts of wisdom, mercy, benefit, and justice from Allah, as believed by Muslims. These names are commonly called upon by Muslims during prayers, supplications, and remembrance, as they hold significant spiritual and theological importance, serving as a means for Muslims to connect with God. Beside these Arabic names, Muslims of non-Arab origins may also sometimes use other names in their own languages to refer to God, such as \"Khuda\" in Persian, Bengali and Urdu. or \"Tengri\" was used in the Ottoman Turkish language as the equivalent of Allah. \nIn Sufis, often characterised as the inner, mystical dimension of Islam, Hu / means just 'He', or \"Parvardigar\" in Persian are used as names of God. derives from the last letter of the word Allah, which is read as when in the middle of a sentence and appears in many verses as in; \"La ilaha illa Hu\" Al Imran:18 According to the Wahdat al-wuj\u016bd interpretetion, the universe was a manifestation of God's -the absolute being- names, and was manifestations or notions with no real existence. Haydar Amuli refused to make any distinction on this matter, arguing that evil beings like Satan were also manifestations of God's imperial names. \nOrigin, Interactions, and Translation.\nSome of the names attributed to God in Islamic culture are names that create problems in transition from a personal god to a universal and transcendent god in understanding; and are translated with forced methods for tanzih, and are given exalting, mystical, and extraordinarily expanded interpretations, eg. names that bear anthropopathic characteristics: Al-Muntaqim (vengeful), Al-Mutakabbir (arrogant), As-Sabur (patient), Al-Jalil (angry one), etc.\nSome are new versions of other god's names, consisting of Arabized words of pre-Islamic gods names; The most well-known of these is Rahman / Rahmanan, who is referred to (Al-Isra; 110) in a polemic in the Quran. (See also: Allahumma)\nList of names.\nDifferent sources give different lists of the 99 names. The most commonly known list is based on the one found in the \"Jami\u02bf at-Tirmidhi\" (9th century) that was narrated by al-Walid ibn Muslim, which is the most commonly known. However, al-Tirmidhi comments on his list: \"This (version of the) hadith is \"gharib\" [unusual]; it has been narrated from various routes on the authority of Abu Hurayrah, but we do not know of the mention of the Names in the numerous narrations, except this one.\" Other hadiths, such as those of al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi or Ibn \u02bfAs\u0101kir, have variant lists. Various early Muslim exegetes, including Ja\u02bffar al-Sadiq, Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah, Ibn Hazm, al-Qurtubi, and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, have given their own versions of lists of 99 names.\nal-Tirmidhi's list.\nBased on al-Tirmidhi's list above, the names for which there is no evidence, as specified by Sheikh Abd al-Muhsin al-Abbad, Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, and others, are as follows:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0641\u0636\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0632\u064f\u0651\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0630\u0650\u0644\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0644\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u062b\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0635\u0650\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0626\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0639\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u062f\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u062f\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0642\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0637\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u063a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u0639\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0631\u064f\u0651\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0639\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0642\u0650\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0634\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0631.\nHidden names.\nThere is no universal agreement among Islamic exegesis scholars about the number of names of God, since it was only Ibn Hazm who argued a limitation of 99 names. Instead, Islamic scholars such as al-Khattabi, al-Qurtubi, Abi Bakr bin Thayyib, Ibn al-'Arabi (not Ibn Arabi), , Ibn Taymiyya, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya and Ibn Rajab, have stated that Allah has an infinite number of names. While there are rulings that only a few names and their attributes are revealed and known in the Qur'an and Hadiths, the uncountably unrevealed names and their attributes are only known by Allah Himself. The basis of these rulings was the Hadith, which contains a supplication as narrated in Hisn al-Muslim:\nAnother Hadith contains a supplication, with multiple chains of transmitters:\nIn the established Islamic creed about the unrevealed names of Allah, the majority of fatwas say it is obligatory for a Muslim to believe in the existence of the unrevealed names and their attributes, but it is forbidden for Muslims to try to search for them without literal evidences from the Qur'an and authentic Hadiths. In the creed of Islamic eschatology, the hidden names are believed to be hidden from anyone but Allah, and will only be revealed personally to Muhammad during Judgement Day.\nIn textual sources.\nAccording to Muslims, the names of God must be established by evidence and direct reference in the Qur'an and hadiths (the concept of \"tawqif\"). Thus, it is impermissible (\"haram\") for Muslims to give Allah names except with what He has named Himself in the Qur'an or in authentic Hadiths.\nThe Quran.\nThe Quran refers to God's \"Most Beautiful Names\" (\"al-\u02beasm\u0101\u02be al-\u1e25usn\u00e1\") in several Surahs. Gerhard B\u00f6wering refers to Surah 17 (17:110) as the \"locus classicus\" to which explicit lists of 99 names used to be attached in tafsir.\nAnother verse references the \"Most Beautiful Names\":\nA cluster of more than a dozen Divine epithets which are included in such lists is found in Surah 59.\nHadith.\nIn a hadith narrated by Sahih al-Bukhari, it is mentioned that Allah has 99 names.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Abu Hurairah reported that God has ninety-nine Names, i.e., one hundred minus one, and whoever believes in their meanings and acts accordingly, will enter Paradise; and God is witr (one) and loves 'the witr' (i.e., odd numbers).\u2014\u200aIn another hadith, this fact is also mentioned again.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"God has ninety-nine Names, one-hundred less one; and he who memorized them all by heart will enter Paradise.\" To count something means to know it by heart.\u2014\u200a\nAttributes.\nIslamic tenets has detailed descriptions about to differentiate names with attributes ( plural of s\u02e4i.fa\u02d0t), which has literal abilities of their owns. Examples of the attributes are the name of \"ar-Rahman\" contains the attributes \"mercifulness in general\", or \"fundamental mercy\". According to Sahih Bukhari and Muslim, God has 100 kinds of \"rahmah\" (grace/godsend), whereas only one of them already revealed to this world, while the other 99 still withheld for the afterlife. One of the \"rahmah\" which was sent to the world are sufficient to fulfil the needs of all creatures until the Judgement Day; including humans, Jinns, and even non-sentients such as animals, so the parents of animals would not trample their babies under their foots or wasting. Another example is name of al-\u02bfAliyy contains several attributes, such as \"heightness\" and \"above all\".\nThis ruling is because the naming of God are limited by the evidences from Qur'an and Hadith in Sunni Islam. Thus, postulating the tenet in Islam's creed that essentially, the name-bearing of God are different from attributes of God. Nevertheless, Salafi scholar al-Uthaymin stated the principal ruling of giving attributes to God is similar with the verdict about giving name to God; that is forbidden to gave attributes without evidence from Qur'an and Sunnah. One of the disputed name of God among the Islamic academic is \"al-Hannan\", Since it is considered as one of the attribute of \"ar-Rahman\" name in Maryam https://, not because al-Hannan is a name itself.\nBoth Ibn Taymiyya in his work, \"The Treaty of Tadmur\", and Ibn al-Qayyim have published their statements claiming to be refuting Jahmiyya, and al-Juwayni respectively; as Jahmiyya scholars and al-Juwayni rejected the existence of the attributes of God and consider that the names of God are just semantics without any substances in them. The statements of both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim became the ruling which was established by Saudi Council of Senior Scholars, as they stated that each of God's name contains multiple attributes. Salafi scholars such as Ibn Baz did not consent to the interpretation of the attributes of God. Moreover, Walid Muhammad Abdullah Muhammad al-'Ali, an exegesis professor of Islamic University of Madinah, has quoted Ibn al-Qayyim's concern regarding the importance of names and attributes of God as part of the Tawhid (oneness of God) which is the first article of The Six Articles of Faith.\nSufi mysticism.\nThere is a tradition in Sufism to the effect the 99 names of God point to a mystical \"Most Supreme and Superior Name\" (\"ismu l-\u02beA\u02bf\u1e93am\" (). This \"Greatest Name of God\" is said to be \"the one which if He is called (prayed to) by it, He will answer.\" More than 1000 names of God are listed in the Jawshan Kabir (\u2014literally \"the Great Cuirass\") invocations. Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi surmised that the 99 names are \"outward signs of the universe's inner mysteries\".\nIbn Arabi (26 July 1165 \u2013 16 November 1240) did not interpret the names of God as mere epithets, but as actual attributes paring the universe both in created and possible forms. By these names, the divine traits disclose for humans, whose divine potential is hidden, can learn to become a reflection of such names. However, such reflections are limited; the divine traits do not equal the divine essence of the names. Influenced by the metaphysical teachings of Ibn Arabi, Haydar Amuli assigned angels to the different names of God. Accordingly, the good angels as a whole are a manifestation of God's Names of Beauty. Shaitan (\"shayatin\") on the other hand are a manifestation of God's Names of majesty, such as \"The Haughty\".\nTheophoric given names.\nThe Arabic names of God are used to form theophoric given names commonly used in Muslim cultures throughout the world, mostly in Arabic speaking societies.\nBecause the names of God themselves are reserved to God and their use as a person's given name is considered religiously inappropriate, theophoric names are formed by either prefixing the term \"\u02c1abd\" (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f: \"slave/servant of\") to the name (in the case of masculine names) or by dropping the definite article \"al\" (\u0627\u0644). \nThis distinction is established out of respect for the sanctity of Divine names, which denote attributes (of love, kindness, mercy, compassion, justice, power, etc.) that are believed to be possessed in a full and absolute sense only by God, while human beings, being limited creatures, are viewed by Muslims as being endowed with the Divine attributes only in a limited and relative capacity. The prefixing of the definite article would indicate that the bearer possesses the corresponding attribute in an exclusive sense, a trait reserved to God.\nQuranic verse 3:26 is cited as evidence against the validity of using Divine names for persons, with the example of \"M\u0101lik ul-Mulk\" (\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064f: \"Lord of Power\" or \"Owner of all Sovereignty\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Say: \"O God! Lord of Power, You give power to whom You please, and You strip off power from whom You please. You endue with honour whom You please, and You bring low whom You please. In Your hand is all Good.\" Verily, over all things You have power.\u2014\u200a\nThe two parts of the name starting with \"\u02c1abd\" may be written separately (as in the previous example) or combined as one in the transliterated form; in such a case, the vowel transcribed after \"\u02c1abdu\" is often written as u when the two words are transcribed as one: e.g., \"Abdur-Rahman\", \"Abdul-Aziz\", \"Abdul-Jabbar\", or even \"Abdullah\" (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u0670\u0647: \"Servant of God\"). (This has to do with Arabic case vowels, the final u vowel showing the normal \"quote\" nominative case form.)\nExamples of Muslim theophoric names include:\nUse in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sources.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sources state that the 100th name was revealed as \"Bah\u00e1\u02bc\" ( \"glory, splendor\"), which appears in the words Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed. They also believe that it is the greatest name of God. The B\u00e1b wrote a noted pentagram-shaped tablet with 360 morphological derivation of the word \"Bah\u00e1\u02bc\" used in it.\nAccording to Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scholar \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Ham\u00edd Ishr\u00e1q-Kh\u00e1vari, Bah\u0101\u02be al-d\u012bn al-\u02bf\u0100mil\u012b adopted the Persian poetic pen name \"Bah\u0101\u02be\" after being inspired by the words of the fifth Twelver Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, and the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who stated that the greatest name of God was included in either the \"Du\u02bf\u0101\u02beu l-Bah\u0101\u02be\", a dawn prayer for Ramadan, or the \"\u02beA\u02bfmal \u02bfam Daw\u016bd\". In the first verse of the \"du\u02bf\u0101\u02beu l-Bah\u0101\u02be\", the name \"Bah\u0101\u02be\" appears four times.\nAppendix.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the United States, the Dust Bowl led to the nickname the \"Dirty Thirties\".\nThe decade was defined by a global economic and political crisis that culminated in the Second World War. It saw the collapse of the international financial system, beginning with the Wall Street crash of 1929, the largest stock market crash in American history. The subsequent economic downfall, called the Great Depression, had traumatic social effects worldwide, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment, especially in the economic superpower of the United States and in Germany, which was already struggling with the payment of reparations for the First World War. The Dust Bowl in the United States (which led to the nickname the \"Dirty Thirties\") exacerbated the scarcity of wealth. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in 1933, introduced a program of broad-scale social reforms and stimulus plans called the New Deal in response to the crisis. The Soviet Union's second five-year plan gave heavy industry top priority, putting the Soviet Union not far behind Germany as one of the major steel-producing countries of the world, while also improving communications. First-wave feminism made advances, with women gaining the right to vote in South Africa (1930, whites only), Brazil (1933), and Cuba (1933). Following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the emergence of the NSDAP as the country's sole legal party in 1933, Germany imposed a series of laws which discriminated against Jews and other ethnic minorities.\nGermany adopted an aggressive foreign policy, remilitarizing the Rhineland (1936), annexing Austria (1938) and the Sudetenland (1938), before invading Poland (1939) and starting World War II near the end of the decade. Italy likewise continued its already aggressive foreign policy, defeating the Libyan resistance (1932) before invading Ethiopia (1935) and then Albania (1939). Both Germany and Italy became involved in the Spanish Civil War, supporting the eventually victorious Nationalists led by Francisco Franco against the Republicans, who were in turn supported by the Soviet Union. The Chinese Civil War was halted due to the need to confront Japanese imperial ambitions, with the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party forming a Second United Front to fight Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Lesser conflicts included interstate wars such as the Colombia\u2013Peru War (1932\u20131933), the Chaco War (1932\u20131935) and the Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934), as well as internal conflicts in Brazil (1932), Ecuador (1932), El Salvador (1932), Austria (1934) and British Palestine (1936\u20131939).\nSevere famine took place in the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union between 1930 and 1933, leading to 5.7 to 8.7 million deaths. Major contributing factors to the famine include: the forced collectivization in the Soviet Union of agriculture as a part of the First Five-Year Plan, forced grain procurement, combined with rapid industrialization, a decreasing agricultural workforce, and several severe droughts. A famine of similar scope also took place in China from 1936 to 1937, killing 5 million people. The 1931 China floods caused 422,499\u20134,000,000 deaths. Major earthquakes of this decade include the 1935 Quetta earthquake (30,000\u201360,000 deaths) and the 1939 Erzincan earthquake (32,700\u201332,968 deaths).\nWith the advent of sound in 1927, the musical\u2014the genre best placed to showcase the new technology\u2014took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with the animated musical fantasy film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937) becoming the highest-grossing film of this decade in terms of gross rentals. In terms of distributor rentals, \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), an epic historical romance film, was the highest-grossing film of this decade and remains the highest-grossing film (when adjusted for inflation) to this day. Popularity of comedy films boomed after the Silent era with popular comedians The Three Stooges and Marx Brothers. Popular novels of this decade include the historical fiction novels \"The Good Earth,\" \"Anthony Adverse\" and \"Gone with the Wind\", all three of which were best-selling novels in the United States for 2 consecutive years. Cole Porter was a popular music artist in the 1930s, with two of his songs, \"Night and Day\" and \"Begin the Beguine\" becoming No. 1 hits in 1932 and 1935 respectively. The latter song was of the Swing genre, which had begun to emerge as the most popular form of music in the United States since 1933.\nThe world population increased from 2.05 to 2.25 billion people during the decade, with about 750 million births and 550 million deaths.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nScience and technology.\nTechnology.\nMany technological advances occurred in the 1930s, including:\nPopular culture.\nBest-selling books.\nThe best-selling books of every year in the United States were as follows:\nMusic.\nThe most popular music of each year was as follows:\nFashion.\nThe most characteristic North American fashion trend from the 1930s to 1945 was attention at the shoulder, with butterfly sleeves and banjo sleeves, and exaggerated shoulder pads for both men and women by the 1940s. The period also saw the first widespread use of man-made fibers, especially rayon for dresses and viscose for linings and lingerie, and synthetic nylon stockings. The zipper became widely used. These essentially U.S. developments were echoed, in varying degrees, in Britain and Europe. Suntans (called at the time \"sunburns\") became fashionable in the early 1930s, along with travel to the resorts along the Mediterranean, in the Bahamas, and on the east coast of Florida where one can acquire a tan, leading to new categories of clothes: white dinner jackets for men and beach pajamas, halter tops, and bare midriffs for women.\nRevolutionary designer and couturier Madeleine Vionnet gained popularity for her bias-cut technique, which clung, draped, and embraced the curves of the natural female body. Fashion trendsetters in the period included The Prince of Wales (King Edward VIII from January 1936 until his abdication that December) and his companion Wallis Simpson (the Duke and Duchess of Windsor from their marriage in June 1937), socialites like Nicolas de Gunzburg, Daisy Fellowes and Mona von Bismarck, and Hollywood movie stars such as Fred Astaire, Carole Lombard, and Joan Crawford.\nTypical fashions in the 1930s:\nVisual arts.\nSocial realism became an important art movement during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. Social realism generally portrayed imagery with socio-political meaning. Other related American artistic movements of the 1930s were American scene painting and Regionalism which were generally depictions of rural America, and historical images drawn from American history. Precisionism with its depictions of industrial America was also a popular art movement during the 1930s in the USA. During the Great Depression the art of photography played an important role in the Social Realist movement. The work of Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Margaret Bourke-White, Lewis Hine, Edward Steichen, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein, Marion Post Wolcott, Doris Ulmann, Berenice Abbott, Aaron Siskind, Russell Lee, Ben Shahn (as a photographer) among several others were particularly influential.\nThe Works Progress Administration part of the Roosevelt Administration's New Deal sponsored the Federal Art Project, the Public Works of Art Project, and the Section of Painting and Sculpture which employed many American artists and helped them to make a living during the Great Depression.\nMexican muralism was a Mexican art movement that took place primarily in the 1930s. The movement stands out historically because of its political undertones, the majority of which of a Marxist nature, or related to a social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Also in Latin America Symbolism and Magic Realism were important movements.\nIn Europe during the 1930s and the Great Depression, Surrealism, late Cubism, the Bauhaus, De Stijl, Dada, German Expressionism, Symbolist and modernist painting in various guises characterized the art scene in Paris and elsewhere.\nPeople.\nScientists and engineers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors/entertainers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmmakers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInfluential artists.\nPainters and sculptors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports figures.\nGlobal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnited States.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCriminals.\nProminent criminals of the Great Depression:\nSee also.\nTimeline.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks and magazines on film.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Primarily known for the economic boom that occurred in the Western World following the end of World War I (1914\u20131918), the decade is frequently referred to as the \"Roaring Twenties\" or the \"Jazz Age\" in America and Western Europe, and the \"Golden Twenties\" in Germany, while French speakers refer to the period as the \"Ann\u00e9es folles\" ('crazy years') to emphasize the decade's social, artistic, and cultural dynamism.\nThe devastating Wall Street crash in October 1929 is generally viewed as a harbinger of the end of 1920s prosperity in North America and Europe. In the Soviet Union, the New Economic Policy was created by the Bolsheviks in 1921, to be replaced by the first five-year plan in 1928. The 1920s saw the rise of radical political movements, with the Red Army triumphing against White movement forces in the Russian Civil War, and the emergence of far-right political movements in Europe. In 1922, the fascist leader Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy. Other dictators that emerged included J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski in Poland, and Peter and Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 in Yugoslavia. First-wave feminism made advances, with women gaining the right to vote in the United States (1920), Albania (1920), (1921), and with suffrage being expanded in Britain to all women over 21 years old (1928).\nIn Turkey, nationalist forces defeated Greece, France, Armenia, and Britain in the Turkish War of Independence, leading to the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), a treaty more favorable to Turkey than the earlier proposed Treaty of S\u00e8vres. The war also led to the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate. Nationalist revolts also occurred in Ireland (1919\u20131921) and Syria (1925\u20131927). Under Mussolini, Italy pursued a more aggressive domestic and foreign policy, leading to the nigh-eradication of the Sicilian Mafia and the Second Italo-Senussi War in Libya respectively. In 1927, China erupted into a civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China (ROC) and forces of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Civil wars also occurred in Paraguay (1922\u20131923), Ireland (1922\u20131923), Honduras (1924), Nicaragua (1926\u20131927), and Afghanistan (1928\u20131929). Saudi forces conquered Jabal Shammar and subsequently, Hejaz.\nA severe famine occurred in Russia (1921\u20131922) due to the combined effects of economic disturbance because of the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, exacerbated by rail systems that could not distribute food efficiently, leading to 5 million deaths. Another severe famine occurred in China (1928\u20131930), leading to 6 million deaths. The Spanish flu pandemic (1918\u20131920) and Russian typhus epidemic (1918\u20131922), which had begun in the previous decade, caused 25\u201350 million and 2\u20133 million deaths respectively. Major natural disasters of this decade include the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake (258,707~273,407 deaths), 1922 Shantou typhoon (50,000\u2013100,000 deaths), 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake (105,385\u2013142,800 deaths), and 1927 Gulang earthquake (40,912 deaths).\nSilent films were popular in this decade, with the highest-grossing film of this decade being either the American silent epic adventure-drama film \"\" or the American silent war drama film \"The Big Parade\", depending on the metrics used. Sinclair Lewis was a popular author in the United States in the 1920s, with his books \"Main Street\" and \"Elmer Gantry\" becoming best-sellers. Best-selling books outside the US included the Czech book \"The Good Soldier \u0160vejk\", which sold 20 million copies. Songs of this decade included \"Mack the Knife\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\".\nDuring the 1920s, the world population increased from 1.87 to 2.05 billion, with approximately 700 million births and 525 million deaths in total.\nSocial history.\nThe Roaring Twenties brought about several novel and highly visible social and cultural trends. These trends, made possible by sustained economic prosperity, were most visible in major cities like New York, Chicago, Paris, Berlin, and London. \"Normalcy\" returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism during World War I, jazz blossomed, and Art Deco peaked. For women, knee-length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable, as did bobbed hair with a finger wave or marcel wave. The women who pioneered these trends were frequently referred to as flappers.\nThe era saw the large-scale adoption of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and household electricity, as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture, mostly in the urbanized areas of the Western World. The media became increasingly more important and began to focus on celebrities like sports heroes and movie stars and began to include women. Some film historians call this distribution of images and invention a \"frenzy of the visible.\" Large baseball stadiums were built in major US cities, in addition to palatial cinemas.\nMany independent countries passed women's suffrage after 1918. Academics such as Arthur Marwick have argued that this occurred because countries wanted to reward the role women played on the home front. However, some scholars like Ellen Dubois have argued that this perspective is incorrect, pointing out some belligerent countries like Italy did not grant suffrage. Meanwhile, some countries like the Netherlands which did not participate in the war did grant suffrage to women.\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nPopular culture.\nFilm.\nSilent films were popular in this decade, with the highest-grossing film of this decade being either 1925 American silent epic adventure-drama film \"\" or the 1925 American silent war drama film \"The Big Parade\", depending on the metrics used: \"Ben-Hur\" grossed more during its initial release, but \"The Big Parade\" ultimately grossed more via re-releases.\nFashion.\nThe 1920s is the decade in which fashion entered the modern era. It was the decade in which women first abandoned the more restricting fashions of past years and began to wear more comfortable clothes (such as short skirts or trousers). Men also abandoned highly formal daily attire and even began to wear athletic clothing for the first time. The suits men wear today are still based, for the most part, on those worn in the late 1920s. The 1920s are characterized by two distinct periods of fashion. In the early part of the decade, change was slow, as many were reluctant to adopt new styles. From 1925, the public passionately embraced the styles associated with the Roaring Twenties. These styles continued to characterize fashion until the worldwide depression worsened in 1931.\nLiterature.\nThe best-selling books of every year in the United States were as follows:\nPeople.\nScience, Engineering and Technology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLiterature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEntertainers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilm makers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArtists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports figures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\nTimeline.\nThe following articles contain brief timelines listing the most prominent events of the decade:\n1920 \u2022 1921 \u2022 1922 \u2022 1923 \u2022 1924 \u2022 1925 \u2022 1926 \u2022 1927 \u2022 1928 \u2022 1929\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On the same day, Nigeria became a British protectorate.\nFollowing this, the Victorian Era would come to an end after Queen Victoria died on January 22 after a reign of 63 years and 216 days, which was longer than those of any of her predecessors, Her son, Edward VII, succeeded her to the throne.\nSignificance of 1901 for software.\nThe date of Friday December 13 20:45:52 1901 is significant for modern computers because it is the earliest date representable with a signed 32-bit integer on systems that reference time in seconds since the Unix epoch. This corresponds to \u22122147483648 seconds from Thursday January 1 00:00:00 1970. Software that depends on this representation cannot represent an earlier date.\nSimilarly, many computer systems suffer from the year 2038 problem, when the positive number of seconds since 1970 exceeds 2147483647 (01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 in binary) and, if represented as a signed 32-bit integer, wraps to \u22122147483648, representing Friday December 13 20:45:52 1901. In a way, the year 2038 problem for using signed 32-bit integers with January 1, 1970, as the zero date is as the year 2000 problem was for software using two-digit decimal integers with January 1, 1900, as the zero date.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Edwardian era (1901\u20131910) covers a similar span of time. The term \"nineteen-hundreds\" is sometimes also used to mean the entire century from January 1, 1900, to December 31, 1999 (the years beginning with \"19\").\nThe Scramble for Africa continued, with the Orange Free State, South African Republic, Ashanti Empire, Aro Confederacy, Sokoto Caliphate and Kano Emirate being conquered by the British Empire, alongside the French Empire conquering Borno, the German Empire conquering the Adamawa Emirate, and the Portuguese Empire conquering the Ovambo. Atrocities in the Congo Free State were committed by private companies and the \"Force Publique\", with a resultant population decline of 1 to 15 million. From 1904 to 1908, German colonial forces in South West Africa led a campaign of ethnic extermination and collective punishment, killing 24,000 to 100,000 Hereros and 10,000 Nama. The First Moroccan and Bosnian crises led to worsened tensions in Europe that would ultimately lead to World War I in the next decade. Cuba, Bulgaria, and Norway became independent.\nThe deadliest conventional war of this decade was the Russo-Japanese War, fought over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and the Korean Empire. Russia suffered a humiliating defeat in this conflict, contributing to a growing domestic unrest which culminated in the Russian Revolution of 1905. Unconventional wars of similar scale include insurrections in the Philippines (1899\u20131913), China (1899\u20131901), and Colombia (1899\u20131902). Lesser conflicts include interstate wars such as the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902), the Kuwaiti\u2013Rashidi war (1900\u20131901), and the Saudi\u2013Rashidi War (1903\u20131907), as well as failed uprisings and revolutions in Portuguese Angola (1902\u20131904), Rumelia (1903), Ottoman Eastern Anatolia (1904), Uruguay (1904), French Madagascar (1905\u20131906), Argentina (1905), Persia (1905\u20131911), German East Africa (1905\u20131907), and Romania (1907). A major famine took place in China from 1906 to 1907, possibly leading to 20\u201325 million deaths. This famine was directly caused by the 1906 China floods (April\u2013October 1906), which hit the Huai River particularly hard and destroyed both the summer and autumn harvest. The 1908 Messina earthquake caused 75,000\u201382,000 deaths.\nFirst-wave feminism made advances, with universities being opened for women in Japan, Bulgaria, Cuba, Russia, and Peru. In 1906, Finland granted women the right to vote, the first European country to do so. The foundation of the Women's Social and Political Union by Emmeline Pankhurst in 1903 led to the rise of the Suffragettes in Great Britain and Ireland. In 1908, a revolution took place in the Ottoman Empire, where the Young Turks movement restored the Ottoman constitution of 1876, establishing the Second Constitutional Era. Subsequently, ethnic tensions rose, and in 1909, up to 30,000 mainly Armenian civilians in Adana were slain by Turkish civilians.\nThe decade saw the widespread application of the internal combustion engine including mass production of the automobile, as well as the introduction of the typewriter. The \"Wright Flyer\" performed the first recorded controlled, powered, sustained heavier than air flight on December 17, 1903. Reginald Fessenden of East Bolton, Quebec, Canada made what appeared to be the first audio radio broadcasts of entertainment and music ever made to a general audience. The first huge success of American cinema, as well as the largest experimental achievement to this point, was the 1903 film \"The Great Train Robbery\", directed by Edwin S. Porter, while the world's first feature film, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", was released on December 26, 1906, in Melbourne, Australia. Popular books of this decade included \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" (1902) and \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1908), which sold 45 million and 50 million copies respectively. Popular songs of this decade include \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" and \"What Are They Doing in Heaven?\", which have been featured in 42 and 16 hymnals respectively.\nDuring the decade, the world population increased from 1.60 to 1.75 billion, with approximately 580 million births and 450 million deaths in total. As of December 2025, the only remaining living person born in this decade is Ethel Caterham, born August 21, 1909. The last living man from this decade was Juan Vicente P\u00e9rez (May 27, 1909 \u2013 April 2, 2024).\nPronunciation varieties.\nThere are several main varieties of how individual years of the decade are pronounced. Using 1906 as an example, they are \"nineteen-oh-six\", \"nineteen-six\", and \"nineteen-aught-six\". Which variety is most prominent depends somewhat on global region and generation. \"Nineteen-oh-six\" is the most common; \"nineteen-six\" is less common. In American English, \"nineteen-aught-six\" is also recognized but not much used.\nDemographics.\nEstimates for the world population by 1900 vary from 1.563 to 1.710 billion.\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nPopular culture.\nLiterature.\nThe best selling books of the decade were \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1908) and \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" (1902), which sold 50 million and 45 million copies respectively. Serbian writers used the Belgrade literary style, an Ekavian writing form which set basis for the later standardization of the Serbian language. Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, published \"The Old New Land\" in 1902, outlining Herzl's vision for a Jewish state in the Land of Israel.\nBelow are the best-selling books in the United States of each year, as determined by \"Publishers Weekly\".\nMusic.\nPopular songs of the 1900s include \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" and \"What Are They Doing in Heaven?\", which have been featured in 42 and 16 hymnals respectively.\nPeople.\nModern artists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther notable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLast survivors.\nSince the deaths of Okagi Hayashi of Japan on 26 April 2025 and Inah Canabarro Lucas of Brazil on 30 April 2025, there is one remaining verified living person born in the 1900s decade, Ethel Caterham (born 21 August 1909) of the United Kingdom.

The conservative lifestyles during the first half of the decade, as well as the legacy of military alliances, were forever changed by the June 28, 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. The archduke's murder triggered a chain of events in which, within 33 days, World War I broke out in Europe on August 1, 1914. The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial and one-sided Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919.\nThe war's end triggered the abdication of various monarchies and the collapse of four of the last modern empires of Russia, Germany, Ottoman Turkey, and Austria-Hungary, with the latter splintered into Austria, Hungary, southern Poland (who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Bessarabia. However, each of these states (with the possible exception of Yugoslavia) had large German and Hungarian minorities, creating some unexpected problems that would be brought to light in the next two decades.\nThe decade was also a period of revolution in many countries. The Portuguese 5 October 1910 revolution, which ended the eight-century-long monarchy, spearheaded the trend, followed by the Mexican Revolution in November 1910, which led to the ousting of dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz, developing into a violent civil war that dragged on until mid-1920, not long after a new Mexican Constitution was signed and ratified. The Russian Empire had a similar fate, since its participation in World War I led it to a social, political, and economical collapse which made the tsarist autocracy unsustainable and, succeeding the events of 1905, culminated in the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, under the direction of the Bolshevik Party, later renamed as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution of 1918, known as the October Revolution, was followed by the Russian Civil War, which dragged on until approximately late 1922. China saw 2,000 years of imperial rule ended with the Xinhai Revolution, becoming a nominal republic until Yuan Shikai's failed attempt to restore the monarchy and his death started the Warlord Era in 1916.\nMuch of the music in these years was ballroom-themed. Many of the fashionable restaurants were equipped with dance floors. Prohibition in the United States began January 16, 1919, with the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Best-selling books of this decade include \"The Inside of the Cup\", \"Seventeen\", \"Mr. Britling Sees It Through\", and \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\"\nDuring the 1910s, the world population increased from 1.75 to 1.87 billion, with approximately 640 million births and 500 million deaths in total.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitics and wars.\nAssassinations.\nProminent assassinations include:\nPopular culture.\nLiterature and arts.\nBelow are the best-selling books in the United States of each year, as determined by \"The Bookman\", a New York-based literary journal (1910\u20131912) and \"Publishers Weekly\" (1913 and beyond).\nVisual Arts.\nThe 1913 Armory Show in New York City was a seminal event in the history of Modern Art.

It is estimated that the century witnessed the death of more than 45 million lives from political and natural disasters in both Europe and the Mongol Empire. West Africa experienced economic growth and prosperity.\nIn Europe, the Black Death claimed 25 million lives \u2013 wiping out one third of the European population \u2013 while the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France fought in the protracted Hundred Years' War after the death of King Charles IV of France led to a claim to the French throne by King Edward III of England. This period is considered the height of chivalry and marks the beginning of strong separate identities for both England and France as well as the foundation of the Italian Renaissance and the Ottoman Empire.\nIn Asia, Tamerlane (Timur), established the Timurid Empire, history's third largest empire to have been ever established by a single conqueror. Scholars estimate that Timur's military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people, amounting to about 5% of the world population at the time. Synchronously, the Timurid Renaissance emerged. In the Arab world, historian and political scientist Ibn Khaldun and explorer Ibn Battuta made significant contributions. In India, the Bengal Sultanate separated from the Delhi Sultanate, a major trading nation in the world. The sultanate was described by the Europeans as the richest country to trade with. The Mongol court was driven out of China and retreated to Mongolia, the Ilkhanate collapsed, the Chaghatayid dissolved and broke into two parts, and the Golden Horde lost its position as a great power in Eastern Europe.\nIn Africa, the wealthy Mali Empire, a huge producer of gold, reached its territorial and economic height under the reign of Mansa Musa I of Mali, the wealthiest individual of medieval times, and perhaps the wealthiest ever.\nIn the Americas, the Mexica founded the city of Tenochtitlan, while the Mississippian mound city of Cahokia was abandoned.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In North America, the election of Free Soiler Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in 1860 in the United States led to the secession of eleven southern states as the Confederate States of America (CSA). The resulting American Civil War (1861\u20131865) would be among the first industrial wars, featuring advanced technology such as steel warships and machine guns. The victory of the Union and subsequent abolition of slavery would contribute to the decline of the global slave trade. Conflict in Mexico ensued after the French Empire installed Maximilian I as Emperor of Mexico; former President Benito Suarez would regain his position in 1867 after a power struggle.\nIn South America, the Triple Alliance of the Empire of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay in the Paraguayan War (1864\u20131870) would be among the bloodiest conflicts in the continent's history, leading to the death of almost 60% of the Paraguayan population.\nIn Europe, the formation of the union of Austria-Hungary in 1867 and the ongoing campaign to unify Italy by Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia-Piedmont would affect the European balance of power. The United Kingdom would continue engaging in a series of conflicts known as the New Zealand Wars with the indigenous M\u0101ori, with the New Zealand land confiscations beginning in 1863.\nIn Asia, the Meiji Restoration of 1868 would begin the process of transforming Japan into a global imperial power. The Qing Dynasty of China would experience decline following its defeat to the British in 1860 in the Second Opium War.

It is often written as the 1st century AD or 1st century CE to distinguish it from the 1st century BC (or BCE) which preceded it. The 1st century is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period. The Roman Empire, Han China and the Parthian Persia were the most powerful and hegemonic states.\nDuring this century, the Roman Empire (ruled by the Julio-Claudian and Flavian dynasties) continued to be in a period of relative stability known as Pax Romana, withstanding a financial crisis in 33 and a civil war in 69. In Europe, Rome expanded into Britain and fought wars in Germania and Dacia. In Africa, Rome was challenged by Tacfarinas, who led his own Musulamii tribe and a loose and changing coalition of other Berber tribes before being defeated in 24. In West Asia, Rome defeated a Jewish rebellion (66\u201373) and fought a war with Parthia from 58\u201363, though the latter conflict was inconclusive. In East Asia, the Chinese Western Han dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Xin dynasty in 9, which in turn faced its own rebel movements (namely the Red Eyebrows and Lulin), and was replaced by the Eastern Han dynasty in 25. The Eastern Han dynasty then faced and quelled a rebellion by the Tr\u01b0ng sisters (40\u201343). In 58, the Eastern Han dynasty entered a golden age with the Rule of Ming and Zhang, who were generally regarded as able administrators who cared about the welfare of the people and who promoted officials with integrity. On its northern frontier, the Chinese dynasties waged intermittent war with the Xiongnu before emerging victorious in 91. The states of Funan and Xianbei were also established in this century.\nThe century saw the origination of Christianity from Palestine. In the early 30s, Roman governor Pontius Pilate sentenced Jesus to crucifixion; his suffering and redemptive death by crucifixion would become central aspects of Christian theology concerning the doctrines of salvation and atonement. Anti-Jewish riots broke out in Alexandria in 38. In 64, the Great Fire of Rome destroyed two-thirds of the city, precipitating the empire's first persecution of Christians, who were blamed for the disaster. Later in 70, the siege and subsequent sack of Jerusalem and the Second Temple during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War marked a major turning point in Jewish history. The loss of mother-city and temple necessitated a reshaping of Jewish culture to ensure its survival. Judaism's Temple-based sects, including the priesthood and the Sadducees, diminished in importance. Second Temple Judaism came to an end, while a new form of Judaism that became known as Rabbinic Judaism developed out of the Pharisaic school. Furthermore, the White Horse Temple, the first Buddhist temple in China, was traditionally constructed in 68, though it is not recorded in contemporary sources before 289.\nSeveral natural disasters took place in this century. In 17, an earthquake struck the region of Lydia in the Roman province of Asia in Asia Minor (now part of Turkey), causing the destruction of at least 12 cities, with Sardis being most affected. Around 44 to 48, a famine took place in Judea, precipitating assistance by Helena of Adiabene and her son, Izates II. In 62, an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of between 5 and 6 and a maximum intensity of IX or X on the Mercalli scale struck the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, severely damaging them. The towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum both suffered major damage, with damage to some buildings also reported from Naples and Nuceria. In 79, Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of , ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash. The event destroyed several towns and minor settlements in the area, at the time part of the Roman Empire, with Pompeii and Herculaneum being the most famous examples. The total population of both cities was over twenty thousand. The remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum so far, although the total death toll from the eruption remains unknown. Death toll estimates range from 13,000 to 16,000.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The conquests of Hulagu Khan and other Mongol invasions changed the course of the Muslim world, most notably the Siege of Baghdad (1258) and the destruction of the House of Wisdom. Other Muslim powers such as the Mali Empire and Delhi Sultanate conquered large parts of West Africa and the Indian subcontinent, while Buddhism witnessed a decline through the conquest led by Bakhtiyar Khilji. The earliest Islamic states in Southeast Asia formed during this century, most notably Samudera Pasai. The Kingdoms of Sukhothai and Hanthawaddy would emerge and go on to dominate their surrounding territories.\nEurope entered the apex of the High Middle Ages, characterized by rapid legal, cultural, and religious evolution as well as economic dynamism. Crusades after the fourth, while mostly unsuccessful in rechristianizing the Holy Land, inspired the desire to expel Muslim presence from Europe that drove the Reconquista and solidified a sense of Christendom. To the north, the Teutonic Order Christianized and gained dominance of Prussia, Estonia, and Livonia. Inspired by new translations into Latin of classical works preserved in the Islamic World for over a thousand years, Thomas Aquinas developed Scholasticism, which dominated the curricula of the new universities. In England, King John signed the Magna Carta, beginning the tradition of Parliamentary advisement in England. This helped develop the principle of equality under law in European judisprudence.\nThe Southern Song dynasty began the century as a prosperous kingdom but were later invaded and annexed into the Yuan dynasty of the Mongols. The Kamakura Shogunate of Japan successfully resisted two Mongol invasion attempts in 1274 and 1281. The Korean state of Goryeo resisted a Mongol invasion, but eventually sued for peace and became a client state of the Yuan dynasty.\nIn North America, according to some population estimates, the population of Cahokia grew to be comparable to the population of 13th-century London. In Peru, the Kingdom of Cuzco began as part of the Late Intermediate Period. In Mayan civilization, the 13th century marked the beginning of the Late Postclassic period. The Kanem Empire in what is now Chad reached its apex. The Solomonic dynasty in Ethiopia and the Zimbabwe Kingdom were founded.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Yugoslavia's communist regime collapses amidst increasing internal tensions and multiparty elections held within its constituent republics result in separatist governments being elected in most of the republics marking the beginning of the breakup of Yugoslavia. Also in this year began the crisis that would lead to the Gulf War in 1991 following the Iraq invasion and the largely internationally unrecognized annexation of Kuwait. This led to Operation Desert Shield being enacted with an international coalition of military forces being built up on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border with demands for Iraq to peacefully withdraw from Kuwait. Also in this year, Nelson Mandela was released from prison, and Margaret Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after more than 11 years.\n1990 was an important year in the Internet's early history. In late 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created the first web server and the foundation for the World Wide Web. Test operations began around December 20 and it was released outside CERN the following year. 1990 also saw the official decommissioning of the ARPANET, a forerunner of the Internet system and the introduction of the first content web search engine, Archie, on September 10.\nSeptember 14, 1990, saw the first case of successful somatic gene therapy on a patient.\nDue to the early 1990s recession that began that year and uncertainty due to the collapse of the socialist governments in Eastern Europe, birth rates in many countries stopped rising or fell steeply in 1990. In most western countries the Echo Boom peaked in 1990; fertility rates declined thereafter.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Canada and the U.S. expand west, with the Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces and the founding of Las Vegas. 1905 is also the year in which Albert Einstein, at this time resident in Bern, publishes his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers in \"Annalen der Physik\" (Leipzig) (March 18, May 11, June 30 and September 27), laying the foundations for more than a century's study of theoretical physics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34638", "revid": "50976332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34638", "title": "401(k)", "text": "Type of U.S. retirement/pension plan\nIn the United States, a 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored, defined-contribution, personal pension (savings) account, as defined in subsection 401(k) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Periodic employee contributions come directly out of their paychecks, and may be matched by the employer. This pre-tax option is what makes 401(k) plans attractive to employees, and many employers offer this option to their (full-time) workers. 401(k) payable is a general ledger account that contains the amount of 401(k) plan pension payments that an employer has an obligation to remit to a pension plan administrator. This account is classified as a payroll liability, since the amount owed should be paid within one year.\nThere are two types: traditional and Roth 401(k). For Roth accounts, contributions and withdrawals have no impact on income tax. For traditional accounts, contributions may be deducted from taxable income and withdrawals are added to taxable income. There are limits to contributions, rules governing withdrawals and possible penalties.\nThe benefit (vs. a normally taxed account) of the Roth account is from permanently tax-free profits that would normally be taxed in a normal account. The net benefit of the traditional account is the sum of (1) the same benefit as from the Roth account from the permanently tax-free profits on after-tax saving, (2) a possible bonus (or penalty) from withdrawals at tax rates lower (or higher) than at contribution, and (3) the impact on qualification for other income-tested programs from contributions and withdrawals reducing and adding to taxable income. \nAs of 2019, 401(k) plans had US$6.4 trillion in assets.\nHistory.\nBefore 1974, some U.S. employers had been giving their staff the option of receiving cash in lieu of an employer-paid contribution to their tax-qualified retirement plan accounts. The U.S. Congress banned new plans of this type in 1974, pending further study. After that study was completed, Congress reauthorized such plans, provided they satisfied certain special requirements. Congress did this by enacting Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) as part of the Revenue Act. This occurred on 6 November 1978.\nThe first implementation of the 401(k) plan was in 1978, about three weeks after Section 401(k) was enacted, before the Revenue Act of 1978 even went into effect. Ethan Lipsig, of the outside law firm for Hughes Aircraft Company, sent a letter to Hughes Aircraft outlining how it could convert its after-tax savings plan into a 401(k) plan.\nTed Benna was among the first to establish a 401(k) plan, creating it at his own employer, the Johnson Companies (today doing business as Johnson Kendall &amp; Johnson). Benna was trying to reduce the taxes due on an deferred-compensation bonus plan for bank executives, at a time when the top marginal income tax rate was 70%. Employees could contribute 25% of their salaries, up to $30,000 per year, to their employer's 401(k) plan.\nTaxation.\nThere are two main types corresponding to the same distinction in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA); variously referred to as traditional vs. Roth, or tax deferred vs. tax exempt, or EET vs. TEE.\nTraditional.\nThe tax-saving benefits from Traditional accounts (as measured by the difference in outcomes vs a normally taxed account) come from two factors. The first possible benefit (which might end up being a cost) is that at the time of withdrawal, which happens later, the tax rate might potentially differ. The hope is the retirement rate will be lower, for a benefit. Effective tax rates are used to incorporate the impact of contributions and draws on the saver's qualification for benefits from other income-tested programs. \nSecond, everyone always receives the same benefit as from a Roth account - permanently tax-free profits on after-tax savings. The conceptual understanding is that the contribution's tax reduction is the government investing its money alongside the saver's, for him to invest as he likes. They become co-owners of the account. The government's share of the account (funding plus the tax-free profits earned by it) at withdrawal fully funds the account's withdrawal tax calculated at the contribution's tax rate. So the contribution's tax reduction is never a benefit, and profits are never taxed. The withdrawal tax is conceptually an allocation of principal between owners, not a 'tax', and there is no benefit 'from deferral'.\nFor pre-tax contributions, the employee still pays the total 7.65% payroll taxes (social security and medicare). If the employee made after-tax contributions to the 401(k) account, these amounts are commingled with the pre-tax funds and simply add to the 401(k) basis. When distributions are made, the taxable portion of the distribution will be calculated as the ratio of the after-tax contributions to the total 401(k) basis. The remainder of the distribution is tax-free and not included in gross income for the year.\nRoth.\nBeginning in the 2006 tax year, employees have been allowed to designate contributions as a Roth 401(k) deferral. Similar to the provisions of a Roth IRA, these contributions are made on an after-tax basis.\nFor accumulated after-tax contributions and earnings in a designated Roth account (Roth 401(k)), \"qualified distributions\" can be made tax-free. To qualify, distributions must be made more than 5 years after the first designated Roth contributions \"and\" not before the year in which the account owner turns age &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442, unless an exception applies as detailed in IRS code section 72(t). In the case of designated Roth contributions, the contributions being made on an after-tax basis means that the taxable income in the year of contribution is not decreased as it is with pre-tax contributions. Roth contributions are irrevocable and cannot be converted to pre-tax contributions at a later date. (In contrast to Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs), where Roth contributions may be recharacterized as pre-tax contributions.) Administratively, Roth contributions must be made to a separate account, and records must be kept that distinguish the amount of contribution and the corresponding earnings that are to receive Roth treatment.\nUnlike the Roth IRA, there is no upper-income limit capping eligibility for Roth 401(k) contributions. Individuals who find themselves disqualified from a Roth IRA may contribute to their Roth 401(k). Individuals who qualify for both can contribute the maximum statutory amounts into either or a combination of the two plans (including both catch-up contributions if applicable). Aggregate statutory annual limits set by the IRS will apply.\nWithdrawal of funds.\nGenerally, a 401(k) participant may begin to withdraw money from his or her plan after reaching the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442 without penalty. The Internal Revenue Code imposes severe restrictions on withdrawals of tax-deferred or Roth contributions while a person remains in service with the company and is under the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442. Any withdrawal that is permitted before the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442 is subject to an excise tax equal to ten percent of the amount distributed (on top of the ordinary income tax that has to be paid), including withdrawals to pay expenses due to a hardship, except to the extent the distribution does not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction under Internal Revenue Code section 213 to the employee for amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care (determined without regard to whether the employee itemizes deductions for such taxable year). Amounts withdrawn are subject to ordinary income taxes to the participant.\nThe Internal Revenue Code generally defines a hardship as any of the following.\nSome employers may disallow one, several, or all of the previous hardship causes. To maintain the tax advantage for income deferred into a 401(k), the law stipulates the restriction that unless an exception applies, money must be kept in the plan or an equivalent tax deferred plan until the employee reaches &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442 years of age. Money that is withdrawn prior to the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442 typically incurs a 10% penalty tax unless a further exception applies. This penalty is on top of the \"ordinary income\" tax that has to be paid on such a withdrawal. The exceptions to the 10% penalty include: the employee's death, the employee's total and permanent disability, separation from service in or after the year the employee reached age 55, substantially equal periodic payments under section 72(t), a qualified domestic relations order, and for deductible medical expenses (exceeding the 7.5% floor). This does not apply to the similar 457 plan.\nAs a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act allowed people to withdraw funds before the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442 up to $100,000 without the 10% penalty due for 2020.\nLoans.\nMany plans also allow participants to take loans from their 401(k). The \"interest\" on the loan is paid not to the financial institution, but is instead paid into the 401(k) plan itself, essentially becoming additional after-tax contributions to the 401(k). The movement of the principal portion of the loan is tax-neutral as long as it is properly paid back. However, the interest portion of the loan repayments are made with after-tax funds but do not increase the after-tax basis in the 401(k). Therefore, upon distribution/conversion of those funds, the owner will have to pay taxes on (only) the interest funds a second time.\nThe loan principal is not taxable income nor subject to the 10% penalty as long as it is paid back in accordance with section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code. This section requires, among other things, that the loan is for a term no longer than 5 years (except for the purchase of a primary residence), that a \"reasonable\" rate of interest be charged, and that substantially equal payments (with payments made at least every calendar quarter) be made over the life of the loan. Employers, of course, have the option to make their plan's loan provisions more restrictive. When an employee does not make payments in accordance with the plan or IRS regulations, the outstanding loan balance will be declared in \"default\". A defaulted loan, and possibly accrued interest on the loan balance, becomes a taxable distribution to the employee in the year of default with all the same tax penalties and implications of a withdrawal.\nRequired minimum distributions (RMD).\nAccount owners must begin making distributions from their accounts by April 1 of the calendar year after turning age &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;70+1\u20442 (72 for individuals who turn age &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;70+1\u20442 after December 31, 2019) or April 1 of the calendar year after retiring, whichever is later. The amount of distributions is based on life expectancy according to the relevant factors from the appropriate IRS tables.\nThe required minimum distribution is \"not\" required for a particular calendar year if the account owner is employed by the employer during the entire calendar year \"and\" the account owner does not own more than 5% of the employer's business at any point during the calendar year. Required minimum distributions apply to both traditional contributions and Roth contributions to a 401(k) plan.\nA person who is required to make a required minimum distribution, but does not do so, is subject to a penalty of 50% of the amount that should have been distributed.\nIn response to the United States economic crisis of 2007\u20132009, Congress suspended the RMD requirement for 2009. It was suspended again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRequired distributions for some former employees.\nA 401(k) plan may have a provision in its plan documents to close the account of former employees who have low account balances. Almost 90% of 401(k) plans have such a provision. As of March 2005, a 401(k) plan may require the closing of a former employee's account if and only if the former employee's account has less than $1,000 of vested assets.\nWhen a former employee's account is closed, the former employee can either roll over the funds to an individual retirement account, roll over the funds to another 401(k) plan, or receive a cash distribution, less required income taxes and possibly a penalty for a cash withdrawal before the age of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;59+1\u20442.\nRollovers.\nRollovers between eligible retirement plans are accomplished in one of two ways: by a distribution to the participant and a subsequent rollover to another plan or by a direct rollover from plan to plan. Rollovers after a distribution to the participant must generally be accomplished within 60 days of the distribution. If the 60-day limit is not met, the rollover will be disallowed and the distribution will be taxed as ordinary income and the 10% penalty will apply, if applicable. The same rules and restrictions apply to rollovers from plans to IRAs.\nDirect rollovers.\nA direct rollover from an eligible retirement plan to another eligible retirement plan is not taxable, regardless of the age of the participant.\nTraditional to Roth conversions.\nIn 2013, the IRS began allowing conversions of existing Traditional 401(k) contributions to Roth 401(k). In order to do so, an employee's company plan must offer both a Traditional and Roth option and explicitly permit such a conversion.\nTechnical details.\nContribution deferral limits.\nThere is a maximum limit on the total yearly \"employee\" pre-tax or Roth salary deferral into the plan. This limit, known as the \"402(g) limit\", was $19,000 for 2019, $19,500 for 2020\u20132021, $20,500 for 2022, $22,500 for 2023, and $23,000 for 2024. For future years, the limit may be indexed for inflation, increasing in increments of $500. Employees who are at least 50 years old at any time during the year are now allowed additional pre-tax \"catch up\" contributions of up to $6,000 for 2015\u20132019, and $6,500 for 2020\u20132021. The limit for future \"catch up\" contributions may also be adjusted for inflation in increments of $500. In eligible plans, employees can elect to contribute on a pre-tax basis or as a Roth 401(k) contribution, or a combination of the two, but the total of those two contributions amounts must not exceed the contribution limit in a single calendar year. This limit does not apply to post-tax non-Roth elections.\nIf the employee contributes more than the maximum pre-tax/Roth limit to 401(k) accounts in a given year, the excess, as well as the deemed earnings for those contributions, must be withdrawn or corrected by April 15 of the following year. This violation most commonly occurs when a person switches employers mid-year and the latest employer does not know to enforce the contribution limits on behalf of their employee. If this violation is noticed too late, the employee will not only be required to pay tax on the excess contribution amount the year was earned, the tax will effectively be doubled as the late corrective distribution is required to be reported again as income along with the earnings on such excess in the year the late correction is made.\nPlans which are set up under section 401(k) can also have employer contributions that cannot exceed other regulatory limits. Employer matching contributions can be made on behalf of designated Roth contributions, but the employer match must be made on a pre-tax basis.\nSome plans also have a profit-sharing provision where employers make additional contributions to the account and may or may not require matching contributions by the employee. These additional contributions may or may not require a matching employee contribution to earn them. As with the matching funds, these contributions are also made on a pre-tax basis.\nThere is also a maximum 401(k) contribution limit that applies to all employee and employer 401(k) contributions in a calendar year. This limit is the section 415 limit, which is the lesser of 100% of the employee's total pre-tax compensation or $56,000 for 2019, or $57,000 in 2020. For employees over 50, the catch-up contribution limit is also added to the section 415 limit.\nGovernmental employers in the United States (that is, federal, state, county, and city governments) are currently barred from offering 401(k) retirement plans unless the retirement plan was established before May 1986. Governmental organizations may set up a section 457(b) retirement plan instead. IRS Raises 2022 401(k) Contribution Limit to $20,500, a $1,000 boost from 2021 contribution limits.\nContribution deadline.\nFor a corporation, or LLC taxed as a corporation, contributions must be made by the end of a calendar year. For a sole proprietorship, partnership, or an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship, the deadline for depositing contributions is generally the personal tax filing deadline (April 15, or September 15 if an extension was filed).\nHighly compensated employees (HCE).\nTo help ensure that companies extend their 401(k) plans to low-paid employees, an IRS rule limits the maximum deferral by the company's highly compensated employees (HCEs) based on the average deferral by the company's non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). If the less compensated employees save more for retirement, then the HCEs are allowed to save more for retirement. This provision is enforced via \"non-discrimination testing\". Non-discrimination testing takes the deferral rates of HCEs and compares them to NHCEs. In 2008, an HCE was defined as an employee with compensation greater than $100,000 in 2007, or as an employee that owned more than 5% of the business at any time during the year or the preceding year. In addition to the $100,000 limit for determining HCEs, employers can elect to limit the top-paid group of employees to the top 20% of employees ranked by compensation. That is, for plans with the first day of the plan-year in the 2007 calendar year, HCEs are employees who earned more than $100,000 in gross compensation (also known as 'Medicare wages') in the prior year. For example, most testing done in 2009 was for the 2008 plan-year, which compared 2007 plan-year gross compensation to the $100,000 threshold in order to determine who was an HCE and who was an NHCE. The threshold was $130,000 for 2020, and is $160,000 for 2025.\nThe actual deferral percentage (ADP) of all HCEs as a group cannot exceed 2 percentage points greater than all NHCEs as a group. This is known as the ADP test. When a plan fails the ADP test, it essentially has two options to come into compliance. A return of excess can be given to the HCEs to lower the HCE ADP to a passing level, or it can process a \"qualified non-elective contribution\" (QNEC) to some or all of the NHCEs in order to raise the NHCE ADP to a passing level. A return of excess requires the plan to send a taxable distribution to the HCEs (or reclassify regular contributions as catch-up contributions subject to the annual catch-up limit for those HCEs over 50) by March 15 of the year following the failed test. A QNEC must be vested immediately.\nThe annual contribution percentage (ACP) test is similarly performed but also includes employer matching and employee after-tax contributions. ACPs do not use the simple 2% threshold, and include other provisions which can allow the plan to \"shift\" excess passing rates from the ADP over to the ACP. A failed ACP test is likewise addressed through return of excess, or a QNEC or qualified match (QMAC).\nThere are a number of \"safe harbor\" provisions that can allow a company to be exempted from the ADP test. This includes making a \"safe harbor\" employer contribution to employees' accounts. Safe harbor contributions can take the form of a match (generally totaling 4% of pay) or a non-elective profit sharing (totaling 3% of pay). Safe harbor 401(k) contributions must be 100% vested at all times with immediate eligibility for employees. There are other administrative requirements within the safe harbor, such as requiring the employer to notify all eligible employees of the opportunity to participate in the plan, and restricting the employer from suspending participants for any reason other than due to a hardship withdrawal.\nAutomatic enrollment.\nEmployers are allowed to automatically enroll their employees in 401(k) plans, requiring employees to actively opt out if they do not want to participate (traditionally, 401(k)s required employees to opt in). Companies offering such automatic 401(k)s must choose a default investment fund and saving rate. Employees who are enrolled automatically will become investors in the default fund at the default rate, although they may select different funds and rates if they choose, or even opt out completely.\nAutomatic 401(k)s are designed to encourage high participation rates among employees. Therefore, employers can attempt to enroll non-participants as often as once per year, requiring those non-participants to opt out each time if they do not want to participate. Employers can also choose to escalate participants' default contribution rate, encouraging them to save more.\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 made automatic enrollment a safer option for employers. Prior to the Pension Protection Act, employers were held responsible for investment losses as a result of such automatic enrollments. The Pension Protection Act established a safe harbor for employers in the form of a \"Qualified Default Investment Alternative\", an investment plan that, if chosen by the employer as the default plan for automatically enrolled participants, relieves the employer of financial liability. Under Department of Labor regulations, three main types of investments qualify as QDIAs: lifecycle funds, balanced funds, and managed accounts. QDIAs provide sponsors with fiduciary relief similar to the relief that applies when participants affirmatively elect their investments.\nFees.\n401(k) plans charge fees for administrative services, record-keeping services, investment management services, and sometimes outside consulting services. They can be charged to the employer, the plan participants or to the plan itself and the fees can be allocated on a per participant basis, per plan, or as a percentage of the plan's assets. For 2011, the average total administrative and management fees on a 401(k) plan was 0.78 percent or approximately $250 per participant. However small businesses can suffer especially higher plan fees. The United States Supreme Court ruled, in 2015, that plan administrators could be sued for excessive plan fees and expenses, in Tibble v. Edison International. In the Tibble case, the Supreme Court took strong issue with a large company placing plan investments in \"retail\" mutual fund shares as opposed to \"institutional\" class shares.\nTop-heavy provisions.\nThe IRS monitors defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s to determine if they are top-heavy, or weighted too heavily in providing benefits to key employees. If the plans are too top-heavy, the company must remedy this by allocating funds to the other employees' (known as non-key employees) benefit plans.\nPlans for certain small businesses or sole proprietorships.\nThe Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) made 401(k) plans more beneficial to the self-employed. The two key changes enacted related to the allowable \"Employer\" deductible contribution, and the \"Individual\" IRC-415 contribution limit.\nPrior to EGTRRA, the maximum tax-deductible contribution to a 401(k) plan was 15% of eligible pay (reduced by the amount of salary deferrals). Without EGTRRA, an incorporated business person taking $100,000 in salary would have been limited in Y2004 to a maximum contribution of $15,000. EGTRRA raised the deductible limit to 25% of eligible pay without reduction for salary deferrals. Therefore, that same businessperson in Y2008 can make an \"elective deferral\" of $15,500 plus a profit sharing contribution of $25,000 (i.e. 25%), and\u2014if this person is over age 50\u2014make a catch-up contribution of $5,000 for a total of $45,500. For those eligible to make \"catch-up\" contribution, and with salary of $122,000 or higher, the maximum possible total contribution in 2008 would be $51,000. To take advantage of these higher contributions, many vendors now offer Solo 401(k) plans or Individual(k) plans, which can be administered as a Self-Directed 401(k), permitting investment in real estate, mortgage notes, tax liens, private companies, and virtually any other investment.\nNote: an unincorporated business person is subject to slightly different calculation. The government mandates calculation of profit sharing contribution as 25% of \"net self-employment (Schedule C) income\". Thus on $100,000 of self-employment income, the contribution would be 20% of the gross self-employment income, 25% of the net after the contribution of $20,000.\nRollovers as business start-ups (ROBS).\nROBS is an arrangement in which prospective business owners use their 401(k) retirement funds to pay for new business start-up costs. ROBS is an acronym from the United States Internal Revenue Service for the IRS ROBS Rollovers as Business Start-Ups Compliance Project.\nROBS plans, while not considered an abusive tax avoidance transaction, are questionable because they may solely benefit one individual \u2013 the individual who rolls over his or her existing retirement 401(k) withdrawal funds to the ROBS plan in a tax-free transaction. The ROBS plan then uses the rollover assets to purchase the stock of the new business. A C corporation must be set up in order to roll the 401(k) withdrawal.\nOther countries.\nEven though the term \"401(k)\" is a reference to a specific provision of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code section 401, it has become so well known that it has been used elsewhere as a generic term to describe analogous legislation. For example, in October 2001, Japan adopted legislation allowing the creation of \"Japan-version 401(k)\" accounts even though no provision of the relevant Japanese codes is in fact called \"section 401(k)\".\nSimilar pension schemes exist in other nations as well. The term is not used in the UK, where analogous pension arrangements are known as personal pension schemes. In Australia, they are known as superannuation funds. In Canada RRSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) play a similar role although they don't have to be employer sponsored and have different contribution limits.\nSimilarly, India has a scheme called National Pension System (NPS), mandatory for all Central Government employees from January 2004, which is similar to 401(k) in terms of investment options, restriction on withdrawals and tax exemption on contribution, return earned and also withdrawals at retirement age(generally 60). It is also adopted by most state governments for their employees and also opened for the corporate sector. It's regulated by PFRDA Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Some old pension schemes like EPF for private or public sector employees and PPF for self-employed, practicing professionals, small business owners, exist but they offer a lower rate of return that is fixed by Government every quarter.The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is a statutory body of the Government of India under the Ministry of Labour and Employment. It administers a compulsory contributory Provident Fund Scheme, Pension Scheme, and an Insurance Scheme. The schemes cover both Indian and international workers (for countries with which bilateral agreements have been signed; 14 such social security agreements are active). It is one of the largest social security organisations in India in terms of the number of covered beneficiaries and the volume of financial transactions undertaken. The EPFO's apex decision-making body is the Central Board of Trustees.\nNepal and Sri Lanka have similar employees provident fund schemes. In Malaysia, The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) was established in 1951 upon the Employees Provident Fund Ordinance 1951. The EPF is intended to help employees from the private sector save a fraction of their salary in a lifetime banking scheme, to be used primarily as a retirement fund but also in the event that the employee is temporarily or no longer fit to work. As of March 31, 2014, the size of the EPF asset size stood at RM597 billion (US$184 billion), making it the fourth-largest pension fund in Asia and seventh-largest in the world.\nCriticisms and proposed reforms.\nRisk of loss.\nUnlike defined-benefit pensions (regulated by ERISA) or an FDIC-insured savings account at a bank, there is no government guarantee for assets held in 401(k) accounts.\nInvestments in stocks can lose value due to market fluctuations. Diversification can protect against poor performance in any one stock or industry, but not against a widespread decline like the Great Depression or Great Recession. Further diversification into bonds can protect against stock market declines, but generally have smaller earning potential and still carry the risk of bondholder default. Earners are generally advised to shift from higher-risk, higher-return assets to lower-risk assets as they near retirement age.\nMoney can also be lost if the plan sponsor has financial difficulties, though if a sponsor goes bankrupt, 401(k) account holders have high priority. Earners can take sponsor risk into account when deciding whether to leave assets in the plan sponsored by a former employer or roll over the assets to a new employer plan or to an individual retirement account (IRA).\nFees charged by 401(k) providers can substantially reduce earnings.\nChoosing investments.\n401(k) plans are restricted to investments chosen by employers. This can prevent earners from risky choices like picking individual stocks, but also from following a favored investment strategy or asset types (such as commodities), or choosing socially responsible investing. IRA providers typically offer a far wider selection of investments.\nConversely, 401(k) plans are sometimes criticized for putting the burden of choosing and updating investments on earners, most of whom are not experts in finance. Some earners avoid signing up for 401(k)s because of the perceived complexity. Target date funds mitigate this complexity by automatically shifting investments from stocks to bonds based on time to planned retirement date.\nInequality.\nThe tax breaks given for money invested in 401(k)s are only available to people who earn enough money to be able to save for retirement, and does nothing to help the lowest-income earners. Households in the highest earning group saved enough to receive about 11 times more in retirement income. This exacerbates existing income inequality, especially if these larger retirement savings are used for the benefit of children (for example to pay for a better education, or simply as inheritance).\nParticipation.\nOffering 401(k)s is not mandatory, so not all employers do so; this means some workers simply cannot benefit from the tax breaks. Benefits consultant Ted Benna, who first realized the favorable treatment this section of the tax code afforded defined-contribution plans, has proposed mandating that employers over a certain size offer 401(k)s.\nIn 2024, one group of researchers advocated ending the tax break for the 401(k) on the grounds that it did not increase aggregate retirement savings, and using the $200 billion in additional tax revenue to support the government-funded Social Security program.\nInsufficiency of retirement savings.\nThe amount of money available in retirement from defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s varies considerably depending on the amount contributed and performance of investments. Reliance on these plans instead of defined-benefit pensions and the small fraction of earnings replaced by government programs like Social Security means many people have an insufficient amount of money for retirement. According to US Census data, in 2017, 49% of Americans aged 55 to 66 had \"no personal retirement savings\". This gap can force people to choose between continuing to work into old age (if they are healthy enough to do so) and living in poverty.\nOne bipartisan proposal to address this problem is to open the defined-benefit Thrift Savings Plan to all employees (currently it is only for federal government employees).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the West, the early part of the century was shaped by Constantine the Great, who became the first Roman emperor to adopt Christianity. Gaining sole reign of the empire, he is also noted for re-establishing a single imperial capital, choosing the site of ancient Byzantium in 330 (over the current capitals, which had effectively been changed by Diocletian's reforms to Milan in the West, and Nicomedeia in the East) to build the city soon called Nova Roma (New Rome); it was later renamed Constantinople in his honor.\nThe last emperor to control both the eastern and western halves of the empire was Theodosius I. As the century progressed after his death, it became increasingly apparent that the empire had changed in many ways since the time of Augustus. The two-emperor system originally established by Diocletian in the previous century fell into regular practice, and the east continued to grow in importance as a centre of trade and imperial power, while Rome itself diminished greatly in importance due to its location far from potential trouble spots, like Central Europe and the East. Late in the century Christianity became the official state religion, and the empire's old pagan culture began to disappear. General prosperity was felt throughout this period, but recurring invasions by Germanic tribes plagued the empire from 376 CE onward. These early invasions marked the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire.\nIn China, the Jin dynasty, which had united the nation prior in 280, began rapidly facing trouble by the start of the century due to political infighting, which led to the insurrections of the northern barbarian tribes (starting the Sixteen Kingdoms period), which quickly overwhelmed the empire, forcing the Jin court to retreat and entrench itself in the south past the Yangtze river, starting what is known as the Eastern Jin dynasty around 317. Towards the end of the century, Emperor of the Former Qin, Fu Ji\u0101n, united the north under his banner, and planned to conquer the Jin dynasty in the south, so as to finally reunite the land, but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Fei River in 383, causing massive unrest and civil war in his empire, thereby leading to the fall of the Former Qin, and the continued existence of the Eastern Jin dynasty.\nAccording to archaeologists, sufficient archaeological evidence correlates of state-level societies coalesced in the 4th century to show the existence in Korea of the Three Kingdoms (300/400\u2013668 CE) of Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla.\nLong Fourth Century.\nHistorians of the Roman Empire refer to the \"Long Fourth Century\" to the period spanning the fourth century proper but starting earlier with the accession of the Emperor Diocletian in 284 and ending later with the death of Honorius in 423 or of Theodosius II in 450.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Khmer Empire of Cambodia flourished during this century, while the Fatimids of Egypt were overtaken by the Ayyubid dynasty.

There was, after a brief ascendancy, a sudden decline of Byzantine power and a rise of Norman domination over much of Europe, along with the prominent role in Europe of notably influential popes. Christendom experienced a formal schism in this century which had been developing over previous centuries between the Latin West and Byzantine East, causing a split in its two largest denominations to this day: Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.\nIn Song dynasty China and the classical Islamic world, this century marked the high point for both classical Chinese civilization, science and technology, and classical Islamic science, philosophy, technology and literature.\nRival political factions at the Song dynasty court created strife amongst the leading statesmen and ministers of the empire. In Korea, the Goryeo Kingdom flourished and faced external threats from the Liao dynasty (Manchuria).\nIn this century the Turkic Seljuk dynasty comes to power in Western Asia over the now fragmented Abbasid realm, while the first of the Crusades were waged towards the close of the century. The Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, the Ghaznavids, and the Chola dynasty in India had reached their zenith in military might and international influence. The Western Chalukya Empire (the Chola's rival) also rose to power by the end of the century. In Japan, the Fujiwara clan continued to dominate the affairs of state.\nIn the Americas, the Toltec and Mixtec civilizations flourished in Central America, along with the Huari Culture of South America and the Mississippian culture of North America. The Tiwanaku Empire centered around Lake Titicaca collapsed in the first half of the century.\nOverview.\nIn European history, the 11th century is regarded as the beginning of the High Middle Ages, an age subsequent to the Early Middle Ages. The century began while the \"translatio imperii\" of 962 was still somewhat novel and ended in the midst of the Investiture Controversy. It saw the final Christianisation of Scandinavia and the emergence of the Peace and Truce of God movements, the Gregorian Reforms, and the Crusades which revitalised a church and a papacy that had survived tarnished by the tumultuous 10th century. In 1054, the Great Schism saw the political and religious culmination and a formal split between the Western and Eastern church.\nIn Germany, the century was marked by the ascendancy of the Holy Roman Emperors, who hit their high-water mark under the Salians. In Britain, it saw the transformation of Scotland into a single, more unified and centralised kingdom and the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The social transformations wrought in these lands brought them into the fuller orbit of European feudal politics. In France, it saw the nadir of the monarchy and the zenith of the great magnates, especially the dukes of Aquitaine and Normandy, who could thus foster such distinctive contributions of their lands as the pious warrior who conquered Britain, Italy, and the East and the impious peacelover, the troubadour, who crafted out of the European vernacular its first great literary themes. There were also the first figures of the intellectual movement known as Scholasticism, which emphasized dialectic arguments in disputes of Christian theology as well as classical philosophy.\nIn Italy, the century began with the integration of the kingdom into the Holy Roman Empire and the royal palace at Pavia was summoned in 1024. By the end of the century, Lombard and Byzantine rule in the Mezzogiorno had been usurped by the Normans and the power of the territorial magnates was being replaced by that of the citizens of the northern cities. In Northern Italy, a growth of population in urban centers gave rise to an early organized capitalism and more sophisticated, commercialized culture by the late 11th century, most notably in Venice. In Spain, the century opened with the successes of the last caliphs of C\u00f3rdoba and ended in the successes of the Almoravids. In between was a period of Christian unification under Navarrese hegemony and success in the Reconquista against the taifa kingdoms that replaced the fallen caliphate. In Eastern Europe, there was a golden age for the principality of Kievan Rus.\nIn China, there was a triangular affair of continued war and peace settlements between the Song dynasty, the Tanguts-led Western Xia in the northwest, and the Khitans of the Liao dynasty in the northeast. Meanwhile, opposing political factions evolved at the Song imperial court of Kaifeng. The political reformers at court, called the New Policies Group (\u65b0\u6cd5, Xin Fa), were led by Emperor Shenzong of Song and the Chancellors Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi, while the political conservatives were led by Chancellor Sima Guang and Empress Dowager Gao, regent of the young Emperor Zhezong of Song. Heated political debate and sectarian intrigue followed, while political enemies were often dismissed from the capital to govern frontier regions in the deep south where malaria was known to be very fatal to northern Chinese people (see History of the Song dynasty). This period also represents a high point in classical Chinese science and technology, with figures such as Su Song and Shen Kuo, as well as the age where the matured form of the Chinese pagoda was accomplished in Chinese architecture.\nIn Japan, the Fujiwara clan dominated central politics by acting as imperial regents, controlling the actions of the Emperor of Japan, who acted merely as a 'puppet monarch' during the Heian period. In Korea, the rulers of the Goryeo Kingdom were able to concentrate more central authority into their own hands than in that of the nobles, and were able to fend off two Khitan invasions with their armies.\nIn the Middle East, the Fatimid Empire of Egypt reached its zenith only to face steep decline, much like the Byzantine Empire in the first half of the century. The Seljuks came to prominence while the Abbasid caliphs held traditional titles without real, tangible authority in state affairs.\nIn India, the Chola dynasty reached its height of naval power under leaders such as Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I, dominating southern India (Tamil Nadu), Sri Lanka, and regions of Southeast Asia. The Ghaznavid Empire would invade northwest India, an event that would pave the way to a series of later Muslim expansions into India.\nIn Southeast Asia, the Pagan Kingdom reached its height of political and military power. The Khmer Empire would dominate in Mainland Southeast Asia while Srivijaya would dominate Maritime Southeast Asia. Further east, the Kingdom of Butuan, centered on the northern portion of Mindanao island flourished as the dominant trading polity in the archipelago. In Vietnam, the L\u00fd dynasty began, which would reach its golden era during the 11th century.\nIn Nigeria, formation of city states, kingdoms and empires, including Hausa kingdoms and Borno dynasty in the north, and the Oyo Empire and Kingdom of Benin in the south.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

February 17), when the Julian calendar acknowledged a leap day and the Gregorian calendar did not, the Julian calendar fell one day farther behind, bringing the difference to 13 days until February 28 (O.S. February 15), 2100.\nSummary.\nPolitical and military.\nThe year 1900 was the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Two days into the new year, the U.S. Secretary of State John Hay announced the Open Door Policy regarding China, advocating for equal access for all nations to the Chinese market. The Galveston hurricane would become the deadliest natural disaster in United States history, killing between 6,000 and 12,000 people, mostly in and near Galveston, Texas, as well as leaving 10,000 people homeless, destroying 7,000 buildings of all kinds in Galveston. As of 2025, it remains the fourth deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record.\nAn ongoing Boxer Rebellion in China escalates with multiple attacks by the Boxers on Chinese and European civilians, killing hundreds; the rebellion would progress with the Russian Empire's invasion of Manchuria and the Battle of Peking (1900). During the Scramble for Africa, the Battle of Kouss\u00e9ri would see French forces secure their domination of Chad, which would become a French colony. Britain would annex the South African Republic and the Orange Free State in Southern Africa, becoming the Orange River Colony until 1910.\nFor Britain, developments such as the Battle of Platrand, Battle of Spion Kop and the Battle of Paardeberg in the Second Boer War highlighted the harsh nature of Boer guerrilla tactics. The British Labour Party was founded in 1900, emerging out of the Labour movement and socialist parties of the 19th century; it would go on to become a major political force in Britain after the First World War. The Federation of Australia is enacted, marking the unification of its colonies into a single country.\nScience.\nFour main scientific discoveries were achieved in the year 1900:\nCultural and artistic.\nGiacomo Puccini's opera \"Tosca\" premiers, one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide, a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias.Calendar year\nL. Frank Baum, an American author, publishes \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", a cornerstone of American children's literature, marking the first book of the Oz series.\nMiscellaneous.\nThe U.S. Senate accepts the British-German Treaty of 1899 on January 14. This formally ended U.S. claims to the Samoan Islands. The U.S.-UK Treaty for a Central American Canal would be signed on February 5. While the initial plan for a Nicaraguan canal did not materialize, this treaty laid the groundwork for the construction of the Panama Canal, a project of immense geopolitical and economic importance.\nThe year 1900 also marked the Year of the Rat on the Chinese calendar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Major events in 1974 include the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis and the resignation of United States President Richard Nixon following the Watergate scandal. In the Middle East, the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War determined politics; following Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir's resignation in response to high Israeli casualties, she was succeeded by Yitzhak Rabin. In Europe, the invasion and occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish troops initiated the Cyprus dispute, the Carnation Revolution took place in Portugal, the Greek junta's collapse paves the way for the establishment of a parliamentary republic and Chancellor of West Germany Willy Brandt resigned following an espionage scandal surrounding his secretary G\u00fcnter Guillaume. In sports, the year was primarily dominated by the FIFA World Cup in West Germany, in which the hosts won the championship title, as well as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\", a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Americas, an agreement was brokered to end the Cristero War, a Catholic counter-revolution in Mexico. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, a British high court, ruled that Canadian women are persons in the \"Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)\" case. The 1st Academy Awards for film were held in Los Angeles, while the Museum of Modern Art opened in New York City. The Peruvian Air Force was created.\nIn Asia, the Republic of China and the Soviet Union engaged in a minor conflict after the Chinese seized full control of the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway, which ended with a resumption of joint administration. In the Soviet Union, General Secretary Joseph Stalin expelled Leon Trotsky and adopted a policy of collectivization. The Grand Trunk Express began service in India. Rioting between Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem over access to the Western Wall took place in the Middle East. The centenary of Western Australia was celebrated. The Afghan Civil War, which started in November in the preceding year, continued until October.\nThe Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact, a treaty renouncing war as an instrument of national policy, went into effect. In Europe, the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy signed the Lateran Treaty. The Idionymon law was passed in Greece to outlaw political dissent. Spain hosted the Ibero-American Exposition which featured pavilions from Latin American countries. The German airship LZ 127 \"Graf Zeppelin\" flew around the world in 21 days.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSummary.\nMiddle East, Asia, and Pacific Isles.\nOn August 1 of this year the 1929 Palestine riots broke out between Arabs and Jews over control of the Western Wall. The rioting, initiated in part when British police tore down a screen the Jews had constructed in front of the Wall, continued until the end of the month. In total, 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed.\nEarly in 1929, the Afghan Civil War saw the Afghan leader King Amanullah lose power to the Saqqawists under Habibull\u0101h Kalak\u0101ni. Kalakani's rule, however, only lasted nine months. Nadir Shah replaced him in October, starting a line of monarchs which would last 40 years. In India, a general strike in Bombay continued throughout the year despite efforts by the British. On December 29, the All India Congress in Lahore declared Indian independence from Britain, something it had threatened to do if Britain did not grant India dominion status. China and Russia engaged in a minor conflict after China seized full control of the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway. Russia counterattacked and took the cities of Hailar and Manzhouli after issuing an ultimatum demanding joint control of the railway to be reinstated. The Chinese agreed to the terms on November 26. The Japanese would later see this defeat as a sign of Chinese weakness, leading to their taking control of Manchuria. The Far East began to experience economic problems late in the year as the effects of the Great Depression began to spread. Southeast Asia was especially hard hit as its exports (spice, rubber, and other commodities) were more sensitive to economic problems. In the Pacific, on December 28 \u2013 \"Black Saturday\" in Samoa \u2013 New Zealand colonial police killed 11 unarmed demonstrators, an event which led the Mau movement to demand independence for Samoa.\nEurope.\nWestern.\nIn 1929, the Fascist Party in Italy tightened its control. National education policy took a major step towards being completely taken over by the agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism, and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God.\nOn February 11, the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See signed the Lateran Treaty, making Vatican City a sovereign state. On July 25, Pope Pius XI emerged from the Vatican and entered St. Peter's Square in a huge procession witnessed by about 250,000 persons, thus ending nearly 60 years of papal self-imprisonment within the Vatican. Italy used the diplomatic prestige associated with this successful agreement to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy. Germany experienced a major turning point in this year due to the economic crash. The country had experienced prosperity under the government of the Weimar Republic until foreign investors withdrew their German interests. This began the crumbling of the Republican government in favor of Nazism. In 1929, the number of unemployed reached three million. On July 27, the Geneva Convention, held in Switzerland, addressed the treatment of prisoners of war in response to problems encountered during World War I.\nOn May 31, the British general election returned a hung parliament yet again, with the Liberals in position to determine who would have power. These elections were known as the \"Flapper\" elections due to the fact that it was the first British election in which women under 30 could vote. A week after the vote, on June 7 the Conservatives conceded power rather than ally with the Liberals. Ramsay MacDonald founded a new Labour government the next day.\n1929 is regarded as a turning point by French historians, who point out that it was last year in which prosperity was felt before the effects of the Great Depression. The Third Republic had been in power since before World War I. On July 24, French prime minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 resigned for medical reasons; he was succeeded by Aristide Briand. Briand adopted a foreign policy of both peace and defensive fortification. The Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact, renouncing war as an instrument of foreign policy, went into effect in this year (it was first signed in Paris in 1928 by most leading world powers). The French began work on the Maginot Line in this year, as a defense against a possible German attack, and on September 5 Briand presented a plan for the \"United States of Europe\". On October 22, Briand was replaced as prime minister by Andr\u00e9 Tardieu. Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in Spain experienced growing dissatisfaction among students and academics, as well as businessmen who blamed the government for recent economic woes. Many called for a fascist regime, like that in Italy.\nEastern.\nIn May, Joseph Stalin consolidated his power in the Soviet Union by sending Leon Trotsky into exile. The only country that would grant Trotsky asylum was Turkey, in return for his help during Turkey's civil war. He and his family left the USSR aboard ship on February 12. Stalin turned on his former political ally, Nikolai Bukharin, who was the last real threat to his power. By the end of the year Bukharin had been defeated. Once Stalin was in power, he turned his former support for Lenin's New Economic Policy into opposition. In November, Stalin declared that it \"The Year of the Great Breakthrough\" and stated that the country would focus on industrial programs as well as on collectivizing the grain supply. He hoped to surpass the West not only in agriculture, but in industry. Millions of Soviet farmers were removed from their private farms, their property was collected, and they were moved to state-owned farms. Stalin emphasized in 1929 a campaign demonizing kulaks as a plague on society. Kulak property was taken and they were deported by cattle train to areas of frozen tundra.\nThe timber market in Finland began to decline in 1929 due to the Great Depression, as well as the Soviet Union's entrance into the market. Financial and political problems culminated in the birth of the fascist Lapua Movement on November 23 in a demonstration in Lapua. The movement's stated aim was Finnish democracy and anti-communism. The Finnish legislature received heavy pressure to remove basic rights from Communist groups. Politics in Lithuania was heated, as President Voldemaras was unpopular in some quarters, and survived an assassination attempt in Kaunas. Later, while attending a meeting of the League of Nations, he was ousted in a coup by President Smetona, who made himself dictator. Upon Voldemaras' removal from office, Gele\u017einis Vilkas went underground and received aid and encouragement in its activities from Germany. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was renamed the \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\" as King Alexander sought to unite the South Slavs under his rule. The state's new Monarchy replaced the old parliament, which had been dominated by Serbs.\nNorth America.\nIn October 1929, the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada that women could not be members of the legislature. This case, which came to be known as the Persons Case, had important ramifications not just for the rights of women but because in overturning the case, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council engendered a radical change in the Canadian judicial approach to the Canadian constitution, an approach that has come to be known as the \"living tree doctrine\". The five women who initiated the case are known in Canada as the Famous Five. In November, the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake occurred off the south coast of Newfoundland in the Atlantic Ocean. It registered as a Richter magnitude 7.2 submarine earthquake centered on Grand Banks, broke 12 submarine transatlantic telegraph cables and triggered a tsunami that destroyed many south coast communities in the Burin Peninsula area, killing 28 (as of 1997, Canada's most lethal earthquake). Ross-Loos Medical Group is established in downtown Los Angeles by two physicians, Donald E. Ross and H. Clifford Loos - the first HMO in the United States.\nThe Mexican Cristero War continued in 1929 as clerical forces attempted an assassination of the provisional president in a train bombing in February. The attempt failed. Plutarco Calles, at the center of power for the anti-clerics, continued to gather power in Mexico City. His government was considered an enemy to more conservative Mexicans who held to traditional forms of government and more religious control. Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party early in the year to increase his power; a party which was, ironically, seen by foreigners as fascist and which was in opposition to the Mexican Right. A special election was held in this year, which Jose Vasconselos lost to Ortiz Rubio. By this time, the war had ended. The last group of rebels was defeated on June 4, and in the same month US Ambassador Dwight Morrow initiated talks between parties. On June 21 an agreement was brokered ending the Cristero War. On June 27, church bells rang and mass was held publicly for the first time in three years. The agreement heavily favored the government, as priests were required to register with the government and religion was banned from schools.\nThe major event of the year for the United States was the stock market crash on Wall Street, which was to have international effects and be widely regarded as the inciting incident of the Great Depression. On September 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) peaked at 381.17, a height it would not reach again until November 1954. Then, from October 24\u2013October 29, stock prices suffered three multi-digit percentage drops, wiping out more than $30\u00a0billion from the New York Stock Exchange (10 times greater than the annual budget of the federal government). On December 3 U.S. President Herbert Hoover announced to the U.S. Congress that the worst effects of the recent stock market crash were behind the nation, and that the American people had regained faith in the economy.\nLiterature, arts, and entertainment.\nLiterature of the time reflected the memories many harbored of the horrors of World War I. A major seller was \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" by Erich Maria Remarque. Remarque was a German who had fought in the war at age eighteen and been wounded in the Third Battle of Ypres. He stated that he intended the book to tell the story \"of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.\" Another 1929 book reflecting on World War I was Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\", as well as \"Good-Bye to All That\" by Robert Graves. In lighter media, a few stars of the comic industry made their debut, including \"Tintin\", a comic book character created by Herg\u00e9, who would appear in over 200 million comic books in 60 languages. \"Popeye\", another comic strip character created by Elzie Crisler Segar, also appeared in this year.\nWithin the film industry, on May 16 the 1st Academy Awards were presented at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, with \"Wings\" winning Best Picture. Also, \"Hallelujah!\" became the first Hollywood film to contain an entirely black cast, and \"Atlantic\", a film about the \"Titanic\", is an early sound-on-film movie. The arts were in the midst of the Modernist movement, as Pablo Picasso painted two cubist works, \"Woman in a Garden\" and \"Nude in an Armchair\", during this year. The surrealist painters Salvador Dal\u00ed and Ren\u00e9 Magritte completed several works, including \"The First Days of Spring\" and \"The Treachery of Images\". On November 7 in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art opened to the public. The latest in modern architecture was also represented by the Barcelona Pavilion in Spain, and the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, at its completion the tallest building in the British Empire.\nScience and technology.\nThe year saw several advances in technology and exploration. On June 27 the first public demonstration of color TV was held by H. E. Ives and his colleagues at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. The first images were a bouquet of roses and an American flag. A mechanical system was used to transmit 50-line color television images between New York and Washington. The BBC broadcast a television transmission for the first time. By November, Vladimir Zworykin had taken out the first patent for color television. On November 29, Bernt Balchen, U.S. Admiral Richard Byrd, Captain Ashley McKinley, and Harold June, became the first to fly over the South Pole. Within the year, Britain, Australia and New Zealand began a joint Antarctic Research Expedition, and the German airship \"Graf Zeppelin\" began a round-the-world flight (ended August 29). This year Ernst Schwarz describes Bonobo (\"Pan paniscus\") as a different species from common chimpanzee (\"Pan troglodytes\"), both closely related phylogenetically to human beings.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The match was contested by England and West Germany, with England winning 4\u20132 after extra time to claim the Jules Rimet Trophy. It was the first \u2013 and to date only \u2013 occasion that England has hosted or won the World Cup.\nWest Germany took the lead in the 11th minute when Helmut Haller shot the ball into the bottom left corner when an English defender failed to clear the ball, before Geoff Hurst equalized with a header to make it 1\u20131, assisting a teammate who took a free kick. The score remained level by halftime until England took the lead with a 78th minute goal from Martin Peters (who was the only player to be booked during the match). England almost won by full time before West German player, Wolfgang Weber, scored a 2\u20132 equaliser in the 90th minute. The game went into extra time, in which Geoff Hurst scored a controversial goal in the 101st minute to make the score 3\u20132 after the first 15 minutes of extra time, until Hurst scored again in the final minute to complete his hat-trick, ending the game 4\u20132 after the extra 30 minutes. He was the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final until Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 did so in 2022.\nThe match is remembered for England's only World Cup and first and only major international title, Hurst's hat-trick \u2013 the first scored in a FIFA World Cup final \u2013 and the dubious third goal awarded to England by referee Gottfried Dienst and linesman Tofiq Bahramov. The England team became known as the \"wingless wonders\", on account of their then-unconventional narrow attacking formation, described at the time as a 4\u20134\u20132.\nIn addition to an attendance of 96,924 at the stadium, the British television audience peaked at 32.3\u00a0million viewers, making it the United Kingdom's most-watched television event ever.\nRoad to the final.\nBoth teams were strong throughout the tournament. Each won two and drew one of their three matches in the group stages. England did not concede a goal until their semi-final against Portugal.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nNormal time.\nEngland, managed by Alf Ramsey and captained by Bobby Moore, won the toss and elected to kick off. After 12 minutes, Sigfried Held sent a cross into the English penalty area which Ray Wilson misheaded to Helmut Haller, who got his shot on target. Jack Charlton and goalkeeper Gordon Banks failed to deal with the shot which went in, making it 1\u20130 to West Germany.\nIn the 18th minute, Wolfgang Overath conceded a free kick, which Moore took immediately, floating a cross into the West German area, where Geoff Hurst rose unchallenged; his downward glancing header went into the net and levelled the scores at 1-1. The teams were level at half-time, and after 77\u00a0minutes England won a corner. Alan Ball delivered the ball to Geoff Hurst whose deflected shot from the edge of the area found Martin Peters. He produced the final shot, beating the West German keeper from eight yards to make the score 2\u20131 to England.\nGermany pressed for an equaliser in the closing moments, and in the 89th minute Jack Charlton conceded a free kick for climbing on Uwe Seeler as they both went up for a header. The kick was taken by Lothar Emmerich, who struck it into George Cohen in the wall; the rebound fell to Held, who shot across the face of goal and into the body of Karl-Heinz Schnellinger. The ball deflected across the England six-yard box, wrong-footing the England defence and allowing Wolfgang Weber to level the score at 2\u20132 and force the match into extra time. Banks protested that the ball had struck Schnellinger on the arm, and reiterated the claim in his 2002 autobiography, but replays showed that it actually struck Schnellinger on the back.\nExtra time.\nEngland pressed forward and created several chances. In particular, with five minutes gone, Bobby Charlton struck the post and sent another shot just wide. With 11 minutes of extra time gone, Alan Ball put in a cross and Geoff Hurst swivelled and shot from close range. The ball hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced down and was cleared. The referee Gottfried Dienst was uncertain if it had been a goal and consulted his linesman, Tofiq Bahramov from Azerbaijan in the USSR, who indicated that it was, and the Swiss referee awarded the goal to the home team. The crowd and the audience of 400\u00a0million television viewers were left arguing whether the goal should have been given or not. The crossbar is now on display in the Wembley Stadium. England's third goal has remained controversial ever since the match. According to the Laws of the Game the definition of a goal is when \"the whole of the ball passes over the goal line\". English supporters cited the good position of the linesman and the statement of Roger Hunt, the nearest England player to the ball, who claimed it was a goal and that was why he wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in. Modern studies using film analysis and computer simulation have shown that the whole ball never crossed the line \u2013 only 50% did. Both Duncan Gillies of the Visual Information Processing Group at Imperial College London and Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman of the Department of Engineering Science at University of Oxford have stated that the ball would have needed to travel a further to fully cross the line. Some Germans cited possible bias of the Soviet linesman, especially as the USSR had just been defeated in the semi-finals by West Germany.\nOne minute before the end of play, the West Germans sent their defenders forward in a desperate attempt to score a last-minute equaliser. Winning the ball, Bobby Moore picked out the unmarked Geoff Hurst with a long pass, which Hurst carried forward while some spectators began streaming onto the field and Hurst, as he later revealed, decided that, if he was not going to score, he needed to boot the ball as far as possible, to prevent Germany getting back up. The ball instead went straight to the top corner of Hans Tilkowski's net, sealing a historic hat-trick and winning the World Cup for England. The goal gave rise to one of the most famous calls in English football history, when BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme described the situation as follows:\nOne of the balls from the final is on display in the National Football Museum in Manchester.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Final\" /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nAftermath.\nChampions photograph and statue.\nOne of the enduring images of the celebrations in Wembley immediately after the game was the picture of the captain Bobby Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. In recognition of Moore and other West Ham United players' contribution to the win, the club and Newham Borough Council jointly commissioned a statue of this scene. On 28 April 2003, the then Prince Andrew, as president of The Football Association, duly unveiled the \"World Cup Sculpture\" (also called \"The Champions\") in a prominent place near West Ham's ground, at the time, the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. The -high bronze piece was sculpted by Philip Jackson and weighed 4 tonnes.\nCultural impact.\nBroadcasting and viewership.\nThe final is the most watched event ever on British television, as of July 2021, attracting 32.30\u00a0million viewers.\nInfluence.\nIn Germany, a goal resulting from a shot bouncing off the crossbar and hitting the line is called a \"Wembley-Tor\" (Wembley Goal) due to the controversial nature of Hurst's second goal. This goal has been parodied many times. Some of the most notable include:\nIn August 1966 a special 4d stamp marked was issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate the victory. It soared in value to up to 15 shillings each on the back of public enthusiasm for the victory before falling back in value when the public realised it was not rare.\nThe World Cup win features in the song \"Three Lions\" (known by its chorus \"Football's Coming Home\"), the unofficial anthem of the England football team. England's win in the final also helped fans to create the \"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" chant.\nBelated presentations.\nHaller collected the match ball after the final whistle, conforming to a German tradition that the losing team keeps the ball. In the build-up to Euro 96 in England, English tabloid newspapers suggested that a British tradition ought to apply, of giving the match ball to the scorer of a hat trick. A consortium of \"Daily Mirror\", Virgin Group, and Eurostar paid Haller \u00a380,000 for the ball and arranged a photo shoot at which he symbolically presented it to Hurst. The ball was then displayed in Waterloo Eurostar terminal, where Hurst and Haller's signatures faded in the sunlight. It was subsequently lent to the National Football Museum in Manchester.\nFrom 1930 to 1974, only those who played in the Final received World Cup winners' medals. In the 2000s FIFA retrospectively awarded medals to the other players and staff of each winning squad. Medals were presented at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street in London on 10 June 2009 to the relevant members of England's 1966 squad, or representatives in the case of those, such as manager Ramsey, who had died.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34678", "revid": "50681662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34678", "title": "500 (card game)", "text": "Trick-taking card game\n500 or Five Hundred is a trick-taking game developed in the United States from Euchre. Euchre was extended to a 10 card game with bidding and a Mis\u00e8re contract similar to Russian Preference, producing a cutthroat three-player game like Preference and a four-player game played in partnerships like Whist which is the most popular modern form, although with special packs it can be played by up to six players.\nIt arose in America before 1900 and was promoted by the US Playing Card Company, who copyrighted and marketed a deck with a set of rules in 1904. The US Playing Card Company released the improved Avondale scoring table to remove bidding irregularities in 1906. 500 is a social card game and was highly popular in the United States until around 1920 when first auction bridge and then contract bridge drove it from favour. It continues to be popular in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where it has been taught through six generations community-wide, and in other countries: Australia, New Zealand, Canada (especially Ontario and Quebec) and Shetland. Despite its American origin, 500 is the national card game of Australia.\nSetup.\nOf the many variants to 500, the standard deck contains 43 playing cards: a joker is included (sometimes two, in which case the black joker beats the red one), and the 2s, 3s, and two 4s are removed. Either the two black 4s are removed, or the 4 of spades and 4 of diamonds are removed, in which case the 4 that matches the trump colour is also considered trump, so that there are always 13 trump cards (14 when using two jokers). Cards are dealt to each of the four players and three (four with two jokers) are dealt face down on the table to form the \"kitty\" (also known as the \"widow\", the \"blind\" or the \" hole card\"). Alternatively, a 45-card deck can be used (46 with two jokers), in which case the 4s are not removed. Each player still receives a hand of 10 cards, but the kitty is increased to five cards (six with two jokers).\nPlayers play in pairs, usually opposite each other. Traditionally, a bundle of three cards is dealt to each player, one to the kitty, a bundle of four to each player, one to the kitty, a bundle of three to each player, one to the kitty or with a 45-card deck: the deal is performed by dealing three cards to each player, then placing three cards in the kitty, four cards each and two to the kitty, and then three. In some versions, if a player does not receive a face card this is considered a misdeal and a redeal may be required.\nAs in euchre, in non-trump suits, the order of cards from highest to lowest is \n ace, king, queen, (jack), 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, (4). \nIn the trump suit, the order is (from the highest):\n joker, the jack of trumps, the jack of the same color, ace, king, queen, 10, 9..., 5, (4). \nFor instance if diamonds are trumps then the order in diamonds is following (from the highest):\n joker, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;dJ, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hJ, A, K, Q, 10, 9..., 4. \nThe jack of the trump suit is called \"right bower\". The jack of the suit of the same colour as the trump suit is called \"left bower\"' and is considered part of the trump suit. The joker is sometimes known as \"best bower\" in reference to the trump jacks.\nBower is an Anglicization of the German \"Bauer\", a word meaning farmer, peasant, or pawn. This name is often used to refer to the Jack of German games.\nBidding.\nAfter the deal, players call in turn, electing either to bid or to pass. A bid indicates the combined number of tricks the bidder believes they and their partner will take and the suit that will be trump for that hand, or that there will be no trump suit. For instance, a bid of \"seven spades\" (7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660) indicates that the player intends to win seven or more tricks with spades being the trump suit, whereas a bid of \"seven no-trump\" (7NT) indicates that the player intends to win seven or more tricks with no trump suit (in which case the only trump card is the joker).\nAuction commences at the level of 6. A player may elect not to bid, or to \"pass\". Bidding proceeds clockwise around the table, with each player passing or making a higher-scoring bid. A player who passes cannot subsequently make a bid in that hand.\nA player who has bid may only bid again in that hand if there has been an intervening bid by another player. However, in some variations a player who has bid and not passed may always bid again in that hand.\nThe order of seniority of suits in bidding (from lowest to highest, as reflected in the scores below) is as follows:\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665, no trump. \nTherefore, for example, a player who bids 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663 may be outbid by a subsequent bidding player on 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666 or 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665, but not seven spades. A \"no-trump\" bid beats any suited bid of the same number. Eventually, all but one player passes and the bid is decided.\nIn American play, there is only one round of bidding, with each player getting one chance, in turn, to either bid or pass. Moreover, in American play, a bid of six is called an \"inkle\". A player who bids \"inkle spades\" is typically indicating to their partner that they have some spades but not enough to bid seven. In most versions, one cannot win auction with an inkle. If auction doesn't reach the level of 7, cards are reshuffled. Only the first two players may inkle.\nIf nobody makes a bid, there are multiple variations. Most commonly, the hand is declared dead and a reshuffle and redeal is made. This can be repeated only twice, after which the deal passes to the next player. Alternatively, the game is played where no bids mean the round is played as no-trump, and scoring is ten points per trick. Other variations include that the deal passes to the next player (no reshuffle); or that if no one else makes a bid, the dealer is required to make a bid.\nThe player making the successful bid then collects the kitty. This player sorts through their hand and discards the least-useful three (or five in the case of a 45-card deck) cards (possibly including cards picked up from the kitty), and places them face down; the discarded cards playing no further part in the hand.\nMis\u00e8re and open mis\u00e8re.\nMis\u00e8re and open mis\u00e8re are two special contracts in 500. A \"Mis\u00e8re\" (also called \"Nullo\" (sometimes pronounced \"Nello\") or similarly) bid means the bidding player is trying to not win any tricks. If playing with a partner, the partner folds their cards and does not participate in the round. Mis\u00e8re is the French word meaning \"extreme poverty\". Mis\u00e8re is worth 250 pts. and is usually placed between 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660 and 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663 in bidding. It can be bid when auction reaches the level 7.\n\"Open Mis\u00e8re\" is the same as mis\u00e8re except the player playing this bid must reveal all of their cards to their opponents after the first trick. Also called \"Lay Down Mis\u00e8re\". It is usually worth 500 and placed between 10&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666 and 10&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665. May be bid at any time even as the first bid.\nValue and precedence of open mis\u00e8re can vary. It can, for instance, also be worth 330 and placed between 8NT and 9&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660.\nPlay.\nThe game focuses on tricks. The lead starts with the player who won the bidding. Players must follow suit if they can (this includes the left bower or any other card that is considered a trump, if trump is led). If a player no longer has any cards of the suit that is led, they may play any card in their hand. After all four players have played a card, the highest trump takes the trick. If no trump is played, the highest card of the led suit wins the trick. The winner of the trick leads on the next trick. Once all ten tricks have been played, the hand is scored. The player to the left of the previous dealer deals for the next hand, so that the deal moves clockwise around the table.\nJoker.\nThe joker is always the highest card. If there are trumps, the joker is the highest trump. In no trumps (including mis\u00e8re) the joker can be played only when the player cannot follow suit. When leading the joker, a player can \"nominate\" it into a suit. Other players need to follow the nominated suit. The joker can be led at any time and nominated to any suit even if the player holds cards in the suit.\nVariations.\nThere are variations of the rules concerning the size of deck, use of the joker, bidding after pass etc.\nBidding after pass.\nSome play that it is allowed to bid after pass if someone hereafter changes the suit of their bid.\nRaising own bid by the winner.\nSome play that the winner of the auction can raise their bid. If they change their suit (or no trumps) other players are allowed to bid again. If they only raise their bid without changing the suit, other players cannot bid again. Moreover, it is a common convention that, if only one player partakes in the auction (other players pass), they cannot raise their bid.\nJoker in no trump.\nThe use of the joker in no trumps (including mis\u00e8re) may vary. In some versions a player may lead a trick with the joker by naming the suit to be followed, but may not name a suit to which the player has previously claimed to be void. In some variations, a player may not \"renege\" with the joker \u2013 that is, use it as a card of a suit in which the player has already claimed to be void (unless the joker is the only card in the player's hand). In some variations, the joker may only be played as the first or last card in a suit.\nWalker Ultimate 500.\nA variation in which the winning team/player must win exactly 500 points. The game is played as normal, with the additional rule that 1000 points (like negative 500 points) loses the game. \"Peggings\" (or \"Scab Points\") must be played. This variation usually (not always) results in a longer game and generates more complex bidding and play.\nMis\u00e8re.\nLocal variants may exclude either \"open mis\u00e8re\", \"mis\u00e8re\" or both.\nFrench Canadian variation.\nA variation for four players using two Jokers (\"bonhommes\") and a standard 52-card pack stripped of 2s and 3s. The white Joker (\"la blanche\") is considered stronger. The players are dealt 10 cards each in batches of 3\u20133\u20134. When 3 are passed, another 3 go to the kitty (\"chatte\", middle of the table). There should be 6 cards in the middle after the deal. Some variations allow for the final card placed in the kitty to be turned upright for all players to see.\nThe attacking player takes the kitty and discards six cards of their choice, and no other player may see them. The bidding goes accordingly with the other variation, and Mis\u00e8re (\"Nulot\") may be allowed. The \"petite\" mis\u00e8re is equal to 500 points and can only be outbid by 8NT while \"la grosse\" or open mis\u00e8re is worth 1000 points and can only be outbid by 10NT (the latter is distinguished in that all cards are placed face-up on the table).\nThe game is played to a total of 1000 points. If a team fails to fulfil its contract, the points are added to the other team's total. Points are never subtracted.\nSet rule.\nThe game may be played with a standard variation known as \"setting\". An opponent is \"set\" when they fail to fulfill a contract by a predetermined number of bids. The point system and scoring remain as per standard, but an opponent who is awarded the kitty and is subsequently set is not allowed to bid in the next round. Note that it is only the player awarded the kitty (not all players on the team) that is not allowed to bid in the next round. In the case of a set occurring during double mis\u00e8re the player who touches the kitty first is not allowed to bid in the next round.\nTypically, the set occurs at one trick more than is actually necessary to break the bidding team's contract. In other words, 5 tricks in a 7-trick bid, 4 tricks in an 8-trick bid, 3 tricks in a 9-trick bid, 2 tricks in a 10-trick bid. However, for mis\u00e8re, open mis\u00e8re, and double mis\u00e8re a set always occurs at 3 tricks.\nBreach rule (related to the set rule).\nBreach indicates that a non-bidding team intends to breach the contract of a bidding team by at least one more trick than is actually necessary to break the contract. As opposed to the Setting rule, Breach must be called on a per hand basis, and does result in additional scoring. Typically, Breach is not played in a game when the setting rule is being used.\nA single player from a non-bidding partnership may call to breach another team's contract after a successful bid for a seven-trick (or more) contract has been made. The breach call may be made before or after the contracting team picks up the kitty, but must be made before game play starts. Typically, a breach occurs at one trick more than is actually necessary to break the bidding team's contract. In other words, 5 tricks in a 7-trick bid, 4 tricks in an 8-trick bid, 3 tricks in a 9-trick bid, 2 tricks in a 10-trick bid. However, for mis\u00e8re, open mis\u00e8re, and double mis\u00e8re a breach always occurs at 3 tricks.\nA breach call can result in three different scenarios:\nBecause breach is not considered an actual bid, a team may not win or lose (\u201cgo out the back door\u201d) based on points gained or lost from a breach call.\nA player who calls breach but does not fulfill the conditions of breach (win/lose or lose/lose scenario) is not allowed to bid in the next round. A player who bids a seven-trick contract but is successfully breached by an opponent (lose/win scenario) is not allowed to bid in the next round.\nPoint spread rule.\nA variation on the score keeping, the point-spread rule ends the game when one team has a negative score and the other team has a positive score, which results in a point spread of 500 or more points.\nVersions for 2\u20136 players.\nVariations exist, with appropriate additions or deductions to the deck for playing three, five or six-handed 500. Three-handed uses no teams, five-handed teams rotate and each player takes a turn without a partner, six-handed can be played as either three teams of two or two teams of three. Six-handed 500 requires a special deck with 63 cards.\nTwo-handed 500.\nTwo-handed 500 is played with a deck of 43 cards as per the standard game. Whereas in the standard game which includes partners, in the Two-handed game each player plays both the hand that is dealt to them and their partner's which is dealt to the table. The deal is the same as the standard game, except that the partners hands are dealt to the table so that they have 5 cards face down, each covered by a face up card (to give a total of 10 cards). Bidding is the same as the standard game except \"Mis\u00e8re\" is generally not allowed. The kitty is used with the player's hand only and no cards can be swapped between the hands. Order of play is as per the standard game. After each trick any exposed face down cards from the partner's hands are turned up and revealed. Play then continues with the lead from the hand that won the last trick.\nAlternatively, the game can be played as per three-handed but with a \"dead hand\".\nAn alternative version is played with the standard 52 card deck. Each player is dealt ten cards and then 8 more cards are exposed on the table. Each player chooses one of these cards to be added to the kitty. No dummies are used and the bidding is standard. After the bid is won the defending player adds one of the remaining exposed cards to their hand and discards an unwanted card. The remaining exposed cards are added to the dead card pile.\nOne additional variant is to use a standard game deck of 45 (or 43) cards and have players alternate in drawing cards from the central deck. The kitty is set aside in advance, and in turn, players draw a card, choose to keep or discard it, and then either discard or keep the next card, taking the opposite action as with the previous card.\nThree-handed 500.\nThree-handed 500 is played with a deck of 33 cards (a joker plus a \"Piquet pack\", i.e. 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s removed from the standard 52 cards). Dealing, scoring and game play are as for the standard game. The common variant is in bidding, where \"mis\u00e8re\" may be bid before a bid for seven tricks. This variant is permitted due to the relative rarity of seven-trick bids outside of team play. \"Open mis\u00e8re\" may be bid in a similar fashion. Alternatively, the game may be played with the standard deck (45 or 43 cards) with one hand dealt face down, which remains untouched during the game (a so-called \"dead hand\"). The common strategy is that the two players who are unsuccessful in bidding form a temporary alliance in an attempt to force the other player to lose their bid.\nFive-handed 500.\nAnother variation allows five players to play. All of the cards in a deck are used (although only one joker) so that each player can be dealt ten cards. The bidding starts to the dealer's left, and works by the same system as normal 500. The player who wins the bidding may then choose to \"go it alone\" (go on his/her own \u2013 without a partner for this hand) or gets to choose a card (in some versions the joker cannot be chosen) to select a partner. One of the bowers is usually chosen, or another high card; however, some variants prevent any trump card from being called. There are two versions of this variation. In one, the player who owns the chosen card announces that they have it, and then becomes the bidder's partner for that round. In the other, even the player winning the bidding will not know who the partner is until the chosen card is played (although the card chosen \"could\" be a card the bidder themselves has, that is they effectively selected no partner). Note that the partnership will usually change for each round. The remaining three players then play against the partnership. The player who won the bid gets to play the first card.\nScoring for this variation uses the same values as normal 500. If the partnership wins the required number of tricks, they will both get points (full points each or half points each, depending on the variation), and if they don't, they will both lose points (either full or half). If one of the three remaining players wins a trick, that player will receive ten points. Neither mis\u00e8re nor open mis\u00e8re is usually permitted in this variant since it is too easy to win. Because the partnership changes each round, there are no fixed teams and each player plays for themselves. This adds dynamic, and new strategies will arise.\nSix-handed 500.\nSpecial decks of cards were created by the United States Playing Card Company for playing six-handed 500, using a total of 63 cards. Besides using all 52 cards of the standard poker deck, plus one joker, these sets include 11s, 12s, and red 13s (a variation of their 61-card packs, with no red 13-spot cards, patented in 1881, that had been sold with rules for a forerunner of 500, and updated in 1897 to include red 13s). Each player receives 10 cards, and the kitty receives 3. Players seated in alternating positions around the table form two teams of three players each (or three teams of two, in \"Cut Throat Six-Handed\" 500). These decks are also made by Queen\u2019s Slipper, Piatnik, and Cartamundi. A variation is to use \"two\" jokers, the black-and-white one ranking highest.\nScore keeping.\nThe goal is for the team who wins the bid to take at least as many tricks as they bid. If the high bid is 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665, then the team wins the hand if they take 8, 9, or all 10 tricks and are awarded points according to the table below. There are no bonuses for overtricks (tricks over the number bid) in the original rules. If they do not make their bid, the same number of points is \"subtracted\" from their score. Whether or not the bid winning team achieves its bid, the opposing team receives 10 points for each trick they take. A team wins the game by scoring at least 500 points; if two teams score 500 or more in the same hand, one by winning their contracted bid and the opponent by winning some tricks, only the team winning the bid wins the game (\"goes out the front door\"), although some Australian versions (see below) hold that winning the game at any time requires winning a bid. The original (copyrighted 1904) rules, by the U.S. Playing Card Co., state \"If any player scores out during play of a hand, balance of hand is not played, unless the bidder can win out\" meaning that the \"first player\" to make 500 wins, unless the bidder (also called the \"maker\" or \"declarer\") makes 500 later in the same hand. A team whose score dips to \u2212500 points or below (referred to as \"set back 500 points\") loses the game. This is also known as going \"out the back door\" or \"out backwards\".\n\"Perfect\" variant.\nScoring for each family of tricks is reduced by 20 points (see table below), causing 10NT (the highest bid) to be worth exactly 500 points.\nOther scoring variations.\nThese are options that may be agreed upon amongst players at the outset, or regional variations of the usually-assumed rules.\nBidding conventions.\nSimilarly to bridge there are possible bidding conventions in 500. It is considered standard to bid 6NT whenever one holds the joker.John McLeod states it is allowed in Saint Paul, Minnesota to bid \"no trumps\" (for instance 6 no trumps) if one holds strong cards and \"no\" (for instance 6 no) when one holds the joker or two jacks of opposite colors (red and black). Two jacks of opposite colors ensure that the partnership will hold one of the three highest trumps regardless of suit chosen.\nIt is standard to open 6 in a suit with good suit and 7 or 8 with better hand. Some propose that opening 6 should indicate an ace or king in the suit and that rebid should indicate good suit for play. Openings 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660/&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663/&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666/&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 can be bluffs in order to bid mis\u00e8re when auction reaches the level 7.\nBryce Francis, who authored a book on 500, proposed a very advanced bidding system for more elaborate version of 500 with bidding after pass and raising the bid by the winner allowed. In his system opening 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660 shows the ace of spades. 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663 shows the ace of clubs and lack of the ace of spades etc. 6NT shows the joker but lack of aces. Openings 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660/&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663/&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666/&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 show good suit but lack of aces and the joker. Opening 7NT shows strong hand but lack of aces and the joker (for instance 4 kings).\nThe responder shows aces as well. To show a good suit which hasn't been bid one needs to jump bid it. For instance \n 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 \u2013 ? \n 6NT \u2013 joker,\n 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660 \u2013 the ace of spades but lack of the joker, \n 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2663 \u2013 the ace of clubs but lack of the joker and the ace of spades,\n 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666 \u2013 the ace of diamonds, but lack of the joker and other aces, \n 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 \u2013 good hearts but lack of the joker and aces, \n 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660 \u2013 good spades but lack of the joker and aces etc.\nShowing aces can commence also after opening at the level of 7.\nIn the Francis' system it is also possible to show kings and even queens and jacks. Kings can be shown by bidding no trumps in the second round of auction. For instance in the following auction \n7NT now by the responder shows the king of diamonds. It is because the opponents had shown the aces of hearts and spades, partner showed the joker and the ace of diamonds. 7NT now shows the king of diamonds and potential possibility to play no trumps with diamonds as the source of tricks. 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2666 would show good diamonds but lack of the king of diamonds. 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 would show good hearts etc.\nStrategy.\nBidding.\nBids are typically made with the consideration that one will be receiving cards from the kitty and playing with a partner (except for mis\u00e8re and open mis\u00e8re) who hopefully will also be able to win a certain number of tricks. While the number of tricks one feel one's partner will be able to win will vary in each situation, one should bid based on that assumption and not only on the cards in one's hand.\nOn the other hand, it is also important to remember that one's partner will be using the same strategy in their bidding; and therefore, if one's partner bids 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665, for example, one may not necessarily want to bid 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 simply because one have two cards of the proposed trump suit in one's hand.\nWhen confronted with a hand that is more-or-less even in two different suits, it is customary to bid on the suit with a higher point value.\nCard Counting.\nWhen playing with 45 cards, the deck is composed of four suits with 11 cards each, and one Joker. In a suited contract (7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665, 8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660, and so on), the trump suit will have 13 cards, the suit of the same colour will have only ten, and the two suits of opposite colour will remain at 11 cards each.\nA simple strategy to bidding is to attempt to predict how the unaccounted-for trump cards (the ones one don't actually hold in one's hand) would be distributed among the remaining players, excluding the kitty, with all things being equal. In other words, if one hold seven cards of one suit it can be helpful to assume that the remaining six trump cards are distributed evenly among the remaining three players (two each and none in the kitty). Doing so can provide a basic idea of how many times one's opponents will be able to follow suit in each of the four suits.\nDiscarding the kitty.\nIf one are successful at bidding a suited contract and are awarded the kitty, a basic strategy of discarding is to eliminate as many non-trump suits from one's hand as possible, thus giving the most opportunity to use trump cards. However, discarding as many suits as possible is only a basic strategy, and should be met with some qualifications.\nFirst, in most contract bids it is beneficial to keep an ace of any non-trump suit, as with all things being equal each player will with high probability have at least two cards of any given non-trump suit, making the ace of that suit a winning card.\nSecond, it can also be effective in some circumstances to intentionally keep the king of a non-trump suit and a low card of the same suit (for example the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;h6 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hK when spades are trump) when one are unable to discard that suit entirely. The resulting strategy is to then play the low card first, with the assumption that one will lose the trick to the player holding the ace of that suit, and then when one have regained control of the table the king is played under the assumption that it will be a winning card.\nLeading trump.\nSometimes called \"flushing\" or \"bleeding\" trump, leading the trump suit immediately can often be (but isn't always) an effective strategy. This is typically done in the following situations.\nFirst, when a player has an above-average number of high trump cards they may wish to flush out the missing high trump cards. For example, if a player who has bid 7&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 is left holding the red joker and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;dJ\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hA\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hK\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hQ\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;h4, then they have five of the six highest cards (and six total). A suitable strategy would be to start the game playing highest trump (the Joker) in an attempt to force the play of the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hJ.\nAn alternative, but similar, strategy in this situation would be to play the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hQ. This alternative strategy would force the player holding the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\"/&gt;hJ to decide between either playing the jack, or throwing away a lower trump card to intentionally lose to the queen.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34681", "revid": "37480484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34681", "title": "Thirteen Colonies", "text": "British colonies forming the United States\nThe Thirteen Colonies were the British colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America which broke away from the British Crown in the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), and joined to form the United States of America.\nThe Thirteen Colonies in their traditional groupings were: the New England Colonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut); the Middle Colonies (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware); and the Southern Colonies (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). These colonies were part of British America, which also included territory in The Floridas, the Caribbean, and what is today Canada.\nThe Thirteen Colonies were separately administered under the Crown, but had similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and each was dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The first of the colonies, Virginia, was established at Jamestown in 1607. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the New England Colonies were substantially motivated by their founders' concerns related to the practice of religion. The other colonies were founded for business and economic expansion. The Middle Colonies were established on the former Dutch colony of New Netherland.\nBetween 1625 and 1775, the colonial population grew from 2 thousand to 2.4\u00a0million, largely displacing the region's Native Americans. The population included people subject to a system of slavery, which was legal in all of the colonies. In the 18th century, the British government operated under a policy of mercantilism, in which the central government administered its colonies for Britain's economic benefit.\nThe 13 colonies had a degree of self-governance and active local elections, and they resisted London's demands for more control over them. The French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the 13 colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating instead of dealing directly with Britain. With the help of colonial printers and newspapers, these inter-colonial activities and concerns were shared and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"Rights as Englishmen\", especially the principle of \"no taxation without representation\".\nLate 18th century conflicts with the British government over taxes and rights led to the American Revolution, in which the Thirteen Colonies joined for the first time to form the Continental Congress and raised the Continental Army, declaring independence in 1776. They fought the Revolutionary War with the aid of the Kingdom of France and, to a much lesser degree, the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Spain.\nBritish colonies.\nIn 1606, King James I of England granted charters to both the Plymouth Company and the London Company for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the Colony of Virginia in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the Popham Colony on the Kennebec River, but it was short-lived. The Plymouth Council for New England sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with Plymouth Colony in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the Pilgrims. The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown. The Thirteen Colonies were complete with the establishment of the Province of Georgia in 1732, although the term \"Thirteen Colonies\" became current only in the context of the American Revolution.\nIn London, beginning in 1660, all colonies were governed through a state department known as the Southern Department, and a committee of the Privy Council called the Board of Trade and Plantations. In 1768, a specific state department was created for America, but it was disbanded in 1782 when the Home Office took responsibility.\nNew England colonies.\nPlymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New Haven Colonies formed the New England Confederation in 1643, and all New England colonies were included in the Dominion of New England (1686\u20131689).\nSouthern colonies.\nThe Province of Carolina was initially chartered in 1629, and initial settlements were established after 1651. That charter was voided in 1660 by Charles II, and a new charter was issued in 1663, making it a proprietary colony. The Carolina province was divided into separate proprietary colonies, north and south, in 1712, before both became royal colonies in 1729.\nEarlier, along the coast, the Roanoke Colony was established in 1585, re-established in 1587, and found abandoned in 1590.\n17th century.\nSouthern colonies.\nThe first British colony was Jamestown, established on May 14, 1607, near Chesapeake Bay. The business venture was financed and coordinated by the London Virginia Company, a joint-stock company looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians, and little gold. The colony survived and flourished by turning to tobacco as a cash crop.\nIn 1632, King Charles I granted the charter for the Province of Maryland to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. Calvert's father had been a prominent Catholic official who encouraged Catholic immigration to the English colonies. The charter offered no guidelines on religion.\nThe Province of Carolina was the second attempted English settlement south of Virginia, the first being the failed attempt at Roanoke. It was a private venture, financed by a group of English Lords Proprietors who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then, the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir John Colleton. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at Charleston, originally Charles Town for Charles II of England.\nMiddle colonies.\nBeginning in 1609, Dutch traders established fur trading posts on the Hudson River, Delaware River, and Connecticut River, seeking to protect their interests in the fur trade. The Dutch West India Company established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of New Netherland.\nIn 1626, Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape Indians and established the outpost of New Amsterdam. Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade. It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships. The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning Atlantic slave trade, bringing some enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America, although many more were sent to Barbados and Brazil. The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did. Many of those who did immigrate to the colony were English, German, Walloon, or Sephardim.\nIn 1638, Sweden established the colony of New Sweden in the Delaware Valley. The operation was led by former members of the Dutch West India Company, including Peter Minuit. New Sweden established extensive trading contacts with English colonies to the south and shipped much of the tobacco produced in Virginia. The colony was conquered by the Dutch in 1655, while Sweden was engaged in the Second Northern War.\nBeginning in the 1650s, the English and Dutch engaged in a series of wars, and the English sought to conquer New Netherland. Richard Nicolls captured the lightly defended New Amsterdam in 1664, and his subordinates quickly captured the remainder of New Netherland. The 1667 Treaty of Breda ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War and confirmed English control of the region. The Dutch briefly regained control of parts of New Netherland in the Third Anglo-Dutch War but surrendered claim to the territory in the 1674 Treaty of Westminster, ending the Dutch colonial presence in America.\nThe British renamed the colony of New Amsterdam to \"York City\" or \"New York\". Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between Manhattan and Albany, while people from New England started moving in, as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population. In 1674, the proprietary colonies of East Jersey and West Jersey were created from lands formerly part of New York.\nPennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of Quaker William Penn. The main population elements included the Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch-Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between. Philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location, excellent port, and a population of about 30,000.\nNew England.\nThe Pilgrims were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the \"Mayflower\". Upon their arrival, they drew up the Mayflower Compact, by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small Plymouth Colony. William Bradford was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the Massachusetts Bay Colony with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, 20,000 had arrived; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.\nRoger Williams established Providence Plantations in 1636 on land provided by Narragansett sachem Canonicus. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, separation of church and state, and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.\nIn 1637, a second group, including Anne Hutchinson, established a second settlement on Rhode Island, today called Aquidneck. Samuel Gorton and others established a settlement near Providence Plantations, which they called Shawomet. However, Massachusetts Bay attempted to seize the land and put it under its own authority, so Gorton travelled to London to gain a charter from the King. Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick assisted him in gaining the charter, so he changed the name of the settlement to Warwick. Roger Williams secured a Royal Charter from the King in 1663, which united all four settlements into the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in New Hampshire and Maine. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\nIn 1685, King James II of England closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the Dominion of New England, putting the region under the control of Governor Edmund Andros. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown, and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the Glorious Revolution deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established. According to Guy Miller, the Rebellion of 1689 was the \"climax of the 60-year-old struggle between the government in England and the Puritans of Massachusetts over the question of who was to rule the Bay colony.\"\n18th century.\nIn 1702, East and West Jersey were combined to form the Province of New Jersey.\nThe northern and southern sections of the Carolina colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when Philip Ludwell was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony. The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the Province of North-Carolina and the Province of South Carolina. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.\nIn the 1730s, Parliamentarian James Oglethorpe proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of Georgia on June 9, 1732. Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750, the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.\nThe population of the Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population was 1.5\u00a0million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of British North America. More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston had a population of more than 16,000, which was small by European standards. By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the gross domestic product of the entire British Empire.\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the Ohio River valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases. Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the Ohio Company to promote the settlement of the Ohio Country.\nGlobal trade and immigration.\nThe British American colonies became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items. American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins. America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves. Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations. There were a few local attempted slave revolts, such as the Stono Rebellion and the New York Conspiracy of 1741, but these uprisings were suppressed.\nWhile the colonies also attracted immigrants from other European countries, English migrants formed the majority of the settler population after 1700. Immigrants from the rest of Europe travelled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies. Numerous settlers immigrated from Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"New Light\" Ulster Presbyterians. Protestant Germans also immigrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania. In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the First Great Awakening.\nFrench and Indian War.\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named Robert Jenkins sparked the War of Jenkins' Ear between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral Edward Vernon's assault on Cartagena de Indias, a Spanish city in South America. The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession, but most colonists called it King George's War. In 1745, British and colonial forces captured the town of Louisbourg, and the war came to an end with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for Madras and other territories. In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.\nThe French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the Seven Years' War. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley.\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when William Pitt the Elder decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a world war. During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably George Washington, which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort. The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops.\nAt the 1754 Albany Congress, Pennsylvania colonist Benjamin Franklin proposed the Albany Plan which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.\nIn the Treaty of Paris (1763), France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day Nova Scotia, and most of the Hudson Bay watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained Spanish Florida, from which it formed the colonies of East and West Florida. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need for colonial protection.\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy, but after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.\nGrowing dissent.\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies. They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the Sugar Act 1764. Later acts included the Currency Act 1764, the Stamp Act 1765, and the Townshend Acts of 1767. Colonial newspapers and printers in particular took strong exception against the Stamp Act which imposed a tax on newspapers and official documents, and played a central role in disseminating literature among the colonists against such taxes and the idea of taxation without colonial representation.\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, as this was designated an Indian Reserve. Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms. The proclamation was modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.\nAmerican Revolution.\nParliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies, bypassing the colonial legislatures, and Americans began to insist on the principle of \"no taxation without representation\" with intense protests over the Stamp Act of 1765. They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\nColonial discontent grew with the passage of the 1773 Tea Act, which reduced taxes on tea sold by the East India Company in an effort to undercut the competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the Boston Tea Party in 1773 when the Sons of Liberty dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the Intolerable Acts, which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless of whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent Thomas Gage to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Colonists elected delegates to the First Continental Congress, which convened in Philadelphia in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the Continental Association. The boycott proved effective, and the value of British imports dropped dramatically. The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between Patriots opposed to British rule and Loyalists who supported it.\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as Provincial Congresses, and colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise. Later in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. During the Second Continental Congress, the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates as well.\nMassachusetts Governor Thomas Gage feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at Concord, Massachusetts, but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, then lay siege to Boston.\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the Continental Congress hosted a convention of delegates for the Thirteen Colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states, later enumerated in the 1777 Articles of Confederation.\nIn May 1775, the Second Continental Congress, assembled in the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, began recruiting soldiers for the Revolutionary War against the British, printing its own money, and appointing George Washington as commander of Patriot militias. Those from New England that had launched the Siege of Boston, which forced British troops to withdraw from Boston. The patriot militias were later formalized into the Continental Army under Washington's command.\nDeclaration of Independence.\nThe Second Continental Congress charged the Committee of Five, including John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman, with authoring the Declaration of Independence. The committee, in turn, asked Jefferson to author the first draft, which Jefferson largely wrote in isolation between June 11, 1776, and June 28, 1776, from the second floor of a three-story home he was renting at 700 Market Street in Philadelphia, now called the Declaration House and within walking distance of Independence Hall. Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over these 17 days, and he likely wrote his first draft quickly.104\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted and issued the Declaration as a letter of grievances to King George III;\nWith the help chiefly of France, they defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War. The decisive victory came at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. In the Treaty of Paris (1783), Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\nPopulation of Thirteen Colonies.\nThe colonial population rose to a quarter of a million during the 17th century, and to nearly 2.5\u00a0million on the eve of the American Revolution. The estimates do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.\nGood health was important for the growth of the colonies: \"Fewer deaths among the young meant that a higher proportion of the population reached reproductive age, and that fact alone helps to explain why the colonies grew so rapidly.\" There were many other reasons for the population growth besides good health, such as the Great Migration.\nBy 1776, about 85% of the white population's ancestry originated in the British Isles (English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Welsh), 9% of German origin, 4% Dutch, and 2% Huguenot French and other minorities.\nOver 90% were farmers, with several small cities that were also seaports linking the colonial economy to the larger British Empire. These populations continued to grow at a rapid rate during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, primarily because of high birth rates and relatively low death rates. Immigration was a minor factor from 1774 to 1830.\nAccording to the United States Historical Census Database (USHCDB), the ethnic populations in the British American Colonies of 1700, 1755, and 1775 were:\nSlavery.\nChattel slavery was legal and practiced in all of the Thirteen Colonies. In most places, it involved house servants or farm workers. It was of economic importance in the export-oriented tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland and on the rice and indigo plantations of South Carolina.\nAbout 287,000 slaves were imported into the Thirteen Colonies over a period of 160 years, or 2% of the estimated 12\u00a0million taken from Africa to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade. The great majority went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. By the mid-18th century, life expectancy was much higher in the American colonies.\nThe numbers grew rapidly through a very high birth rate and low mortality rate, reaching nearly four million by the 1860 census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\nThe legal status of chattel slavery has been explained by William M. Wiecek:By the time of the Revolution, each of the mainland colonies had at least the rudiments of a statutory law of slavery...and nine of them had fairly elaborate slave codes that specified four basic legal characteristics of American slavery. First, the statutes defined slavery as a lifetime condition, distinguishing it from servitude and other forms of unfree status, which lasted only for a term of years. Second, slave status was made heritable through the mother. In so providing, the American colonies reversed the common-law rule that personal status followed the condition of the father... The third fundamental statutory characteristic of American slavery was racial identification...The fourth and most troublesome of the elements of slavery for colonial legislators was the precise legal status of a slave as property... southern jurisdictions ...settled on the legal definition of a slave as a \"chattel personal.\"\nDisease.\nThe diseases that afflicted the early immigrant settlers were a dangerous threat to life. Some of the diseases were new, and treatments were ineffective. Malaria was deadly to many new arrivals, especially in the Southern colonies. Of newly arrived able-bodied young men, over one-fourth of the Anglican missionaries died within five years of their arrival in the Carolinas. Mortality was high for infants and small children, especially for diphtheria, smallpox, yellow fever, and malaria. Most sick people turned to local healers and used folk remedies. Others relied upon the minister-physicians, barber-surgeons, apothecaries, midwives, and ministers; a few used colonial physicians trained either in Britain or through an apprenticeship in the colonies. One common treatment was blood letting. The method was crude due to a lack of knowledge about germs and infection among medical practitioners. There was little government control, regulation of medical care, or attention to public health. By the 18th century, Colonial physicians, following the models in England and Scotland, introduced modern medicine to the cities in the 18th century, and made some advances in vaccination, pathology, anatomy, and pharmacology.\nReligion.\nAccording to Patricia Bonomi, \"early Americans in all sections lived not in a spiritual desert but in a world where religion formed a key component of their mental landscape.\" Protestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies. There were also a few Catholics in Maryland, as well as Jews and deists; many colonists had no religious connection. The Church of England was officially established in most of the South. The Puritan movement divided into the Congregational and the Unitarian denominations, and was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 19th century. In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The Anglican parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as the repair of the roads and the relief of the poor. After 1700, the vestry no longer dominated the minister.\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The Reformed tradition was the foundation for Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Continental Reformed denominations. French Huguenots set up their own Reformed congregations. The Dutch Reformed Church was strong among Dutch Americans in New York and New Jersey, while Lutheranism was prevalent among German immigrants. Germans also brought diverse forms of Anabaptism, especially the Mennonite variety. Reformed Baptist preacher Roger Williams founded Providence Plantations which became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Jews were clustered in a few port cities. The Baltimore family founded Maryland and brought in fellow Catholics from England. Catholics were about 1.6% of the population or 40,000 in 1775. Of the 200\u2013250,000 Irish who came to the Colonies between 1701 and 1775, less than 20,000 were Catholic, many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination. Between 1770 and 1775 3,900 Irish Catholics arrived out of almost 45,000 white immigrants (7,000 English, 15,000 Scots, 13,200 Scots-Irish, 5,200 Germans). Most Catholics were English Recusants, Germans, Irish, or blacks; half lived in Maryland, with large populations also in New York and Pennsylvania. Presbyterians were chiefly immigrants from Scotland and Ulster who favored the back-country and frontier districts.\nQuakers were well established in Pennsylvania, where they controlled the governorship and the legislature for many years. Quakers were also numerous in Rhode Island. Baptists and Methodists were growing rapidly during the First Great Awakening of the 1740s. Many denominations sponsored missions to the local Indians.\nEducation.\nHigher education was available for young men in the north, and most students were aspiring Protestant ministers. Nine institutions of higher education were chartered during the colonial era. These colleges, known collectively as the colonial colleges were New College (Harvard), the College of William &amp; Mary, Yale College (Yale), the College of New Jersey (Princeton), King's College (Columbia), the College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania), the College of Rhode Island (Brown), Queen's College (Rutgers) and Dartmouth College. The College of William &amp; Mary and Queen's College later became public institutions, while the other institutions account for seven of the eight private Ivy League universities.\nExcept for the College of William and Mary, these institutions were all located in New England and the Middle Colonies. The southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.\nMost New England towns sponsored public schools for boys, but public schooling was rare elsewhere. Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college. Aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner, although some young men went to medical schools in Scotland.\nGovernment.\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial (royal colony), proprietary, and charter. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the Parliament of Great Britain. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the Board of Trade in London beginning late in the 17th century.\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at the pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could prorogue (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power over legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the English Restoration of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.\nCharter governments were political corporations created by letters patent, giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691. Providence Plantations merged with the settlements at Rhode Island and Warwick to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which also became a charter colony in 1636.\nBritish role.\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by Herbert L. Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles McLean Andrews, and Lawrence H. Gipson. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and it emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.\nPolitical culture.\nSettlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate. The 13 colonies had no hereditary aristocrats, as in Europe. There were no rich gentry who owned all the farmland and rented it out to tenants, as in England and in the Dutch settlements in upstate New York. Instead, there was a political system of local control that was governed by men elected in fair elections. The colonies offered a broader base than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature. Governors were appointed in London but colonists elected the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head and did not have a vote or a voice. Indians and free blacks were politically outside the system and usually could not vote. Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\". The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate. In Britain, 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. However, in most places, good farmland was cheap and so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.\nAccording to historian Donald Radcliffe: The right to vote had always been extraordinarily widespread\u2014at least among adult white males--even before the country gained its independence...Enfranchisement varied greatly by location. There certainly were communities, particularly newly settled communities where land was inexpensive, in which 70 or 80 percent of all white men were enfranchised. Yet there were also locales...where the percentages were far lower, closer to 40 or 50 percent...On the whole, the franchise was far more widespread than it was in England, yet as the revolution approached, the rate of property ownership was falling, and the proportion of adult white males who were eligible to vote was probably less than 60 percent. \nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat or town center to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. In Virginia candidate George Washington spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.\nVoting was voluntary, and typically about half the men eligible to vote turned out on election day. Turnout was usually higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere, the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.\nThe colonies were independent of one another before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the Albany Congress of 1754 led by Benjamin Franklin. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the Rights of Englishmen which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.\nEconomic policy.\nThe British Empire at the time was operated under the mercantile system, where all trade was concentrated within the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain, its merchants, and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners to increase political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish, or Dutch. The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus, the British Navy captured New Amsterdam (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country. Colonial commodities were shipped on British ships to the mother country where Britain sold them to Europe reaping the benefits of the export trade. Finished goods were manufactured in Britain and sold in the colonies, or imported by Britain for retail to the colonies, profiting the mother country. Like other New World colonial empires, the British empire's commodity production was dependent on slave labor; as observed in 1720s Britain, \"all this great increase in our treasure proceeds chiefly from the labour of negroes\" in Britain's colonies.\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the Navigation Acts, which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants (Writs of Assistance). In 1761, Boston lawyer James Otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation that affected them internally.\nTransportation.\nTransportation was primarily done by water, although a road network did exist in the colonies. As transportation was often done by water, a sizable shipbuilding industry developed, especially in New England. Rivers were utilized for transportation purposes.\nMost roads existed along the Atlantic Coast and connected other cities. Some individual colonies built their own road networks. By 1764, a stagecoach route existed between Philadelphia and New York City, and by 1773, the stagecoach network extended to Providence and Boston.\nOther British colonies.\nBesides the grouping that became known as the \"thirteen colonies\",\nBritain in the late-18th century had another dozen colonial possessions in the New World surrounding the 13 colonies. The British West Indies, Newfoundland, the Province of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Bermuda, and East and West Florida remained loyal to the British crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida as the war was ending, and in 1821 sold it to the United States). Several of the other colonies evinced a certain degree of sympathy with the Patriot cause, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation. The British crown had only recently acquired several of those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, especially in the case of Quebec and Florida.\nHistoriography.\nThe first British Empire centered on the Thirteen Colonies, which attracted large numbers of settlers from Britain. The \"Imperial School\" between the 1900s and 1930s took a favorable view of the benefits of empire, emphasizing its successful economic integration. The Imperial School included such historians as Herbert L. Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles M. Andrews, and Lawrence Gipson.\nThe shock of Britain's defeat in 1783 caused a radical revision of British policies on colonialism, thereby producing what historians call the end of the First British Empire, even though Britain still controlled Canada and some islands in the West Indies. Ashley Jackson writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first British Empire was largely destroyed by the loss of the American colonies, followed by a \"swing to the east\" and the foundation of a second British Empire based on commercial and territorial expansion in South Asia.\nMuch of the historiography concerns the reasons why the Americans rebelled in the 1770s and successfully broke away. Since the 1960s, the mainstream of historiography has emphasized the growth of American consciousness and nationalism and the colonial republican value-system, in opposition to the aristocratic viewpoint of British leaders.\nHistorians in recent decades have mostly used one of three approaches to analyze the American Revolution:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34700", "revid": "48404955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34700", "title": "1840s", "text": "Decade\nDecade\nThe 1840s (pronounced \"eighteen-forties\") was the decade that began on January 1, 1840, and ended on December 31, 1849.\nThe decade was noted in Europe for featuring the largely unsuccessful Revolutions of 1848, also known as the \"Springtime of Nations\". Throughout the continent, bourgeois liberals and working-class radicals engaged in a series of revolts in favor of social reform. In the United Kingdom, this notably manifested itself through the Chartist movement, which sought universal suffrage and parliamentary reform. In France, the February Revolution led to the overthrow of the Orl\u00e9ans dynasty by Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1848, the publication of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx would help lay the groundwork for the global socialist movement. Arguably the first major event of the decade was the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in the United Tribes (modern-day New Zealand) between M\u0101ori rangatira and representatives of the British Crown, which began in February 1840. Due to the differences between the M\u0101ori and English versions of the texts, the British claimed M\u0101ori had ceded sovereignty and proclaimed a new Colony, leading to more than 25 years of asymmetric armed conflict until the Colony secured substantive control.\nThe Mexican\u2013American War led to the redrawing of national boundaries in North America. In the United States, mass migration to the new West Coast occurred, following the annexation of California from Mexico with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, \nand the California Gold Rush beginning, following the discovery of gold there, both in early 1848. On its northern border, the United States settled the Oregon boundary dispute with the United Kingdom in 1846, thereby solving a domestic political crisis in the former nation. Meanwhile in Ireland, the Great Famine began in 1845, causing the deaths of one million Irish people and forcing over a million more to emigrate. In 1848, the women's rights movement began with the Seneca Falls Convention in New York.\nThe last living person from this decade was Robert Early, who died in 1960.\nPolitics and wars.\nPacific Islands.\nIn 1842, Tahiti and Tahuata were declared a French protectorate, to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. The capital of Papeet\u0113 was founded in 1843. In 1845, George Tupou I united Tonga into a kingdom, and reigned as Tu\u02bbi Kanokupolu.\nEast Asia.\nChina.\nOn August 29, 1842, the first of two Opium Wars ended between China and Britain with the Treaty of Nanking. One of the consequences was the cession of modern-day Hong Kong Island to the British. Hong Kong would eventually be returned to China in 1997.\nOn July 3, 1844 the United States signed the Treaty of Wanghia with the Qing Empire. The treaty established five U.S. treaty ports in China with extraterritoriality and was the first unequal treaty that the United States imposed on the dynasty.\nJapan.\nThe 1840s comprised the end of the Tenp\u014d era (1830\u20131844), the entirety of the K\u014dka era (1844\u20131848), and the beginning of the Kaei era (1848\u20131854). The decade saw the end of the reign of Emperor Ninko in 1846, who was succeeded by his son, Emperor K\u014dmei.\nSoutheastern Asia.\nSiam and Vietnam.\nThe Siamese-Vietnamese War (1841\u20131845) in Cambodia erupted between Vietnam (then under the rule of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty) and Siam (under the House of Chakri). In the increasingly confrontational rivalry between Vietnam and Siam, the conflict was triggered by Vietnam's absorption of Cambodia and the demotion of the Khmer monarchs. Siam under Rama III seized the opportunity to intervene as the tide of Khmer discontent rose against Vietnamese rule.\nEmperors Minh M\u1ea1ng, Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb and T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c ruled Vietnam during the 1840s under the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty.\nSouthern Asia.\nAfghanistan.\nThe First Anglo-Afghan War had started in 1838, started by the British as a means of defending India (under British control at the time) from the Russian Empire's expansion into Central Asia. The British attempted to impose a puppet regime on Afghanistan under Shuja Shah, but the regime was short lived and proved unsustainable without British military support. By 1842, mobs were attacking the British on the streets of Kabul and the British garrison was forced to abandon the city due to constant civilian attacks. During the retreat from Kabul, the British army of approximately 4,500 troops (of which only 690 were European) and 12,000 camp followers was subjected to a series of attacks by Afghan warriors. All of the British soldiers were killed except for one and he and a few surviving Indian soldiers made it to the fort at Jalalabad shortly after. After the Battle of Kabul (1842), Britain placed Dost Mohammad Khan back into power (1842\u20131863) and withdrew from Afghanistan.\nSikh Empire.\nThe Sikh Empire was founded in 1799, ruled by Ranjit Singh. When Singh died in 1839, the Sikh Empire began to fall into disorder. There was a succession of short-lived rulers at the central Durbar (court), and increasing tension between the Khalsa (the Sikh Army) and the Durbar. In May 1841, the Dogra dynasty (a vassal of the Sikh Empire) invaded western Tibet, marking the beginning of the Sino-Sikh war. This war ended in a stalemate in September 1842, with the Treaty of Chushul.\nThe British East India Company began to build up its military strength on the borders of the Punjab. Eventually, the increasing tension goaded the Khalsa to invade British territory, under weak and possibly treacherous leaders. The hard-fought First Anglo-Sikh War (1845\u20131846) ended in defeat for the Khalsa. With the Treaty of Lahore, the Sikh Empire ceded Kashmir to the East India Company and surrendered the Koh-i-Noor diamond to Queen Victoria.\nThe Sikh empire was finally dissolved at the end of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 into separate princely states and the British province of Punjab. Eventually, a Lieutenant Governorship was formed in Lahore as a direct representative of the British Crown.\nWestern Asia.\nOttoman Empire.\nThe decade was near the beginning of the Tanzim\u00e2t Era of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid I ruled during this period.\nLebanon.\nEmir Bashir Shihab II controlled the Mount Lebanon Emirate at the beginning of the 1840s. Bashir allied with Muhammad Ali of Egypt, but Muhammad Ali was driven out of the country. Bashir was deposed in 1840 when the Egyptians were driven out by an Ottoman-European alliance, which had the backing of Maronite forces. His successor, Emir Bashir III, ruled until 1842, after which the emirate was dissolved and split into a Druze sector and a Christian sector.\nRevolutions of 1848.\nThere was a wave of revolutions in Europe, collectively known as the Revolutions of 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history, but within a year, reactionary forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed.\nThe revolutions were essentially bourgeois-democratic in nature with the aim of removing the old feudal structures and the creation of independent national states. The revolutionary wave began in France in February, and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries. Six factors were involved: widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership; demands for more participation in government and democracy; demands for freedom of press; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based on the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants.\nThe uprisings were led by ad hoc coalitions of reformers, the middle classes and workers, which did not hold together for long. Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary, the end of absolute monarchy in Denmark, and the definitive end of the Capetian monarchy in France. The revolutions were most important in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, and the Austrian Empire, but did not reach Russia, Sweden, Great Britain, and most of southern Europe (Spain, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, Portugal, the Ottoman Empire).\nNorthern Europe.\nUnited Kingdom.\nRoyalty.\nQueen Victoria was on the throne 20 June 1837 until her death 22 January, 1901. The wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha took place in 1840.\nIreland.\nThe Great Famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of one million Irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it. It is sometimes referred to, mostly outside Ireland, as the \"Irish Potato Famine\" because one-third of the population was then solely reliant on this cheap crop for a number of historical reasons. The proximate cause of famine was a potato disease commonly known as potato blight. A census taken in 1841 revealed a population of slightly over 8 million. A census immediately after the famine in 1851 counted 6,552,385, a drop of almost 1.5 million in 10 years.\nThe period of the potato blight in Ireland from 1845 to 1851 was full of political confrontation. A more radical Young Ireland group seceded from the Repeal movement and attempted an armed rebellion in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848, which was unsuccessful.\nSouthern Europe.\nSpain.\nThis period saw the 1840 end of the First Carlist War, a civil war in Spain over the succession to the throne and the nature of the Spanish monarchy. This was the first full decade of the reign of Isabella II of Spain. Since she was only 10 years old in 1840, her true reign started in 1843, for which the first portion was referred to as D\u00e9cada moderada. The Affair of the Spanish Marriages (1846) was a series of intrigues between France, Spain, and the United Kingdom relating Isabella II's marriages, which was shortly followed by Second Carlist War (1847\u20131849).\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn the prior decade, the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837\u20131838. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all British North American provinces by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858).\nUnited States.\nNative Americans.\nChief Joseph of the Nez Perce was predicted to have been born in the 1840s.\nPresidents.\nThe United States had five different Presidents during the decade. Only the 1880s would have as many. Martin Van Buren was president when the decade began, but was defeated by William Henry Harrison in the U.S. presidential election of 1840. Harrison's service was the shortest in history, starting with his inauguration on March 4, 1841, and ending when he died on April 4, 1841.\nHarrison's vice president, John Tyler, replaced him as President (the first such Presidential succession in U.S. history), and served out the rest of his term. Tyler spent much of his term in conflict with the Whig party. He ended his term having made an alliance with the Democrats, endorsing James K. Polk and signing the resolution to annex Texas into the United States.\nIn the Presidential election of 1844, James K. Polk defeated Henry Clay. During his presidency, Polk oversaw the U.S. victory in the Mexican\u2013American War and subsequent annexation of what is now the southwest United States. He also negotiated a split of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain.\nIn the U.S. presidential election of 1848, Whig Zachary Taylor of Louisiana defeated Democrat Lewis Cass of Michigan. Taylor's term in office was cut short by his death in 1850.\nCalifornia.\nIn the first part of the 1840s, the modern state of California was part of a larger province of Mexico, called \"Alta California\". The region included all of the modern American states of California, Nevada and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico.\nThe United States, embarked on the Conquest of California in an early military campaign of the Mexican\u2013American War in Alta California. The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847. The Treaty of Cahuenga was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. Shortly thereafter, John C. Fr\u00e9mont was appointed Governor of the new California Territory, and Yerba Buena, California, was renamed San Francisco.\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in February 1848, marked the end of the Mexican\u2013American War. By the terms of the treaty, Mexico formally ceded Alta California along with its other northern territories east through Texas, receiving $15,000,000 in exchange. This largely unsettled territory constituted nearly half of its claimed territory with about 1% of its then population of about 4,500,000.\nThe discovery of gold in Northern California (and subsequent discourse about that discovery in 1848) led to the California Gold Rush. In October 1848, the SS \"California\" left New York Harbor, rounded Cape Horn at the tip of South America, and arrived in San Francisco after the 4-month-21-day journey. Thereafter, regular steamboat service continued from the west to the east coast of the United States. During 1848, only an estimated 6,000 to 6,500 people traveled to California to seek gold that year. By the beginning of 1849, word of the Gold Rush had spread around the world, and an overwhelming number of gold-seekers and merchants began to arrive from virtually every continent. In 1849, an estimated 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849\u2014of which 50,000 to 60,000 were from the United States. In 1850, California joined the union as the 31st state.\nTexas.\nThe Republic of Texas had declared independence in 1836, as part of breaking away from Mexico in the Texas Revolution. The following year, an ambassador from Texas approached the United States about the possibility of becoming an American state. Fearing a war with Mexico, which did not recognize Texas independence, the United States declined the offer.\nIn 1844, James K. Polk was elected the United States president after promising to annex Texas. Before he assumed office, the outgoing president, John Tyler, entered negotiations with Texas. On February 26, 1845, six days before Polk took office, the U.S. Congress approved the annexation. The Texas legislature approved annexation in July 1845 and constructed a state constitution. In October, Texas residents approved the annexation and the new constitution, and Texas was officially inducted into the United States on December 29, 1845, as the 28th U.S. state. Mexico still considered Texas to be a renegade Mexican state, and never considered land south of the Nueces River to be part of Texas. This border dispute between the newly expanded United States and Mexico triggered the Mexican\u2013American War.\nWhen the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the Compromise of 1850, in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.\nMexican\u2013American War.\nAmerican territorial expansion to the Pacific coast was a major goal of U.S. President James K. Polk. In 1845, the United States of America annexed Texas, which had won independence from Centralist Republic of Mexico in the Texas Revolution of 1836. Mexico did not accept the annexation, while also continuing to claim the Nueces River as its border with Texas, and also still considering Texas to be a province of Mexico. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk sent troops to the disputed area, and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces attacked American forces, the U.S. declared the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848).\nCombat operations lasted a year and a half, from the spring of 1846 to the fall of 1847. U.S. forces quickly occupied the capital town of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico along the upper Rio Grande and began the Conquest of California in Mexico's Alta California Department. They then invaded to the south into parts of central Mexico (modern-day northeastern Mexico and northwest Mexico). Meanwhile, the Pacific Squadron of the United States Navy conducted a blockade and took control of several garrisons on the Pacific coast farther south in lower Baja California Territory. The U.S. Army eventually captured the capital Mexico City, having marched west from the port of Veracruz, where the Americans staged their first amphibious landing on the Gulf of Mexico coast.\nThe 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and specified its major consequence, the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million compensation for the physical damage of the war. In addition, the United States assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of their province, later the Republic of Texas (and now the State of Texas), and thereafter cited and acknowledged the Rio Grande as its future northern national border with the United States. Including Texas, Mexico ceded an area of approximately \u2013 by its terms, around 55% of its former national territory.\nMexico.\nThe 1840s for Mexico were the end of the centralist government and the waning years the \"Age of Santa Anna\". In 1834, President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna dissolved Congress, forming a new government. That government instituted the new Centralist Republic of Mexico by approving a new centralist constitution (\"Siete Leyes\"), From its formation in 1835 until its dissolution in 1846, the Centralist Republic was governed by eleven presidents (none of which finished their term). It called for the state militias to disarm, but many states resisted, including Mexican Texas, which won its independence in the Texas Revolution of 1836.\nThe Republic of the Rio Grande declared its independence from Mexico in January 1840. However, the border with Texas was never determined (whether the Nueces River or the Rio Grande). The new Republic fought a brief and unsuccessful war for independence, returning to Mexico late in the year.\nIn 1841, Generals Santa Anna and Paredes led a rebellion against President Bustamante, resulting in Santa Anna becoming president of the centralist government for a fifth time . Local officials in Yucat\u00e1n declared independence in 1841, opposing strong autocratic rule and demanding the restoration of the Constitution of 1824, thus establishing the second Republic of Yucat\u00e1n.\nIn 1842, the region of Soconusco was annexed by Mexico as part of the state of Chiapas, following the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America.\nIn 1846, President Paredes and the Congress of Mexico declared war at the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War. Paredes' presidential successor was deposed in a coup, replaced by Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas. Salas issued a new decree that restored the Constitution of 1824, ending the Centralist Republic and beginning the Second Federal Republic of Mexico. After the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera became the second president of Mexico to finish his term (Mexico's first president completed his in 1829). It was during this time that Yucat\u00e1n reunited with Mexico. A decisive factor for the reunion was the Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n (a revolt by the indigenous Maya population) for which Yucat\u00e1n initially sought help from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but ultimately reunited with Mexico for help.\nHerrera peacefully turned over the presidency to the winner of the Federal Elections of 1850, General Mariano Arista. Despite being exiled from Mexico in 1848, Santa Anna would return to the presidency one last time during the 1850s.\nScience and technology.\nPhotography.\nThe 1840s saw the rise of the Daguerreotype. Introduced in 1839, the Daguerreotype was the first publicly announced photographic process and came into widespread use in the 1840s. Numerous events in the 1840s were captured by photography for the first time with the use of the Daguerreotype. A number of daguerreotypes were taken of the occupation of Saltillo during the Mexican\u2013American War, in 1847 by an unknown photographer. These photographs stand as the first ever photos of warfare in history.\nTransportation.\nRail.\nWidespread interest to invest in rail technology led to a speculative frenzy in Britain, known there as Railway Mania. It reached its zenith in 1846, when no fewer than 272 Acts of Parliament were passed, setting up new railway companies, and the proposed routes totalled of new railway. Around a third of the railways authorised were never built \u2013 the company either collapsed due to poor financial planning, was bought out by a larger competitor before it could build its line, or turned out to be a fraudulent enterprise to channel investors' money into another business.\nPopular culture.\nFashion.\nFashion in European and European-influenced clothing is characterized by a narrow, natural shoulder line following the exaggerated puffed sleeves of the later 1820s fashion and 1830s fashion. The narrower shoulder was accompanied by a lower waistline for both men and women.\nDisasters, natural events, and notable mishaps.\nCholera.\nThe third cholera pandemic happened during the 1840s, which researchers at UCLA believe may have started as early as 1837 and lasted until 1863. This pandemic was considered to have the highest fatalities of the 19th-century epidemics. It originated in India (in Lower Bengal), spreading along many shipping routes in 1846. Over 15,000 people died of cholera in Mecca in 1846. In Russia, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people died in the country's epidemic.\nA two-year outbreak began in England and Wales in 1848, and claimed 52,000 lives. In London, it was the worst outbreak in the city's history, claiming 14,137 lives, over twice as many as the 1832 outbreak. Cholera hit Ireland in 1849 and killed many of the Irish Famine survivors, already weakened by starvation and fever. In 1849, cholera claimed 5,308 lives in the major port city of Liverpool, England, an embarkation point for immigrants to North America, and 1,834 in Hull, England. In 1849, a second major outbreak occurred in Paris.\nCholera, believed spread from Irish immigrant ship(s) from England to the United States, spread throughout the Mississippi river system, killing over 4,500 in St. Louis and over 3,000 in New Orleans. Thousands died in New York, a major destination for Irish immigrants. The outbreak that struck Nashville in 1849\u20131850 took the life of former U.S. President James K. Polk. During the California Gold Rush, cholera was transmitted along the California, Mormon and Oregon Trails as 6,000 to 12,000 are believed to have died on their way to Utah and Oregon in the cholera years of 1849\u20131855. It is believed cholera claimed more than 150,000 victims in the United States during the two pandemics between 1832 and 1849, and also claimed 200,000 victims in Mexico.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The advancements of the previous three decades towards the end of the 18th century had propelled the Industrial Revolution into a global movement, with entire wars fought with the newly developed technologies \u2013 creating an impetus to imperialist campaigns across Africa and Asia, as well as the counter-movement on Latin America later on.\nPolitics and wars.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nThe European political landscape was dominated by the Napoleonic Wars, a series of conflicts declared against Napoleon's First French Empire and changing sets of European allies by opposing coalitions that ran from 1803 to 1815. As a continuation of the wars sparked by the French Revolution of 1789, they revolutionized European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale, mainly due to the application of modern mass conscription. French power rose quickly, conquering most of Europe by the end of the decade. The decade brought hard times.\nOn 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire), Napoleon overthrew the French government, replacing it with the Consulate, in which he was First Consul. On 2 December 1804, after a failed assassination plot, he crowned himself Emperor. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria (Third Coalition), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time failure to lure the superior British fleet away from the English Channel, ending in a decisive French defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar (in this battle, British Admiral Horatio Nelson was fatally wounded) on 21 October put an end to hopes of an invasion of Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz, forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (\"see Treaty of Pressburg\") and dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, a Fourth Coalition was set up, on 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at Friedland. The Treaties of Tilsit divided Europe between France and Russia and created the Duchy of Warsaw.\nThe War of the Fifth Coalition, fought in the year 1809, pitted a coalition of the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against the French Empire and Bavaria. Major engagements between France and Austria, the main participants, unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War, sent another expedition, the Walcheren Campaign, to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians, although this effort had little impact on the outcome of the conflict. After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley, the war ended favorably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July, resulting in the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn . Although fighting in the Iberian Peninsula continued, the War of the Fifth Coalition was the last major conflict on the European continent until the French invasion of Russia in 1812 sparked the Sixth Coalition.\nSlavery.\nThis decade marked the greatest increase of the Atlantic slave trade to the United States. During the period of 1798 and 1808, approximately 200,000 slaves were imported from Africa to the United States. Still, the abolitionist movement began to gain ground in this period. Britain enacted the Slave Trade Act 1807, which barred the trade of slaves in Great Britain (though slavery was still legal). The United States enacted a similar ban in 1808. However, Napoleon revoked the French Empire's ban on slavery with the Law of 20 May 1802.\nOn 30 August 1800, under the cloak of religious meetings, Gabriel Prosser and Jack Bowler planned a slave rebellion in Richmond, Virginia. The rebellion was postponed due to poor weather and was ultimately unsuccessful because of unnamed two slaves betraying the cause.\nScience and technology.\nElectricity.\nThis decade contained some of the earliest experiments in electrochemistry. In 1800 Alessandro Volta constructed a voltaic pile, the first device to produce a large electric current, later known as the electric battery. Napoleon, informed of his works, summoned him in 1801 for a command performance of his experiments. He received many medals and decorations, including the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\nAlso in 1800, William Nicholson and Johann Wilhelm Ritter succeeded in decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. Soon thereafter Ritter discovered the process of electroplating. He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the electrodes. By 1801 Ritter observed thermoelectric currents and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by Thomas Johann Seebeck.\nIn 1806, Humphry Davy decomposed potash and soda, employing a voltaic pile of approximately 250 cells, showing that these substances were respectively the oxides of potassium and sodium, which metals previously had been unknown. Employing a battery of 2,000 elements of a voltaic pile and charcoal enclosed in a vacuum, Davy gave the first public demonstration of the electric arc lamp in 1809.\nSteam transportation started to become viable during this decade. In 1803, William Symington's \"Charlotte Dundas\", generally considered to be the world's first practical steamboat, made her first voyage. Later, in 1807, Robert Fulton's \"North River Steamboat\", the world's first commercially successful steamboat, made her maiden voyage.\nIn 1801, Richard Trevithick ran a full-sized steam 'road locomotive' on the road in Camborne, England, followed by his 10-seater London Steam Carriage in 1803. In 1804, Trevithick built a prototype steam-powered railway locomotive.\nThe first railway began operating during this time. The Surrey Iron Railway in Great Britain was established by the British Parliament in 1801, and began operation on 26 July 1803. The railway relied on horse-drawn haulage than powered locomotives.\nIn 1807, Isaac de Rivas made a hydrogen gas-powered vehicle, the first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.\nJames Watt creates first steam engine based on Newcomen's design.\nCulture.\nFashion.\nFashion in this period in European and European-influenced countries saw the final triumph of undress or informal styles over the brocades, lace, periwig, and powder of the earlier eighteenth century.\n Fashionable women's clothing styles were based on the Empire silhouette \u2014 dresses were closely fitted to the torso just under the bust, falling loosely below. Inspired by neoclassical tastes, the short-waisted gowns sported soft, flowing skirts and were often made of white, almost transparent muslin, which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. No respectable woman would leave the house without a hat or bonnet. The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary \"coif\", Chinese hat, Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.\n1800\u20131809 was the height of dandyism in men's fashion in Europe, following the example of Beau Brummell. Older men, military officers, and those in conservative professions such as lawyers and physicians retained their wigs and powder into this period, but younger men of fashion wore their hair in short curls, often with long sideburns. This period saw the final abandonment of lace, embroidery, and other embellishment from serious men's clothing outside of formalized court dress. Instead, cut and tailoring became much more important as an indicator of quality.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the year, the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving fifteen sovereign republics and the CIS in its place. In July 1991, India abandoned its policies of dirigism, license raj and autarky and began extensive liberalisation to its economy. This increased GDP but also increased income inequality over the next two decades. A UN-authorized coalition force from 34 nations fought against Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait in the previous year, 1990. The conflict would be called the Gulf War and would mark the beginning of a since-constant American military presence in the Middle East. The clash between Serbia and the other Yugoslav republics would lead into the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, which ran through the rest of the decade.\nIn the context of the apartheid, the year after the liberation of political prisoner Nelson Mandela, the Parliament of South Africa repeals the Population Registration Act, 1950, overturning the racial classification of the population, a key component of apartheid.\nThe year 1991 saw the rise of a ten-year-long boost of the US domestic economy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average remarkably closing in April at above 3,000 for the first time. This situation would only be cut short by the Dot-com bubble of 2000\u20132002.\nIn August, the World Wide Web, originally conceived during the previous year, was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and publicly announced in August, also establishing the first website ever, \"info.cern.ch\". This step was a key factor that led to the mid-1990s public breakthrough of the internet, which would eventually accelerate the already ongoing globalization around the globe.\nIn terms of popular culture, during this year alternative rock saw a new height of popularity when some of the earliest music exponents of the virtually unknown grunge sound were released, including the influential \"Nevermind\" album by Seattle-based band Nirvana in September 1991. It was also in 1991 that hip-hop music reached an unprecedented mainstream level of success. Electronic music derivative forms were also starting to gain momentum and would define, along with the previous scenes, the sound for most of the decade. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In American popular culture, the decade would later be nostalgically referred to as the \"gay nineties\" (\"gay\" meaning carefree or cheerful). In the British Empire, the 1890s epitomised the late Victorian period.\nAs European powers continued their colonial expansion, the decade saw the defeat of Edi (1890), Siam (1893), Morocco (1894), Dahomey (1894), Arab-Swahili warlords (1894), Lombork (1894), Pahang (1895), Merina (1895), Zanzibar (1896), Khaua and Mbandjeru (1896), Ashanti (1896), Matabeleland (1897), Pedir (1898), Sudan (1899), and various north-west Indian tribes and states. Whereas most colonial campaigns were successful, Italy faced a significant defeat as it failed to conquer Ethiopia, being decisively defeated at Adwa (1896). Furthermore, the second half of the decade saw the final unravelling of Spanish America, which began with insurrections in Cuba (1895) and the Philippines (1896) and ended with the Spaniards' defeat at the hands of the United States in 1898. Following the sale of various Pacific islands to Germany in 1899, the Spanish colonial empire would be restricted to Africa. Further in the east, Japan sought to expand its own empire, waging wars against Donghak (1894\u20131895), Qing China (1894\u20131895) and the Republic of Formosa (1895). Other conflicts included the Garza War (1891\u20131893), the Greco-Turkish War (1897) and internal conflicts in Samoa (1886\u20131894, 1898\u20131899), Afghanistan (1888\u20131893), Argentina (1890), Chile (1891), the Ottoman Empire (1891, 1893, 1894, 1895\u201396, 1896\u20131897, 1896), Mexico (1891\u20131892), Brazil (1893\u20131894, 1893\u20131895, 1899\u20131903), Peru (1894\u20131895), the South African Republic (1894), northwest China (1895\u20131896), Bolivia (1898\u20131899) and Columbia (1899\u20131902).\nThe decade was characterized by an international economic recovery following the Long Depression (1873\u20131896) and by the beginning of strong economic growth during the Belle \u00c9poque (1871\u20131914), driven by the innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution (i.e. electricity, gasoline, automobiles, artificial textiles, organic chemistry). The decade also saw the apogee of the coal-powered steam engine, which would subsequently be dethroned by the reciprocating engine, powered by refined petroleum. The supremacy of this new source of energy was confirmed when the world's first fleet, the Royal Navy, decided in 1910 to supply all its vessels with fuel oil. In the United States, the decade was marked by a severe economic depression sparked by the Panic of 1893. This economic crisis would help bring about the end of the so-called \"Gilded Age\", and coincided with numerous strikes in the industrial workforce. The economic depression sparked a political struggle over free silver and the collapse of the Third Party System. Concurrently in Australia, a banking crisis occurred, caused by the collapse of a speculative boom in the Australian property market. First-wave feminism made a significant breakthrough as a successful petition in 1893 resulted in New Zealand becoming the first country to grant women the right to vote.\nFrom 1889 to 1890, a worldwide respiratory viral pandemic took place, resulting in 300\u2013900 million infections and 1 million deaths. The pandemic is presumed to have originated in the central Asian city of Bukhara. Furthermore, in this decade, an epizootic of the rinderpest virus struck Africa, considered to be \"the most devastating epidemic to hit southern Africa in the late nineteenth century\". It killed more than 5.2 million cattle south of the Zambezi, as well as domestic oxen, sheep, and goats, and wild populations of buffalo, giraffe, and wildebeest. This led to starvation resulting in the death of an estimated third of the human population of Ethiopia and two-thirds of the Maasai people of Tanzania. In 1891\u22121892, poor weather alongside government mismanagement in Russia led to a famine, causing 375,000 to 400,000 deaths. British India suffered two famines this decade, first from 1896 to 1897 and then from 1899 to 1900, due to draught and British policies. Famines also took place in Cuba and China. Major earthquakes of this decade include the 1891 Mino\u2013Owari earthquake (7,273 deaths), the 1893 Quchan earthquake (18,000 casualties), and the 1896 Sanriku earthquake (22,066 people dead or missing).\nThe first international Olympic Games in modern history were held in Athens in 1896, with 241 athletes from across 14 nations competing. In the United States, the best-selling books of this decade (by year) were \"Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush\" (a collection of short stories, best-seller in 1895), \"Tom Grogan\" (a drama novel, best-seller in 1896), \"Quo Vadis\" (a historical novel, best-seller in 1897), \"Caleb West\" (best-seller in 1898), and \"David Harum\" (best-seller in 1898). The film industry, still in its infancy, continued to produce short films such as \"Le Coucher de la Mari\u00e9e\" and \"The Kiss\". Songs of this decade include \"America the Beautiful\", \"Daisy Bell\" and \"Hello! Ma Baby\".\nIn this decade, the world population grew from approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion. The last living person from this decade, Emma Morano, died on April 15, 2017. The last living man from this decade, Jiroemon Kimura, died on June 12, 2013.\nPolitics and wars.\nColonization.\nHarbin founded as a Russian city within Manchuria to serve as the center of construction and the main junction and administration center of the Russian-built Chinese Eastern Railway. The location for the city was largely chosen strategically to cross the Songhua River, a tributary of the Amur, and the largest river in Manchuria.\nWars and conflicts.\nThe Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota on December 29, 1890, when 365 troops of the US 7th Cavalry, supported by four Hotchkiss guns, surrounded an encampment of Miniconjou (Lakota) and Hunkpapa Sioux (Lakota) near Wounded Knee Creek, South Dakota. The Army had orders to escort the Sioux to the railroad for transport to Omaha, Nebraska. One day earlier, the Sioux had been cornered and agreed to turn themselves in at the Pine Ridge Agency in South Dakota. They were the last of the Sioux to do so. In the process of disarming the Sioux, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote could not hear the order to give up his rifle and was reluctant to do so. A scuffle over Black Coyote's rifle escalated into an all-out battle, with those few Sioux warriors who still had weapons shooting at the 7th Cavalry, and the 7th Cavalry opening fire indiscriminately from all sides, killing men, women, and children, as well as some of their own fellow troopers. The 7th Cavalry quickly suppressed the Sioux fire, and the surviving Sioux fled, but US cavalrymen pursued and killed many who were unarmed. By the time it was over, about 146 men, women, and children of the Lakota Sioux had been killed. Twenty-five troopers also died, some believed to have been the victims of friendly fire as the shooting took place at point-blank range in chaotic conditions. Around 150 Lakota are believed to have fled the chaos, with an unknown number later dying from hypothermia. The incident is noteworthy as the engagement in military history in which the most Medals of Honor have been awarded in the military history of the United States. This was the last tribe to be invaded which broke the backbone of the American Indian Wars and the American Frontier.\nIn 1891 the Chilean Civil War was fought from January to September. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda, President of Chile, and the Chilean Army loyal to him face Jorge Montt's Junta. The latter was formed by an alliance between the National Congress of Chile and the Chilean Navy.\nIn 1892 the Johnson County War occurred in Wyoming. Actually this range war took place in April 1892 in Johnson County, Natrona County and Converse County. The combatants were the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA) and the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA). WSGA was an older organization, comprising some of the state's wealthiest and most popular residents. It held a great deal of political sway in the state and region. A primary function of the WSGA was to organize the cattle industry by scheduling roundups and cattle shipments. The NWFSGAA was a group of smaller Johnson County ranchers led by a local settler named Nate Champion. They had recently formed their organization in order to compete with the WSGA. The WSGA \"blacklisted\" the NWFSGA and told them to stop all operations, but the NWFSGA refused the powerful WSGA's orders to disband and instead made public their plans to hold their own roundup in the spring of 1892. The WSGA, under the direction of Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member and large North Platte rancher), hired a group of skilled gunmen with the intention of eliminating alleged rustlers in Johnson County and break up the NWFSGA. Twenty three gunmen from the Paris, Texas, region and four cattle detectives from the WSGA were hired, as well as Idaho frontiersman George Dunning who would later turn against the group. A cadre of WSGA and Wyoming dignitaries also joined the expedition, including State Senator Bob Tisdale, state water commissioner W. J. Clarke, as well as W. C. Irvine and Hubert Teshemacher, both instrumental in organizing Wyoming's statehood four years earlier. They were also accompanied by surgeon Charles Penrose, who served as the group's doctor, as well as Asa Mercer, the editor of the WSGA's newspaper, and a newspaper reporter for the \"Chicago Herald\", Sam T. Clover, whose lurid first-hand accounts later appeared in the eastern newspapers.\nIn 1893 the Leper War on Kaua\u02bbi took place on the island of Kauai. The Provisional Government of Hawaii under Sanford B. Dole passes a law which would forcibly relocate lepers to the Leprosy Colony of Kalawao on the Kalaupapa peninsula. When Kaluaikoolau, a leper, resisted arrest by a deputy sheriff and killed the man, Dole reacted by sending armed militia against the lepers of Kalalau Valley. Kaluaikoolau reportedly foiled or killed some of his pursuers. But the conflict ended with the evacuation of the area in July 1893. The main source for the event is a 1906 publication by Kahikina Kelekona (John Sheldon), preserving the story as told by Piilani, Kaluaikoolau's widow.\nDuring the span of 1893\u20131894 the Enid-Pond Creek Railroad War was fought in the Oklahoma Territory. It was effectively a county seat war. The Rock Island Railroad Company had invested in the townships of Enid and Pond Creek following an announcement by the United States Department of the Interior that the two would become county seats. The Department of the Interior decided to create an Enid and Pond Creek at another location, free of company influence. Resulting in two Enids and two Pond Creeks vying for becoming county seats, starting in September 1893. Rock Island refused to have its trains stop at \"Government Enid\". They would pass by without taking passengers. Frustrated Enid residents \"turned to acts of violence\". Some were regularly shooting at the trains. Others were damaging trestles and rail tracks, setting up train accidents. Only government intervention stopped the conflict in September 1894.\nDuring 1893\u20131897 the War of Canudos arose, a conflict between the state of Brazil and a group of some 30,000 settlers under Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro who had founded their own community in the northeastern state of Bahia, named Canudos. After a number of unsuccessful attempts at military suppression, it came to a brutal end in October 1897, when a large Brazilian army force overran the village and killed most of the inhabitants. The conflict started with Conselheiro and his jagun\u00e7os (landless peasants) of this \"remote and arid\" area protesting against the payment of taxes to the distant government of Rio de Janeiro. They founded their own self-sufficient village, soon joined by others in search of a \"Promised Land\". By 1895, they refused requests by Rodrigues Lima, Governor of Bahia and Jeronimo Thome da Silva, Archbishop of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia to start obeying the laws of the Brazilian state and the rules of the Catholic Church. In 1896, a military expedition under Lieutenant Manuel da Silva Pires Ferreira was sent to pacify them. It was instead attacked, defeated and forced to retreat. Increasingly stronger military forces were sent against Canudos, only to meet with fierce resistance and suffering heavy casualties. In October 1897, Canudos finally fell to the Brazilian military forces. \"Those jagun\u00e7os who were not killed in combat were taken prisoner and summarily executed (by beheading) by the army\".\nIn 1894 the Donghak Peasant Revolution in Joseon Korea came to pass. The uprising started in Gobu during February 1894, with the peasant class protesting against the political corruption of local government officials. The revolution was named after Donghak, a Korean religion stressing \"the equality of all human beings\". The forces of Emperor Gojong failed in their attempt to suppress the revolt, with initial skirmishes giving way to major conflicts. The Korean government requested assistance from the Empire of Japan. Japanese troops, armed with \"rifles and artillery\", managed to suppress the revolution. With Korea being a tributary state to Qing Dynasty China, the Japanese military presence was seen as a provocation. The resulting conflict over dominance of Korea would become the First Sino-Japanese War. In part, the government of Emperor Meiji was acting to prevent expansion by the Russian Empire or any other great power towards Korea. Viewing such an expansion as a direct threat to Japanese national security.\nDuring 1895, the Doukhobors, a pacifist Christian sect of the Russian Empire, attempt to resist a number of laws and regulations forced on them by the Russian government. They are mostly active in the South Caucasus, where universal military conscription was introduced in 1887 and was still controversial. They also refuse to swear an oath of allegiance to Nicholas II, the new Russian Emperor. Under further instructions from their exiled leader Peter Vasilevich Verigin, as a sign of absolute pacifism, the Doukhobors of the three Governorates of Transcaucasia made the decision to destroy their weapons. As the Doukhobors assembled to burn them on the night of June 28/29 (July 10/11, Gregorian calendar) 1895, with the singing of psalms and spiritual songs, arrests and beatings by government Cossacks followed. Soon, Cossacks were billeted in many of the Large Party Doukhobors' villages, and over 4,000 of their original residents were dispersed through villages in other parts of Georgia. Many of those died of starvation and exposure.\n1896\u20131898 was when Philippine Revolution occurred. The Philippines, part of the Spanish East Indies, attempt to secede from the Spanish Empire. The Philippine Revolution began in August 1896, upon the discovery of the anti-colonial secret organization \"Katipunan\" by the Spanish authorities. The \"Katipunan\", led by Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio, was a secessionist movement and shadow government spread throughout much of the islands whose goal was independence from Spain through armed revolt. In a mass gathering in Caloocan, the \"Katipunan\" leaders organized themselves into a revolutionary government and openly declared a nationwide armed revolution. Bonifacio called for a simultaneous coordinated attack on the capital Manila. This attack failed, but the surrounding provinces also rose up in revolt. In particular, rebels in Cavite led by Emilio Aguinaldo won early victories. A power struggle among the revolutionaries led to Bonifacio's execution in 1897, with command shifting to Aguinaldo who led his own revolutionary government. That year, a truce was officially reached with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and Aguinaldo was exiled to Hong Kong, though hostilities between rebels and the Spanish government never actually ceased. In 1898, with the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War, Aguinaldo unofficially allied with the United States, returned to the Philippines and resumed hostilities against the Spaniards. By June, the rebels had conquered nearly all Spanish-held ground within the Philippines with the exception of Manila. Aguinaldo thus declared independence from Spain and the First Philippine Republic was established. However, neither Spain nor the United States recognized Philippine independence. Spanish rule in the islands only officially ended with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, wherein Spain ceded the Philippines and other territories to the United States. The Philippine\u2013American War broke out shortly afterward.\nIn 1897 the Lattimer massacre happened. The violent deaths of 19 unarmed striking immigrant anthracite coal miners at the Lattimer mine near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 1897. The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, and Lithuanian ethnicity, were shot and killed by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse. Scores more workers were wounded. The Lattimer massacre was a turning point in the history of the United Mine Workers (UMW).\nIn 1898 the Bava Beccaris massacre in Milan, Kingdom of Italy came about, killing and injuring hundreds. On May 5, 1898, workers organized a strike to demonstrate against the government of Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin\u00ec, Prime Minister of Italy, holding it responsible for the general increase of prices and for the famine that was affecting the country. The first blood was shed that day at Pavia, when the son of the mayor of Milan was killed while attempting to halt the troops marching against the crowd. After a protest in Milan the following day, the government declared a state of siege in the city. Infantry, cavalry and artillery were brought into the city and General Fiorenzo Bava Beccaris ordered his troops to fire on demonstrators. According to the government, there were 118 dead and 450 wounded. The opposition claimed 400 dead and more than 2,000 injured people. Filippo Turati, one of the founders of the Italian Socialist Party, was arrested and accused of inspiring the riots.\nDuring 1898 the Voulet\u2013Chanoine Mission became a disastrous French military expedition sent out from Senegal to conquer the Chad Basin and unify all French territories in West Africa. The expedition descended into wanton violence against the local population and ended in sedition on the part of the commanders.\nIn 1898, the Battle of Sugar Point takes place in the northeast shore of Leech Lake, Minnesota. \"Old Bug\" (Bugonaygeshig), a leading member of the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians in Bear Island had been arrested in September 1898. A reported number of 22 Pillagers helped him escape. Arrest warrants were issued for all Pillagers involved in the incident. On October 5, 1898, about 80 men serving or attached to the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment arrived on Bear Island to perform the arrests. Finding it abandoned, they proceeded to Sugar Point. There, a force of 19 Pillagers armed with Winchester rifle was observing the soldiers from a forested area. When a soldier fired his weapon, allegedly a new recruit who had done so accidentally, the Pillagers returned fire. Major Melville Wilkinson, the commanding officer, was shot three times and killed. By the end of the conflict, seven soldiers had been killed (including Wilkinson), another 16 wounded. There were no casualties among the 19 Natives. Peaceful relations were soon re-established but this uprising was among the last Native American victories in the American Indian Wars. It is known as \"the last Indian Uprising in the United States\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Middle East, the House of Wisdom was founded in Abbasid Baghdad, attracting many scholars to the city. The field of algebra was founded by the Muslim polymath al-Khwarizmi. The most famous Islamic scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal was tortured and imprisoned by Abbasid official Ahmad ibn Abi Du'ad during the reign of Abbasid caliph al-Mu'tasim and caliph al-Wathiq.

In America, the Maya experienced widespread political collapse in the central Maya region, resulting in internecine warfare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population.\nWest Africa.\nSoutheastern Nigeria.\nAround the 9th century, the Igbo people of what is now southern Nigeria developed bronze casts of humans, animals, and legendary creatures. These bronzes, which were used as vessels, amulets, pendants, and sacrificial tools, are among the earliest made bronzes ever found in Nigeria. Most items were part of a burial of a nobleman culture in the northern part of the Igboland.\nGhana Empire.\nThe Ghana (Wagadu) Empire (before c.\u2009830 until c.\u20091235) was located in what is now southeastern Mauritania and western Mali. It is considered the first of the Sahelian Kingdoms, which would exist in some form until the early 20th century.\nWestern Europe.\nBritain and Ireland.\nBritain experienced a great influx of Viking peoples in the 9th century as the Viking Age continued from the previous century. The kingdoms of the Heptarchy were gradually conquered by the Danes, who set up Anglo-Saxon puppet rulers in each kingdom. This invasion was achieved by a huge military force known as the Great Heathen Army, which was supposedly led by Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan Ragnarsson, and Guthrum. This Danish army first arrived in Britain in 865 in East Anglia. After conquering that kingdom, the army proceeded to capture the city of York (Jorvik) and establish the kingdom of Jorvik. The Danes went on to subjugate the kingdom of Northumbria and to take all but the western portion of Mercia. The remaining kingdom of Wessex was the only kingdom of the Heptarchy left. Alfred the Great managed to maintain his kingdom of Wessex and push back the Viking incursions, relieving the neighbouring kingdoms from the threat of the Danes following his famous victory over them at the Battle of Ethandun in 878. Alfred re-established Anglo-Saxon rule over the western half of Mercia, and the Danelaw was established which separated Mercia into halves, the eastern half remaining under the control of the Danes.\nIreland was also affected by the Viking expansion across the North Sea. Extensive raids were carried out all along the coast and eventually, permanent settlements were established, such as that of Dublin in 841. Particular targets for these raids were the monasteries on the western coast of Ireland, as they provided a rich source for loot. On such raids the Vikings set up impermanent camps, which were called longphorts by the Irish\u2014this period of Viking raids on the coasts of Ireland has been named the longphort phase after these types of settlements. Ireland in the 9th century was organised into an amalgam of small kingdoms, called tuatha. These kingdoms were sometimes grouped together and ruled by a single, provincial ruler. If such a ruler could establish and maintain authority over a portion of these tuatha, he was sometimes granted the title of High King.\nScotland also experienced significant Viking incursions during the 9th century. The Vikings established themselves in coastal regions, usually in northern Scotland, and in the northern islands such as Orkney and Shetland. The Viking invasion and settlement in Scotland provided a contributing factor in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Picts, who inhabited most of Scotland at the time. Not only were the Pictish realms either destroyed or severely weakened, the Viking invasion and settlements may have been the reason for the movement of Kenneth MacAlpin, the king of D\u00e1l Riata at that time. The kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata was located on the western coast of Scotland, and Viking incursions destroyed it after the death of its previous king, \u00c1ed mac Boanta in 839, according to the Annals of Ulster. This may have caused the new king, MacAlpin, to move to the east, and conquer the remnants of the Pictish realms. MacAlpin became king of the Picts in 843 and later kings would be titled as the King of Alba or King of Scots.\nArt.\nArt in the 9th century was primarily dedicated to the Gospel and employed as basic tools of liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church. Thousands of golden art objects were made: Sacred cups, vessels, reliquaries, crucifixes, rosaries, altarpieces, and statues of the Virgin and Child or Saints all kept the flame of western art from dying out. Architecture began to revive to some extent in the West by the 9th century, taking the form of Church facilities of all kinds, and the first castle fortifications since Roman times began to take form in simple \"moat and bailey\" castles, or simple \"strong point\" tower structures, with little refinement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From the upheaval the Franks rose to prominence and carved out a sizeable domain covering much of modern France and Germany. Meanwhile, the surviving Eastern Roman Empire began to expand under Emperor Justinian, who recaptured North Africa from the Vandals and attempted fully to recover Italy as well, in the hope of reinstating Roman control over the lands once ruled by the Western Roman Empire.\nOwing in part to the collapse of the Roman Empire along with its literature and civilization, the sixth century is generally considered to be the least known about in the Dark Ages.\nIn its second golden age, the Sassanid Empire reached the peak of its power under Khosrau I in the 6th century.

The 5th century is noted for being a period of migration and political instability throughout Eurasia. \nIt saw the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which came to a formal end in 476 AD. This empire had been ruled by a succession of weak emperors, with the real political might being increasingly concentrated among military leaders. Internal instability allowed a Visigoth army to reach and ransack Rome in 410. Some recovery took place during the following decades, but the Western Empire received another serious blow when a second foreign group, the Vandals, occupied Carthage, capital of an extremely important province in Africa. Attempts to retake the province were interrupted by the invasion of the Huns under Attila. After Attila's defeat, both Eastern and Western empires joined forces for a final assault on Vandal North Africa, but this campaign was a spectacular failure.\nIn China, the period of the Sixteen Kingdoms continued. This was characterized by the formation and collapse of small sub-kingdoms, ruled by warring ethnic groups. After the fall of the Former Qin towards the end of the previous century, the north of China was once again reunited by Northern Wei in 439. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Jin dynasty, the Jin statesman and general Liu Yu consolidated his power and forced the last Emperor of the Jin dynasty, Emperor Gong of Jin, to abdicate to him in 420. This created the (Liu) Song dynasty, which was also the starting point of the period known as the Northern and Southern dynasties.\nTowards the end of the 5th century, the Gupta Empire of India was invaded from Central Asia and occupied by elements of the Huna peoples.

This crisis would also mark the beginning of Late Antiquity. While in North Africa, Roman rule continued with growing Christian influence, particularly in the region of Carthage.\nIn Persia, the Parthian Empire was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire in 224 after Ardashir I defeated and killed Artabanus V during the Battle of Hormozdgan. The Sassanids then went on to subjugate many of the western portions of the declining Kushan Empire. In Africa the most significant event was the rise of the Aksumite Empire in what is now Ethiopia, which experienced significant military expansion and became a major trading hub in northeast Africa.\nIn China, the chaos that had been raging since 189 would ultimately continue to persist with the decisive defeat of Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208, which would increasingly end the hopes of unification and lead to the tripartite division of China into three main empires; Shu, Wu, and Wei, colloquially known as the Three Kingdoms period, which started in 220 with the formal abdication of Emperor Xian of Han to Cao Cao's son, Cao Pi, thereby founding Wei, which would go on to conquer Shu in 263, but would ultimately be united again under the Jin dynasty, headed by the Sima clan, who would usurp Wei in 266, and conquer Wu in 280.\nIn other parts of the world, Korea was ruled by the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Japan entered the Kofun period and the Southeast Asian mainland was mostly dominated by Funan, the first kingdom of the Khmer people. In India, the Gupta Empire was on the rise towards the end of the century. In Pre-Columbian America, the Adena culture of the Ohio River valley declined in favor of the Hopewell culture. The Maya civilization entered its Classic Era.\nRoman Empire.\nAfter the death of Commodus in the late previous century the Roman Empire was plunged into a civil war. When the dust settled, Septimius Severus emerged as emperor, establishing the Severan dynasty. Unlike previous emperors, he openly used the army to back his authority, and paid them well to do so. The regime he created is known as the Military Monarchy as a result. The system fell apart in the 230s, giving way to a fifty-year period known as the Military Anarchy or the Crisis of the Third Century, following the assassination of the 28-year-old emperor Severus Alexander (the last emperor of the Severan dynasty), where no fewer than twenty emperors held the reins of power, most for only a few months. The majority of these men were assassinated, or killed in battle, and the empire almost collapsed under the weight of the political upheaval, as well as the growing Persian threat in the east. Under its new Sassanid rulers, Persia had grown into a rival superpower, and the Romans would have to make drastic reforms in order to better prepare their state for a confrontation. These reforms were finally realized late in the century under the reign of Diocletian, one of them being to divide the empire into an eastern and western half, and have a separate ruler for each.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period.\nEarly in the century, the Roman Empire attained its greatest expansion under the emperor Trajan, but after his death became primarily defensive for the rest of its history. Much prosperity took place throughout the empire at this time, ruled as it was by the \"Five Good Emperors\", a succession of well-received and able rulers. This period also saw the removal of the Jews from Jerusalem during the reign of Hadrian after Bar Kokhba's revolt.\nThe last quarter of the century saw the end of the period of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana at the death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, last of the \"Five Good Emperors\", and the ascension of Commodus. After Commodus was murdered in 192, a turbulent period known as the Year of the Five Emperors ensued. After the quick successive removals of Pertinax and Didius Julianus from power, this period had the general-turned-emperor Septimius Severus, who was the founder of the Severan dynasty, pitted against rival claimants in the form of Pescennius Niger. Severus' forces defeated the rival claimants at the Battle of Issus in 194, and Clodius Albinus, whom he defeated at the Battle of Lugdunum in 197, granting Severus sole authority over the empire.\nAlthough the Han dynasty of China was firmly cemented into power and extended its imperial influence into Central Asia during the first half of the century, by the second half there was widespread corruption and open rebellion. This led to its decline, and in September 189, the Han general Dong Zhuo, after being summoned to the capital by He Jin to help quell the corrupt and powerful eunuch faction by serving as an intimidator to both them and the Empress Dowager, marched his army into Luoyang in light of He Jin's assassination and the subsequent slaughter of the eunuchs, taking over the capital and effectively becoming the \"de facto\" head of the government.\nWarlords and government officials quickly took against him in a campaign that, while failing to put him down, compelled Dong Zhuo to shift the seat of imperial power further west to Chang'an. As Dong Zhuo was killed in 192, the chaos in the wake of the collapse of centralized authority only continued, with various warlords attempting to vie for supremacy in order to establish or hold onto their authority within the decaying empire. Meanwhile, Dong Zhuo's former followers Li Jue and Guo Si were left to squabble amongst themselves, while Emperor Xian himself fled and returned to the ravaged city of Luoyang. In 196, he was given refuge by the warlord Cao Cao, who relocated him to the new capital city of Xu, from where he could control the emperor. Cao Cao would further exert his authority by defeating the powerful warlord Yuan Shao at the decisive Battle of Guandu in 200.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The decade was a part of the Gilded Age (1874\u20131907) in the United States, the Victorian Era in the British Empire and the Belle \u00c9poque in France. It also occurred at the height of the Second Industrial Revolution and saw numerous developments in science and a sudden proliferation of electrical technologies, particularly in mass transit and telecommunications.\nThe last living person from this decade, Mar\u00eda Capovilla, died in 2006.\nDecade\nAssassinations and attempts.\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\nPopular culture.\nSports.\nIn 1882 Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d creates Judo\nMusic.\nThe Romantic style, most prominent in Europe, emphasised strong melodies, beautiful harmony, and the unique vision of the artist. Loud, extreme contrasts in dynamics and accentuated rhythmic patterns were featured in the music of the time. The influence of Ludwig van Beethoven was strong, especially in the German-language area. Many of the artists involved in the Romantic music movement were disappointed with the effects of the Industrial Revolution and urbanisation, and drew influence from nature, the countryside, commoners, and old myths and legends. Nevertheless, music was seen as separate from politics, an ethereal sphere dominated by sublime expressions of the artists' deepest, primal sentiments. It was seen as something almost divine, with a unique ability to portray passionate emotions like love directly to the listener. Romantic orchestral pieces tended to be quite long and required more players than before, with symphonies regularly taking a whole hour to perform completely.\nWithin the Russian Empire, the influence of the Five, or \"the Mighty Handful\" and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky had been crucial in developing a new national understanding of music.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Britain saw a surge of power and world dominance, as Queen Victoria took to the throne in 1837. Conquests took place all over the world, particularly around the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the British Raj. New outposts and settlements flourished in Oceania, as Europeans began to settle over Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.\nPolitics.\nEast Asia.\nChina.\nChina was ruled by the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing dynasty during the 1830s. The decade witnessed a rapid rise in the sale of opium in China, despite efforts by the Daoguang Emperor to end the trade. A turning point came in 1834, with the end of the monopoly of the East India Company, leaving trade in the hands of private entrepreneurs. By 1838, opium sales climbed to 40,000 chests. In 1839, newly appointed imperial commissioner Lin Zexu banned the sale of opium and imposed several restrictions on all foreign traders. Lin also closed the channel to Guangzhou (Canton), leading to the seizure and destruction of 20,000 chests of opium. The British retaliated, seizing Hong Kong on August 23 of that year, starting what would be known as the First Opium War. It would end three years later with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.\nSouth-eastern Asia.\nDutch East Indies.\nThe Padri War was fought from 1803 until 1837 in West Sumatra between the \"Padris\" and the \"Adats\". The latter asked for the help of the Dutch, who intervened from 1821 and helped the Adats defeat the Padri faction. The conflict intensified in the 1830s, as the war soon centered on Bonjol, the fortified last stronghold of the Padris. It finally fell in 1837 after being besieged for three years, and along with the exile of Padri leader Tuanku Imam Bonjol, the conflict died out.\nSouthern Asia.\nIndia.\nThe British government appointed a series of administrative heads of British India in the 1830s (\"Governor-General of India\" starting in 1833): Lord William Bentinck (1828\u20131835), Sir Charles Metcalfe, Bt (1835\u20131836), and The Lord Auckland (1836\u20131842). The Government of India Act 1833 was enacted to remove the East India Company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions, renewing the company's political and administrative authority for another twenty years. It invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.\nThe English Education Act by the Council of India in 1835 reallocated funds from the East India Company to spend on education and literature in India. In 1837, the British East India company replaced Persian with local vernacular in various provinces as the official and court language. However, in the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, Urdu instead of Hindi was chosen to replace Persian.\nIn 1835, William Henry Sleeman captured \"Feringhea\" in his efforts to suppress the Thuggee secret society. Sleeman's work led to his appointment as General Superintendent of the operations for the Suppression of Thuggee. In February 1839, he assumed charge of the office of \"Commissioner for the Suppression of Thuggee and Dacoity\". During these operations, more than 1400 Thugs were hanged or transported for life.\nNorthern Europe.\nUnited Kingdom.\nRoyalty.\nIn 1830, William IV succeeded his brother George IV as King of the United Kingdom. Upon his death in 1837, his 18-year-old niece, Princess Victoria. Under Salic law, the Kingdom of Hanover passed to William's brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, ending the personal union of Britain and Hanover which had existed since 1714. Queen Victoria took up residence in Buckingham Palace, the first reigning British monarch to make this, rather than St James's Palace, her London home.\nPolitics and law.\nBritain had four prime ministers during the 1830s. As the decade began, Tory Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington led parliament. Wellington's government fell in late 1830, failing to react to calls for reform. The Whigs selected Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey to succeed him, who led passage of many reforms, including the Reform Act 1832, the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire), and the Factory Acts (limiting child labour).\nIn 1834 Grey retired from public life, leaving Lord Melbourne as his successor. Reforms continued under Lord Melbourne, with the Poor Law Amendment Act in 1834, which stated that no able-bodied British man could receive assistance unless he entered a workhouse. King William IV's opposition to the Whigs' reforming ways led him to dismiss Melbourne in November and then appoint Sir Robert Peel to form a Tory government. Peel's failure to win a House of Commons majority in the resulting general election (January 1835) made it impossible for him to govern, and the Whigs returned to power under Melbourne in April 1835. The Marriage Act 1836 established civil marriage and registration systems that permit marriages in nonconformist chapels, and a Registrar General of Births, Marriages, and Deaths.\nThere were protests and significant unrest during the decade. In May and June 1831 in Wales, coal miners and others rioted for improved working conditions in what was known as the Merthyr Rising. William Howley Archbishop of Canterbury has his coach attacked by an angry mob on his first official visit to Canterbury in 1832. In 1834, Robert Owen organized the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union, an early attempt to form a national union confederation. In May 1838, the People's Charter was drawn up in the United Kingdom, demanding universal suffrage. Chartism continued to gain popularity, leading to the Newport Rising in 1839, the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain.\nIn 1835, James Pratt and John Smith were hanged outside Newgate Prison in London after a conviction of sodomy, the last deadly victims of the judicial persecution of homosexual men in England.\nWestern Europe.\nFrance.\nFrench Revolution of 1830.\nThe French Revolution of 1830 was also known as the July Revolution, Second French Revolution or in French. It saw the overthrow of King Charles X, the French Bourbon monarch, and the ascent of his brother Louis, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (who would in turn be overthrown in 1848). The revolution ended the Bourbon Restoration, shifting power to the July Monarchy (rule by the House of Orl\u00e9ans). Duc de Broglie briefly served as State Minister, with many successors over the course of 2 years.\nCanut revolts.\nThe first two Canut revolts occurred in the 1830s. They were among the first well-defined worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The word Canut was a common term to describe to all Lyonnais silk workers.\nThe First Canut revolt in 1831 was provoked by a drop in workers' wages caused by a drop in silk prices. After a bloody battle with the military causing 600 casualties, rebellious silk workers seize Lyon, France. The government sent Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, at the head of an army of 20,000 to restore order. Soult was able to retake the town without any bloodshed, and without making any compromises with the workers. The Second Canut revolt in 1834 occurred when owners attempted to impose a wage decrease. The government crushed the rebellion in a bloody battle, and deported or imprisoned 10,000 insurgents.\nAfrica.\nFrench conquest of Algeria.\nIn 1830, France invaded and quickly seized Ottoman Regency of Algiers, and rapidly took control of other coastal communities. Fighting would continue throughout the decade, with the French pitted against forces under Ahmed Bey at Constantine, primarily in the east, and nationalist forces in Kabylia and the west. The French made treaties with the nationalists under 'Abd al-Q\u0101dir, enabling them to capture Constantine in 1837. Al-Q\u0101dir continued to give stiff resistance in the west, which lasted throughout the decade (and well into the 1840s, with Al-Q\u0101dir surrendering in 1847).\nNorth America.\nMexico.\nThe 1830s for Mexico saw the end of the First Mexican Republic and saw General Santa Anna move in and out of the presidency in a 30-year span now known as the \"Age of Santa Anna\". In 1834, President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna dissolved Congress, forming a new government. That government instituted the Centralist Republic of Mexico by approving a new centralist constitution (\"Siete Leyes\"). From its formation in 1835 until its dissolution in 1846, the Centralist Republic was governed by eleven presidents (none of which finished their term). It called for the state militias to disarm, but many states resisted, including Mexican Texas, which declared independence in the Texas Revolution of 1836. During the 1840s, other provinces separated. The Republic of the Rio Grande in 1840, and the Republic of Yucat\u00e1n declared independence in 1841.\nScience and technology.\nElectricity.\nMany key discoveries about electricity were made in the 1830s. Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in 1831; however, Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments. Electromagnetic induction is the production of a potential difference (voltage) across a conductor when it is exposed to a varying magnetic field. This discovery was essential to the invention of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.\nIn 1834, Michael Faraday's published his research regarding the quantitative relationships in electrochemical reactions, now known as Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Also in 1834, Jean C. A. Peltier discovered the Peltier \"effect\", which is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors. In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity.\nDisasters, natural events, and notable mishaps.\nCholera.\nHistorians believe that the first cholera pandemic had lingered in Indonesia and the Philippines in 1830. The second cholera pandemic spread from India to Russia and then to the rest of Europe claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. It reached Moscow in August 1830, and by 1831, the epidemic had infiltrated Russia's main cities and towns.\nRussian soldiers brought the disease to Poland during the November Uprising. \"Cholera riots\" occurred in Russia, caused by the anti-cholera measures undertaken by the tsarist government.\nThe epidemic reached western Europe later in 1831. In London, the disease claimed 6,536 victims; in Paris, 20,000 died (out of a population of 650,000), with about 100,000 deaths in all of France. In 1832 the epidemic reached Quebec, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, Canada; and Detroit and New York City in the United States. It reached the Pacific coast of North America between 1832 and 1834.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Photography, rail transport, and the textile industry were among those that largely developed and grew prominent over the decade, as technology advanced significantly. European colonialism began gaining ground in Africa and Asia, and trade with the Qing Dynasty began to open up more towards foreign traders, particularly those from Europe. As European imperialism gained momentum, opposition from affected/exploited societies resulted, with wars such as the Java War and the Greek War of Independence. Resistance in the form of separatism and nationalism (particularly in the Spanish American wars of independence) led to the independence of many countries around the world, such as Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia.\nPolitics and wars.\nThe Greek War of Independence and the Russo-Turkish War were two of the decade's more important conflicts. Meanwhile, colonialism in Africa had just begun to accelerate, and global trade between Asian powers (e.g. the Qing Dynasty) with European powers (mainly the British and French empires) increased substantially. In South America, states such as Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil gained independence from the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire.\nEast Asia.\nIndonesia.\nJava War.\nThe Java War (also known as the \"Diponegoro War\") was fought in Java between 1825 and 1830. It started as a rebellion led by Prince Diponegoro after the Dutch decided to build a road across a piece of his property that contained his parents' tomb.\nThe troops of Prince Diponegoro were very successful in the beginning, controlling the middle of Java and besieging Yogyakarta. Furthermore, the Javanese population was supportive of Prince Diponegoro's cause, whereas the Dutch colonial authorities were initially very indecisive. As the Java war prolonged, Prince Diponegoro had difficulties in maintaining the numbers of his troops. Prince Diponegoro started a fierce guerrilla war and it was not until 1827 that the Dutch army gained the upper hand. The Dutch colonial army was able to fill its ranks with troops from Sulawesi, and later on from the Netherlands.\nThe rebellion finally ended in 1830, after Prince Diponegoro was tricked into entering Dutch custody near Magelang, believing he was there for negotiations for a possible cease-fire. It is estimated that 200,000 died over the course of the conflict, 8,000 being Dutch.\nEurope.\nSouthern Europe.\nGreek War of Independence.\nAt the start of the decade, most of Greece was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, as it had been since 1453, despite frequent revolts. In early 1821, a secret organization called the Filiki Eteria instigated several battles that, together with the blessing of a Greek flag and proclamation of uprising by Bishop Germanos of Patras on March 25, marked the beginning of the revolution. The uprising successfully established a foothold in the Peloponnese, seizing Tripolitsa in September 1821, and had some success in Crete, Macedonia and Central Greece.\nBetween 1821 and 1824, first and second national assemblies were held, and the constitutions of 1822 and of 1823 were established. However, revolutionary activity was fragmented, resulting in the civil wars of 1824\u20131825. The Greek side withstood the Turkish attacks because, during this period, the Ottoman military campaigns were periodic and uncoordinated.\nThat changed when the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II negotiated with Mehmet Ali of Egypt, who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and secured most of the peninsula by the end of 1825. He then helped break the siege of Missolonghi. Although Ibrahim was defeated in Mani, he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken.\nFollowing years of negotiation, three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom and France had come to agree to the formation of an autonomous Greek state under Ottoman suzerainty, as stipulated in the Treaty of London. Ottoman refusal to accept these terms led to the Battle of Navarino, which effectively secured complete Greek independence. That year, the Third National Assembly at Troezen established the First Hellenic Republic. With the help of a French expeditionary force, the Greeks drove the Turks out of the Peloponnese and proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, Greece was finally recognized as an independent nation in May 1832.\nWestern Europe.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the 1820s, the British government was formally headed by King George IV, but in practice, was led by his prime ministers Lord Liverpool (1812\u20131827), George Canning (1827), Lord Goderich (1827\u20131828), and Duke of Wellington (1828\u20131830). This decade was largely peaceful for Britain, with some foreign intervention. The British supported the Portuguese liberals in the Liberal Wars, and supported Greek rebels in the war for independence. During this time, London became the largest city of the world, taking the lead from Beijing.\nDomestic tensions ran high at the start of the decade, with the Peterloo Massacre (1819), the Cato Street Conspiracy (1820), and the Radical War (1820) in Scotland. However, by the end of the 1820s, many repressive laws were repealed. In 1822, Britain repealed the death penalty for over 100 crimes, and punishments such as drawing and quartering and flagellation fell out of use. Seditious Meetings prevention Act (barring large assemblies) and the Combination Act (banning trade unions) were repealed in 1824. The Roman Catholic Relief Act by Parliament of the United Kingdom granted a substantial measure of Catholic emancipation in Britain and Ireland.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nAt the beginning of the 1820s, the United States stretched from the Atlantic Ocean through to (roughly) the western edge of the Mississippi basin, though Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and all present-day states fully west of the Mississippi had yet to be granted statehood. Two states were admitted to the union during this decade: Maine in 1820 and Missouri in 1821. The Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, signed in 1819 and ratified by Spain in 1821, ceded Florida (already conquered by USA in 1818) to the United States, and established a boundary between New Spain and the United States.\nSlavery was widespread throughout the southern United States. According to the 1820 U.S. Census, the slave population at that time was 1,538,000. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 prohibited slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north except within the boundaries of the proposed state of Missouri. By the 1830 U.S. Census, the slave population had risen to 2,009,043. With the coordination of the American Colonization Society, many freed African-Americans repatriated to Africa during this decade to the newly formed colony of Liberia.\nThe political mood at the start of the 1820s was referred to as the Era of Good Feelings, following the collapse of the Federalist party. James Monroe, the sitting U.S. president since 1817, was re-elected in 1820, virtually unopposed. In 1823, Monroe introduced the Monroe Doctrine in the State of the Union Address, declaring that any European attempts to recolonize the Americas would be considered a hostile act towards the United States.\nThe feeling of unity during the Monroe administration was dispelled in the presidential election of 1824, which due to an Electoral College stalemate, was decided in the United States House of Representatives. John Quincy Adams was chosen as the sixth U.S. president, despite receiving only 30.9% of the popular vote to Andrew Jackson's 41.3%. This gave rise to Jacksonian Nationalism and the rise of the modern Democratic Party, with Andrew Jackson elected in the 1828 election.\nMexico.\nAfter ten years of civil war in Mexico (then called the \"Viceroyalty of New Spain\") and the death of two of its founders, by early 1820 the Mexican independence movement was stalemated and close to collapse. However, the Army of the Three Guarantees was formed under the command of Colonel Agust\u00edn de Iturbide with the support of patriots and loyalists to secure independence for Mexico and the protection of Roman Catholicism. Iturbide's army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico, and quickly gained control of Mexico. On August 24, 1821, representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, which recognized the Mexican Empire under the terms of the Plan of Iguala.\nOn September 27 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City, and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire. The newly formed Mexican congress eventually declared Iturbide emperor of Mexico on May 19, 1822. Later that year, Iturbide dissolved Congress and replaced it with a sympathetic junta. However, on March 19, 1823 Iturbide abdicated.\nThe First Federal Republic was established on October 4, 1824. In the new constitution, the republic took the name of United Mexican States, and was defined as a representative federal republic, with Catholicism as the official and unique religion.\nGuadalupe Victoria was the first President of Mexico from 1824 until 1829.\nAfter Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza won the election to succeed Victoria, Vicente Guerrero staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and took the presidency on April 1, 1829. Guerrero was deposed in a rebellion under Vice-president Anastasio Bustamante in December 1829.\nCulture.\nFashion.\nDuring the 1820s in European and European-influenced countries, fashionable women's clothing styles transitioned away from the classically influenced \"Empire\"/\"Regency\" styles of ca. 1795\u20131820 (with their relatively unconfining empire silhouette) and re-adopted elements that had been characteristic of most of the 18th century (and were to be characteristic of the remainder of the 19th century), such as full skirts and clearly visible corseting of the natural waist.\nThe silhouette of men's fashion changed in similar ways: by the mid-1820s coats featured broad shoulders with puffed sleeves, a narrow waist, and full skirts. Trousers were worn for smart day wear, while breeches continued in use at court and in the country.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
